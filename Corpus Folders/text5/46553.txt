That 's all they do . And it 's small but huge . Within their small community it 's risky , as we see in the film. - <p> For every small step we take in our communities , private lives , or on the big political stage " it 's really important we take a stand. - <p> The other thing that was important to show is that gender equality is also good for men .

And they declined the right to vote . In 1959 , 60% of the men said no we 're not not giving women the right to vote . ' That was such a slap in the face .

It was a short note by this person and I thought that 's an interesting starting point to develop Nora because I wanted to create a main character who we can all relate to today .

The annual observance , established by the UN in 1999 , is a day to promote multilingualism and celebrate the world 's linguistic and cultural diversity , especially minority and indigenous languages . It came out of a need to recognize and protect the 576 critically endangered languages around the world . <p> So in honor of International Mother Language Day , here are 7 good reasons why you should learn a new language . <h> 1 ) - Increase your brain power . <p> It 's not surprising that Sherlock Holmes was multi-lingual . Learning a language is a great way to keep your brain healthy and sharp . <p> Research shows that people who are multilingual may be better at processing language and other analytical tasks . Switching between languages causes the part of your brain responsible for problem-solving and filtering information to work more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases like dementia and Alzheimer 's . For more information on the bilingual brain , watch this quick Ted Talk . <h> 2 ) - - Language is the gateway into another culture . <p> Language is the best introduction to a new culture . It automatically makes you interested in the cultural traditions that are tied to learning a language . Of course , you can still learn about other cultures , but language learning really allows for a more immersive experience . Most of the time , efforts at translation ca n't fully capture the nuances conveyed in different languages . Even movie titles can get lost in translation . But multi-linguals can read new literature without translation , sing along to songs and actually understand the lyrics and watch foreign films without the need for pesky subtitles . With a new language , a whole new world will be open to you . <h> 3 ) - Be a better communicator in any language . <p> Learning a language forces you to improve your listening skills and while making you look at your own language in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how their native language works , but language learners are forced to be more conscious of grammatical rules and constructions of that language , which can give new insight into how they use their mother tongues . Knowing a second language also allows you to connect with more people and if you learn in a group setting , you 're automatically part of a larger community of language learners . For myself , speaking other languages keeps me connected to family and friends who live in other parts of the world that do n't speak English . <h> 4 ) - Make travel easier and more enjoyable . <p> If you are or aspire to be a globetrotter , learning languages is a must ! Traveling is way more fun and easier when there is n't a language barrier . You do n't have to worry about getting around because you do n't speak the language . You can converse with locals without relying on charades or translation books and , most importantly , know what food to order without pointing at pictures . <p> And when languages share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one language to another and travel to different regions of the world . Knowing Spanish for instance , is helpful in learning and understanding other Romance languages like Italian , French and Portuguese . <h> 5 ) - Preserve lesser known languages . <p> Language is one of the most important instruments of preserving heritage . According to the UN , half of the more than 6000 languages spoken in the world will disappear by the end of the century . And we may lose more than just words if we let them die out . Writing systems only exist for about one-third of the world 's languages , so language itself is the only way to convey a culture 's oral traditions . Language also conveys unique cultural expressions . Ever wanted a word that expresses that delightfully- warm feeling of seeing an adorable little kitten ? <p> The Cherokee- language has a unique word called " oo-kah-huh-sdee " that does just that. - <p> While not every language may survive amidst globalization , choosing to study a lesser known language can help promote the preservation of minority languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a language disappears , so does its culture and the body of knowledge it has accumulated . <h> 6 ) - Become more open-minded and bridge cultural gaps . <p> A huge reason for cultural stereotypes , and prejudice is a lack of understanding between people of different cultures . The way languages are formed and local language like slang can give great insight into the people who speak it . While learning a different language can make you more aware of cultural differences , you also come to understand why those differences exist and the importance of respecting cultures different from your own . Language learning can inspire solidarity , tolerance , and understanding especially in a time when refugees are denied help because of xenophobia and cultural prejudices . <h> 7 ) - Become a better global citizen . <p> If you have n't realized already , all the benefits that come with learning another language will make you an awesome global citizen . It 's pretty much a superpower . <p> Many would argue that multilingualism is essential in an increasingly interconnected world . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people can go a long way in better understanding and tackling global challenges like poverty and inequality. - <p> Did n't learn a second language as a kid ? It 's never too late to start learning ! Even if it 's just 5 minutes of learning a day , with continual practice you can create a solid foundation for starting language study .

Some are obvious " like not having a school to go to " while others are more subtle , like the teacher at the school not having had the training needed to effectively help children to learn . Here we list 10 major barriers to education , and look at how the Global Partnership for Education is working to overcome them . <p> 1 . A lack of funding for education <p> Image : The Global Partnership for Education <p> While the Global Partnership for Education is helping many developing countries to increase their own domestic financing for education , global donor support for education is decreasing at an alarming rate. - Total aid delivered for basic education has dropped for three years in a row , resulting in a 16% reduction between 2009 and 2012 . Aid to basic education is now at the same level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global funding crisis that is having serious consequences on countries ' ability to get children into school and learning . The 59 developing countries that are GPE partners face a funding shortage of $34 billion over the next four years for primary and secondary education . Money is n't everything , but it is a key foundation for a successful education system . <p> The Global Partnership is aiming to raise $3.5 billion in new investment from donor countries into the GPE fund , as well as increases in other aid to education , and is also asking developing country partners to pledge increases in their own domestic financing . If these pledges are made , GPE estimate that they can leverage a further $16 billion in spending by developing countries on education , aiming to close the global education funding gap . <p> What 's the number one thing any child needs to be able to learn ? A teacher of course . We 're facing multiple challenges when it comes to teachers . Not only are there not enough teachers globally to achieve universal primary education ( let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently working are also untrained , leading to children failing to learn the basics , such as maths and language skills . Globally , the UN estimates that 1.6 million additional new teachers are required to achieve universal primary education by 2015 , and 5.1 million more are needed to achieve universal lower secondary education by 2030 . Meanwhile , in one out of three countries , less than three-quarters of teachers are trained to national standards . <p> Since 2011 the Global Partnership for Education has helped to train over 300,000 teachers worldwide . With a successful replenishment , GPE can make teacher recruitment and training a top global priority for delivering quality education for all . <p> 3 . No classroom <p> Plan UK : Children in South Sudan learn under a mango tree after their school was destroyed by civil war . <p> This seems like a pretty obvious one " if you do n't have a classroom , you do n't really have much of a chance of getting a decent education . But again , that 's a reality for millions of children worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed into overcrowded classrooms , classrooms that are falling apart , or are learning outside . In Malawi , for example , there are 130 children per classroom in grade 1 on average . It 's not just a lack of classrooms that 's the problem , but also all the basic facilities you would expect a school to have " like running water and toilets . In Chad , only one in seven schools has potable water , and just one in four has a toilet ; moreover , only one-third of the toilets that do exist are for girls only " a real disincentive and barrier for girls to come to school . <p> Since 2011 funding from the Global Partnership for Education has helped to build or rehabilitate 53,000 classrooms . If they receive the money they need from donors like the UK , the GPE can ensure that many more children are able to learn in a decent classroom . <p> 4 . A lack of learning materials <p> Plan UK : A girl in class in Mozambique . <p> Outdated and worn-out textbooks are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . In the United Republic of Tanzania , for example , only 3.5% of all grade 6 pupils had sole use of a reading textbook . In Cameroon , there are 11 primary school students for every reading textbook and 13 for every mathematics textbook in grade 2 . Workbooks , exercise sheets , readers and other core materials to help students learn their lessons are in short supply . Teachers also need materials to help prepare their lessons , share with their students , and guide their lessons . <p> Between 2011 and 2014 , the Global Partnership 's developing country partners are on track to distribute 55 million textbooks thanks to GPE support . <p> 5 . The exclusion of children with disabilities <p> Plan UK : A mother walks her blind daughter to school in Togo . <p> Despite the fact that education is a universal human right , being denied access to school is common for the world 's 93 million children with disabilities . In some of the world 's poorest countries , up to 95% of children with disabilities are out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in inclusive teaching methods among teachers , and a straightforward lack of disabled accessible schools leave this group uniquely vulnerable to being denied their right to education . <p> Children with disabilities are one of the Global Partnership for Education 's priorities over the next four years . With a successful replenishment , the GPE will be able to work with its 59 developing country partners to promote inclusive education . The Global Partnership has pledged that by 2018 , 80% of its partner countries will have explicit policy and legislation on education for children with disabilities . <p> 6 . Being the wrong ' gender <p> Plan UK : Girls can often be denied an education by poverty , conflict and discrimination . <p> Put simply , gender is one of the biggest reasons why children are denied an education . - Despite recent advances in girls ' education , a generation of young women has been left behind . Over 100 million young women living in developing countries are unable to read a single sentence . At least one in five adolescent girls around the world is denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discrimination . Poverty forces many families to choose which of their children to send to school . Girls often miss out due to belief that there 's less value in educating a girl than a boy . Instead , they are sent to work or made to stay at home to look after siblings and work on household chores . <p> Ensuring girls can access and complete a quality education is a top priority for the Global Partnership for Education . Since its inception , GPE has helped 10 million girls to go to school . 28 of GPE 's developing country partners have succeeded in getting equal numbers of girls and boys to complete primary school . With a successful replenishment , GPE aims to increase the percentage of girls completing primary school from 74% to 84% by 2018 . <p> 7 . Living in a country in conflict or at risk of conflict <p> Plan UK : The ruins of a former school in South Sudan . Following a 20 year civil war , only 16% of schools in the region operate in permanent buildings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems are often destroyed . While this may seem obvious , the impact of conflict can not be overstated . In 2011 , around 50% of all of the world 's out-of-school children were living in countries affected by conflict . Conflict prevents governments from functioning , teachers and students often flee their homes , and continuity of learning is greatly disrupted . Worryingly , education has thus far been a very low priority in humanitarian aid to countries in conflict " only 1.4% of global humanitarian assistance was allocated to education in 2012 . <p> Since its establishment , the Global Partnership for Education has committed 61% of its funds to conflict-affected and fragile states " higher than most other donors . Of the 29 million children GPE hope to get into school between 2015 and 2018 , 23 million are living in fragile and conflict-affected states . The Global Partnership is also right now looking at how to further improve its operations to accelerate support to countries in emergencies or early recovery situations . <p> For many children around the world , a walk to school of up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is just too much for many children , particularly those children with a disability , those suffering from malnutrition or illness , or those who are required to work around the household . Imagine having to set off for school , hungry , at 5am every day , not to return until 7pm . Many children , especially girls , are also vulnerable to violence on their long and hazardous journeys to and from school . <p> By investing in new schools , more schools , the Global Partnership for Education is helping to reduce the distances children have to travel to get to school for a decent education . With pledges of support from donors , the GPE can help ensure no child has to endure such long journeys just to fulfil their basic right to education . <p> 9 . Hunger and poor nutrition <p> Plan UK : Students eat a breakfast of rice and vegetables at a primary school in Cambodia . <p> The impact of hunger on education systems is gravely underreported . Being severely malnourished , to the point it impacts on brain development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooling . Around 171 million children in developing countries are stunted by hunger by the time they reach age 5 . Stunting can affect a child 's cognitive abilities as well as their focus and concentration in school . As a result , stunted children are 19% less likely to be able to read by age eight . Conversely , good nutrition can be crucial preparation for good learning . <p> The Global Partnership for Education seeks to address national priorities as decided by developing country governments themselves . Where under-nutrition is a major concern , the GPE is stepping in to address the problem . For instance , in Lao People 's Democratic Republic , an innovative School Meals Program funded by GPE is addressing students ' nutritional deficits as well as promoting self-reliance , community ownership , and sustainability through integrated local food production and the active involvement of community members . As a result , Lao PDR has seen increased school enrollment ( especially for girls ) , improved nutritional status , reduced household expenses , and stronger student-teacher-parent and community relations . <p> 10 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan UK : Schoolgirls walk arm-in-arm in Zimbabwe . Cost of uniforms , books and even pens can exclude children from education . <p> The Universal Declaration of Human Rights makes clear that every child has the right to a free basic education , so that poverty and lack of money should not be a barrier to schooling . In many developing countries , over the last decades governments have announced the abolition of school fees and as a result , seen impressive increases in the number of children going to school . But for many of the poorest families , school remains too expensive and children are forced to stay at home doing chores or work themselves . Families remain locked in a cycle of poverty that goes on for generations . In many countries in Africa , while education is theoretically free , in practice informal fees ' see parents forced to pay for compulsory items ' like uniforms , books , pens , extra lessons , exam fees or funds to support the school buildings . In other places , the lack of functioning public ( government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send their children to private schools that , even when technically low fee ' , are unaffordable for the poorest families who risk making themselves destitute in their efforts to get their children better lives through education . <p> The Global Partnership for Education 's primary purpose is to help strengthen the national education systems of the poorest countries , building their capacity to deliver quality affordable education for all citizens . The GPE specifically priorities the most marginalised children out of school , supporting countries to find ways to provide even the poorest families with access to basic education . <p> Use the button on this page to call on world leaders to give 29 million more children a good education . <p> Living in the UK and want to get involved ?

But dreams can only carry the 61 million children not in school , mostly girls , so far . Educating children no matter where they are is one of the biggest steps we can take toward ending extreme poverty . Education is key to building a society that can overcome poverty in a sustainable manner . Investing in human capital brings about powerful social change and creates opportunities for those in developing countries to realise their full potential and to become leaders of the generation to come . <p> In many developing countries , education is unaffordable for families and there is a shortage of classrooms . The poorest countries need almost 4 million new classrooms by 2015 , largely in rural and marginalized areas , to accommodate those who are not in school . More classrooms will alleviate overcrowding , cut class sizes and reduce the long travel distances . Children in rural areas sometimes walk two to three hours to attend school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergencies , especially conflict . The need to fulfill the right to education is greatest in humanitarian crises . More than 40 per cent of out-of school children live in conflict-affected poor countries , and millions are forced out of school by natural disasters each year . In emergency situations , education can save and sustain lives . A safe school environment can give children a sense of normalcy during a crisis . Schools can also aid in post-conflict reconstruction . Yet only 2 per cent of all humanitarian aid goes into education . Schools should be a higher priority during humanitarian crises , and national education plans should include contingencies for emergencies . <p> Gender discrimination . Girls face a unique set of barriers to education , such as child marriage , early pregnancy , and expectations related to domestic labour , not to mention unsafe travel and a lack of sanitary facilities . Many countries under-value girls ' education , with the result that fewer girls enroll and those who do are more likely to drop out .

The gender gap has significantly narrowed in primary education but there has been limited progress at the secondary level . <p> Child labor . Poverty and vulnerability are pushing far too many young children out of school and into the world of work . Some children remain in school , but are disadvantaged doubling up studies with work . For households living in poverty , children may be pulled out of school and into work in the face of external shocks such as natural disasters , rising costs , or a parent 's sickness or unemployment . By leaving school to enter the labor market prematurely , children miss a chance to lift themselves , their families , and their communities out of a cycle of poverty . Sometimes children are exposed to the worst forms of labor that is damaging to their physical , mental and emotional well-being . <p> Ironically , the same barriers that impede access to education could themselves be eradicated by making education more available .

To read more about Skyler's- experiences living in- Ecuador and to learn more about how you too can take a Global Citizen Year in Ecuador , Senegal , Brazil , or India , visit globalcitizenyear.org . <p> Three kilometers above sea level in the southern Ecuadorian Andes sits the ancient indigenous kichwa-speaking community of Ca+ar . The terrain consists of steep ravines and grassy slopes . Most Ca+aris work the fields as subsistence farmers producing crops native to the Andes such as quinoa and potatoes . <p> As is typical in many agricultural communities , life moves at a slow pace . People will take advantage of just about any opportunity to stop and chat with neighbors , friends , and family members about local gossip , the weather , and whatever else may come to mind . Just walking through the community along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those around . None take themselves too seriously and jokes told with a certain amount of sass and sarcasm are not just accepted , but encouraged and met with raucous laughter . <p> Community meetings are a favorite pastime- " - but they almost always start at least an hour after the advertised start time . The actual purpose of said meetings generally has little to do with the advertised meeting topic , which could be water quality , road repair , weekly planning , or agricultural workforce organization . The real , tacitly acknowledged reason for the meetings is to maintain strong community bonds . <p> Although daily life in Ca+ar is remarkably chill and peaceful , the indigenous community bears the weight of a tumultuous history . Once a powerful and independent nation recognized for innovations in metalworking and agriculture , Ca+ar had its freedom and glory stolen by two foreign conquests in the span of only 60 years , first by the Incas and later by the Spanish . <p> Image : Flickr : Sally Taylor <p> To be historically accurate , however , the Incas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was essentially a tense and semi-stable truce as the Ca+aris were notoriously stubborn and refused to be conquered . This earned them the nickname in Quichua , " Pi+ashka Ka+arikuna , " or " The Angry Ca+aris . " <p> Then , after approximately 60 years of being more or less under the rule of the Incas , the game completely changed with the invasion by the Spanish in the early 1530s . The Ca+aris at first welcomed the Spanish and , seeing them as liberators , helped them in the fight to defeat the Incas . <p> After the Incan empire fell , however , the Spanish quickly betrayed the people of Ca+ar , enslaving them as they did to native populations all over Latin America . They remained as slaves , property of the Spanish conquerors , from that time until Ecuador declared it 's independence from Spain almost 300 years later in 1822 . <p> Unfortunately for the Ca+aris , the struggle did n't stop there . They spent the next 150 years or so , up until around the 1960s , in de-facto slavery working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca+aris were the original inhabitants of the land , they were not allowed the same land ownership rights as the mestizos , or people of mixed Spanish and indigenous descent . This left them no other option but to work as semi-slaves on the land they once owned . <p> Only now that the indigenous people of Ecuador have officially been granted full citizenship rights are the Ca+aris able to live freely on their native land . <p> Though the living circumstances have vastly improved in recent years , there is still a ways to go before equality can be achieved . The indigenous community still has a much higher poverty rate than the general population and due to centuries of oppression , some people still feel a sense of shame associated with their indigenous identity . <p> What is clear , however , is that the Ca+aris are on the way back up . Most still continue to be proud of maintaining their ancient traditions and understand the importance of speaking their native Quichua . Their is a high value placed on education for young Ca+aris as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be they male or female , mestizo or indigenous , old or young , etc . Such values are taught in their schools and practiced in daily life . <p> The story of the Ca+aris is the story of a proud and glorious people who lost it all but are on their way towards gaining it back .

The problem is , this water ca n't be consumed . It 's oversaturated with salt . <p> Desalination is the process of turning salty ocean water into drinking water . So with 783 million people lacking access to clean water and more areas facing severe droughts , could desalination be the silver bullet ? <h> So how does desalination work ? <p> Desalination is the process of purifying saline water into a potable fresh water . Basically " turning ocean water into drinkable fresh water . Sounds pretty cool ! <p> There are several ways to remove salt from water . Reverse osmosis and distillation are the most common ways to desalinate water . Reverse osmosis water treatment pushes water through small filters leaving salt behind . Distillation on a large scale involves boiling water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of energy , infrastructure and are costly . <p> Image : Flickr : ro plant <h> So is cost the reason why desalination is n't used ? <p> Yup . The energy requirements are so high that the cost for a lot of countries is too much.That 's why it 's mainly used in regions lacking freshwater , ships , and military vessels . <p> There are environmental concerns too . Desalination plants take in salt water straight from the ocean and can kill or harm fish and other small ocean life as water travels from the source to the plant . <p> A pipeline to a desalination plant in the Red Sea near Nuweiba , Egypt . Image : Flickr : prilfish <p> Lastly , salinity levels in oceans are predicted to rise , which would make filtering water more expensive . The more salt there is to filter out , the more energy required . That 's why plants often convert brackish water ( think lightly salted potato chips vs. regular ) to clean water . But brackish water is not as prevalent as ocean water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : John Wiley It 's still very expensive compared to using freshwater sources . But companies are working on it . Israel invested in a large desalination plant in 2005 and will be producing enough water to supply half the country by the end of 2015. - Yes , building desalination plants is very costly ( 1 billion USD for the largest plant in the US ) but it is a safety net for places where drought conditions persist and freshwater is limited or lacking entirely . California , you know what I 'm talking about . <p> California is building seventeen new desalination plants after years of severe drought . And it 's still controversial . Desalination is being used as a last resort in California . Cities in California have tried investing in infrastructure for desalination previously . Santa Barbara built a desalination plant years ago and is just now restarting it after initial costs were too high to run the plant previously . It will cost 55 million USD to restart and maintain . Water obtained from desalination costs twice the amount of water from freshwater sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other options . <p> The only way desalination can be a good option to solving the water crisis is if renewable energy is used , costs are lowered , and environmental protections are put in place for marine life too . <p> Companies and countries and trying to lower the amount of energy needed to desalinate water and look into using cleaner energy sources . For example , Saudi Arabia has pushed to use solar energy to power desalination plants . <p> Image : Flickr : US Embassy Tel Aviv <p> In California , the California Coastkeepers Alliance is working with desalination plants on a plan to make sure marine life is minimally harmed by using techniques sub-surface water intake as opposed to sucking in water from the surface where marine life is more prevalent . <p> Desalination does allow for severely water-stressed areas to have their own water source , but it still comes at a high cost . But with climate change and severe drought affecting more and more areas , I think it 's a process worth investing in to lower cost and cut carbon footprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make desalination a more viable option .

Last week , eight people were reported dead after a roof collapsed on top of construction workers in Mongla , Bangladesh ( for geographic reference , Mongla is a port city in the south-west region of the Asian nation ) . This deadly incident is the latest in a series of factory accidents within the country - and recalls thecalamityin 2013 , when 1,100 textile workers died after a nine-story building collapsed . <p> While laws are in place in Bangladesh to protect workers , oversight is scant , and violations of working conditions are often overlooked , according to a BBC correspondent covering the disaster . Further , foreign investment is often involved in the products manufactured at factories in developing nations . <p> Worker safety standards are often overlooked for the poorest and most marginalized peoples ( here is a link to a GREAT article on poverty and workplace safety ) . And due to expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the rapid expansion of poorly constructed factories . It 's an issue of supply and demand , and with many Western and first-world nations craving cheap products , developing nations are meeting the need with inexpensive labor and shoddy factories . <p> So , what does that mean for consumers ? Do we simply stop buying products made in developing nations ? In my mind , the answer to this question is no , but the onus falls to consumers to demand accountability from companies that are outsourcing labor . While many corporations are beginning to look at their supply chains ( a fancy way of saying where products are outsourced and made ) , much of this focus is new - and has been a response to customer demands . Additionally , many companies have become more responsible to preserve their - image ( also known as corporate social responsibility ) . <p> Below , I list a number of recommendations on responsible buying practices and awareness of supply chains . - While this list is n't comprehensive , it does provide the framework for more responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products are made <p> This one may sound easy - but do you really know where your clothes are from ? My current ensemble showcases jeans produced in Turkey , shoes cobbled in China , a leather jacket manufactured in France , and socks handmade in New York City from yarn spun in Ireland . Yeah , my wardrobe is better traveled than I am . <p> When shopping , I try to look for goods that are produced locally , or are second-hand , but this is n't always possible . So , when I do buy something new , I try to see where the product is being manufactured . Here is an example - If a plastic dish I am considering buying has been produced in Myanmar , where low-cost manufacturing is prevalent , and I do n't know the specifics of the factory conditions , I will do some detective work before I buy . - This firstly gives me a better idea of where I am buying from , but secondly , makes me accountable for the product I want to purchase . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying from in the past , and as a result have written these corporations to increase responsibility for their products ( I use twitter , email , and Facebook as a platform for activism ) . <p> 2 . ) Buy sustainably , locally , or DIY <p> Buying sustainable products is largely associated with environmental concerns , but it also applies to people . Think about it this way- buying from a factory or brand that under-charges workers and is n't accountable for how its goods are produced is n't a sustainable business model . Corporations need to have an idea of how to manage supply chains , and most large brands are getting smart about this . And for those that have n't - it goes back to consumer power . Demand that corporations understand where their goods are being manufactured . <p> And what about local buying ? It 's not just for shopping at the farmers ' market ! Use me as an example - here in New York City , I will look for locally made clothing produced on recycled fabric . I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't buy locally to be on trend , I buy locally t because it makes sense . Not only am I supporting local designers , but with the supply chain closer to home , the product is more sustainable , environmentally friendly , and I know that I am paying a fair price for what I am purchasing . For all you New Yorkers , check out kaightshop.com and www.sustainable-nyc.com . It 's easier than you 'd think to find sustainable , fair-trade products . <p> As for the DIY aspect , remember those socks previously mentioned ? Yeah , I made them myself . I also have several ceramic bowls and mugs I created using a kiln at a local pottery house ( not doing much for my hipster argument ) . <p> 3 . ) Know the supply chain policy of brands <p> Corporations and brands are becoming increasingly more accountable to laborers and consumers , working to ensure that goods are manufactured in safe conditions . While it would be nice to simply assume that all corporations outsource their labor and production to factories that comply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . To be a responsible consumer , look at the supply chain policy of companies ( for instance , big brands like H&amp;M and Target have been leaders in corporate social responsibility . Or check out http : //www.free2work.org to see the stories behind the barcodes ) . <p> 4 . ) Campaign for worker 's rights <p> As consumers , it 's our job to support the health and wellbeing of workers . With increasing news coverage on factory disasters such as the one profiled in Mongla , we , global citizens , have to have an awareness of the conditions people are working under . It is important to understand how consumers can affect important change in worker 's rights - and that our buying power has , well power . By understanding the conditions that our goods are produced in , we can help to support better conditions for laborers across the globe . Campaigns like www.cleanclothes.organd www.laborrights.org are great ways to support laborers , and demand accountability from companies on worker 's rights . <p> 5 . ) Consume less <p> I love buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty pleasure , but in recent years , I have tried practicing " mindful " buying . Instead of shopping to pass time , I only buy what I need , and try to purchase higher quality clothing that will last longer , look for flatware from local potters , and use the public library as opposed to running out to bring home the newest hard-back novel . <p> How does consuming less relate to labor standards ? It goes back to my argument of supply-and-demand . The developed world is increasingly asking for more and more cheap products , and developing nations are answering the demand because of their ability to supply cheap labor . While I am thrilled to see all nations moving onto the global market , I question the role of consumerism in making these connections . Particularly if demand for goods are producing unsafe conditions for laborers , and lack of accountability from the corporate sector . It 's a tricky balance - everyone deserves to work , and it 's amazing to see emerging industries , but not at the expense of workers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy things , and shopping can be fun . But we , global citizens , should also be aware of worker 's rights and the sustainability of where the things we consume originate . Being thoughtful , mindful , and also advocacy oriented in our buying is not only good for our pocketbooks , it 's good for laborers . <p> It may be time for nations to begin thinking of consumer culture as a hindrance to development . While everyone should be able to have the ability to purchase and consume in the ways they see fit , the desire to buy often impacts our ability fully relate to one another . While it is wonderful that workers in developing nations are able to find jobs , is it really the right kind of work ? What does it mean that the source of income and labor for many individuals are linked to the needs of foreign consumption ? <p> Whatever you feel about supply chains , corporate social responsibility , and consumerism , the bottom-line is this : worker 's rights matter .

In NGO circles corruption in Africa tends to be regarded as a product of western influence and the siren voices of capitalism . Where does the truth lie ? <p> In my book , Global Corruption : Money , Power and Ethics in the Modern World , I explore the nature of corruption across the world , the forces which drive it forward , and the roadblocks to combating it . Many of the issues discussed are common to a range of countries . I particularly focus on five key drivers . The first is the size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nigeria unrecorded transactions amount to at least 40 per cent of GDP , constituting a vast reservoir from which corrupt payments can be made without trace . <p> The second is the system of ' political finance , ' by which huge sums of money , often gained corruptly , are invested in the political process with the expectation of a corruptly gained reward once power is secured or re-secured . This is easily discernible in most political systems from the US to India . <p> The third is the role of organised crime in securing political support and cover for trading operations ranging from drugs to counterfeit pharmaceuticals - a recognised practice from Italy to Thailand . <p> The fourth is the role of national and international companies in the ' mis-pricing ' of products which enable a large chunk of profits to be moved to havens where tax is low or non-existent - a common phenomenon from Russia to Peru . <p> The last is the system by which illegally and corruptly gained products - such as oil , timber and rare minerals - transit from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cambodia or counterfeit drugs in south east Asia . <p> It is easy to see that these five drivers are also at work across Africa . No African country has an economy , except South Africa , in which more than 60 per cent is recorded in standard GDP figures ; dominant political parties are typically funded by a small clique with corporate interests ; organised crime is a major factor in many countries especially in the drugs and counterfeit pharmaceuticals business ; ' mis-pricing ' of mineral and timber exports is common ; and the transit of illegally acquired products - such as timber , oil and coltan - from the informal to the formal sector is widespread . By these criteria , corruption in Africa is very much part of an international pattern . <p> How does this work out at the country level ? <p> In Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe has been maintained in power by an elite group with strong ties to the military . This group once extended its tentacles to the DRC and does so now in the domestic diamond mining industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in power in Cameroun for 30 years , is partly sustained by the export of illegally felled logs from Cameroun 's vast forest reserves . Key politicians in Guinea-Conakry and Guinea-Bissau have become active partners with Colombian drug cartels in the trans-shipment of cocaine to Europe . In Nigeria , oil ' bunkering ' from the Delta enriches both local and national players in the government and the army - a classic case of illegally acquired products entering the world 's legal trade through the Rotterdam market . The price at which Tanzania 's booming mineral exports - notably gold , platinum and uranium - enter the world market is controversial and secret . <p> Whilst these types of corruption are common across much of the world , it is difficult to argue that Africa is a victim of global and corrupt processes which , substantially , it can not control . The question of the size of the unrecorded sector is one which governments can tackle over a three to four year period as , for example , Rwanda has shown . Any increase in the local tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady increase in the relative size of the formal sector . The control of political finance is a big problem throughout the world , but the more outrageous raids in Africa on Treasuries , Central Banks and the defence budget can be dramatically reduced . The expansion of the tentacles of organised crime depends on the compliance of at least some elected and non-elected officials , but the process is not inevitable . The transit of products from the illegal to the legal sector , although a mechanism requiring international collaboration , is ultimately triggered by local rather than international initiative . <p> The question of mispricing is one for which the responsibility falls much more heavily on the corporate world outside Africa and where African countries are undoubtedly frequent victims of this , losing huge quantities of revenue in the process . Here initiatives such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) , which commits both companies and governments to reporting the revenue they respectively earn and receive from the exploitation of mineral resources , are key ( of the 14 countries which are ' fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ) . <p> Africa 's corruption has many global aspects , especially the fact that it arises from deep structural factors which it will take great energy and courage to change . Heroes such as Nuhu Ribadu and John Githongo have shown the way forward , but have also demonstrated the depth of resistance to rolling it back - both were forced into exile . As elsewhere in the world , governments will have to address the underlying issues as well as the symptomatic cases which are only occasionally brought to court . <p> Laurence Cockcroft is a development economist and former chair of Transparency International .

Across South Asia there is a common term for this transgender community which comprises transvestites , transsexuals , transgender people and eunuchs- they are known as the hijra . <p> NB : Although for convenience of understanding I am using the term hijra in this piece , social workers and activists prefer the term Khwaja Saraa as hijra is a derogatory word in Urdu . <p> A history of the hijra <p> The first mentions of a third sex are found in ancient texts such as the Mahabharata and the Kama Sutra , meaning the hijra have existed in some form or another since antiquity . Some of the earliest references to hijra describe their role as similar to that of court eunuchs- dancing , singing for kings or as handmaidens for princesses . However , in a similar way to homosexuality , being hijra was criminalised by the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India hijra subsequently formed secretive and self-contained communities . They even crafted their own language , hijra Farsi , in order to communicate with each other in secret . <p> Hijra are considered sacred in Indian society , but suffer extreme prejudice and poverty . Image credit : Graham Barratt <p> While there is limited data on how many transgender people there are in India , the hijra community is estimated to have between 500,000 and 2 million members . Despite still being considered sacred ( they are often invited to bestow blessings at weddings ) , in modern India life as a member of the hijra is often an arduous one . Being hijra was decriminalized after independence in 1949 , but deep suspicion of transgender people has remained . The stigma against transgender people in India remains such that many hijra are forced out of their family homes , and are left with no choice but to sleep on the streets . Many resort to begging or prostitution as their only means of income , and levels of poverty and destitution among these groups are extremely high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical treatment . Also , the endemic risk of sexual violence in Indian society is even more pronounced for hijra- trans activists in India report frequent gang rapes of hijra occurring in a number of major Indian cities . - <p> Trans poverty around the world <p> This link between being trans and being poor and socially excluded is one found in many countries around the world . Although there are not many thorough studies yet , what data there is is shocking . For example , the WHO has found that because trans people are so often forced into prostitution as a means of income , prevalence of HIV among these groups is disproportionately high- around 1 in 4 trans women across the world are thought to have the disease . In Brazil , high rates of homelessness and anti-transgender violence has meant that life expectancy for trans people is 35 . Meanwhile , in many African countries trans men are prone to corrective rape ' - sexual violence designed to punish them for not conforming to sexual and gender norms . Even in the United States recent studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live below the national poverty line , particularly Latino and Asian trans people . The reasons for this link between being transgender and poverty are complex , often it 's to do with discriminative hiring practises in the workplace and exclusion from educational opportunity , but ultimately it can be traced back to deep-rooted prejudice and stigma . <p> Steps forward <p> What 's encouraging is that , perhaps in tandem with a global push for further recognition of trans rights , there have recently been a number of significant steps forward for India 's trans communities . Last year the Supreme Court of India formally recognized transgender people as a third gender ' , stating that everyone has the right to choose their own gender ' . This historic legal acknowledgement that there can be gender identity outside of man ' or woman ' is far more progressive than the laws in many Western countries . The Court also directed the government to provide equal opportunity to the socially and economically deprived transgender population . This year India also elected its first openly transgender mayor- Maddu Kinnar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became mayor of Raigarh in the Central State of Chattisgarh in January . <p> Bear in mind , homosexuality remains illegal in India and those who engage in homosexual activity ' can face imprisonment . What this says then is that if we can make progress in a normally conservative society we can continue to push for the proper social and economic inclusion of transgender people around the world .

Illiterate people generally exist on the margins of society in poverty . They may not have a broad awareness of disease and injuries and therefore may not seek out medical help when needed .

Even if they get health care , they may be unable to understand prescription directions . These barriers compound and create poverty . <p> Ensuring global literacy is everyone 's responsibility . Literacy is empowering , but someone can only become literate with the help of another person . Everyone who can read and write can point to the people in their life who taught and guided them , who opened up the world of literacy 's possibilities . Many people who are illiterate simply do not have anyone in their life who can teach them , making illiteracy a generational problem . It 's not their fault they do not receive the guidance . Therefore , it is up to all of us to make sure people without the resources and connections receive a robust education . Doing so not only gives them a much fuller life , but also improves society as a whole , creating more capable and independent citizens and a more informed public . <p> I loved to read as a little kid .

Ever wonder why these products have such drastic variations in prices depending on where you are around the globe ? <p> Enter " the Big Mac Index . It was started back in the 1980s by The Economist as a fun way to get people to learn about how currencies are valued at different rates around the world . However you feel about McDonalds , it 's nice when economists at least try to make economic theory sound fun to others .

The Big Mac Index reflects that a burger in Norway costs more than in the Malaysia because people in Norway can more easily afford to pay $8 ( USD ) for a burger . Right ? <p> A person in Norway has an average income of $34,000 ( USD ) per year while the average citizen of Malaysia makes $11,500 ( USD ) per year . <p> But the average income in other countries is higher than Norway , you say ? <p> Ok " here 's the answer for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross domestic product ) .

Countries with undervalued ( or lower value ) currencies often have little global power when it comes to economic trade with countries with strong currencies . <p> On top of this , citizens of these lower value currency countries have few options for purchasing food and goods domestically because these countries need to export goods in order to raise the value of their currency and economy in the global market . This makes buying quality food a challenge in poor countries . And creates a large-scale poverty cycle for developing countries entering the global market . <p> There 's enough food to feed the world , ( hopefully not in the form of Big Macs ) the problem is access to affordable nutritious food .

In 1980 , sub-Saharan Africa had a 3.6% share of world trade . By 1998 , this share had dropped to just 1.3% and in 2011 , it was 2.1% . <p> Similarly , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to the region remains a small fraction of global FDI flows ; however , the picture is improving . While the global financial crisis led to a general drop in FDI from 2008 , sub-Saharan Africa has fared relatively well compared to the G8 countries ( Canada , France , UK , USA , Russia , Italy , Japan , Germany ) . <p> Africa 's economic growth also rebounded relatively quickly from the global financial crisis. - In 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth across 2012 and 2013 is predicted to average 5.4% ; only the developing Asia region is predicted to have higher rates of economic growth during this period. - <p> Despite this progress , roughly one-third of the African population lives in poverty and building Africa 's capacity for global and regional trade is essential for creating a pathway to sustainable livelihoods . Sub-Saharan Africa faces some of the world 's greatest challenges in accessing local , regional , and global markets . <p> On the supply side , poor infrastructure for roads , bridges , and unreliable access to energy and under-developed telecommunications systems are significant barriers to trade and discourage investments . Other constraints include a lack of business training , capital to build competitive industries and financial services to help entrepreneurs bring their ideas to fruition . Combined with regressive import tariff policies in many developed countries , these constraints contribute to a reliance on raw exports , such as minerals and agricultural products , rather than finished products . This presents significant challenges to expanding trade across the continent . <p> Sub-Saharan African countries also face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which make it difficult for their products to compete in important markets like the U.S. and Japan . To worsen the situation , wealthy nations pay subsidies " many of which are trade-distorting " to their producers , giving them an unfair advantage in the global marketplace . In 2011 , agricultural subsidies in OECD countries reached $407 billion , which represents 0.95% of these countries ' GDP . More than ten times what was provided to sub-Saharan Africa in the same year . <p> Within Africa , poor regional integration " both in terms of infrastructure and government policies " poses a barrier to African countries benefiting from trade with each other . <p> The opportunity : <p> Inclusive economic growth , driven by trade and investment , will help end poverty in sub-Saharan Africa . <p> Improving access to developed countries and neighboring markets , enhancing aid for trade to help countries address supply-side constraints and improve competitiveness , investing in infrastructure , increasing capital investment flows , and strengthening regional economic integration can make trade can work for Africa .

The good news is that global levels of aid continue to rise . Even better , after a few years of decline , development assistance for the poorest countries is finally increasing again . <p> However , looking more closely at the numbers the figures tell us a less positive story . An increasing proportion of aid is not reaching developing countries and instead is being spent at home in donor countries . Most of the increase in aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover domestic refugee costs .

Under current rules , donor countries are allowed to count certain costs for hosting refugees in their own countries as development aid . This is controversial as it is not clear how these costs meet the main objective of aid " to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries . Not only is this contested , governments also apply these rules inconsistently with some only counting certain expenditures such as temporary accommodation and food , whilst- others include- a range of costs - from administration to helping- refugees find a home- in developing countries . <p> These rules have always been a concern but the scale of the refugee crisis which hit Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as governments look to aid budgets to fill budget gaps at home .

In some countries , the majority , or at least a part , of the money is additional to the development budget but counting it as aid distorts the figures of actual aid spending . In other worse cases , governments have effectively cut aid programmes by diverting funds dedicated to development programmes away to finance refugee costs at home . Luxembourg is the only European country which does not count domestic refugee costs as development assistance . <p> Image : Mon 's Images / Shutterstock.com <h> We can and must do both . <p> There is no question that governments must meet the needs of the refugees arriving at Europe 's border .

Taking money away from the development budget to cover refugee costs- treats- the symptoms of the crisis at home , but exacerbates- the root causes abroad . Both increased humanitarian as well as long-term development aid need to be an integral part of Europe 's solution to the refugee crisis . <p> Right now the OECD is in the process of reviewing the rules of how refugee costs are being counted by donor countries .

You might think this buys more in a poor country than it does here , but actually , it 's a figure that 's been adjusted for purchasing power , which means that anywhere in the world , the $1.25 a day measure buys little more than enough basic food , clean water and cooking fuel to make two simple meals . <p> In the last 30 years , the proportion of the world 's population that live below this line has halved " from 52% in 1980 , to 25% today . That 's a decline from 1.9 billion people down to 1.3 billion people . <p> At the Global Poverty Project we 're passionate about communicating these amazing achievements , and highlighting the opportunity we have to bring this number down to zero - within a generation . <p> This post summarizes how we can each play a part in realizing this opportunity " moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improbable possibility ' , to likely reality ' . This list is designed to introduce you to the key themes and issues related to ending extreme poverty . <p> How we think about extreme poverty <p> We know ending extreme poverty is a big and complex challenge . It has many causes , and there 's certainly no silver bullet or single solution , but we do n't think that this complexity means the challenge can not be overcome . There are a huge number of smart and talented people all over the world in charities , business , academia , evaluation organisations , government and think-tanks who are building an evidence base of things that work , things that do n't and why . <p> The big three issues <p> To see an end to extreme poverty , there are three big issues that we need to see action on " governance , aid and trade . We know that we have the resources ( economic , social , political and environmental ) to see an end to extreme poverty . But , right now , the world works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we all need to focus on to see an end to extreme poverty . <p> Improving governance structures can ensure that decision-making works in favour of the world 's poorest people . At present , most discussions about governance are framed in terms of corruption . Rather than treating the problem of corruption as an excuse to stop investing in development efforts , we need to get behind those working in communities to counter corruption : by holding local leaders to account , increasing transparency , and ensuring that laws are applied . Corruption is not only a problem that needs to be tackled in poor countries . In rich countries we need to hold governments and businesses to account for any complicity in the process of corruption , or for unethically undermining poverty reduction through actions like avoiding tax or utilising vulture funds to recover illegitimate debts . We 've posted more about corruption here , including an interview with leading experts here , or you can see the work being done by corruption-fighting organisations like Global Witness and Transparency International . <p> Next , we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through donations to charities or taxes to government " is spent on programs that really work . Foreign aid wo n't end poverty - but it 's a vital ingredient that can be used to make investments in things like health , education and infrastructure " resources needed for countries and communities to lift themselves out of poverty and prevent dependence on aid in the future . We 've written more about good aid here , here and here . <p> Ultimately , extreme poverty ends when local communities can trade their way to a better future . The amazing poverty alleviation that we 've seen in the past generation has been led by countries who have joined global markets : in China 400 million citizens have been lifted out of poverty since 1980 , South Korea has moved from aid recipient to aid donor by building industry and creating world-renowned brands , and Botswana has grown faster than any other country in Africa by wisely investing proceeds from its diamond mines . Currently , the potential of trade is limited by the rules which work against poor countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to extreme poverty . <p> The Elephants in the Room <p> Beyond these three issues , climate change and resource limitations are the elephants in the room , threatening the potential end to extreme poverty . The impact of these issues can be seen in the Pakistan floods , and in the record food prices which will mean that 1 billion people go to bed hungry tonight . On both of these issues our challenge is distribution , not scarcity . We are n't running out of food - there 's more than enough food on our planet to feed everyone . The problem is that the world 's poorest people ca n't afford to buy enough of it . In order to realize the potential of developing populations , rich countries have to increase their efficiency in resource use , and support clean development . <p> Our role <p> All of the opportunities and challenges of fighting extreme poverty outlined above are technically possible and eminently affordable . Our role is to make them politically viable and increasingly probable . <p> Beyond that , we can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we are already making significant progress , and that practical steps can be taken to overcome the challenges that remain . <p> From there , it 's about using your voice as a citizen to join the campaigns and initiatives of organisations fighting hard in your local community to change the rules and systems that keep people poor : ensuring that corruption is reduced , that aid is given in appropriate quantities in the right way to the right things , and changing trade rules to give the world 's poorest a fair chance to lift themselves out of poverty . <p> Most importantly , it 's about recognizing that the movement to end extreme poverty is led by people in poverty themselves . As we reflect on the changes of the last generation , we can look forward a generation and see a real prospect of extreme poverty not existing .

But the sector is controversial , accused of irresponsibly promoting the idea that tourists can make a real difference to development by spending a few weeks of their time at a project . <p> According to the critics , this approach purely serves the needs and aspirations of the volunteer , and can have negative effects on the local communities that have to host and direct people who have little or no experience in the work they are carrying out . <p> One- volunteer company- does n't seem to shy away from this assumption , allowing potential volunteers to search through its projects with the questions , Where do you want to go ? ' , What do you want to do ' and How long do you want to go for ? ' . If the volunteer is there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be What can you do ? ' , What are your skills ' and Where are you needed ? ' . <p> Voluntouring is n't cheap either . Volunteers usually shell out for flights , insurance , transfers , food , visas and vaccinations as well as the volunteer placement fee , which can be up to -400 a week. - The critics ( including a character in our recent aid worker ' video ) , argue that this money could be better spent if it was donated straight to the project , for example it would last a lot longer used as a salary for a qualified local worker to take the place of the volunteer . <p> But sometimes these criticisms can all feel a bit cynical . Surely there are lots of projects that would benefit from enthusiastic volunteers committing their time and energy , even if only for a short time ? And is n't there huge potential for utilising volunteers who return from their trip inspired , better informed about the world and looking to contribute more ? <p> From my experience volunteering abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have truth in them . The key to making sure your volunteering abroad is useful , efficient and positive for both parties is being honest about what skills you really have to offer as a volunteer , and careful research into where these skills might be used most effectively . <p> When I was 18 I volunteered as a teacher in the South Pacific country of Vanuatu . I had n't been much further east than Norwich before and had no experience teaching or working with young people . But , I had always dreamt of living on a tropical island - ever since seeing The Beach ' aged 14 it had been a bit of an obsession . I believed that if placements were on offer there then these poor people must need me . Before I arrived I pictured myself surrounded by happy smiling children whose life chances had been drastically improved by my imparted wisdom and English language skills . <p> The reality was of course quite different . Do n't get me wrong , I loved my time living on an amazing tropical island steeped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most welcoming and friendly people on the planet . I had an amazing year and my experience still influences me personally and professionally . What troubles me is that I could have experienced these things without taking up that particular teaching placement , and the arrogance in assuming children needed ' to be taught by an unqualified and inexperienced westerner . <p> My school already had an English teacher , Lizzy , who was from the island and had stuck it out through high school and Uni to qualify " and she was really good at her job . When I arrived I took over her classes , and as I was completely new to teaching and had minimal ( one week ) training , it took me quite some time to get into it , and frankly I was never going to be as good as her . It would have been far better for me to have played an assistant role to Lizzy in her classes , or to have focused on helping students with their conversational English . However when I had seen teaching assistant placements advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour of full teaching as I thought I would make more of a difference that way . <p> It was partly the volunteer organisation 's fault , they should have had a better understanding of the education system in Vanuatu and the local community to know what their needs really were and were n't . But it was also my fault for choosing a placement based on what I wanted to get out of it , not what I could honestly offer at the time . <p> I do n't have a problem with people wanting to see more of the world through voluntourism , it can provide links to communities which most tourists will never interact with , and these relationships can be mutually beneficial . I do n't have a problem with people shelling out thousands of pounds for placements which could be arranged locally for a fraction of the price , some people would n't be confident doing so and would therefore never go .

Real progress will be elusive unless all children receive a quality education . <h> #1 No Poverty <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> End poverty in all its forms everywhere . <p> Education is the one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty . <p> According to UNESCO , 171 million people could be lifted out of poverty " a 12% drop in global poverty " if all students in low-income countries left school with basic reading skills . <p> UNESCO also found that one extra year of schooling increases an individual 's earnings by up to 10% , and each additional year of schooling raises average annual gross domestic product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that a mother 's education improves her children 's nutrition , especially as she seeks higher levels of schooling . <p> The most recent UNESCO research in 2013 shows that there are approximately 47 million children in low-income countries who are stunted as a result of malnutrition in early childhood . If all mothers in those countries had a primary education , 1.7 million children would be saved from stunting . If those mothers had a secondary education , 12.2 million children would be saved from stunting. - <h> #3 Good Health <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages . <p> Better educated people are much less vulnerable to health risks . <p> When mothers in particular are educated , even at the most primary level , they are more likely to be well informed about various diseases and take steps to prevent them. - UNESCO reports that each extra year of a mother 's schooling reduces the probability of infant mortality by as much as 10% and that a child whose mother can read is 50% more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal Lancet also showed that four million child deaths have been prevented over the past four decades thanks to the global increase in women 's education . <p> Education equips learners of all ages with the skills and values needed to be responsible global citizens , such as respect for human rights , gender equality and environmental sustainability . Investing in and strengthening a country 's education sector is key to the development of any country and its people . Without investment in quality education , progress on all other development indicators will stagnate . The Global Partnership for Education works to ensure that all children irrespective of where they live get a quality education , prioritizing the most vulnerable . <h> #5 . Gender Equality <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls . <p> Education enables girls and women to reach their full potential " in parity with men and boys " in their homes , communities , workplaces and institutions of influence . <p> One additional school year can increase a woman 's earnings by up to 20% , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some countries lose more than $1 billion a year by failing to educate girls at the same level as boys . We also know that as the gap between the number of girls and boys narrows , so , too , do gender disparities in wages and employment . <h> #6 Clean Water and Sanitation <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all . <p> As communities become better educated about the links between their sanitation and health they seesubstantial improvements in sanitation . And , as societies become more economically prosperous , it stands to reason that they will be better able to create modern water and sanitation facilities and systems . <p> In many societies , girls can spend as many as 15 hours per week fetching water for their families , leave no time for school , UNESCO reports . Similarly , without access to safe sanitation , there are many more sick children who will miss school . In Ethiopia , 6.8 million people gained access to improved sanitation from 1990 to 2006 . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sanitation and health , and of implementing new , affordable technologies . <h> #7 Clean Energy <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Ensure access to affordable , reliable , sustainable and modern energy for all . <p> Like education , clean and accessible energy is an essential building block of a country 's social , economic and environmental development . <p> Experience suggests that educated citizens will likely be more inclined to recognize and adopt new practices and technologies that will help them and their communities prosper . And , with education , those citizens will be positioned to build and maintain energy infrastructures that will sustain their countries for a long time to come . <h> #8 Good Jobs and Economic Growth <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Promote sustained , inclusive and sustainable economic growth , full and productive employment and decent work for all . <p> Education is one of the strongest drivers of economic progress and prosperity .

Over a 45-year period , average annual growth in income per capita was 3.4% in East Asia and the Pacific , but 0.8% in sub-Saharan Africa . The difference in education levels explains about half of the difference in growth. - - - <h> #9 Infrastructure <p> With education , countries have greater capacity to assemble and maintain the physical building blocks of progress , health and security . <p> As a country 's inhabitants become better educated , they will be more likely to acquire their own critical technical skills and creative problem solving necessary to build and sustain roads and bridges , ICT systems , ports and airports , health and financial systems , governance practices and the many other structures that enable life in a country to improve and flourish . - Well-planned and operating infrastructure itself enables more children to get the educational opportunities they need . Better infrastructure makes it possible for children " particularly in remote areas that have few developed roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school conveniently and quickly . <h> #10 Inequalities <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Reduce inequality within and among countries . <p> As more children , from across the demographic , geographic and cultural spectrum become educated , we are likely to see an improvement in a country 's income inequality . <p> One study showed that a 0.1% improvement in a country 's education equality can , over forty years , raise its per capita income by 23% higher . <p> Research demonstrates that with more education equality , Vietnam 's economic performance improved and , in 2005 , its GDP surpassed Pakistan 's , where education equality levels are half those of Vietnam 's . <p> And , with better education , people from traditionally disadvantaged communities are better positioned to advocate for their own rights and needs , gain entry into higher echelons of economic , social and civic life and help narrow gaps of inequality across their societies . <h> #11 Sustainable cities and communities <p> With education , people are more likely than not to understand , support and craft creative solutions that ensure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Good urban planning , efficient energy use , good water and sanitation management , social inclusion and other elements of well-working communities require people with knowledge and skills that are only available through quality education . At the heart of a World Bank Sustainable Cities Initiative , for example , are awareness-building programs , development and implementation of local diagnostic tools , the creation of policy reforms and other tasks that require not just primary but advanced education . <h> #12 Responsible Consumption <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns . <p> Education raises the odds that people will use energy and water more efficiently and recycle household waste , according to UNESCO . <p> A study of Ethiopia showed that , six years of education improve by 20% the chance that a farmer will address climate change by adopting techniques such as soil conservation , variation in planting dates and changes in crop varieties . <p> Another study showed that for each additional year of education that a head of household received , a society is between 4% and 21.5% less likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , in developing countries , research points out that there is an improvement in awareness of energy-efficient technologies with increasing education . <p> Life on landProtect , restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems , sustainably manage forests , combat desertification , and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss . <p> With higher levels of education , people across many different societies show greater concern about the well-being of the environment . <p> In 29 countries , 25% of people with less than a secondary education expressed concern for the environment compared to 37% of people with secondary education and 46% of people with tertiary education , research shows . <p> Also , environmental education programs have been responsible for important advances in many national and regional efforts to fight climate change and protect aquatic life and terrestrial ecosystems . But that kind of education can only reach its full potential where a critical mass of a country 's or region 's inhabitants have foundational learning skills that come with primary and secondary education . - <h> #16 Peace and justice <p> Image : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , provide access to justice for all and build effective , accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels . <p> Education is an essential precursor to peace , tolerance and a healthy civil society . <p> Studies have shown that people with secondary educations are more likely than those with only primary education to show tolerance for people who speak another language ( a 21% difference in Latin America and 34% among Arab States ) , immigrants ( 26% and 16% , respectively ) , homosexuals ( 32 and 1% ) , people of a different religion ( 39% and 14% ) , people with HIV ( 45% and 12% ) and people of a different race ( 47% and 28% ) <p> We also know that literate people are more likely to participate in the democratic process and exercise their civil rights , and that , if the enrollment rate for secondary schooling is 10 percentage points higher than the average , the risk of war is reduced by about three percentage points . <h> #17 Partnerships for the goals <p> Image : Global Citizen <p> Strengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . <p> Partnerships are proven to be a most effective way to achieve strong development outcomes . <p> The Global Partnership for Education is a prominent example of how working in a collaborative partnership can enhance progress in education and in the other development sectors . The partnership model of the Global Partnership for Education mobilizes and aligns donor financing behind national education plans that are based on needs assessments and evidence- based policy making . <p> It coordinates the work of all internal and external actors that play a role in that process . When the most important players work together , we see greater efficiencies and impacts with the available resources . And we see real progress in countries that are hungry to bring quality education to their children and move ever closer to the global goal of education for all . <p> As the U.N .

Similar models might prove useful in other areas . " <p> The Global Partnership for Education brings together developing country partners , donors , multilateral agencies , Civil Society Organizations , the private sector and private foundations , to achieve the common goal of getting all children into school for a quality education .

Composed of Sunni Muslims , the group broke with Al Qaeda 's core leadership in Pakistan with the purpose of building a strict Islamic state in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Islamic religious law . <p> The group initially failed in this target . However , when the 2011 Syrian Civil War broke out , many Isis fighters relocated to the neighbouring country and joined with Syrians and other foreign fighters in the struggle against the Syrian government . From within this union of fighters , a larger group was formed , united with the vision of creating a transnational Islamic state across both Syria and Iraq . <p> Isis , which has been described as the richest terror group on earth , generates its own income . It achieves this by having taken control of local businesses , taxing others , and making money from oil sales on the open market . Additionally , the collapse of Iraqi security forces in the north of the country in early June 2014 has meant that Isis has been able to collect more money as well as a variety of weaponry . The group has also allegedly looted more than $400 million in cash from banks in the city of Mosul in northern Iraq . This has strengthened its ability to recruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track record of extreme brutality and has allegedly been involved in prisoner executions , massacres and the cutting off of hands of Syrians for petty offenses in the areas it controls . <p> WHAT HAS HAPPENED ? <p> ISIS , now running large parts of Iraq , has cemented its control of the country 's western borders by taking control over a key town , its airport and important trade and transport crossings to neighbouring Jordan . <p> The group has also taken the Al-Waleed border crossing with Syria and Iraq 's second city " Mosul , forcing 500,000 residents to flee . Additionally , after a ten day siege , Isis captured the country 's main oil refinery at Baiji , north of Baghdad . This refinery supplies a third of Iraq 's refined fuel and as a result , the battle has already led to petrol rationing . <p> Consequently , Isis now controls considerable territory in eastern Syria and western and central Iraq , in a campaign to set up an Islamic state straddling the border . They have also taken further steps to win over citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes and giving money and medicine to hospitals . At the same time , an ultra-strict version of Islamic law has been implemented . <p> This has resulted in the Iraqi central government now having little or no presence on its western borders , with just one border crossing with Syria left . They have been able to slow the militants ' advance on the capital Baghdad , partly by calling on the support of local allies including Shia militias , the Kurdish peshmerga forces as well as taking advice from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard . However , this has only intensified divisions within the country . <p> Not only has the UN human rights team in Iraq reported more than 1,000 people killed in Iraq this month ( the vast majority of them civilians ) ; Isis ' advance has led to mass internal displacement within the country . High casualty rates and the displacement of civilians can have devastating knock on effects on the social and economic development of the country . Dispersed internal labour forces can radically disturb domestic production and exports , leading to low-economic productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ; production has already been affected by the takeover of the Baiji refinery , however , if the country collapses and fragments , it could destabilise the rest of the Middle East which could lead to further conflict . This will only slow production further affecting the economies and growth of these countries due to lost revenue from the region 's largest export . <p> Disruption to oil production in Iraq and the wider region could also distress the world market leading to price fluctuations ; this is worrying as the rest of the world is still very dependent on Middle Eastern oil . There are today only about 80 days of reserves worldwide , down from a peak of more than 100 days . <p> Alongside the disruption that conflict brings to the physical and human infrastructure of a country , economic fluctuations can affect positive gains made in poverty eradication . With approximately 25% of Iraq 's population living in poverty , this conflict could dramatically hinder poverty reduction plans by re-allocating time , money and concentration on addressing the conflict and peace-building strategies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lose their assets and access vital services . <p> This latest development in Iraq is also a huge set-back for the formation of nationhood within the country " this is a necessity for the promotion of inclusive and good governance as well as democratisation . The fragmentation and division of the state has further undermined the legitimacy of the Iraqi government in Baghdad . The state has long been perceived as risky place for investment by the international community and consequently , this latest conflict will only intensify this perception leading to a shortage of pro-growth investment within the country .
