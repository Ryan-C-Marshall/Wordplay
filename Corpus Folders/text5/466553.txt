The building stands on a base of two steps ; above it there are three floors of arcades and a fourth storey without arches but with small rectangular windows . There were eighty arches on every floor , divided by pillars with a half column ( see the picture on the right ) . <p> The four arches on the axes of the building were the main entrances , and were probably decorated with a little porch and a statue . The other 76 arches were numbered for an easier access to the seats . Only 31 arches of the outer ring , from number XXIII to LIV , have remained intact . All around the rims of the first three floors there were circular promenades that could accommodate most of the public in case of rain . <p> The Colosseum includes all the ancient architectural " orders " , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of the ground floor half columns is the Tuscan one ( a Roman variation of the Doric order ) , on the second floor the semicolumns are Ionic and on the third floor Corinthian . The panels of the fourth floor - the attic - are divided by flat composite ( Roman-Corinthian ) lesenes in place of the half-columns of the lower arcades , with a rectangular window every second panel . Ancient authors mention - and the images that we have confirm it - that a series of bronze shields ( clipea ) was affixed all around the attic on the panels between the windows . <p> The arches are 4.20 metres ( 13 ? 9 " ) wide and 7.05 m ( 23 ? 1 " ) high on the ground floor , while on the upper floors they are only 6.45 m ( 21 ? 2 " ) high . Including the cornices between the floors and the attic , the overall height of the building is 48,5 m . <p> The arena where the shows took place measures 76 by 44 metres ; its floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a wall called podium , about 10 feet high , whose scanty remains do not allow for a precise reconstruction . During the shows the arena covered with yellow sand ( harena ) taken from the hill of Monte Mario ; on special occasions the arena was covered with specially coloured sand , or mixed with speckles of glittering minerals . <p> Over 100.000 cubic metres of travertine stone ( 45.000 only for the external wall ) , quarried near Tibur ( today Tivoli ) , were used . A road was built from the quarries to Rome for this purpose . A similar quantity of tuff blocks , bricks and opus cementicium ( concrete made of small lumps of tuff in mortar ) were also used , thus adapting the resistance of the materials to the loads and thrust that had to be supported . The combination of different materials improves the elasticity of the whole : the main pillars are made of travertine , radial walls are of travertine and tuff , the vaults are cast in cement work , and the walls were plastered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared ) . The passages corresponding to the main entrances were decorated with paintings and stuccoes , which have barely survived the centuries . The travertine blocks were connected by iron grips that were removed a long time ago , leaving those ugly holes between the blocks . It has been calculated that 300 tons of metal were used only to this purpose . <p> Like every amphitheatre , the Colosseum had two entrances to the arena on the main axis : the NW gate was the Porta Triumphalis , where the gladiators made their entrance during the pompa gladiatoria , the parade that took place outside and led to the amphitheatre . The SE gate was called Porta Libitinaria ( from Libitina , a Roman goddess of death , corpses and funerals ) , as dead gladiators were carried through it . All around the top there were sockets for 240 wooden beams which supported the awning ( velarium ) that covered the spectators from the sun and was manoeuvred by a unit of sailors of the imperial fleet , stationed nearby . Some of the sockets are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area paved with large travertine slabs and delimited by boundary stones set in the ground with a slight inclination inwards , which are thought to have been supports of some sort for the ropes of the awning ( or perhaps gates for crowd control ) . Beyond these stones began the street paving of big gray blocks of basaltic lava . <p> The square around the Colosseum is probably one of the few places in Rome that is at the same level as the ancient times . Remember that Rome is about 2600 years old , and that during all this time layers and layers of buildings and roads have accumulated . The level of the ancient city is about 8-15 metres below the current one . Since the birth of Rome , the average annual growth of the city has been calculated at about 7.5 millimetres per year . But there , when you walk on the cobblestones around the Colosseum you are walking on the same stones the ancient Romans walked on . Click here for a page of maps of the area during the centuries . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the outer wall is still standing ( including 31 of the original 80 entrances , together with the part of the building that is between it and the inner wall supporting the top floor colonnade ) and practically the whole skeleton of the structure between this inner wall and the arena , that is , the encircling and radiating walls on which rested the cavea with its marble seats , that instead have disappeared . <p> Inside The cavea seats were made in travertine , but now the seats are almost completely lost . The cavea was divided into three parts called , from bottom to top , podium , gradatio and porticus . In major amphitheatres , like the Colosseum , the gradatio was divided horizontally into different levels ( maeniana ) by praecinctiones ( corridors ) , and vertically into cunei ( sectors ) by the scalaria , the steps leading to the vomitoria , the entrances . Upon entering , the spectators had to present a tessera , a tablet that reported the cuneus , gradus and locus of their seat . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , row 4 , sector 3 . <p> A section of the cavea was reconstructed during the 30s and fitted with some seats found in the excavations . However , it seems that the reconstruction is not faithful at all , as on that part of the terraces there were only three wide step where the Senators placed their personal seats ( subsellia ) . The arena floor was made of wooden planks supported by brick pillars ; some sections of the floor were removable or could slide down the underground , so that the scenarios , animals and people could emerge from beneath . <p> In Domitian times , some years after the inauguration of the amphitheatre , was built under the arena a complex system of walls that supported the wooden floor of the harena and organised the underground spaces that were used as a backstage for the shows . It is not easy today to understand the specific purpose of the underground spaces , which are now only partially visible , as recently a part of the arena deck was reconstructed by the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Roma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration with the German Archaeological Institute ( see details ) . It is easy to imagine that in the underground spaces there were all the services necessary to the shows : equipment , machines , costumes , cages for the animals , storage . All around the underground , along the wall , there were lifts that could raise the animals to the level of the arena . <p> The podium was the terrace immediately around the arena . In the Colosseum it was raised about 10 feet above it . Part of the floor of the arena was made of masonry and part of wood , with removable sections for the entrance/exit of scenarios , beasts and materials . There were marble decorations around the podium , at the entrances ( vomitoria ) that gave on to the cavea for the passage of the public , and perhaps also on the niches beside the main entrances on the arena . <p> Under the arena there were all the services necessary for the shows : cages for the animals , stores , tools , and lifts that raised the beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When wild beasts were in the amphitheatre a fence was erected all around the podium . The fence had wooden rollers on top , in order to prevent the beasts from climbing over . Inside , the seating has a gradient of 37 , and the overall height of 48.5 m ( 159 ? ) was calculated to give a good view of the arena even to the spectators in the upper seats . <p> The corridors and stairs were planned in order to allow the public , calculated between 50.000 and 75.000 , swift access and exit and to keep the different classes of spectators separated . The two main entrances on the short axis led directly to the central boxes , while a series of obligatory pathways , symmetrically repeated in each quadrant of the stand , led the other spectators to their assigned places . <p> Between the arena and the podium there was a service tunnel , with niches . Their function is uncertain ; some say they housed archers who protected the spectators from the risk of wild animals reaching the public , some say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water channel meant to give supplementary protection from the beasts . In any case , it seems that these niches could be reached only through some entrances located in the fourth ring of the cavea , accessible only to service personnel .

@@47389001 @889001/ <h> M A T E R I A L S <p> Several materials were employed for the building of the Colosseum , all of them easily found or produced in the Roman area : first of all there is the travertino , a limestone , then tuff for the other pillars and radial walls , tiles for the floors of the upper storeys and the walls ; finally , concrete ( a.k.a. cement ) for the vaults . <p> Travertine , a limestone that the Romans called lapis Tiburtinus , is a sedimentary stone made essentially of calcite , deposited by calcareous waters .

The stone can stand a pressure of 226/298 Kg/cmq , depending on its quality .

Its colour is gray , yellowish , greenish or brown . It is used in the preparation of special cements and as a building stone ( peperino ) . <p> Tiles and bricks were produced with clay mixed with water and often with sand , straw and finely ground pozzolana . The mixture was pressed by hand into a wooden mould , and dried first in the sun . The tiles had to be turned over often , so as that they would not bend . After a long time of drying under cover , the tiles were placed in the oven and baked at 800C . They were produced in standard sizes ( full and hollow bricks , tiles for roofs etc ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as filling , often by using the leftovers of former works . <p> Roman Cement ( most of the info from Benjamin Herring " The secrets of Roman Concrete " ? Constructor , Sept. 2002 ? in http : //www.romanconcrete.com/ ) Cement , or concrete , is a building material with a binding agent , usually produced by mixing finely ground limestone and clay . It reacts to water by forming a cement that hardens to the consistency of stone . When mixed with sand , small stones or pebbles takes the name of concrete aggregate ( or beton ) . <p> Mortar ( malta ) is a mix of a binding agent ( calcia , cement ) and water ( malta semplice ) or with water and sand ( m. composta ) . It hardens when exposed to air ( malta aerea ) and also in water ( malta idraulica ) . <p> Lime is a binding agent that Romans obtained by heating limestone ? which contains calcium , carbon and oxygen - in a kiln . Limestone undergoes a chemical reaction in which the carbon and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving a highly reactive product known as quicklime , or calcium oxide . Quicklime in water starts a bubbling , heat-producing chemical reaction which yields a white colloidal paste , called hydrated lime or slaked lime . In chemical terms : CaCO3 ? calcium carbonate ? when heated becomes CaO and liberates CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) . CaO + water H2O becomes Ca(OH)2 , that is calcium idroxide ( slaked or hydrated lime ) . Concrete is produced by mixing that paste with river sand or pozzolana . The quicklime was converted into lime paste by immersing it in water . By adding water to the lime , Romans produced : <p> lime putty , thick and greasy ; used as a binder for the cement ; <p> lime milk , with 20/30% of water , used for the paints ; <p> lime water , clear and disinfectant , used for medicinal purposes . <p> A few more words on Roman Cement Romans had two distinct types of concrete mortar . One was made with simple lime and river sand , mixed at a ratio of three parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pozzolana instead of river sand and was mixed at a ratio of two parts pozzolana to one part lime . There was no doubt as to which was superior : the pozzolanic mortar . Pozzolana , the vulcanic ashes ( pulvis puteolana in Latin ) took its name from the Pozzuoli region by the Bay of Naples , where it was found , and it was a truly magical substance . Vitruvius , an engineer and architect for the Emperor Augustus , wrote 10 books on architecture and engineering . He devotes an entire chapter in his second book to pozzolana , stating that " there is also a kind of powder which from natural causes produces astonishing results . It is found in the neighbourhood of Baiae and in the country belonging to the towns round about Mount Vesuvius . This substance , when mixed with lime and rubble , not only lends strength to buildings of other kinds , but even when piers of it are constructed in the sea , they set hard under water . " Scientists today know exactly what Vitruvius ? s " powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in prodigious abundance . What is the secret of the special ingredient ? Let ? s begin by looking at the modern technical definition of pozzolana , which is : A siliceous or aluminous material which in itself possesses no cementitious value , but will , in a finely divided form , and in the presence of moisture , chemically react with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperatures to form compounds possessing cementitious properties . Translated : by using volcanic ash in the place of river sand in their concrete , the Romans were anticipating the process by which modern Portland cement chemically bonds lime to clay through the application of heat . But finely divided pozzolana must be amorphous ( glassy ) to chemically react . How was this possible ? Because the volcano had already heated the pozzolana for them ! In the words of Tim Dolen , a pozzolana expert and research civil engineer at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation , " the pozzolana was calcined by the volcano , " enabling it to chemically react with calcium hydroxide in slaked lime , no heating required .

@@47389003 @889003/ <h> M A R T Y R I V M <p> Were Christians ever tortured and killed in the Colosseum ? <p> The answers seems to be no . The original sources on the amphitheatre are very few , and a connection between Christian martyrdom and the Colosseum still has to be found , though the Church for many years has credited the story of Christian martyrs finding death in the arena ( something similar happened , but it was in Gallia ) . On the subject I prefer to quote the Catholic Encyclopedia on the net . Entry : Colosseum , or ... Coliseum <p> THE COLISEUM AND THE MARTYRSPope St. Pius ( 1566-72 ) is said to have recommended persons desirous of obtaining relics to procure some sand from the arena of the Coliseum , which , the pope declared , was impregnated with the blood of martyrs . The opinion of the saintly pontiff , however , does not seem to have been shared by his contemporaries . The practical Sixtus V ( 1585-90 ) was only prevented by death from converting the Coliseum into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little the Coliseum as a place consecrated by the blood of Christian martyrs that he authorized its use for bullfights . Nevertheless from the middle of the seventeenth century the conviction attributed to St. Pius V gradually came to be shared by the Romans . A writer named Martinelli , in a work published in 1653 , put the Coliseum at the head of a places sacred to the martyrs . Cardinal Carpegna ( d. 1679 ) was accustomed to stop his carriage when passing by the Coliseum and make a commemoration of the martyrs . But it was the act of Cardinal Altieri , referred to above , which indirectly effected a general change of public opinion in this regard . A pious personage , Carlo Tomassi by name , aroused by what he regarded as desecration , published a pamphlet calling attention to the sanctity of the Coliseum and protesting against the intended profanation authorized by Altieri . The pamphlet was so completely successful that four years later , the jubilee year of 1675 , the exterior arcades were closed by order of Clement X ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instance of St. Leonard of Port Maurice , Benedict XIV ( 1740-58 ) erected Stations of the Cross in the Coliseum , which remained until February , 1874 , when they were removed by order of Commendatore Rosa . St. Benedict Joseph Labre ( d. 1783 ) passed a life of austere devotion , living on alms , within the walls of the Coliseum . " Pius VII in 1805 , Leo XII in 1825 , Gregory XVI in 1845 , and Pius IX in 1852 , contributed liberally to save the amphitheatre from further degradation , by supporting the fallen portions with great buttresses " ( Lanciani ) . Thus at a moment when the Coliseum stood in grave danger of demolition it was saved by the pious belief which placed it in the category of monuments dearest to Christians , the monuments of the early martyrs . Yet , after an exhaustive examination of the documents in the case , the learned Bollandist , Father Delehave , S.J. , arrives at the conclusion that there are no historical grounds for so regarding it ( op. cit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the sanctuaries of the martyrs were looked upon with so great veneration , the Coliseum was completely neglected ; its name never occurs in the itineraries , or guide-books , compiler for the use of pilgrims to the Eternal City . The " Mirabilia Romae " , the first manuscripts of which date from the twelfth century , cites among the places mentioned in the " Passions " of the martyrs the Circus Flaminius ad pontem Judaeorum , but in this sense makes no allusion to the Coliseum . We have seen how for more than a century it served as a stronghold of the Frangipani family ; such a desecration would have been impossible had it been popularly regarded as a shrine consecrated by the blood , not merely of innumerable martyrs , but even of one hero of the Faith . The intervention of Eugenius IV was based altogether on patriotism ; as an Italian the pope could not look on passively while a great memorial of Rome 's past was being destroyed . " Nam demoliri urbis monumenta nihil aliud est quam ipsius urbis et totius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages no tradition existed in Rome which associated the martyrs in any way with the Coliseum ; it was only in the seventeenth century and in the manner indicated , that it came to he regarded with veneration as a scene of early Christian heroism . Indeed , little attention was paid by the Christians of the first age to the actual place of a martyr 's sufferings ; the sand stained with his blood was , when possible gathered up and treasured as a precious relic , but that was all . The devotion of the Christian body centred wholly around the place where the martyr was interred . Father Delehaye calls attention to the fact that although we know from trust-worthy historical sources of the execution of Christians in the garden of Nero , yet popular tradition preserved no recollection of all event so memorable ( op. cit. , 37 ) . The Acts of Roman Martyrs , it is true , contain indications as to the places where various martyrs suffered : in amphitheatro , in Tellure , etc . But these Acts are often merely pious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up by unknown writers on a feast reliable historical facts . The decree formerly attributed to Pope Gelasius ( 492-96 ) bears witness to the slight consideration in which this class of literature was held in the Roman Church ; to read it in the churches was forbidden , and it was attributed to unknown writers , wholly unqualified for their self-imposed task ( secundum antiquam consuetudinem , leguntur , quia et eorum qui conscripsere nomina penitus ignorantur , et ab infidelibus et idiotis superflua aut minus apta quam rei ordo fuerit esse putantur. -- Thiel . Epist . Rom . Pont. , I , 458 ) . The evidence , therefore , which we possess in the Roman Acts in favour of certain martyrs suffering in the Coliseum is , for these reasons among others , regarded by Father Delehaye as inconclusive . He does not deny that there may have been martyrs who suffered in the Coliseum , but we know nothing on the subject one way or the other . ( Je ne veux pas nier qu'il y ait eu des martyrs de l'amphithTGtre Flavien ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a eu , et en tout cas leurs noms nous sont inconnus. --Op. cit. , 37 . ) It is , of course , probable enough that some of the Christians condemned ad bestias suffered in the Coliseum , but there is just as rnuch reason to suppose that they met their death in one of the other places dedicated to the cruel amusements of imperial Rome ; for instance , in the Circus Flaminius , the Gaianum , the Circus of Hadrian , the Amphitheatrum Castrense , and the Stadium of Domitian . Even as regards St. Ignatius of Antioch , the evidence that he was martyred in the Coliseum is far from decisive , the terms employed by St. John Chrysostom and Evagrius in reference to this matter convey no precise meaning ( Delehaye , op. cit. 43 ) . The same is true of the term used by Theodoret in reference to the death of St. Telemachus , who sacrificed his life to put an end to the bloody spectacles which , as late as the early fifth century , took place in Rome . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Telemachus , but there is , on the other hand , no clear proof that its scene was the Coliseum .

As everybody knows , two-thirds of the city of Rome were destroyed by a great fire in 64 AD . Nero used most of this land as a site for his new palace . It was not so much a palace as a series of buildings scattered over a landscaped " countryside " which included an artificial lake . The main building was extravagantly crafted , and boasted rooms and hallways decorated almost entirely in gold .

Among the other things there was an amphitheatre , a market , and bath-gymnasium complex , served by an aqueduct 75 Km ( 50 miles ) long . Baths were served by a flow of both salted water and sulphurous one from the Albulae springs near Tivoli . Upon the Caelian Hill there were beautiful gardens , zoos , woods and parks where all kinds of animals roamed . There were hundreds of statues , grottoes , fountains , nymphaeums , porticoes painted with romantic landscapes ; multiple waterfalls flowed all over .

How do we know this ? It is an interesting story . When the arena was unearthed in the XIX century archaeologists found fragments of a long inscription ( CIL , VI , 32085 ) commemorating the repairs made to the amphitheatre by emperors Theodosius II and Valentinian III ( Western Roman Emperor from 425 to 455 ) . The inscription , carved on marble blocks , consisted of one line of text repeated twice all around the arena , so that the spectators could read it completely from any point of the terraces . We have only a few letters left of the inscription ( see picture on the right ) . This inscription , however , had been carved on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The discovery of other fragments and a more careful reading of the erased letters allowed deciphering most of the first text . AndrT Chastagnol , French historian and epigraphist , found out that some words of the older text could be related to the age of co-rulers Honorius and Theodosius II ( between 408 and 423 ) . Since these emperors are defined invictissimi ( never defeated ) and this word was used elsewhere in 416-417 to celebrate Honorius ' victory against the Vandals , it is reasonable that the inscription dates back to those years . There 's more : the fragments of the words " Vale- " and " -cius " have been attributed to the name of the Praefectus Urbi Iunius Valerius Bellicius , the only one of that age whose name matched with these letters . And we also have more information : two inscriptions mention the same Valerius as the one who repaired some of the Prefecture buildings . The recent re composition of the word " area " suggests that the repairs regarded also the surrounding area , which is consistent with the archaeological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscription are still being discussed , as basically there are too few fragments to decipher other words . <p> In any case this first inscription did n't last for long . After a few years the blocks were removed and repositioned with the second text ( CIL , VI , 32086-87 ) commemorating further repairs . ( We know that the blocks were actually removed because the letters of the new text are placed upside down on some of them . As we know , the epigraphists dated this second inscription back to the age of Theodosius II and Valentinian III , i.e. between 425 and 455 , when they were emperors respectively of the Eastern Empire and of the Western one , because they reconstructed the words of the conventional phrase " Pro felicitate dd . nn . Theodosii et Placidi Valentiniani perpetuorum invictissimorum principum " ( =to the prosperity of our masters Theodosius and Placidus Valentinian , forever invincible emperors ) . <p> In the text is also mentioned one " Flavius Pa- " .

But it could have been also another unknown person who later on repaired the amphitheatre after it was hit by another tremendous earthquake in 443 , when many buildings in Rome were destroyed . This last hypothesis was until now prevalent , but the recent discoveries make it less probable . In this latter case Flavius Pa- could have acted together with Praefectus Urbi Rufius Cecina Felix Lampadius , who is mentioned in another inscription . <p> The Lampadius inscription <p> Rufius Cecina Felix Lampadius Between 425 and 450 , probably after the 443 earthquake , Lampadius carried out more restoration works on the arena , the podium and on the terraces at his own expense , as he had inscribed on the marble .

We already know the dd . nn . " Theodosii et Placidi Valentiniani " phrase . The scholars are debating the exact meaning of posticis : service doors ? Fake doors for the bestiarii to escape the wild beasts ? Another puzzling question : in October 444 , one year after the earthquake , Valentinian III celebrated his vicennalia ( 20 years of rule ) . How could they have repaired the amphitheatre in such a short time ? However , this particular Lampadius inscription is also important because it had been carved on a slab that had a former inscription made of bronze letters . These letters left holes in the marble and these holes were deciphered in 1995 . It was found that the bronze inscription commemorated the original dedication of the amphitheatre by Vespasian , with the confirmation that the Colosseum was built with the spoils of war , i.e. the booty of the Palestinian war and the plundering of the Temple of Jerusalem .

@@47389007 @889007/ <h> BUILDING STRATEGY <p> Building strategy An approximate estimate of the workers necessary to build the amphitheatre , in the brief span of time confirmed by historical documents , concluded that their number was so great that it could have been impossible for them to be occupied on the surface of the amphitheatre at the same time . We can see now how this was made possible . In analysing the structures of the monument I was attracted by the singular arrangement of some travertine pillars embedded in the radial walls . Also Choisy had noticed these pillars , but he could not draw a conclusion about their actual function . ... If we examine the arrangement of the structures in travertine we can see that on the ground floor the radial walls that go from the external corridor to the arena , embed , in their part built with big blocks , four travertine pillars The filling between these four pillars , that reach the second floor and end just beneath the cavea , has been made with square tufa blocks on the ground floor and with cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second floor . <p> In these radial walls the travertine pillars are connected at the top by large arches made by bipedali bricks , about two feet ( 60 cm ) tall , arranged to allow the building of many " volte rampanti " , vaults supported by walls , that all together constitute the great funnel , or cavea , destined to support the marble seats for the public . <p> The travertine pillars ( left ) <p> Now , almost all these large arches show a striking external arrangement : the way they end up near the edge of the travertine pillars would lead one to think that there is no supporting surface . If this had been true , then the existence of the arches and the corresponding travertine pillars would not be justified . Instead , an accurate investigation , carried out where the arch has disappeared , or where a part of the facing is missing , has revealed the existence of a supporting impost emerging from the sides of one of the travertine blocks placed in the upper part of each pillar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensured support and stability to the arch . . A second finding followed the first one : the tufa structures of opus quadratum and the upper ones of bricks , that fill up the spaces between the travertine pillars ( and that , together with the pillars , constitute the radial walls of the amphitheatre ) can be considered as completely independent from the pillars and from the upper big arches , therefore built after them , at a later time . This possibility is made more evident by the great facility of working the tufa stone , and by the renowned ability of the Romans in executing the opus quadratum . <p> The image on the right ( taken from Cozzos book ) shows how the travertine blocks of the external facade , with sculpted half columns , have been sometimes mounted overlooking the best practice ( i.e. placing blocks of the same size one on top of the other ) , perhaps with the intent to speed up the completion or to optimise the use of the stones . <p> On the ground floor , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also some projections and hollows so as to ensure the grip with the tufa opus quadratum structure , nothing excludes that this opus quadratum was built independently from the rising of the pillars . Actually , this independence is demonstrated by a certain length of a radial wall , in which the base of the opus quadratum is completely independent from the base of the travertine pillars . Though this independence does not result at first sight equally evident in all the radial walls of the ground floor , we can be completely assured of its existence by a great lot of little details that can not escape a careful investigation . On the other hand , it is sufficient to demonstrate it in some points , in order to accept it for the rest of the building . On the second floor of the amphitheatre this independence between the travertine pillars and the tufa or brick walls is demonstrated beyond any discussion by photographic evidence . Now , the task of these big arches would not be comprehensible if they had been executed directly over the walls below ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been absurd to make load bearing arches to reduce the little weight of the vaults making up the cavea . <p> The vaulted arches ( left ) <p> It is therefore clear the genial concept behind the building of the amphitheatre . The travertine pillars , in the area behind the cavea , were in a first moment completely isolated , then they were connected into a single organism by the arches , and in a first phase both pillars and arches supported , like an independent skeleton , the vaults supporting the cavea , before the gaps between the pillars were filled up with masonry . The dimensions of these pillars and their construction were perfectly compliant with the load assigned to them and to their function , a thing that reveals a real ingenuity of the ancient Romans in building and organising.This building procedure , both simple and evident , allowed to build very quickly the big cavea and to shelter the walkways on the second floor ; at the same time it allowed for the coexistence of two vast building yards on the same site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered from the rain , and a second upper one , above the cavea , working on the upper part of the amphitheatre . Below , in the construction sites under coverage , were completed all the walls between the travertine pillars , the rampant bridging of the stairs , the vaults of the ground floor walkways , the plastering and the stuccoes . Above , work could be carried out on the walls of the remaining two floors of the amphitheatre , the podium , the seats , and the wooden upper portico.It is singular that this system recalls a scheme of caging frequent in the Roman provinces of Africa , e.g. in Timgad , with networks of stone pillars and beams . The system survived in the Middle Ages in an interesting form in the so-called Torri Pisane , of the XII century , where the stone pillars , the gothic arches and the beams in the middle constitute a frame for the brick filling of the walls . There the same concept is inspired to a similar purpose : separating the skeleton from the filling so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building site , creating a big surface of superimposed floors , dividing and attacking the work from more points.We find today the very same concept in the recent buildings made with concrete and steel that represent the latest novelty of rapidity in modern construction . So , the rise of the highest skyscrapers in North America was achieved so quickly to that we are in amazement just like when we think of the building of the Colosseum. 
@@47389008 @889008/ <h> L O C A <p> For the Romans the games were n't just a moment of leisure , but were also an occasion in which people , institutions and the powers congregated . Valerius Maximus tells that Senators and the common people , at least up to the year 560 b.C. , assisted to the shows together , standing . Later on the division deepened , and the amphitheatre reflected this new order . Roman society was tightly divided into classes , and this separation was observed also on occasion of the games . However , in the arena-mania that developed in Rome , the amphitheatre became the place were the common folks could meet the upper class - even the emperor - and sometimes could address him directly . The story of the emperors ' relations with the arena is long and interesting , and it will appear on this site as soon as possible . The games were strictly reserved to the citizens ( slaves were n't admitted ) , but tickets were not on sale ; instead , institutions , brotherhoods , sisterhoods , companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et cetera had their places assigned in the amphitheatre , as a consequence of the role and the rank they had in the society . The ones who did not fit the above description tried to find a protector that could grant them the privilege of a seat by invitation . This custom lasted for a long time : only after the 4th century AD some seats started to be inscribed with the names of families , or of single senators . <p> In amphitheatres , circuses and theatres each rank was assigned a certain seating , which was considered a prized privilege . We know that in 490 BC Manius Valerius Maximus got the right , valid also for all his descendants , to place his seat in a particular place of the Circus Maximus . Scipio the African proposed in 194 BC that the senators , as such , had seats separated from those of the commoners . Around 90 BC Sulla allowed the women in the theatres . In 87 BC the Lex Roscia Theatralis assigned to the knights the first 14 rows of seats ( XIV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and strongly opposed this measure , so much that some think that this law was not enforced in amphitheatres . <p> The spectators had to dress up : the citizens who were entitled to it had to wear the toga , the robe Romans wore on the great occasions ( Martial , IV , 2 ) . Citizens who did not enjoy good reputation - bankrupts and profligate - were destined to sit with the plebs at the top , but in ancient times even unaccompanied women were allowed . Alcohol was forbidden : people were not supposed to drink alcohol during the games , and the writer Lampridius criticized the emperor Commodus because he used to drink in the amphitheatre . For more info on the practical organisation see this page . <p> On the day of the games people came very early , and sometimes even slept out of the amphitheatre . To enter , the spectators had to produce to the designatores , the ushers , a tessera , an invitation . The tessera - like today 's tickets - reported the exact location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , row and seat ) . For example , CVN III GRAD IV LOC I corresponds to sector 3 , row 4 , seat 1 . It seems , however , that if one spectator left his seat during the day he lost his right to it ( Quintilianus , l.VI , c . III ) . Each locus was identified by lines cut in the seats . People sat on wooden planks placed on the marble stones , but the elite could be more comfortable : the senators had cushions at first , then they were allowed chairs called curules , and cushions were accorded to the equites . <p> We have a list of many institutions that had places assigned in the cavea : the tribuni and their viatores(summoners) , the religious collegia ( that were 8 : Pontifices , Viri Epulones , Augures , Fetiales , Arvales , XV Viri Sacris Faciundis , Sodales Titii and Salii ) , the semi-official collegia ( Lupercorum , Mercurialum , Capitolinorum , Veneris Genetricis , Minervae ) , the sodalitates ( kind of private religious associations : Sodales Matris Magnae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the praetextati ( the toga praetexta was the garment , bordered with purple , worn at Rome by the higher magistrates and by free-born children till they assumed the toga virilis ) . There was place also for the kids from the nobiliores et honestiores familiae ( distinguished and honorable families ) , and their teachers . The poor - and the women after Augustus - had to go up to the top , in the porticus , and they participated to the games under the banner of their tribes ( yes : Roman citizens first and then the citizens from the surrounding regions were organised in tribes , that were basically the voting constituencies ) , furtherly divided by their civil state ( married/unmarried ) . At some point between 20 and 17 BC , Augustus introduced the Lex Iulia Theatralis , which brought order in this matter by regulating minutely the seating arrangement of all the classes in public places like theatres , amphitheatres and circuses . Of course the senators had the seats nearest to the action , then came the knights , military men , married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plebs . He also banned women from public spectacles , and these rules were enforced all over the Empire . <p> As Jonathan Edmonson wrote , " the full complexity of the social distinctions laid down in the Lex Iulia Theatralis became permanently enshrined in the seating plan of the Colosseum . Like all amphitheatres , it was planned to keep the different classes of spectators separated . They had different entrances and seats in the cavea . The entrance on the north side seems to have been connected with the Esquiline by a porticus . A wide passage led directly from this entrance to the imperial box ( pulvinar ) on the podium . A corresponding box on the opposite side of the podium was probably reserved for the Praefectus Urbi . The entrances at the ends of the major axis led directly into the arena .

In the proceedings of 80AD there is a description of the spaces reserved to the Arvales in the different sectors of the Colosseum ( in fact reserved to their friends , clientes and servants , since the 12 Arvales were probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centuries have tried to interpreted this writing , as it is difficult to explain the meaning of the digits , leaving alone the correspondence with a number of seats . According to modern interpretations of the stone , the Arvales had in total about 130 ft , corresponding to 37 metres . Considering 40-50 cm for each person , the Arvales could accommodate 70-80 people . Places were highly sought after , and we can imagine that the popularity of the Emperor Trajan reached a peak when - not long before the year 100 - he demolished the imperial tribune and donated 500 seats to the people , as an inscription reports . <p> Many fragments of the marble seats bear the indication of the class to which they were destined . Most of the fragments date back to the III or IV century , and some bear the names of Roman families and senators who were already known to the experts from different sources . Some fragments bear only the name of the family , and it seems that related families ( we would call them clans ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the community . When seats were assigned to a different person or family the inscription was erased and the new name engraved in the stone . A recent research on the fragments shows that one of the seats could have belonged to Iobius Philippus Ymelcho Valerius , perhaps the same Valerius who was consul in 521 , and this should prove that the amphitheatre was still in use in the VI century . <p> In the city of Rome , for the practical organisation of the games , the emperors set up in the first century an organisation for the production of the games . There was the Ratio a muneribus , a kind of Ministry of Games with organisational and financial powers over the venationes and the munera . The costumes and the pegmata , the machines that appeared on the arena from underground and instantly unfolded producing a scenery , were built , from the times of Vespasian to Hadrian , in the Summum Choragium on the Summa Sacra Via .

First of all , some enormous drains were built in order to ensure an adequate drainage towards the Circus Maximus ( a part of these drains was lost when the metro line was built ) . <p> After the area was completely drained , the excavation started , and it lasted until it reached the clay bed of the lake . In the firm clay bed an elliptical ring was excavated , 31 metres wide , 6 metres deep , with a perimeter of 530 metres . This enormous excavation was filled up with Roman cement , i.e. mortar made with pozzuolana and lime , mixed with coarse crushed stones . Layers and layers of mortar and stones were laid , and the concrete was compacted by hammering . It seems that on the SW side the clay bed was n't as firm as on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side collapsed first . <p> Then the foundation was raised for a further 6 metres , so that the thickness of this enormous doughnut is over 12 metres . All around the foundations a reinforcement brick wall was built , 3 metres wide and 6 metres deep , and a similar wall was built inside . On the internal brick wall were arranged 32 cells , that are visible all around the underground of the arena . <p> Drillings recently carried out have shown that , contrary to what Ingegner Cozzo thought ( and to what is still widely believed ) there is no underground storey of travertine arches beneath the ground floor . The only foundation is this formidable ring of cement , and the only underground arches at the bottom of the arena are the ones on the main axis . The drillings have demonstrated that the top of the foundation reaches up just beneath the ground floor . The foundation can be also seen from the so-called Passage of Commodus , a fifth tunnel decorated with stuccoes which was excavated after the Colosseum was completed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many buildings of the Domus Aurea ) and with these materials and earth , the valley was filled up to the level we see today .

These passages were made during the building of the foundations , by casting the concrete around a wooden boxing . Some remains of the boxing , which were made of non-seasoned oak timber , have been dated back - quite obviously - to about the year 70 AD . More large underground rooms , necessary for the services and the preparation of the shows , were made along the main axis . <p> Four plus one underground tunnels connected the amphitheatre to the surrounding buildings : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libitinaria ) , reached the Ludus Magnus , it was cleared by the French for 83 metres , then filled up again and it was interrupted by a modern drain in the 19th century . The one on the opposite end led to the Summum Choragium , where the scenarios and costumes of the shows were prepared before the place was occupied by the temple of Venus , and it was sliced by the works for the underground railway in the ' 40s . On the short axis , the eastern tunnel towards the Exquiline Hill , 2.95 metres wide , and the other one towards the Celium seems , quite surprisingly , have n't been explored yet . Near the tunnel on the side of the Celian Hill , a fifth passage , called " Passaggio di Commodo " , is believed to connect the amphitheatre and the imperial palace on the side of the Celian Hill .

@@47389016 @889016/ <h> E L L I P S E ? <p> The Colosseum is generally supposed to be elliptical , but the curve of the arena and of the remaining facade , which has now been measured to a high degree of accuracy , does not coincide exactly with a perfect ellipse . It is in fact an ovoid ( a polycentric curve , i.e. a curve with more than one centre ) , but very approximate to an ellipse . For centuries the experts have debated on the subject , trying to push one explanation or the other . <p> The matter is still very much debated ( see this very interesting forum in the Nexus Network Journal ) , because it also implies different interpretations of the geometric skill of the ancient Romans . Everybody admits that Romans could draw plans with polycentric curves . Apparently all amphitheatres are built like this . But what about the ellipse ? Did they know it ? And if they knew it , how could they construct one and draw it on the ground ? So there are quite a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a compass . Also , there are really esoteric explanations of the geometry of the Colosseum , like the triangle with proportions 3:4:5 ( which in the case of the Colosseum becomes 6:8:10 ) , or the Ippia trisector ... <p> Rationally , the solution should be found by measuring the building with a high degree of precision , but there are in fact many obstacles to it : the original small deviations of stones and brickwork from the plan ( that are natural with those materials ) , the adjustments made during the construction for the wider corridors on both axis , the general deformation of the structures , due to earthquakes , land movements etc. , then the ruined state of the stones , etc . So in practice there are small deviations from the ideal curve ( be it an ovoid or an ellipse ) , and nobody can demonstrate in full the validity of his theory . <p> Many are sure that the Romans knew how to draw an ellipse ; the Greeks before them had studied it since Archimedes ' time and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more difficult to draw it on the ground ( the sheer size of an amphitheatre makes a precise measuring quite complex ) , or maybe it did not make much sense to struggle with a perfect ellipse when a polycentric curve is much easier to draw , and the final result is in practice no different from an ellipse . In my modest opinion the polycentric curve makes more sense . First , it has been adopted for amphitheatres all over the Empire . Secondly , it is easy to draw with simple instruments that the gromatici ( land surveyors ) used every day to measure land and make plans for roads and buildings . Moreover , if a polycentric curve has a minimum number of centres ( say 4 ) it is almost indistinguishable from an ellipse . <p> The Polycentric curve According to the famous Colosseum expert , Ingegner Giuseppe Cozzo , the hypothesis is that the curve of the arena is a polycentric one , i.e. a curve composed of many different curves , whose centres are found by means of a geometric system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image &gt; ) : AB is the length of the arena , and BI is a constant measure , corresponding to the width of the building .

The line VM starts from the extreme V of the quadrant BOV , intersecting D. <p> Divide in 2 parts VD and find E. Draw the line EL intersecting C.

By very accurate measurements with modern means he noticed that there are small differences between the hypothetical curve as described by Cozzo and the real measurements of the amphitheatres , and has provided an explanation ( Unfortunately for you it is in Italian language .... ) Basically , Trevisan explains that the survey of the original structures excluded the shape of a four-centre oval and made more probable an eight-centres oval or an ellipse . He also proposes two building phases : a first " project " one in which the for-centre oval was used , and a second " executive " one in which the project was refined into a eight-centre oval or an ellipse . In practice , after the axes have been drawn , the difference between a four-centre and an eight-centre oval would be minimum . Moreover , this procedure would fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this would not be the first case in which ancient monuments present details not yet cleared completely , despite modern technologies . <p> Rosin - Trucco I will quote here one of the latest studies on the subject , by Paul Rosin and Emanuele Trucco : ... there is a large literature on how the Roman amphitheatres were designed and laid out . Many authors propose ovals constructed from circles in one form or another ( also known as polycentric arcs , or quadrarcs , four centered ovals , eight centered ovals , etc . ) . Examples , ranging over the last 200-300 years include : Fontana , Maffei , Devecchi , Guadet , Cozzo and Golvin . Others however put the case forward for the ellipse : Biradi , Michetti , Trevisan , de Rubertis and Sciacchitano . It is also possible that different schemes were used for different amphitheatres , for instance an ellipse for the small relatively crude amphitheatre at Pompeii , and polycentric ovals at most of the others . In the end Rosin and Trucco , who used the same data of Trevisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in my eyes ) mathemathical means , have to admit that " both models provide accurate matches to the data , but the ellipse always fits better . However , these differences are relatively small and subtle , and to determine if they are significant , the median test was applied to compare the distributions of residuals . It was found that the median test was unable to identify a statistically significant difference between the ellipse and the oval fits in most cases . " I bet that archaeologists will debate on this matter in the next century , too ( I 'm writing in 2004 ) .

Colosseum or Coliseum ( though in olden times Romans referred to it as Amphitheatrum Caesareum or hunting theatre ) , was built by the Flavian emperors Vespasian , Titus and Domitian between 71-72 and 80 AD as a gift to the Roman citizens in the place where the previous Emperor Nero ( 37-68 AD ) had his residence , the Domus Aurea . ( To see what was there befor Nero click here ) . <p> The city needed an amphitheatre , as the only one with a ( partially ) stone structure , which had been built by Statilius Taurus in 29 BC , was far too small . The emperor Caligula ( 12-41 AD ) had started the works for a new amphitheatre , but Claudius ( 10-54 AD ) stopped them when he came to power . Nero , too , refused to use the old Statilius ' building and preferred to have his own amphitheatre built in the Campus Martis . It was a beautiful one , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous fire of AD 64 . <p> Nero 's death in 68 AD marked the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty ; the Flavian family came to power .

So he gave back to the Romans most of the land that Nero had occupied in the centre of the city to make his residence , and had the amphitheatre - a public facility - built in the place where once there was a huge artificial pond , in the park of Nero 's residence . <p> It took about ten years to build the amphitheatre . Vespasian started the works in 72 AD and his son Titus ( that 's him smiling in the statue on the right ) dedicated it in the year 80 with magnificent games that lasted one hundred days .

The organization of the games , which involved great expenses , became a matter of public interest and was regulated by many laws . <p> The whole area around the amphitheatre was dedicated to the games ; near the Colosseum Domitian also built four ludi , the prisons where gladiators had their training . The bestiarii , who fought against the beasts , trained in the Ludus Matutinus , so called because the show with the animals was held in the morning .

The Colosseum became an enormous brazier that stopped burning only after the fuel was consumed .

Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus , also known as Heliogabalus or Elagabalus ( 203 222 ) started the works . The building - still unfinished - was reopened and dedicated to the gods in 222 under Alexander Severus , who ordered that the taxes paid by pimps , prostitutes and homosexuals would be destined to the repair of public buildings , among which the amphitheatre . Actually the repairs were completed only in 240 under Gordian III and a coin was minted for the occasion . Gordian wanted to celebrate in Rome a lavish triumph for his victory in the war against the Persians , and had collected 32 elephants , 10 elks , 10 tigers , 60 lions , 30 leopards , 10 hyenas , 1000 couples of gladiators from the imperial ludi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giraffes , 20 Asiatic wild asses , 40 wild horses and many other animals . <p> However , Gordian died in Persia in mysterious circumstances .

Roman sources on the contrary do not mention this battle and suggest that Gordian died somewhere else , upstream of the Euphrates . Philip , who succeeded Gordian as emperor , came to Rome and used all those animals . They were first exhibited and then killed on occasion of the shows organised for the millennium of the city : April 21 , 248 . <p> The amphitheatre was again damaged - according to some sources - during the reign of Decius ( 201251 ) or of Trebonianus Gallus ( 206253 ) . Decius led many persecutions against the Christians : among the victims were the bishop of Rome , Fabianus , and the future saints Ireneus , Abundius and Policronius . Two Persian subregoli ( vassals ) , Abdon and Sennen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the area between the Colosseum and the Meta Sudans , in the spot where a small church was later dedicated to them in the V century ; this church was still there in the XV century . <p> In 262 , during the reign of Gallienus ( 218-268 ) a violent earthquake devastated the Eastern Mediterranean ; also Rome was affected , so much that the following year a plague epidemic spread in the city . In 312 the Senate dedicated to the emperor Constantine the triumphal arch that is still standing near the Colosseum , and replaced the face of the Colossus with that of the new emperor . The head of Constantine was found in the XVI century between the pedestal of the statue and the Meta Sudans and it is now in the Capitoline Museums . In 320 the amphitheatre was again struck by lightning , but it was n't heavily damaged . From this date onwards no more fires are reported , but there have been many earthquakes . In 357 the emperor Constantius II ( 317-361 ) visited Rome and was very impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year described it as in very good conditions . <p> The last gladiatorial combat is recorded in 404 , after emperor Theodosius established Christian orthodoxy , banned paganism and started persecuting its followers . Pagan holidays were abolished , the Temple of Vesta destroyed , the Vestal Virgins disbanded and auspices and sacrifices were considered witchcraft and punished . So it was in this period that most ancient Roman traditions and lifestyle ceased to exist . Also , from these years we have no further literary information about the Colosseum , and the only sources are the texts of inscriptions on stone slabs . <p> From 408 to 410 the city was besieged by Alaric ( 370 - 410 ) , king of the Visigoth . In the end his troops plundered the city for three days . During the Visigoth war the amphitheatre was completely abandoned and its surroundings actually became a burial site , as the sieges prevented the Romans from burying the dead outside the walls . After the war these cemeteries were " reclaimed " by burying them under 2 metres of earth , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dating from Diocletian to Theodoric times ( IV-VI century ) have been found in the valley of the Colosseum , mainly in the NE sector . 63 burial places have been found in and around the amphitheatre , though only 56 have been mapped . These 56 are located in 3 places . 15 ones on the eastern side and 18 on the northern side were placed outside the travertine paving around the amphitheatre , which was still in use . The third group of 23 tombs ( from the VI century ) were found inside the northern portico . So the obvious conclusion is that during the V century the area around the amphitheatre was abandoned , but the facility was still in use ; in the VI century , when the amphitheatre was finally closed , it was used for burials . <p> The trauma of the Visigoth sack induced about half the population to leave the city . At the end of the IV century Rome still counted between half a million and one million inhabitants , but after the shock of the invasion their number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the V century/beginning of the VI there were only about 100.000 Romans left in the city . The Visigoth sack might have obstructed the drains of the amphitheatre , flooded the hypogea and maybe also ruined part of the upper porch , that had collapsed in the cavea , since it was once again repaired between 417 and 423 by the Praefectus UrbiIunius Valerius Bellicius , probably together with Praefectus Urbi Rufius Cecina Felix Lampadius , who is mentioned in another inscription . How do we know all this ? It is an interesting story . <p> Between 425 and 450 , probably after the 443 earthquake , Praefectus Urbi Lampadius carried out more restoration works on the arena , on the podium and on the terraces - at his own expense , as he left inscribed on a marble slab . This particular inscription is also important because the marble slab had been recycled : beforehand it had carried another inscription , made of bronze letters . These letters were secured to the slab by metal pegs , that left holes in the marble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deciphered in 1995 , so it was found that the bronze former inscription was by the Flavian emperors Vespasian and Titus , and it declared that the amphihteatre had been built with the spoils of the Palestinian war and the plundering of the Temple of Jerusalem . After the 429 and 443 ones , another earthquake devastated Rome in 470 , and in between , in 455 , the city was again sacked , this time for fifteen days , by the Vandals of Genseric ( a.k.a . Gaiseric , 389 477 ) . Another inscription commemorates the repairs carried out by patrician Messius Phoebus Severus in 470 , but the last restoration works mentioned are the ones paid in 484 or 508 by the Praefectus Urbi Decius Marius Venantius Basilius after an earthquake . See the text or the photo . In any case these works were n't the last to be carried out in the amphitheatre : the arena floor was again raised during the VI century , as stated by the fragments of an inscription found in the amphitheatre which has disappeared but that at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works made by Anastasius , a senator of the period following the fall of the Western Empire . <p> The last venatio is recorded in 523 . Gradually the taste of the public had changed , but the main reason for the end of the games was the military and financial crisis in the western part of the empire , together with the many invasions Italy had suffered . No one could bear the colossal expenses needed to organize the shows , and this made the function of the building obsolete . Perhaps some venationes were held until the end of the VII century ( Gentili ) , but in the VI-IX centuries the amphitheatre was completely abandoned . In medieval times houses and churches were built in the Colosseum , which was also used as a fortress/residence by the barons of Rome .

If you are looking for the Colosseum on coins click here . <p> The principal Roman coinswere the as , made of copper ; the sestertius , the quinarius , the silver denarius and the golden aureus. 1 . The as , the unit of the Roman currency , was originally one pound of copper , but its value diminished with time till at last it contained only 1/24 of a pound . Note : An as , whatever its weight , was always divided into twelve unciae. 2 . The sestertius contained originally 2 1/2 asses , the quinarius 5 , and the denarius 10 ; but as the as depreciated in value , the number of asses in these coins was increased . 3 . The as was also used as a general unit of measure . Thus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libra , or pondo , which means " weight " ( 327 g ) , and the uncia - one ounce - is 1/12 of the as ( 27 g ) . b ) In Measure , the as is a foot - 29.6 cm ( 11.6 inches ) - and the uncia is 1/12 of a foot ( 24.6 mm ) . c ) In Interest , the as is the unit of interest -- i.e. , 1 percent a month or 12 percent a year ; the uncia is 1/12 percent a month , or 1 percent a year ; and the semis is 6/12 percent a month , or 6 percent a year , etc. d ) In Inheritance , the as is the whole estate , and the uncia 1/12 of it . Hence here 's ex asse , heir of the whole estate ; here 's ex dodrante , heir of 9/12 . <p> Now , why dodrante ? It is the ablative case of dodrans , dodrantis ( masculine ) , that is a mix of de and quadrans , and that means " missing 1/4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so here it means " owner of 3/4 " , that is the same of 9/12 . Dodrans could also be a measure of length ( 3/4 of a foot ) : " quinque pedes et dodrans " and of time : " dodrantes horarum " , i.e. 3/4 of an hour ( which in any case had a very different length then ) . A nice page on Roman units of measure is of course in Wikipedia . <p> Computation of Money and Complications on sesterces1 . In all sums of money the common unit of computation was the sestertius , also called nummus ; but four special points deserve notice : a ) In all sums of money , the units , tens , and hundreds are denoted by sestertii with the proper cardinals . Thus --quinque sestertii = 5 sesterces ; viginti sestertii = 20 sesterces ; ducenti sestertii = 200 sestertes. b ) One thousand sesterces are denoted by mille sestertii , or mille sestertium. c ) In sums less than 1,000,000 sesterces , the thousands are denoted either ( 1 ) by milia sestertium ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : duo milia sestertium , or duo sestertia = 2,000 sesterces ; quinque milia sestertium , or quinque sestertia = 5,000 sesterces . Note. --With sestertia the distributives are generally used , as -- bina sestertia. d ) In sums containing one or more millions of sesterces , sestertium with the value of 100,000 sesterces is used with the proper numeral adverb , decies , vicies , etc . Thus--decies sestertium = 1,000,000 ( 10 x 100,000 ) sesterces ; vicies sestertium , 2,000,000 ( 20 x 100,000 ) sesterces . <p> In the examples under d ) , sestertium is treated as a neuter noun in the singular , though originally it was probably the genitive plural of sestertius , and the full expression for 1,000,000 sesterces was decies centena milia sestertium . The words centena milia were afterward generally omitted , and finally sestertium lost its force as a genitive plural , and became a neuter noun in the singular , capable of declension . <p> The following weights and measures deserve mention : 1 . The Libra , also called As or Pondo , equal to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . a ) The libra , like the as in money , is divided into 12 parts . 2 . The Modius , equal to 8 2/3 of a liter ( about a peck ) is the basis for dry measure . 3 . The Amphora , containing a Roman cubic foot , equivalent to about seven gallons , is a convenient basis for liquid measure . 4 . The Roman Pes or Foot , equivalent to about 29.6 cm ( 11.6 inches ) is the basis for length measure . <p> Note. -- The Cubitus is equivalent to 1 1/2 Roman feet ( 44.4 cm ) , the passus to 5 feet ( 1.48 m ) , and the stadium to 185 m ( 625 feet ) . Consequently mille passuum - the Roman mile , was 1480 metres.5 . The Jugerum , containing 28,800 Roman square feet , equivalent to about six tenths of an acre , is the basis for square measure . ( source : LONG ... <p> The sestertius ( Eng . sesterce&gt; sehs-tursh ) was the main coin used for setting prices and values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , as aureus , denarius , and other coin names , the name was originally an adjective modifying nummus , the Roman word for " coin " . Before the Second Punic War the sestertius was worth 2 1/2 asses because this was a convenient value , since 10 asses = 1 denarius . Early in the war due to hard times the as was devalued to 4 asses = 1 sestertius , which made 16 asses = 1 denarius . Due to the greatly different nature of today 's economics , any effort to equate sesterces to modern currency is probably wasted . However , we can look at what was the money situation of different Romans . Consider the facts below : <p> A man in the times of Augustus was considered to be part of the equites ( knights , rich class ) if he possessed 400,000 sesterces ( 100,000 denarii ) worth of property . <p> Under Augustus , a senator had to own property equal to 1,000,000 sesterces ( 250,000 denarii ) . <p> A common soldier under Augustus and Tiberius ( ca. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than one denarius ) or about 900 sesterces per year , and under the emperor Domitian ( ca. 85 A.D. ) this had only raised to about 1,200 sesterces ( 300 denarii ) per year . <p> Praetorian legionaries ( an elite force ) under Augustus received 2 denarii per day or about 730 per year . Officers of course could expect more- centurions ( perhaps equivalents of modern sergeants ) received 3750 denarii per year under Augustus and 5000 under Domitian . <p> A lawyer under Claudius ( ca. 50 A.D. ) could expect his clients to pay up to 10,000 sesterces for his services in a case . <p> Juvenal ( ca. 100 A.D. ) complained of charioteers who made 100 times what a lawyer did- 15,000 to 60,000 sesterces for one victory , and Martial , who wrote in the latter half of the first century A.D. , talked of a charioteer named Scorpus winning 15 bags of gold in one hour . Another charioteer living under Hadrian and Antoninus Pius ( ca. 140 A.D. ) was supposed to have made 35,863,120 sesterces in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 sesterces , and he made fun of patrons who could offer no more than 100 quadrantes ( 6 1/4 sesterces ) to their sicophants as a day 's gift . In another place , he basically says he would have sold his loyalty to a man named Paetus for 6,000 sesterces , except that Paetus paid him too late . <p> In the first century A.D. , olive oil cost about 2 or 3 sesterces per quart , and wine between 1 and 4 asses per pint . A trip to the public baths cost about 1 quadrans for a man and 2 quadrantes for a woman , children got in free- of course , you had to bring your own servant , oil , and strigil ( instrument used for scraping away grime ) . <p> A lonely man in Pompeii reported paying a denarius for a good night with a woman . <p> A town house in Rome might cost between 500,000 ( 125,000 den. ) and 2,500,000 sesterces ( 625,000 den. ) , and a iugerum ( slightly more than 3/5 acre ) of land might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3,000 den . ) . <p> When used to describe large amounts of money the sestertius was often counted in milia(1000s) , so they used the genitive plural of sestertius , but since sesterti*orum is so long they shortened it to sesterti*um . That is one explanation . Another says that sestertium is just the adjective form modifying mille-- in which case you would expect milia sestertia , and this does appear sometimes . So if we are confused about this , it seems the Romans were too . <p> EXEMPLI GRATIA sexie(n)s sesterti*um = 6,000 sesterces ; or ( rarely ) 600,000 sesterces decie(n)s sesterti*um = 10,000 sesterces ; or ( rarely ) 1,000,000 sesterces vicie(n)s sesterti*um = 20,000 sesterces ; or ( rarely ) 2,000,000 sesterces . Now that I 've showed the thoroughly confusing Roman longhand for monetary amounts , I will describe their shorthand notation . HS stands for sestertius . The H was originally II , and the S stands for semis ( n.b . II ( 2 ) + semis ( 1/2 ) ) . To indicate 1000 sesterces they wrote HS with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote HS with a line on top and on each side . They used this same technique with other quantities . So HS followed by XV with a line above the XV indicated 15,000 sesterces , and HS followed by XCI with a line above and at each side of XCI indicated 9,100,000 sesterces . Although not particularly related to money , I will mention a few other things about numerical notation here . Roman numerals are often taught with the notation IV for 4 , IX for 9 , XC for 90 , etc. , but IIII , VIIII , LXXXX , etc. were more common . Also the Romans had a variant notation form for D , M , and some larger numerals : <p> Constantine Values ( Aureus dropped , inflated economy - see this paper by Constantina Katsari on 3rd century inflation ) The siliqua is the modern name given to small , thin , Roman silver coins produced from 4th century and later . The term siliqua comes from the siliqua graeca , the seed of the carob tree , which in the Roman weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Roma pound or about 0.19 gram ) . Are called siliqua various silver coins on the premise that the coins represented that were valued at 1/24 of the gold solidus ( which weighed 1/72nd of a Roman pound ) and therefore represented a siliqua of gold in value . Since gold was worth about 14 times as much as silver in ancient Rome , such a silver coin would have a theoretical weight of 2.7 grams . However , the term seems to be one of convenience as no name for these coins is indicated by contemporary sources . Thin silver coins to the 7th century which weigh about 2 to 3 grams are known as siliqua by numismatic convention . <p> From the site of the Museum of London : For the first time , a hoard of Roman gold coins has been discovered in London .

The aureus was 95% pure gold ( 22 carat ) 45 aurei were intended to weigh one Roman pound or libra ( 327.45g ) 12 aurei represented the salary of a Roman legionary soldier for 1 year 8 aurei would buy 1 boy slave 8 aurei would buy 23 acres of woodland in Kent 1 aureus would buy 400 litres of cheap wine 1 aureus would buy 200 pounds of flour

The expense was enormous , and the problem must have been a grave one , because at the times of Tiberius the Senate forbade the organization of games to the citizens with a patrimony of less than 400.000 sestertia ( which was the equivalent of the wealth needed to be part of the census equestris , or knighthood ) .

It is possibly the best example of French Gothic manuscript illumination surviving to present day . It was created for John , Duke of Berry , by the Limbourg brothers between 1412 and 1416 . The view is from the North ; the circular representation of the city is rather fantastic , but it is typical of that age and there are all the most important elements : aqueducts , walls , churches etc. , and - of course - the amphitheatre .

His six-volume work was inspired by Sebastian Mnnster 's Cosmographia . Frans Hogenberg ( 15351590 , from Munich ) created the tables for volumes I through IV .

He was nevertheless criticized for the excessive cruelty of the repression . Sixtus restored the papal finances , that were in a ruinous state , and in a very short time managed to accumulate enormous amounts of gold and silver . As a planner , he was very active in Rome : he achieved the completion of the dome of St. Peter 's ; the loggia of Sixtus in the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano ; additions or repairs to the Quirinal , Lateran and Vatican palaces ; the erection of four obelisks , including that in Saint Peter 's Square , and much more ...

This edition with changes dates to 1645 ; it shows Rome in its late sixteenth-century condition , with some of the changes brought about by Sixtus . Near the Colosseum there is the new road that leads to St. John 's Lateran .

The area is full of churches and convents , but the main buildings on the Lateran square belong to the hospital of Arciconfraternita del Salvatore ( still there , still a hospital ) . The Arciconfraternita in 1604 had made an agreement with the Senate of Rome , undertaking to provide all the stone ( quarried at the Colosseum ) necessary to finish the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitol . In exchange , it got permission to demolish the Arch of Basile , that was placed at the eastern end of Via dei Santi Quattro ( it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials to build the hospital . In 1606 the concession to use the stones from the Colosseum was renewed to the Arciconfraternita . Giovanni Maggi was born around 1566 and was active in Rome from the beginning of the XVII century . We do n't know much of him , but in 1625 he engraved on woodcut the biggest ever ( cm 224 x 428 ) map of Rome . The use of wood is rather unusual , as most artists used to engrave on copper . Probably the explanation is that the wood technique is cheaper and faster . It seems that only few copies were made of the original print , so that soon the memory of this map was lost . That is probably why in 1774 Carlo Losi reprinted the Maggi map and attempted to sell it as an original publication .

This view follows the eastward oriented model established in 1593 by Antonio Tempesta . The axonometric projection that Merian utilizes lends this map a special significance to historians and architects who can thus visualize many buildings that were demolished or fell into ruin during the subsequent era . This map also includes some of the only surviving visual representations of Rome 's early churches , many of which were replaced with grander structures in the 18th century . <h> Falda 1676 <p> Giovanni Battista Falda in 1676 printed a 12 sheet map of Rome , that represents Rome during the baroque era .

He is best known for his Pianta Grande di Roma which he began surveying in 1736 and engraved in 1748 . Nolli achieved an extraordinary technical feat that represents a milestone in the art and science of cartography . Modern surveys and sophisticated satellite images have confirmed the accuracy of Nolli 's map within the smallest margin of error . The map is composed of 12 copper plate engravings that together measure 176 centimetres ( 69 in ) by 208 centimetres ( 82 in ) . It was by far the most accurate description of Rome produced to date . The Nolli map reflects Bufalini 's map of 1551 , however Nolli reorients the city from east to magnetic north , reflecting his reliance on the compass for surveying , and represents enclosed public spaces , such as the colonnades in St. Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The map was a significant improvement in accuracy and it was used as a base map for all Roman mapping and planning up to the 1970s . This great website of the University of Oregon is dedicated to the Nolli map . Explore and learn ! The map can also be downloaded at the UC Berkeley website . Nolli collaborated with famous engraver Piranesi in producing a smaller version of this map , the Piccola Pianta , begun in 1747 , but published with the larger map in 1748 .

Nonetheless , Stockdale had a number of important works to his name , including several geographies , most notably the 1794 American Geography 1794 and , with John Cary , the 1805 New British Atlas .

He had reigned longer than any Pope in historical times . <p> According to the French project , the Colosseum was to become part of a huge archaeological park comprising the whole centre of Rome . The monument was in a bad state , because coach drivers used it as a night shelter , and it had been for a long time a storehouse of manure destined to a nearby gunpowder factory .

One week after the presentation of the report there was an order from the Quirinale to clear the Colosseum from abuses . In 1805 the excavations started , carried out by architects Camporesi , Palazzi and Stern , with the help of Carlo Lucangeli , an artist of wood modeling who needed an exact survey of the monument for his reproduction . The three architects presented further plans for the consolidation of the Colosseum , proposing the building of a buttress to stop the lateral movement of the outer wall . The idea was criticised in name of the picturesque and romantic qualities of the ruin , which would be spoiled by the monstrous buttress . <p> A counter proposal was presented to the Pope by one Domenico Schiavoni , possibly a master mason who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered part itself into a buttress by demolishing the upper parts along an oblique line and by walling in some arches .

A wooden shoring had prevented the collapse of the outer wall , but when the works started it was found that the outer wall was in worse conditions than expected , so it was deemed necessary to build a cross wall to link the buttress , the outer wall and the inner structure of the monument . The niches around the podium , parts of the podium , the entrance of the so-called passage of Commodus , part of the drain that runs around the amphitheatre and part of the canalisation system of the ground floor were also excavated .

In 1814 the authority of the Pope was re-established The temporary administration contracted out to Luigi Maria Valadier , son of the more famous Giuseppe , a survey of the undergrounds , the arena was then covered again and the stations of the Cross reinstalled . <p> Under Pius VII ( 1800-1823 ) it was deemed necessary to reinforce the remains of the outer ring . An abutment ( buttress ) of bricks ( a.k.a. the " Stern abutment " from Raffaele Stern , the architect who planned it ) was built to support the arches on the NW side , ad was completed around 1820 .

Then in 1852 Luigi Canina repaired the second ring of corridors and rebuilt part of the Maenianum summum in ligneis , where he wanted to reproduce a section of the colonnade by using modern elements . On this occasion the tie rods that cross the facade and anchor it to the masonry behind were installed . These 1846-1853 restorations are well described ( in Italian ) in this article . <p> In 1870 Rome became the capital of the new Italian State , but the works to finally free the arena restarted only in 1874 .

Also the streets around were redesigned ( Via Claudia and Via degli Annibaldi ) . The works to install drains and gas pipes led to more discoveries : the paved area around the amphitheatre on the N side , boundary stones and a road . In 1895 the valley was again unearthed and 89 burial places , dating from Diocletian to Theodoric times ( IV-VI century ) were discovered in and around the amphitheatre . <p> More restoration works were carried out by the Italian State in 1901-2 , but the arena remained half full of earth for many years .

Cozzo also demolished 567 cubic metres of underground structures that had been added to the original construction during the millennia and 1059 cubic metres of unstable masonry . These demolitions have been criticised on the grounds that Cozzo acted with haste and without a serious study of what was being dismantled . The western side of the underground was reached in 1939 , a heap of columns from the upper porch and structures of the cavea were found .

The Roman historian Livy , on the contrary , stated that the games originated in Campania , the region around Naples ( where in fact there are many funeral paintings depicting scenes of duels and chariot races ) , and his statement has influenced greatly the experts . This option , however , should not conflict with the Etruscan one , in my modest opinion , since the Etruscans had had colonies and influence in Campania .

During the III and II century BC the popularity of the games increased ; Livy reports that in 216 the Forum hosted a combat of 22 pairs ; in 183 sixty pairs of gladiators fought at the funerals of Publius Licinius Crassus ; in 174 a show lasted for three days . In 105 BC the consuls were finally authorized to organize ludi circenses , so they became a public event . Many private munera were nevertheless organized also after that date .

In Rome the organisation of the games was entrusted to magistrates , called curatores .

Even the sand of the arena probably received its share of special effects , by the addition of coloured stones : we know that the Circus Maximus was embellished with petra specolare ( a translucent selenite ) and that there Caligula and Nero in special occasions mixed the yellowish sand coming from the hill today called Monte Mario with minium ( red lead ) and crisocolla ( green-blue copper oxide ) . <p> During the games gifts were offered to the spectators ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift stamped on it , were thrown to the public .

In 61 BC a law was passed which entrusted the organisation of the games to the emperors and fixed the occasions ( public events and official dedications ) in which they could be produced . The production of munera had become a matter of public interest , as it was too important to be left to any private citizen who could exploit their popularity to gain credits and the favour of the masses ( thus being a threat to the State and the authorities ) . <p> Given the enormous expense of the munera , and their frequency , the emperor could renounce his privilege of offering the games in favour of local high priests ( also called magistrates ) of the imperial religion . In fact , provincial magistrates were obliged by city laws to offer munera on behalf of the emperor . This was often for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could use a fixed amount of public money . The magistrates that had already offered games could add to their title the one of munerarii ( it seems that it was Caesar August himself to invent the title ) . And when the new classes of the rich liberti ( ex slaves ) started offering games , in the effort to imitate the behaviour of the Roman nobility , the maximum number of gladiators was restricted , thus reducing the value of these spectacles , in comparison to the lavish and splendid games offered personally by the emperor . <p> In the city of Rome , for the practical organisation of the games , the emperors set up in the first century an organisation for the production of the games . There was the Ratio a muneribus , a kind of Ministry of Games with organisational and financial powers over the venationes and the munera .

The other schools in Italy and over the empire were directed by officers called procuratores familiarum gladiatoriarum.

The ludi - something halfway between barrack and prison - had the same basic layout all over the empire : gladiators were lodged in small cells around the yard where they trained . At the beginning the schools were only private and were managed by rich citizens . The schools were common , too , in all the provinces of the Empire , and all were submitted to the authority of a procurator , an imperial official who controlled an entire area like Gallia ( modern France ) or Asia ( Turkey ) . In imperial times , starting with Julius Caesar , the emperors organized their own schools . <p> In Rome there were important gladiatorial schools : the first one was the Ludus Aemilius , founded by the triumvir Aemilius Lepidus , and it is also mentioned by Horace in his Ars Poetica .

It was probably placed between the Temple of Divus Claudius on the Celian hill and the ancient street vicus Capitis Africae , where in 1938 excavations showed its elliptical foundations . <p> The Ludus Magnus , as its name tells , was the most important of them all , and it was the main gladiatorial school in Rome .

They kept in check the Roman state for three years before the revolt was suffocated . The organization of the schools was thereupon set to avoid such accidents . Beside every ludus there was a garrison of soldiers who delivered the real weapons to the gladiators in the morning and took them away at night . Soldiers would intervene in any case of disorder .

@@47389028 @889028/ <h> I M A G O <p> It is reasonable to think that even the ancients considered the Colosseum an architectural wonder , and that its image circulated in the ancient world . As far as we know , the only images of the amphitheatre we have from the antiquity are on some coins . We have coins bearing the image of the Colosseum that were minted during the reigns of Titus , Severus Alexander and Gordianus , and they are very precious not only because they are rare , but also because they are in fact the only contemporary documentation of the Flavian amphitheatre . <p> The first one is the Titus 80 AD bronze sestertius ( above ) . One can see the heads of the spectators in the cavea , which shows horizontal divisions , reflecting the seating for the different classes of spectators , and staircases that separate the sectors . The imperial throne is the half circle in the middle of the cavea ( the lonely dot in its centre should be the emperor ) . The representation is rather accurate ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular bronze shields once placed on the cornice of the fourth floor ) .

The latter is perhaps a representation of Titus ' baths , or a covered passage that connected the baths to the amphitheatre . <p> After Titus ' death , another bronze sestertius was coined by the mint of the Senate . It is very similar to the previous one , but Luciani saw a detail in it which maybe was n't in the first coinage : a set of garlands , or festoons all around the top ( I say : could these be the rolled awnings of the velarium ? ) . <p> The important thing in both coins is that the amphitheatre appears fully completed , and this disproves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colosseum being completed by Domitian . <p> About 150 years passed before the Colosseum was again represented on a coin . In 223 , during Severus Alexander 's reign , the Senate mint produced gold , silver and bronze coins , all of the same type , probably to celebrate the restoration of the amphitheatre . <p> This coin appears in many variations : in some cases the clypea are missing , or there is a different number of staircases ; however , the Meta Sudans and the portico are still there ( 150 years have passed by ! ) but behind the Meta appears the statue of the Triumphant Sun ( which was later called Colossus ) and the portico has only one floor . The golden aureus is a nice coin , but presents a simplified version of the elements around the amphitheatre . <p> Around AD 240 another coin appeared , this time minted by the imperial mint of Gordian III . It is not really a coin , but a celebrative medallion , produced in a limited series . It seems that there are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two pictures of two different coins .

On the right , the portico . <p> The archaeologists also consider as contemporary representations of the amphitheatre the bas-relief of the famous tomb , called of the Haterii family ( above ) and the remaining pieces of the Forma Urbis , which was a marble map of the ancient city . <p> The Haterii tomb in my opinion is a rather fanciful design of the Colosseum ( judge for yourself , the picture is here on the right ) .

The ex lake thus became part of a huge park provided with all sorts of amenities , including the most luxurious mansions , fake fishing villages , animals , water sources and fountains . In the entrance of his palace Nero also placed a colossal bronze statue of himself ( 120 feet high , work of Zenodorus ) , whose face was later modified many times to represent different emperors . <p> After the death of Nero in 68 AD , and after a period of turmoil , Vespasian came to power .

Dio Cassius calls it " hunting theatre " , but is a translation from the Greek . Colagrossi writes that Calpurnius called it " Ovum " , the egg . The name Colosseum dates back to the XI century , and it is origin is uncertain . The most popular version is that the name comes from a colossal statue of Nero , called indeed Colossus Neronis , that at first was in the Domus Aurea .

Discussion among the experts is still open , though , because some have argued that 1 ) there is no substantial evidence of the presence of the statue near the amphitheatre ; 2 ) the name Colosseum appears only from the XI century , when the statue had long disappeared . <p> Another theory maintains that the name might have come from the Collis Iseum , a nearby hill where a temple dedicated to Isis once stood .

Though inhuman , according to modern standards , the system worked , and in the following battle the soldiers attacked furiously an army of 10.000 and killed two thirds of the enemies . More slaves were killed in a battle at the Lacus Lucanus , but the final confrontation took place near Brundisium , at the end of the Appian Way . Plutarch wrote that before the battle Spartacus killed his horse : if he won , he could get all the horses of the Romans ; if he lost , a horse would have been useless . 60.000 rebels were killed , and 6.000 were made prisoners and crucified all along the Appian Way from Rome to Capua .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and the arts , I have read about it , and I started it when I looked around the web for some information on the Colosseum and found out that the existing sites were superficial . Now , from the point of view of academic credibility , my site does little more than try to report in a concise manner the findings of some of the available literature on the subject ( believe , it is massive ! ) . My reference for the site is the literature listed in the sources page . In the site I have tried to report as faithfully as possible the current knowledge about the Colosseum , reporting where opportune the different views . It is quite common to find different opinions on a lot of issues ; I tried to be honest to the reader in the sense that I often wrote " many authors think " , or " it is believed " rather than give a one-sided , easy-to-remember explanation of some particular issue . In my opinion , this should lead the reader to imagine that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . As to the value of the theories reported , this is another question : in the field of history or archaeology , where much is left to the interpretation of hints , generally the credibility of a theory can not be proven by scientific evidence . While reading about the Colosseum I understood that much of the literature is based on important studies of the past , so that big mistakes have been perpetuated for decades . Often , when former studies were challenged , those theories were disproved . The issue of the sources and their reliability/credibility is an important one . If you go deep into any subject , you realise that the problem of the " original " sources is the most disturbing one . If we consider the Colosseum , the original literary sources are few ( I tried to collect most of them in the sources page in Latin ) , and they have generally been taken as fundamental .. For example , the fact that Martial ( De spectaculis ) says that naval battles were held in the arena has led many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be filled with water and then emptied . Some explained that when it was first inaugurated the Colosseum was n't fitted with the underground passages , which were made later , by Domitian . Some recent studies now affirm that naval battles could n't possibly have been held at all in the arena , because of the architecture of the building , draining system and all . Were naval battles held in the Colosseum or not ? We are not sure anymore . And then we meet a new elegant explanation of it : Martial did not really mean the Colosseum when he wrote about naval battles , but he meant another place or another kind of show , different from what is generally intended as naumachia . Can at this point Martial , the original source , still be credible ? Can we find another meaning in his writings ? And again , can we trust the edition of Martial 's works ? Which edition ? Is the translation adequate ? Is it the only version and/or interpretation of the original parchment codex ? Because there might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on ... What do we do then ? With limited time and cultural resources , we generally stop in front of printed paper that looks credible enough , though the credibility threshold for me rose together with my knowledge . The conclusion is that the truthfulness and reliability of books and papers ( and in general of all information , this site included ) on the Colosseum ( and I believe on every subject ) is good until disproved .

@@47389036 @889036/ <h> PUBLIC SPECTACLES AND ROMAN SOCIAL RELATIONS <h> Jonathan Edmondson . Dpt. of History , York University , Toronto , Canada <p> In A.D. 58 two Frisian leaders , Verritus and Malorix , traveled from the far-distant shores of the North Sea to the city of Rome to petition the emperor Nero . They tried , unsuccessfully it transpired , to persuade him to reverse an order issued by the Roman governor of Lower Germany that they should abandon the lands their people had occupied in Roman territory on the left bank of the Rhine . While they were waiting for their audience with the emperor , they went on a sight-seeing tour of the city 's monuments . They were particularly attracted by the Theatre of Pompey and decided to spend some time there , since a public spectacle was taking place . The historian Tacitus reports at some length ( Ann . 13.54 ) how intrigued they were by the seating arrangement of the crowd ( the consessus caveae ) and by the distinctions of rank ( discrimina ordinum ) that it so clearly revealed . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no delight in the shows ) , they asked a series of questions about the seating arrangements of the audience ( consessus caveae ) and the distinctions between the social orders ( discrimina ordinum ) : who were the equestrians and where were the senators sitting ? They then noticed some men wearing foreign clothes sitting in the senators seats . They kept on asking who they might be , and when they discovered that they were delegates who had received this honour because their nations excelled in their courage and their friendship to Rome , they cried out that no race on earth was braver and more loyal than the Germans , and then moved down and sat among the senators . The spectators liked this rather old-fashioned impulsiveness and fine sense of competitiveness . Nero made them both Roman citizens , but ordered that the Frisians should leave the territory they had occupied . It is impossible to tell whether all the details of Tacitus narrative are precisely accurate ( and it is somewhat worrying that Suetonius relates what appears to be the same incident , but sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25.4 ) ; but even so , the anecdote is valuable for the Roman cultural assumptions that underlie it . For Tacitus , as for many other Romans , it was at the theatre and other public spectacles that the complex hierarchies of Roman social organization were revealed for all to see more clearly than anywhere else . Furthermore , the division of the population into orders or ranks ( ordines ) was one of the defining features of Romanness . Non- Romans such as the Frisians Verritus and Malorix needed to appreciate this concept if they were ever to grasp how Roman society really worked . <h> I. THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC SPECTACLES AT ROME <p> Public spectacles were put on in a variety of different contexts in Rome . Games or competitions ( in Latin ludi , in Greek agones ) were the defining feature of the religious festivals ( also called ludi ) of the Roman state that were held on a regular cycle according to the Roman religious calendar . These traditionally included several days of stage-shows ( ludi scaenici ) of many varieties tragedies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onwards , the highly popular mimes and pantomimes and normally culminated in a day or more of chariot-races ( ludi circenses ) , held in the Circus Maximus . As Greek culture came to penetrate Roman spectacle from the second century B.C. onwards , athletic and gymnastic competitions were sometimes added to the festal programmes . For the stage-shows , temporary wooden theatres were erected for each particular festival and then dismantled , until stone theatres finally became available in Rome : from 55 B.C. onwards the Theatre of Pompey , from 17 B.C. the Theatre of Marcellus ( CIL VI 32323 = ILS 5050 , lines 157-158 ) , even though it was not officially dedicated until 13 or 11 B.C. ( Dio 54.26.1 ; Pliny Hist . Nat . 8.65 respectively ) , and from 13 B.C. the Theatre of Balbus ( Suet . Aug. 29.5 ; Dio 54.25.2 ) . Even thereafter , temporary wooden stages were still sometimes erected , as occurred , for example , at the Ludi Saeculares celebrated in Rome in 17 B.C. ( CIL VI 32323 = ILS 5050 , lines 108 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladiatoria ) , on the other hand , were special events , much less common , offerings or gifts ( which is the underlying sense of the term munus ) made periodically to their fellow-citizens by members of the Roman elite . Initially in the Republic they were put on by senatorial families as part of the funeral of a distinguished family member . Later their main sponsors were Roman emperors , keen to celebrate a military victory , the dedication of a major building in the city of Rome or an important dynastic event such as the coming-of-age , marriage or death of a key member of the imperial family . Sometimes Roman magistrates added gladiatorial combats or venationes ( wild-beast hunts ) to the regular programme of ludi scaenici or ludi circenses that they were required to sponsor during their year in office , but this was increasingly kept in check by the emperors ( cf. Dio 54.2.3-4 ) . <h> II . SEATING HIERARCHIES AT ROME DURING THE REPUBLIC <p> It was at festal events in the theatre that distinctions of rank first became officially enshrined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time received privileged , segregated seating at the Ludi Romani ; previously , the historian Livy reports , senators and plebs had watched the ludi without discrimination of rank ( Livy 34.54 : in promiscuo spectatum ; cf. Val . Max. 2.4.3 ) . However , the characteristic respect shown by ordinary Romans towards their social superiors meant that even before 194 the Roman elite had always been able to claim privileged seats based on their status alone , as Valerius Maximus makes clear in his discussion ( 4.5.1 ) of the important Roman virtue of deference ( verecundia ) . So although in theory there was a sense that elite and plebs sat down together to share the pleasures of the ludi , in practice the elite usually sat in the seats closest to the stage . This principle of segregated seating was extended further in 67 B.C. when the tribune L. Roscius Otho successfully introduced a law , the Lex Roscia , which laid down that the first fourteen rows of the theatre were to be reserved for members of the equestrian order ( equester ordo ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases those who have the right to sit in the equestrian seats came to be used as an official designation of the equestrian order . Bankrupt equestrians ( the so-called decoctores ) were banned from the fourteen rows and confined to a special block of seats at the rear of the theatre ( Cicero Philippics 2.44 ) . These attempts to regulate seating at the theatre did not immediately win universal approval . L. Roscius Otho , for example , was still receiving a very hostile reception from the Roman plebs four years after his law came into force when he entered the theatre to watch a play , although on that occasion the equestrians cheered him just as vigorously as the plebs booed him ( Plutarch Cicero 13 ) . Individuals sometimes tried to defy these regulations by occupying seats to which they were not strictly entitled and this became problematic during the civil wars from 44 to 30 B.C. , when there seems to have been a particularly flagrant disregard for such regulation , as we shall see later . <p> Formal segregations by rank were not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor to gladiatorial presentations during the Republic . The Circus Maximus was well known for its looser seating arrangements , where festive licence and the mixing of social ranks was possible and even encouraged . Occasionally individual elite families were granted a specially reserved space for viewing the races as a reward for outstanding public service , as when a space for a curule seat ( sella curulis ) to be placed near the shrine of Murcia was granted to the family of M. Valerius Maximus , dictator in 494 B.C. and conqueror of the Sabines . But in general the peculiar elongated shape of the circus also meant that there were fewer possibilities for elaborate vertical hierarchies to be worked out , and we should not forget that it was only under Julius Caesar that work on a more monumental form of seating commenced , to be completed under Augustus . <p> As for gladiatorial presentations , the situation is more complicated , largely since most munera in this period took place in the Forum , where a temporary wooden arena was constructed for each particular munus and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plebs should share the pleasures of the occasion by sitting alongside each other , but it is also clear that certain families over time came to be given special seats , which reminded the crowd consistently of that familys honoured status . So , for example , in 184 B.C. the Maenii were granted in perpetuity a special place on the balcony of the Basilica Porcia from which to watch the gladiatorial combats in return for having sold their house to allow the construction of the basilica . Similarly in 43 B.C. the descendants of Servius Sulpicius Rufus ( who had been consul in 51 ) were permitted by senatorial decree to view the shows and gladiatorial presentations from that part of the Rostra on which Rufus honorific statue had just been set up ( Cicero Philippics 9.16 ) . Men and women certainly sat together during the Republic : so , for example , the dictator Sulla openly sat next to his future wife Valeria at the gladiators ( Plutarch Sulla 35 ; cf. Suet . Aug. 44.2 ) . And this lasted into the early imperial period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amatoria , written between 9 B.C. and A.D. 2 , recommended chariot-races and gladiatorial performances as ideal hunting-grounds for young men to flirt with , and win the hearts of , young women ( Ovid Ars am. 1.135-162 chariot-races , 163-176 gladiators ) . <h> III . ITALY AND HISPANIA <p> The concept that seating arrangements in theatres should provide a clear manifestation of social rank quickly spread to Italian towns and then to the Roman provinces . In his treatise On Architecture ( 5.6.2 ) , written at the very end of the Republic , Vitruvius assumed that architects of theatres for Italian towns would need to incorporate designated seats for local senators ( decurions ) into their design of the orchestra ; while a section of the law from Heraclea regulating the organization of Italian municipalities , dated ca. 45 B.C. ( CIL I2 593 ) , defines those professions which prohibited individuals from watching the games or gladiators in the space reserved for senators , decurions or conscripti ( line 138 ) . By this period some towns at least of Roman status in Hispania had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charter ( lex ) that was drawn up for the colony established ca. 44 B.C. at Urso ( modern Osuna ) , the so-called Lex Ursonensis , clearly specified the various social groups who at public games were allowed to sit in the seats of honour in the orchestra of the towns theatre . These included Roman magistrates and promagistrates ( i.e. , provincial governors ) , Roman senators and their sons , equestrian praefecti fabrum serving on the staff of Roman provincial officials , as well as local magistrates and local decurions , who could also grant special privileges for others to join them in these seats of honour ( CIL II2 / 5 , 1022 , ch. 127 ) . Another section of the same charter ( ch. 66 ) reveals that the colonys major priestly colleges , the pontifices and augures , were allowed to watch the ludi and gladiators alongside the decurions . Similarly at Gades ( modern Cdiz ) , a municipium of Roman citizens ( municipium civium Romanorum ) , already by 43 B.C. at ludi and munera put on by the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fourteen rows of seats of the theatre were reserved for the substantial number of equestrians that formed part of the local population ( Cicero ad Fam. 10.32.2 ; cf. Strabo 3.5.3 : Patavium was the only town in Italy except Rome which could surpass the five hundred equites of Gades registered in a census of the Augustan period ) . <h> IV . AUGUSTUS AND THE REGULATION OF SEATING AT PUBLIC SPECTACLES <p> It was in particular during the upheaval of the civil wars at the end of the Republic , when boundaries of social rank became more permeable and common soldiers were rising even to senatorial rank , that individuals ( especially soldiers and wealthy freedmen ) started to assert a claim to much higher social status simply by sitting in the seats of the privileged at public spectacles(8) . The biographer Suetonius reports two occasions on which Augustus was made aware of this problem . First , in 41 B.C. at a celebration of ludi in the theatre he had to order an attendant to eject a low-ranking soldier from the fourteen rows ( i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , he was shocked , we are told , when he heard that at a crowded set of games in Puteoli ( modern Pozzuoli ) no-one had offered his seat to a Roman senator , who had clearly arrived late for the show ( Aug. 44.1 ) . This , according to Suetonius , prompted Augustus to look closely into the whole question of segregated seating . Augustus attempt to regulate seating at public spectacles came in two phases . First , in 26 B.C. he persuaded the senate to issue a senatorial resolution ( senatus consultum ) to the effect that the front row of seats should be left vacant for Roman senators at all public spectacles in Rome and throughout the Roman Empire ( Suet . Aug. 44.1 ; Dio 53.25.1 ) . Never again , he hoped , would a Roman senator be embarrassed in the same way as the senator who could not find a seat at the games at Puteoli had been . Then , at some point between 20 and 17 B.C. he introduced a much more far-reaching law , the Lex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seating arrangements that should pertain at ludi scaenici in the theatre . In his zeal for social and moral reform , he went much further than any previous politician in making the theatre a template of the Roman hierarchical social order . He also attempted to extend the same kind of segregation to the crowds who flocked to watch gladiatorial presentations and later in his reign he took some steps , it seems , towards trying to regulate seating in the circus . <h> A ) THE THEATRE <p> The Lex Iulia theatralis strongly reaffirmed the existing , but sometimes overlooked , rules that at the theatre senators should sit on individual seats ( subsellia ) in the orchestra and that equites should occupy the first fourteen rows of the cavea . ( For an example of a Roman theatre , see Figure 1 : the theatre at Emerita , modern Merida . ) However , it also introduced a number of novelties , some of which we can reconstruct from the literary sources , most of all from Suetonius life of Augustus . One clause of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forbidding in particular delegates sent by free and allied nations to sit alongside them , as had occurred in the past . Augustus was worried that some of them were only freedmen and this would make a mockery of his relegation of freedmen who were Roman citizens to the upper rows of the auditorium ( Suet . Aug. 44.1 ) . Soldiers who had won the corona civica , a military decoration awarded to those who had saved the life of a fellow-citizen , were allowed to wear their decorations at the ludi and received special , honoured seats in front of the equites immediately behind the senators ( Pliny Hist . Nat . 16.13 ) . <p> The equites were differentiated more elaborately than they had ever been hitherto . Those who had served as military tribunes and who were holding office as one of the twenty junior magistrates known as the XX viri were rewarded for their public service by being allowed to occupy the first two rows of the equestrian seats . At some date before A.D. 19 and probably under Augustus the equestrians were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whom separate blocks of seats ( cunei ) were allocated . In A.D. 19 one of the cunei iuniorum was renamed the cuneus of Germanicus in Germanicus honour after his untimely death in that year ( Tac . Ann . 2.83 ) ; and there were also cunei of Lucius and of Gaius , which were probably given these names after the deaths of Augustus grandsons , Lucius and Gaius Caesar , in A.D. 2 and 4 respectively . Equestrians whose wealth had slipped below the property qualification for equestrian status of 400,000 sesterces were banned from sitting in the XIV rows , but Augustus exercised some leniency towards those who had suffered financial losses during the civil wars ( Suet . Aug. 40.1 ) . Equestrians and senators who had taken up a profession adjudged inappropriate for persons of their rank ( such as working as an actor , gladiator , gladiatorial trainer or pimp ) and as a result been adjudged infames ( persons not to be spoken about ) formally lost their right to sit in the seats to which their privileged rank had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the official attendants of Roman magistrates ( the clerks , heralds , messengers , assistants known collectively as apparitores ) immediately behind the equites and in front of the ordinary citizens ( the plebs Romana ) , which perfectly captured their liminal status on the boundary between low-ranking equites and high-ranking plebs . Behind them the plebs Romana was divided as never before . Soldiers and perhaps also retired veterans were separated out from the rest and given their own block of seats ( Suet . Aug. 44.1 ) . Further rows ( ordines ) were assigned to those of the plebs who were married ( mariti ) ( Suet . Aug. 44.2 ) . Boys who were still wearing the toga praetexta ( i.e. , those who had not yet assumed the toga of manhood , the toga virilis ) sat in a special block of seats ( cuneus ) , while their pedagogues ( paedagogi ) sat in an adjoining cuneus ( Suet . Aug. 44.2 ) . Many of the latter would have been slaves or freedmen , but they were being publicly honoured for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman citizens by being allowed to sit among the freeborn . Conversely , those of the plebs who came to the theatre wearing dark clothing ( pullati ) because they could not afford a proper white toga were relegated to the very back rows in the summa cavea ( Suet . Aug. 44.2 ) . <p> Women of all social ranks were required to sit in their own section of seats in the covered portico that ran around the very back of many theatres . The only exception were the Vestal Virgins , who were given a special enclosure directly opposite the praetor 's tribunal , where the president of the ludi sat ( Suet . Aug. 44.2-3 ) . Later some female members of the imperial family were granted the privilege of sitting with the Vestals at the theatre : Livia , for example , in A.D. 23 ( Tac . Ann . 4.16 ) , Caligulas grandmother Antonia and his sisters Agrippina , Drusilla and Julia Livilla in 37 ( Dio 59.3.4 ) , Messallina , wife of Claudius , in 44 ( Dio 60.22.2 ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close a view of the actors whose bodily gestures could be considered threatening to female modesty ( pudicitia ) and also to protect them from the wandering eyes of male spectators , who clearly felt that the festal atmosphere at public festivals and spectacles was ideal for seducing women . Whether this was entirely successful is not clear , since even from their position at the very back of the theatre , upper-class women could be accused of seeking out lovers from among the sordid plebs , who filled up the back rows of the cavea , just below the portico where women of all ranks sat ( Petronius Satyricon 126 ) . Augustus banned women completely from attending ludi involving athletes , perhaps because they performed naked ( Suet . Aug. 44.3 ) . <p> Furthermore , Augustus law regulated the dress one had to wear to attend public spectacles . We have already seen how those who were not dressed in togas were relegated to very back rows . This is clearly related to Augustus attempt to make Roman citizens wear the toga on important public occasions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40.5 ) . Distinctions of dress further underlined the differences in social status among the assembled spectators . The president of the games was entitled to wear triumphal dress : that is , a purple and gold decorated toga ( the toga picta ) , worn over a tunic with palmbranch designs ( the tunica palmata ) . Current and past curule magistrates ( i.e. , consuls , praetors and curule aediles ) wore the purple bordered toga ( the toga praetexta ) ; the rest of the senate the simple white toga , but over a tunic with the broad purple stripe ( the latus clavus ) . Equestrians wore the same toga , but over a tunic with the narrow stripes ( the angusti clavi ) that was the traditional mark of their rank . Emperors were entitled to wear triumphal dress , but sometimes preferred the simpler toga praetexta . Not all of the clauses of the law were successful . The ban on ambassadors sitting among the senators , for example , had lapsed at the latest by the reign of Claudius , when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theatre in Rome ( Suet . Claud. 25.4 ; cf. Tac . Ann . 13.54 , A.D. 58 ; Dio 69.15.2 , reign of Trajan ) , while other clauses had to be reinforced by subsequent legislation . The municipal charter ( lex ) from Irni in Baetica , dated to A.D. 91 , refers ( ch. 81 ) to a series of laws , plebiscites , senatorial resolutions , edicts and decrees on the subject passed by no fewer than seven Roman emperors : Augustus , Tiberius , Claudius , Galba , Vespasian , Titus and Domitian . But even despite these challenges , the Lex Iulia theatralis was a challenging piece of prescriptive legislation , which helped to publicize and reinforce many of the major elements of Augustus ambitious programme of social and moral reform . <p> First , the law in general terms emphasized the enormous importance of rank in Roman society and the need to maintain clear boundaries between the different ordines . In this way it was closely related to Augustus law of 18 B.C. which attempted to regulate the kinds of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lex Iulia de ordinibus maritandis . Secondly , it underlined the centrality to the Augustan programme of marriage and the production of legitimate citizen children by allowing married members of the plebs to occupy better seats than the unmarried , and it appears that at some point Augustus even excluded unmarried men and women from public games altogether . Not surprisingly , it was at a public spectacle that he chose to present Germanicus as a model Roman father by parading his children in front of the crowd when the equestrians were complaining about the harsh terms of his marriage law ( Suet . Aug. 34.2 ) . By creating a separate and visible section of seats for boys wearing the toga praetexta , he drew the crowds attention to the importance to the Roman state of maintaining the birth-rate ; and by honouring their pedagogues , who were often slaves , he made it clear to all just how much he valued the proper education of children in an appropriate disciplined manner . <p> Thirdly , his restriction of women to the back rows emphasized his general concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very heart of his laws of 18 B.C. that attempted to curb adultery and extramarital sex ( the Lex Iulia de adulteriis coercendis and the Lex Iulia de stupro ) . Fourthly , his privileging of those equestrians who served the state by becoming junior officers in the army or by assuming various junior political posts in Rome corresponded closely with his creation of a whole series of administrative posts reserved solely for equestrians . Finally , he gave soldiers and especially soldiers who had won distinctive honours a privileged place in the theatre , as in real life , where his reforms of military service emphasized the centrality of the army to the successful maintenance of peace throughout the Roman world . As Vergil so aptly phrased it , the Romans main talents lay in bringing peace and adding morality to it , and in sparing the subjected and making vigorous war on the proud : pacique imponere morem , parcere subiectis et debellare superbos . ( Verg . Aen. 6.852-853 ) <h> B ) GLADIATORIAL PRESENTATIONS <p> Furthermore , Augustus attempted to extend these elaborate seating arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were still constructed in the Forum , as well as in the Saepta and occasionally from 29 B.C. in the small amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus . Suetonius is explicit that he would not allow women to watch the gladiators unless they sat in the very uppermost seats , even though it had been customary in the past for men and women to sit alongside each other to watch such displays ( Aug. 44.2 ) . However , his attempt at enforcing segregation by sex does not seem to have been immediately successful , since Ovid in his mock didactic poem , the Ars Amatoria , written at some point between 9 B.C. and A.D. 2 , could still recommend gladiatorial presentations in the Forum as an ideal occasion for young men to meet and seduce women ( 1.163-176 ) . In this regard it was now much more promising than the theatre , where women do seem to have been restricted to the very back of the auditorium ( Propertius 4.8.74-78 ; Ovid Amores 2.7.3-4 ) . <p> However , by the reign of Nero at least quite elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as at the theatre . In one of his pastoral poems ( Eclogue 7 ) Calpurnius Siculus describes in great detai the wooden amphitheatre that Nero had constructed in the Campus Martius . Calpurnius describes the plebs sordida ( i.e , the plebs who chose not to wear their white togas ) sitting at the very rear of the auditorium ( cavea ) near the section of seats reserved for women . From here a peasant visiting Rome looks down on the equestrians and the military tribunes sitting in their gleaming white togas . It would appear to confirm that various elements of Augustus Lex Iulia theatralis were now fully operational in the amphitheatre : not just the segregation by rank , but also the restriction of women and those not wearing the toga ( the pullati ) to the very back rows of the audience . <p> Once the Flavian Amphitheatre , better known since the Middle Ages by its popular name , The Colosseum , had been inaugurated by the emperor Titus in A.D. 80 , the full complexity of the social distinctions laid down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of the building where all the most important gladiatorial presentations henceforth took place in the city of Rome . The main part of the auditorium ( or cavea ) was divided into four main sections of seating stretching up and back from the edge of the arena for a possible reconstruction of the seating arrangements click here . The first sector included the podium , a flat platform running around the arena on which the senators sat on moveable subsellia , and seven rows of seats for the equites and others specially authorized ; these seven rows may have been conceived as the equivalent of the fourteen rows of the theatre , since the amphitheatre was in a sense a double theatre ; then the maenianum primum ; thirdly , the maenianum secundum imum ; and finally , the maenianum secundum summum . A fifth tier of wooden seats was set up in the gallery running around the very top wall of auditorium , the so-called maenianum summum in ligneis . The Acts of the Arval Brethren , an aristocratic priestly college , for the year A.D. 80 refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reserved for the guests of the priests in the first Maenianum ( maeniano I ) and for their dependants in the maenianum summum and in the maenianum summum in ligneis ( CIL VI 32363 = ILS 5049 ) . <p> These divisions were reinforced architecturally by marble balustrades ( baltei ) , just under 1 m. tall , that ran around the rear of the podium and along the front of each subsequent section of seating . These boundaries , both architectural and social , show up clearly on the coins struck by the emperor Titus in 80 to commemorate the opening of the amphitheatre ( Figure 6 ) and also on the depiction of it on the Severan marble plan of the city of Rome ( the so-called Forma Urbis ) . They were thus crucial to the official plan for , and perception of , the amphitheatre . Furthermore , the visual effectiveness of these architectural differentiating elements can be clearly seen whenever a public spectacle is held in a well-preserved Roman amphitheatre , such as the one at Nemes in southern France when it is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flavian or Trajanic period confirm that special places were reserved at the new amphitheatre for social groups that we know were segregated in the theatre by Augustus Lex Iulia theatralis : for example , those marked as for Roman equites , for praetextati ( that is , boys still wearing the toga praetexta ) and perhaps for pedagogues of boys ( CIL VI 32098 , b-d = ILS 5654 , b-d ) . Further sections were reserved for public guests and for clients ( CIL VI 32098 , e-f = ILS 5654 , e-f ) , while another very precise space ( that amounted to twelve , thirteen or just possibly fourteen Roman feet ) was for those who have been granted the right to sit here in the theatre i.e. , amphitheatre by law or by plebiscite ( CIL VI 32098 , a = ILS 5654 , a ; see Figure 8 ) . Interestingly there was also a section reserved for people from Gades ( CIL VI 32098 , l-m = ILS 5654 , l-m ) ( 18 ) . The poet Martials boast ( De Spectaculis 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to watch the spectacles that Titus put on to inaugurate the amphitheatre was clearly not completely hyperbolic . <h> C ) THE CIRCUS <p> The Circus Maximus , like all other spectacle buildings , was affected by the senatorial resolution of 26 B.C. reserving the first row of seats for senators ( Suet . Aug. 44.1 ) . According to the historian Cassius Dio ( 55.22.4 ) in A.D. 5 the senate passed a further resolution , probably at Augustus instigation , to the effect that the equites should be segregated at the circus from the rest of the population , i.e , from the senators , who already had been segregated , and from the plebs . However , this does not appear to have taken hold , for when Tacitus reports that under Nero equestrians finally did receive separate seats in front of those of the plebs ( Ann . 15.32 ) , he comments that up to that day they had entered the circus unsegregated ( indiscreti ) because the Lex Roscia only applied to the XIV rows sc . in the theatre . In A.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senators , which would suggest that hitherto no particular area of the seating had been permanently reserved for their use . At the same time he allowed senators , if they did not wish to wear full senatorial dress , to sit among the lower-ranking spectators ( Dio 60.7.4 ) ( 19 ) . Finally , Nero took the logical next step in 63 by designating a fixed section of seating for the equestrians ( Tac . Ann . 15.32 ; cf. Suet . Nero 11.1 ) . This involved a certain amount of restructuring of the cavea , with new seating built for the senators over the water-channel ( euripus ) that ran around the edge of the arena , while the equestrians occupied the existing seats behind these new ones ( Pliny Hist . Nat . 8.21 , with Humphrey 1986 : 647 , note 240 ) . In stark contrast to the theatre and amphitheatre , no attempt was made , it appears , to separate men and women at the circus ( cf. Ovid Amores 3.2 , Ars Amatoria 1.135-162 ; Juvenal Satires 11.202 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , the emperor took up a very visible and prominent position at public spectacles . If he was presiding at ludi in the theatre , he would legitimately sit on a sella curulis on the tribunal over the main entrance ( the aditus maximus ) to the orchestra , where the presiding magistrate traditionally sat . This was where Augustus , for example , was sitting at the ludi inaugurating the Theatre of Marcellus when his sella curulis collapsed , sending him crashing unceremoniously to the ground ( Suet . Aug. 43.5 ) or Claudius at the games with which he rededicated the Theatre of Pompey in A.D. 41 ( Suet . Claud. 21.1 ; Dio 60.6.8 ) . When he was not presiding , the emperor seems to have sat among the senators . So , for example , the emperor Commodus was criticized for kissing his lover Saoterus even in the orchestra ( SHA Commodus 3.6 ) . Emperors wives and other female relatives , as we have seen , were occasionally granted the right to sit with the Vestal Virgins . This highly publicized association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the domus Caesaris played in ensuring the well-being of the Roman state . <p> Some emperors broke with tradition . Nero , for example , liked to watch ludi in the theatre from the top of the proscaenium , where he occasionally departed still further from the normal practice by watching from a sedan chair ( sella gestatoria ) ( Suet . Nero 26.2 ) . Julius Caesar had already demonstrated the problems this could cause . When dictator , he had been heavily criticized for having a raised platform ( suggestus ) set up in the orchestra , so that his seat would stand out from those of the senators who surrounded him . According to Suetonius ( Div . Iul. 76.1 ) , this was one of the excessive honours that made him unpalatable to members of the senatorial order and led shortly thereafter to his assassination . <p> At the amphitheatre the emperor sat on the podium in the front row . Augustus , it is reported , once led some Parthian hostages across the middle of arena at a munus gladiatorium in Rome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( subsellio secundo ) behind his own seat ( Suet . Aug. 43.4 ) . Over time the emperor and his chosen entourage sat in a special enclosure ( the pulvinar ) , thus segregating him from the senators who sat around the rest of the podium . Again emperors like Nero could flout tradition by preferring , it is alleged , to watch from a cubiculum closed off with curtains placed on the podium presumably of the wooden amphitheatre erected on his instructions in the Campus Martius ( Suet . Nero 12.2 ) . At the Flavian Amphitheatre the imperial pulvinar became enshrined in the monumental architecture , located astride the centre of the minor axis of the arena on the north side directly opposite the enclosure in which , it has been suggested , the female members of the imperial family and the Vestal Virgins sat , along with the president of the munus and the consuls . <p> At the Circus Maximus a similar enclosure or pulvinar became the normal place for the emperor to watch the chariot races , but in this venue alongside the female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cf. Suet . Claud. 4.3 ; Res Gestae 19 ) . From here he was in full view of the crowd , and for this reason Augustus was adamantly opposed to allowing the young Claudius , his grandnephew , to sit in full view of the masses ( Suet . Claud. 4.3 : since Claudius was born on 1 August 10 B.C. , this presumably dates the incident to sometime c . A.D. 1-5 , when it would have been normal for a young member of the imperial family to be introduced to the Roman people ) . Occasionally Augustus and later Tiberius preferred to watch the races beyond the gaze of the crowd by using the balconies of the houses of friends or imperial freedmen , which must have lined the street that ran behind the long side of the Circus Maximus ( Suet . Aug. 45.1 ; Dio 57.11.5 ) . Domitian , however , adopted the practice that Nero had used in the amphitheatre by sitting in a covered cubiculum on a raised platform ( suggestus ) . Trajan consciously avoided this example and returned to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the senatorial seating ( Pliny Panegyric 51.4-5 ) . <p> Again the place from which the emperor viewed public spectacles was crucial to his public image . Furthermore , if he was seen to disdain the entertainments loved by the masses , this could cause political embarrassment , as Julius Caesar and Marcus Aurelius learnt when they tried to attend to state business while watching the ludi circenses ( Suet . Aug. 45.1 ; SHA , Marc . Aur. 15.1 ) . The emperor was expected to relax and enjoy the pleasures of the theatre , amphitheatre and circus together with his fellow-citizens . <h> VI . CHALLENGING THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY <p> We have already noted how in the chaotic years of the civil wars at the end of the Republic , certain individuals , especially wealthy freedmen , tried to lay claim to higher status by simply occupying the equestrian seats in the theatre ; and we have also seen that when the Frisian leaders Verritus and Malorix felt they belonged alongside other honoured delegates in the orchestra in the Theatre of Pompey , they simply moved down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . These actions demonstrate clearly how effective the theatre and amphitheatre were for defining ones social status publicly in front of the large crowds who gathered to watch the entertainments put on there . <p> Augustus far-reaching attempt at regulating the seating helped to make this social definition even sharper . However , it would be a mistake to assume that every aspect of his legislation was universally and everlastingly successful . The evidence that successive emperors had to pass legislation on the subject suggests that this was always a contested issue , with the rules constantly being challenged and then reinforced by further legislation . Furthermore , bad emperors were accused of trying to undermine the distinctions of rank made manifest in the theatre . Caligula , for example , allegedly loved to stir up discord between the equites and the plebs at ludi scaenici by inducing the plebs to sit in the equestrian seats ( Suet . Calig. 26.4 ) . Even if this is a malicious story invented to malign Caligulas reputation , it is still valuable , for it reveals the entrenched Roman mentality that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles . <p> The whole issue was clearly at the forefront of the poet Martials mind when he was composing his fifth book of epigrams around A.D. 90 , two years or so after the emperor Domitian as censor had reasserted the law regulating seating at public spectacles . In no fewer than eight poems in this book ( poems 8 , 14 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 35 , 38 and 41 ) Martial poked fun at people who tried to pass themselves off as equestrians by sitting in theequestrian seats only to be expelled by the vigilant and tough imperial attendants . Many of these characters bear Greek names ( Phasis , Chaerestratus , Euclides , Calliodorus ) , which make them sound distinctly like freedmen . Others , Martial claimed , tried to solidify their claim to equestrian status by wearing brightly coloured and expensive looking clothes , but the gaudy ( and now outlawed ) tones only drew attention to the fact that they were not real equestrians ( poems 8 , 23 , 35 ) . The fact that this question so exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very graphically the potential of the theatre for defining and even for redefining social status . <h> VII . SOCIAL RELATIONS : HONOURING THE ELITE <p> In addition to the seating arrangements , public spectacles helped to define and reinforce existing social relations in a number of other ways . Since the elite played an important role in funding the games and gladiatorial presentations , this was an ideal opportunity for them to publicize their financial generosity towards the community and to solidify their honoured position in Roman society . The fact that gladiatorial presentations were termed munera , offerings or gifts , suggests that the Romans conceived of these events as major acts of patronage on the part of the elite . By accepting such gifts , the plebs were ipso facto accepting that the existing social relationship between themselves and the elite would remain in force . And they often expressed their joy in accepting such gifts in very vocal terms , by rhythmically acclaiming their generous benefactor and in so doing , enhancing his social authority considerably . The sheer magnificence of the gladiatorial presentations sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took this a stage further . The increase in the number and variety of gladiators , the development of wild beast hunts ( venationes ) to include more and more exotic beasts and the breathtaking stage-effects of some of the public executions that filled up the programme around noon underlined the widening social gap between the highest members of the Roman elite ( the domus Caesaris ) and the Roman plebs . It would be virtually impossible for anyone else in Roman society , even the highest-ranking senator , to outdo such magnificence . It simply confirmed the emperor as the greatest benefactor of all . <p> For ludi scaenici and ludi circenses , there was some state financial funding available , but it was increasingly necessary for the magistrates who had responsibility for them to contribute significant funds of their own . During the Republic this economic outlay , made with the distinct hope of political and hence social advancement , fell largely upon the aediles , members of the Roman senate who were usually in their early thirties and ambitious later to gain election to the really prestigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consulship . As political competition became more intense after 150 B.C. and the range of possible spectacles was now much more elaborate and varied , they competed even more keenly to outdo their predecessors in the splendour of their games and so ensure their subsequent election to higher office . Augustus saw the dangers of such competitiveness and gave control of the ludi to the praetors , whom he allowed to contribute some of the funding , but only so long as no praetor outstripped a colleague in his financial generosity ( Dio 54.2.3-4 ) . <p> Such very public acts of generosity were interwoven into a complex sequence of ritual acts , whereby a reciprocal dialogue developed between elite and plebs . This dialogue helped to reinforce the existing relationship between each social group and did much to entrench the elite in their position of social ascendancy . Early in his magistracy , or in some cases even earlier when he was still campaigning for office , an aedile , praetor or consul would make a solemn promise ( pollicitatio ) to his fellow-citizens regarding the precise type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure of office . The plebs would react to this promise , usually praising the magistrate or candidate for his generosity . During the celebration of the ludi the magistrate would receive further lavish and very public praise from the plebs : first , at the various processions ( pompae ) that took place before many of the events that made up the ludi ; secondly , during the actual staging of the theatrical shows or chariot-races , when the magistrate presided in front of large crowds , whose acclamations would boost further his prestige ; and then finally after the event was over as the plebs ritually thanked the magistrate and offered him honours to commemorate his civic-minded generosity . <p> These rituals of reciprocity can be seen even more clearly in the municipalities of Italy and the Roman provinces . An honorific text from a statue-base set up in the later second century A.D. at Palermo in Sicily ( CIL X 7295 = ILS 5055 = Buonocore 1992 , 81- 83 , no. 53 , with photo ) illustrates well the complexity of the process . The opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and details of at least one of his public offices at Palermo . It continues : <p> which ( office ) he administered with unadulterated loyalty , and at the same time curator of the duty imposed on goods arriving at the port , which he carried out with singular diligence ... , praiseworthy munerarius , who thanks to the sacred indulgence ( of the emperor ) exhibited a munus which lived up to all expectations and for all the citizens gave in return a most pleasing production , at which over .... days the pleasure of the theatre occupied the people for many hours and they all in their joyfulness passed from there into the arena at mid-day . In the arena they marvelled at the very distinguished accoutrements prepared for the show and every type of herbivore and numerous Oriental wild beasts ; and from midday in both auditoria they took delight in the varied programme . And again thanks to the sacred indulgence ( of the emperor ) he proved particularly worthy in summoning all of his fellow-citizens to an elegant banquet , which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded with very frequent requests that statues of him in a two-horse chariot ( biga ) be set up in his honour by centuries ( i.e. , in all the districts of the city ) to increase the dignity of this excellent man on account of the pleasures that he had splendidly provided , in modesty he was content with two chariot statues and ? three equestrian statues <p> From this we see that the local worthy had put on a series of public spectacles in the theatre and amphitheatre , followed by a public banquet . As a result , the citizens of Palermo made very frequent requests of the local town-council , we may presume , that his generosity be commemorated with various honorific statues throughout the town . As often , the generous benefactor boosted his social worth still further by modestly accepting only some of those offered . From other similar monuments , it is clear that to mark the dedication of such statues , the honorand often sponsored further public spectacles , to make the occasion that much more memorable . This occurred , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellicus put on ludi circenses to mark his dedication of a statue honouring a local benefactress and her son ( HAE 1462 ; DOrs &amp; Contreras 1956 , 119-121 , n. 1 ) or at nearby Torredonjimeno , where ludi circenses and a banquet were put on by Annia Severa when she set up a statue of the emperor Marcus Aurelius to mark her husbands holding of a local priesthood ( CILA Jan , no. 69 ; see below , catalogue , n 42 ) . <p> The Roman elite could also enhance its prestige by providing the funds to construct buildings in which public spectacles could take place . During the Republic each year in Rome the magistrates responsible for the ludi or the noble families who offered gladiatorial munera to the people had to construct temporary wooden theatres or amphitheatres for their spectacles . Some of these were famous for their lavishness and technological ingenuity : for example , the wooden theatre of M. Aemilius Scaurus , built in 58 B.C. , with its 3,000 bronze statues and its stage-building ( scaenae frons ) adorned with 360 columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pliny Hist . Nat . 36.113-116 ) or the revolving double-theatre of C. Scribonius Curio , built for a gladiatorial munus in honour of his deceased father in 52 or 51 B.C. ( Pliny Hist . Nat . 36.24 ) . Eventually permanent spectacle buildings started to appear in the urban landscape , and these were funded by dominant political leaders such as Pompey , by trusted generals of Augustus such as T. Statilius Taurus , who built the first stone amphitheatre in Rome , inaugurated in 29 B.C. ( Dio 51.23.1 ) , or L. Cornelius Balbus , the last man from outside the imperial family to be granted a triumph . Thereafter , it was exclusively the emperor himself who erected such building : for example , the lavish wooden amphitheatre constructed by Nero in the Campus Martius ( see Calpurnius Siculus Eclogue 7 ) or the Flavian Amphitheatre , begun by Vespasian and completed by his sons Titus and Domitian , and funded from the spoils of the Jewish War ( ex manubi(i)s ) , as emphasized on its dedicatory inscription , that initially commemorated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that of the emperor Titus , who had succeeded his father by the time the amphitheatre was inaugurated in A.D. 80 ( CIL VI 40454a ) . <p> In the municipalities of Italy and the provinces , it was the local elites , the domi nobiles , who were responsible for the construction of permanent theatres or arenas , as , for example , at Alba Fucens , where an amphitheatre was constructed from the funds bequeathed in his will by one of the towns most famous sons , Q. Naevius Sutorius Macro , Prefect of the Vigiles and then Praetorian Prefect in the last years of Tiberius before he was forced to commit suicide in A.D. 38 after the accession of Caligula . Two copies survive of the same dedicatory inscription commemorating Macros posthumous generosity , which were set up over the arch of the southern entrance to the arena , one on the inside , the other on the outside of that entrance ( AE 1957 , 250 = Buonocore 1992 , 110 , no. 75 ; see here Figure 13 ) . It announced : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fabian voting tribe , Prefect of the Night Watch , Prefect of the Praetorian Guard of Tiberius Caesar Augustus , gave this in his will . <p> By funding such buildings , these members of the elite , whether in Rome , Italy or the provinces , reinforced their social position in their own community , while the buildings themselves stood as a permanent memorial of their ( and their family 's ) high social status and public generosity . Even for those members of the elite who did not fund new buildings , the sponsorship of spectacles in the theatre , amphitheatre or circus was often the high point of their civic benefactions , so much so that they chose to commission mosaic floors for their urban residences or rural villas which depicted the sorts of public spectacle that their generosity to the community had made possible . Whenever they entertained guests in their homes , they were able to remind them of their past acts of munificence . So the owner of a villa at Zliten in modern Libya chose particularly graphic scenes of gladiatorial combats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer frieze of a mosaic that was laid in one of the main reception rooms of his impressive villa . Sometimes , they went further and arranged to have their tombs decorated with painted or sculpted representations of the ludi or munera they had sponsored . So , for example , at Teate Marrucinorum ( modern Chieti ) in Italy the facade of the tomb of the freedman C. Lusius Storax , a VI vir Augustalis ( priest of the imperial cult ) , incorporated panels of relief sculpture depicting the variety of gladiatorial spectacles that he had sponsored as VI vir , while its pediment showed Storax himself presiding at his munus , proudly dressed in a toga praetexta , surrounded by his fellow priests of the imperial cult ( Figure 15 ) . ( 23 ) For Storax , the sponsoring of this gladiatorial munus was the most enduring memory of his life that he wished to convey to posterity . <h> VIII . SOCIAL RELATIONS : DEGRADING THE PERFORMERS <p> Ludi publici also forced Romans to confront the social values of the community as they sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drawn from a range of different social backgrounds and were themselves ranked hierarchically . The largest percentage of actors , gladiators and charioteers were slaves . As a result , these professions came to be thought of as servile well below the dignity of respectable Romans . The freeborn members of the audience , therefore , even those low in the social hierarchy , would draw satisfaction from the fact that they were being entertained by slaves even lower in class than themselves and without any civic rights . <p> However , this seemingly natural equation of public performance on the stage or arena with slavery was occasionally shattered when free-born Romans decided to take up careers as actors , gladiators or charioteers . As soon as they chose to perform for pay in the public arena , they sacrificed any social standing that they had ever possessed . In the eyes of Roman law , they became infames , persons of whom one should not speak . Just like prostitutes , with whom they were often conceptually connected , they had sold their bodies to others ( either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladiatorial trainer , lanista ) and were no longer able to act of their own free will . The wording of the oath , the auctoramentum , that all gladiators had to swear to their lanista made this dramatically clear . For they swore to endure burning , bondage , flogging , death by the sword , or anything else that the lanista ordered ( cf. Petronius Satyricon 117 ) . Gladiators and actors were also denied burial in the same cemeteries as the respectable on the assumption that their remains would pollute the other tombs ( e.g. CIL I2 2123 = IX 6528 = ILS 7846 , Sassina ) . <p> These freeborn volunteers surrendered all of the theoretical protections that Roman citizenship brought : in particular , they were now liable to suffer corporal punishment at the hands of Roman magistrates . Indeed actors who stepped out of line often received very dramatic punishment , sometimes even being flogged successively at each of the three theatres of Rome ( Suet . Aug. 45.4 ) . Even the lowest-ranking members of the Roman plebs were safeguarded , in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the mid-second century A.D. when it had already started to lose some of its protective force . Charioteers , it seems , were held in higher regard and , if freeborn , do not appear to have suffered infamia , but even they were debarred from rising to the equestrian or senatorial orders , from serving on local town-councils and from holding local magistracies ( Tertullian De Spectaculis 22 ) . <p> Every time , then , that a Roman watched a freeborn fellow- citizen performing on the stage or in the arena , she or he would be forced to contemplate the importance of social status in Roman culture . This was further emphasized by the fact that the performers were themselves ranked . Mime actors , for example , were ranked chief mime ( archimimus ) ( e.g. ILS 5209 , 5209a , 5211 , 5213 ) or second mime ( secundus mimus ) , as the freedwoman Cornelia P.l . Nothis , secunda mima of Solemnis and Halyus , was labelled on her tombstone set up at Emerita ( Merida ) ( AE 1993 , 912 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no. 10 ; here catalogue , n 18 ) . Charioteers normally started their careers driving two-horse chariots ( bigae ) before moving up to the four-horse variety ( quadrigae ) once they had gained sufficient experience . Moreover , their career statistics were widely publicized , which allowed a clear hierarchy to develop with at its apex the star charioteers , who commanded extremely high salaries and garnered very impressive amounts of prize money . <p> Gladiators were even more hierarchically organized . They were classified according to a series of ranks : beginners ( tirones ) and then numbered ranks ( quarti pali , tertii pali , secundi pali ) culminating in the most successful and most honoured ( and most highly paid ) : the primi pali . Gladiatorial statistics were also widely promulgated with the number of fights , victories , victory crowns and victory palms all meticulously recorded . Those at the upper end of this hierarchy were much higher in status in the eyes of the public , and their fights more eagerly awaited . Occasionally the freeborn performers were drawn from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may have originated in the fact that the Roman elite sometimes gave demonstrations of their martial prowess at public spectacles to emphasize their military courage . Rome , we must remember , was a military culture , in which single combat on the battlefield involving its elite continued well into the late Republic ( the last attested case occurs in Spain during the Munda campaign in 45 B.C. ) . So long as the elite performed for the sake of demonstrating their courage without receiving pay ( virtutis ostendendae causa sine mercede ) in Roman legal parlance ( Digest 3.1.1.6 ) , the Roman authorities were not concerned ; it only was when a senator or equestrian bound himself to a lanista and started to accept pay for his performances ( quaestus causa ) that he had crossed the line and suffered infamia , moral and legal loss of status ( Digest 3.2.2.5 ) . Augustus and Tiberius , anxious to maintain and even sharpen the distinctions between the various Roman social ranks ( ordines ) , tried repeatedly to prevent this , but the fact that legislation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective . Indeed Augustus and Tiberius even occasionally bowed to the inevitable and officially permitted equestrians to perform in the arena in A.D. 11 and 15 respectively ( Dio 56.25.7-8 ; 57.14.3 ) . <p> In conclusion , theatre-shows ( ludi scaenici ) , chariot-races ( ludi circenses ) and gladiatorial presentations ( munera gladiatoria ) were very much more than mere entertainments that kept the Roman plebs amused and politically quiescent ; they served as very important occasions for articulating in a highly visible and public manner the component elements of the Roman social order . This was most of all displayed in the seating arrangements whereby the crowd came to be organized hierarchically first in the theatre , later at gladiatorial presentations and eventually to a lesser degree in the circus . Where one sat and the dress one wore at a public spectacle marked out immediately to ones fellow-citizens precisely where one belonged in the Roman social hierarchy . As these social distinctions came to be increasingly regulated in a series of laws , senatorial resolutions and imperial decrees , they invited challenge . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to lay claim to a higher social position than the one to which they were strictly entitled . Such fraudulent usurpations of rank led the Roman authorities in the city of Rome and in the provinces to further attempts at regulation . <p> In addition , existing formal relationships between the various social ranks ( ordines ) were repeatedly reinforced and confirmed at public spectacles . The sponsorship of the ludi and munera by the elite and the rituals that such acts of euergetism engendered reminded both elite and lower orders alike of their respective place in an essentially conservative social order , while the way in which performers on the stage and in the arena ( though not , it seems , charioteers ) were stigmatized and relegated to the margins of Roman society helped to reinforce on a regular basis in the minds of the spectators just what it meant to belong as an accepted member of the Roman social order . Finally , it is no surprise that as Roman legal , social and cultural norms spread to the provinces of an expanding Empire , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships and social hierarchies first in the municipalities of Italy and later in colonies and municipalities throughout the Roman Empire . But even towns of non-Roman status seem to have adopted some elements of the distinction between ranks ( discrimina ordinum ) that the seating arrangements allowed . So even before it was promoted to municipal status under the Flavians , the small town of Irni in Baetica had already developed its own system of segregated seating at the theatre , which a specific clause of its municipal charter allowed it to retain ( Lex Irnitana , ch. 81 ) . As a result , every time a citizen of Rome or a provincial subject decided to enjoy the pleasures of the stage , the gladiatorial arena or the chariot-races , he or she came to gain a much sharper understanding of where he or she belonged in the Roman social universe . <h> BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE <p> For ludi in general , see Clavel-Lvque 1984 ; for the Republican period , note also Bernstein 1998 .

@@47389037 @889037/ <h> A E D I F I C A T I O <p> In order to plan an amphitheatre it is necessary to coordinate the dimensions of the arena , of the cavea ( the auditorium ) , and the length of the external perimeter , which in turn is necessary to calculate the number and width of the external arches and the area occupied by the building . The first planning step defined then the dimensions of the arena , given the traditional ratio of 5:3 used for most amphitheatres . Also , the width of the cavea had to be the same of the width of the arena , and in the case of the Colosseum this figure is roughly the same as the height of the external facade . Here are more details about the geometry . <p> Small differences in construction details have convinced the archaeologists that there were our different contractors , each one building a quadrant of the Colosseum .

This was widely accepted before as commonsense , but now the theory is corroborated by a recent discovery on a marble inscription . On the stone , " underneath " the inscription , there are still the holes used to lodge the metal letters of a precedent inscription , that was later erased . The holes were recently interpreted by Prof. Geza Alfoldy of Heidelberg University , who , working with Italian archaeologists , deciphered the puzzle . He concluded that the first inscription read : " Imp . T. Caes . Vespasianus Aug . Amphitheatrum Novum Ex Manubis Fieri Iussit " , that means " Emperor Caesar Vespasian Augustus had this new amphitheatre erected with the spoils of war " . See here the original paper in German and here an explanation in English . <p> Little is known of the expense , which must have been must have been enormous : The French Jacquier calculated in 1756 the cost of building only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of devaluation etc. , the cost would be today of more than 39 million EUR ( about 49 Million USD ) . <p> Scholars have debated at length if forced labour had been employed to build the amphitheatre . In fact , slave labour was widely used then , however the concept that only slaves were employed has been rejected , since the quality of the construction is evidence of a skilled work force . <p> Click here for an explanation of the building strategy , according to Cozzo . <p> Once completed , the foundation base was covered by a travertine floor , 90 cm thick in average . On this stone floor were marked the reference points for the main pillars , and the base blocks of the pillars were anchored to the floor by a pivot and melted metal . This skeleton of pillars was raised up to the second floor , and the pillars were connected , at the top , by big arches made with 2 feet long bricks , placed so as to allow the construction of many rampant vaults , which all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble seats . Some remaining vaults can be seen in the picture of the arena as it is today . <p> The system of having a first basic structure built up to the second floor allowed the builders to carry out the rest of the works above and below the cavea at the same time , leaving only some vaults open for the lifting up of the materials . The space between the pillars was filled by tuff opus quadratum on the ground floor , and by cement aggregate with a brick facing for the second floor . The tuff structures and the bricks ones which constitute ? together with the pillars - the radial walls of the amphitheatre are indeed independent from the pillars themselves and from the big vaults , and it is thought that they were built after the pillars .

In my opinion one of the most astonishing feats is the building technique , i.e. the system of making first the main arches in travertine , so that the rest of the construction could be carried out at the same time above and below this first structure . Amazingly , it took less than 10 years to build it ! Ingegner Giuseppe Cozzo , who in the 30s excavated and cleaned the whole building , wrote ( the translation is mine ) : " This building procedure , both simple and evident , allowed to terminate very rapidly the construction of the big cavea and to cover the walkways on the second floor ; at the same time it allowed for the coexistence of two vast building yards on the same site ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain , and a second upper one , above the cavea , in order to build the upper part of the amphitheatre . Below , under coverage , all the walls between the travertine pillars , the rampant bridging of the stairs , the vaults of the ground floor walkways , the plastering and the stuccoes could be completed ; above , work could be carried out on the walls of the remaining two floors of the amphitheatre , the podium , the seats , and the wooden upper portico " . <p> The travertine blocks were all connected to each other by iron clamps , which have been extracted in medieval times , and have left the holes that can be seen everywhere . It has been calculated that 300 tons of metal were used only for the clamps . The upper external wall ( see the photo ) shows that many of the travertine blocks were recycled from other buildings : their internal face is in fact irregular , and they have been leveled only on the external and contact sides . We are not sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save time or if these irregularities depend on later restorations . The external wall was once coupled and supported by a thick brick facing , and it is another mystery of the Colosseum how the wall you see can still stand .

The disaster of Vesuvius , had placed further strain on the Roman state whilst with the death of Nero and the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty , the city found itself plunged into civil war at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empire . Vespasian ? s position , however , needed consolidating ? now that the ? hereditary ? monarchy had come to an end , he needed to establish his own hold on power despite the ever-present faction calling for the restitution of the Republic . Given the untimely fate of his immediate predecessors , Vespasian ? s position on reaching Rome in AD 70 must have appeared parlous for the Empire was close to ruin , and it can be no coincidence that the following decade witnessed an unparalleled programme of sustained building activity demonstrating both his munificence and strengthening his grip on power . It is in this context that we view the building of the flavian amphitheatre . <p> In examining the political motivation for the creation of such public buildings , we must first comprehend the significance of building work as a means of bolstering political status . Augustus , for example , had instigated large building programmes in response to the years of war and in this respect Vespasian , as founder of a new dynasty can be seen as comparable ? " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thornton 1989 , 3 ) . The end of the Julio-Claudian line had created a power vacuum into which Galba , Otho and Vitellius had been sucked , and so on Vespasian ? s accession it was uncertain just what kind of an emperor he would be and how much of the power of previous emperors he would assume . In particular there was uncertainty as to whether the new emperor would inherit chief responsibility for major building projects solely by right of his office . A situation demonstrated most graphically by Helvidius Priscus ? challenge over who should take the lead role in rebuilding the Capitol ? a grand demonstration of the end of the war . <p> The lack of a direct link to the Julio-Claudians was a weakness which had prompted Vespasian ? s immediate predecessors to ally themselves with Nero ? s memory , arguably a factor in their downfall . Vespasian , however , chose not to look back to the supposedly villainous Nero , but to Claudius whom he considered a ? good ? emperor . The obliteration of the memory of Nero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a decline in the years following his death ) , forms the primary theme of most modern interpretations of the significance of Vespasian ? s building programmes , especially in the conversion of the Valley of the Golden House into that of the Colosseum ? a process which took just over ten years . <p> Whether Nero was as universally despised as later emperors would have us believe is doubtful , Tacitus for example records that many people in Rome still hankered after him ( Tacitus . Annals , I , 7 ) . The picture of Nero misappropriating public lands is therefore possibly overdrawn , there was for example a public market close to the Domus Aurea which he could easily have moved had he so wished , and the house itself was frequently thrown open to the public . Perhaps , however , the debate is irrelevant , for it is a common ploy amongst politicians to blame the prior administration for all society ? s ills , and one which is all too readily accepted by the people . It is this policy of damnatio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the buildings of what was once the Valley of the Golden House . <p> As well as looking to Claudius , under whom so much of his military career had taken place , Vespasian also looked to Augustus for inspiration and justification , most notably in his claim that Augustus had himself planned to build a permanent amphitheatre . However , unlike so much of Augustus ? s construction , there is less self-glorification in Vespasian ? s work , particularly in the Templum Pacis , but also evident in the reduced orders of the Colosseum , though following on from so profligate a ruler , this juxtaposition can be seen as another demonstration of Vespasian ? s political manipulation of public imagery . <p> The return of the lands of the golden house to the public domain was of major significance to the people of Rome ? " the Colosseum and all the buildings around it are there for the people to enjoy , no longer just its ruler " ( Martial . Spectaculae , 2 ) ? a theme which was continued in the re-display of Nero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps also in the arches of the Colosseum , as depicted on a sestertius of AD 80 ( BMC 190 ) ) . Such actions gave a much needed morale boost to the people of Rome and would have improved Vespasian ? s public image , but what was really important to the Roman plebs was panem et circenses ( Juvenal . Satire , 10.71 ? 10.81 ) . The appetite for public entertainment was enormous and gave the imperial house an opportunity to display its munificence ? the importance of the Colosseum in this respect can not be over-emphasised , such that Titus ? s opening spectacle easily surpassed anything Nero achieved . <p> Of further significance , however , is the importance of the building trade within Rome . As Thornton has pointed out ( Thornton and Thornton 1989 ) from the time of Augustus ( with the exception of the reign of Tiberius ) construction had been one of the most important industries in the city . Any emperor who could not find work for this large body of men created a significant man management problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his refusal to use certain labour-saving devices commenting " you must let me feed my poor commons " ( Suetonius . Divus Vespasianus , 18 ) . We should therefore also see the Colosseum in terms of the diversion of labour which was required to build it . <p> The political significance of the structure is not however confined to the motives of those building it . The purposes served by the amphitheatre present us with some of the most interesting facets of study . The dichotomy between the unification of society and the segregation of society present us with two contrasting themes . As a place of public entertainment the Colosseum was open freely to all members of Roman society and the glorification of the city by this is reflected when Martial writes of the amphitheatre as " a place for all the peoples of the world to unite . " ( Martial op. cit ) However underlying this , the rigid segregation which the design imposes reinforces the hierarchical nature of Roman life . Although entrance to the games was free , admission was by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrances , beyond each of which was a complex of passageways and staircases which delivered the spectator to a sector of the arena reserved exclusively for people of his status . No other roman building of this period so effectively incorporates the functional demands of a segregated society into its fabric . <p> We have already seen how the siting of the Colosseum on Nero ? s lake provides a determined demonstration of the handing back to public use of the land , but the location itself is significant in other ways . The sheer bulk of the design would dominate its surroundings no matter where it were placed , but here with only the semi-abandoned Temple of Claudius and the Colossus of Nero / Helios , the structure would be far more visible . The location also has a direct relationship with the Via Triumphalis and the point where four or five of the augustan regions of Rome converged , later to be marked by Meta Sudens . <p> Having outlined the very significant political and sociological importance of the flavian amphitheatre , I will now turn to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect the flavian amphitheatre is not a particularly revolutionary building ( Darwall-Smith 1996 , 80 ) , with the exception of the sheer scale of the monument , precedent can be found for most aspects of its architecture . The following discussion will attempt to contextualise these features with respect to the generally accepted precedents and also , perhaps ambitiously , to push precedents back further than we might expect . <p> With any attempt to analyse such a well-known structure , probably the most difficult aspect is deciding what to leave out , which material is irrelevant . To this end , I plan to pay scant attention to the mechanics of the amphitheatre ? s day-to-day operation ? the sub-arena structures , the velarium and other such mechanisms ? on the grounds that whilst these do have an impact on the architecture , it is not sufficient to demand significant changes to the design . Instead I plan to concentrate on three aspects of the buildings architecture : the structural form ; the materials , technology and history of construction ; the architectural vocabulary . <p> The earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Marcus Porcius at Pompeii , which in plan differs very little from that of the flavian amphitheatre . Here the design takes advantage of the topography in such a way that the arena is below ground level whilst the cavea is supported by artificial earthworks which are held in place by an elliptical retaining wall . This wall in places merges with the city wall , perhaps suggesting a lack of confidence in the amphitheatre as a free-standing form . Access to the seating was primitive , relying on four triangular staircases to disgorge the spectators up-and-over the top of the auditorium . However , some basic radial passageways were constructed under the cavea to permit access to the front row of seats , in a similar , though much less complex , manner to that employed in the flavian amphitheatre . Here then , we see the amphitheatre in its basic form . Others were to be built which developed the theme , with greater complexity and decoration , but this would appear to be one of the earliest . In seeking to establish an earlier precedent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the forum for hosting spectacul and the adoption and adaptation by Rome of the traditional Greek theatre . <p> The Roman gladiatorial contest had its roots in the Etruscan combats which were held to honour the dead , and as such were well established as a form of entertainment/religious observation long before the amphitheatre developed as a building type . For much of the Republic and into the early principate , particularly important combats took place in the forum ( both in Rome and other cities ) , as well as other structures such as the Saepta Iulia ( e.g. the games to in memory of Agrippa in 7 BC ) . Seating was arranged around the four sides of the usually oblong forum ( Vitruvius . De Architectura , 5.1.1 states that Roman fora were oblong , whilst Greek agora were square ) to allow spectators to view the action in the round , and it is this recto-elliptical form of seating which remained and largely determined the shape of the classical amphitheatre . From this developed wooden structures of a similarly temporary nature erected specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate opposed grandiose displays of luxuria as part of the overwhelming spread of Hellenic culture and the creation of permanent theatres and amphitheatres in Rome was curtailed . It was not until 58 BC and the construction of the lavish and expensive Theatre of Scaurus by Sulla ? s stepson , followed by the Theatre of Pompey ( Pompey was careful to assuage possible senatorial criticism by including a temple to Venus Victrix " under which we have built seats for viewing the shows " ( Tertullian . De Spectaculis , 10.5 ) . The design of this theatre is said to have been influenced by a visit to Mytilene in 63 BC , but also bears remarkable similarities to the second century Samnite sanctuary at Pietrabbondante. ) in 55 BC that the construction of a permanent amphitheatre in Rome might have been possible . <p> The first semi-permanent amphitheatre in Rome would appear therefore to be Curio ? s somewhat unbelievable rotating double-theatre ( 50 BC ) , whilst the first fully permanent amphitheatre in Rome was that of Statilius Taurus constructed in 30 BC , but not rebuilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphitheatres were still the exception during the first half of the first century AD . <p> Running parallel with the slowly evolving amphitheatre was the Roman theatre , a building adapted from the Greek , but with important differences . Roman engineering developments such as the refinement of opus caementicium , allowed the theatre to be constructed as a free-standing building , rather than cut into a hillside . In addition , a tall scaena frons was usually erected running to the full height of the auditorium and uniting the theatre ( Woodford 1982 ) . These developments created a structure which could now truly be thought of as a building , rather than an adapted hillside , and the influence on amphitheatre design of theatres such as that of Marcellus is significant . Here , whilst taking advantage of a self-supporting cavea , the limited access passageways seen at Pompeii were greatly enlarged to provide a comprehensive entrance system , utilising an alternating annular and radial substructure vaulted in opus caementicium . It is this interplay between cut stone and opus caementicium as well as the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recur as features in the flavian amphitheatre . <p> Construction work on the Colosseum began with an enormous concrete foundation ring capped with travertine , upon which was built a skeleton of travertine concentric rings infilled with tufa blocks and roofed with opus caementicium . The use of a vaulted form of construction with stone voussoirs and concrete was not a particularly revolutionary building method , similar building styles can be seen at the Tabularium and the sanctuary at Praeneste . However this form of materials was not common in the city during the imperial period . The method of erecting the building with skeleton travertine walls points to a degree of ingenuity , and it is in the mixture of stone and opus caementicium on such a large degree that allows the Colosseum to solve the structural problems inherent in such a design . The use of Tufa is recommended by Vitruvius ( Vitruvius . De Architectura , 2.7 ) as being durable under cover , and was hence used as screen walling in the non load-bearing sections , whilst travertine , which is relatively easily quarried but hardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Roman reliance on travertine for load-bearing is ably demonstrated at the Temple of Castor &amp; Pollux ) . The conservative attitude towards concrete exhibited by Vitruvius is echoed at the Colosseum where it is used only for the vaults and foundations and nowhere as a major load-bearing part of the structure . <p> The exact date of the commencement of building work on the Colosseum is uncertain , but would appear to be sometime after AD 71 ? confusion also exists over which flavian emperor is responsible for which work . Whilst the start of construction evidently belongs to Vespasian , with Titus celebrating the opening in AD 80 , Domitian would also appear to have carried out some work at the top of the building ? the markedly different styles of corinthian capital which now lie around the interior of the amphitheatre attest to the building ? s evolving style over the three reigns , as does evidence such as the Haterii relief where the Colosseum is displayed without its storey of pilasters , perhaps indicating an intermediate stage in the design . The use of square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also recall the use of an alternate square and segmental design in the Domus Flavia . However , as Lancaster has been at pains to point out , the extensive reconstruction work enacted following the lightning strike in August , AD 217 ( as well as later work ) , masks much of the constructional history of the building . Despite this Cozzo has argued that at least the two lowest orders had been completed by the time of Vespasian ? s death , though the interior is likely to have remained a skeleton . This has , however , to be seen in the light of the surprisingly small amount of work which has been carried out to determine the true extent of the restorations ; a considerable amount of work which was thought to be flavian belongs in fact to the third century . <p> The architectural vocabulary of the Colosseum is surprisingly restrained for a building whose construction spanned the reigns of so many flavian emperors . The use of an extensively arcuated form of decoration mimics the Theatre of Marcellus forming a neat termination to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the fornix ? was derived initially from its use at the Tabularium ( c.78 BC ) and became a popular motif , being also used for example on the Sanctuary of Hercules at Tivoli ( c.50 BC ) . The Theatre of Marcellus , for example , uses the fornix with a canonically-correct expression of the orders ; most of the decorative components are utilised in both doric and ionic levels , with a purer Greek form of doric appearing on the ground level than is usually the case in roman buildings ( e.g. there are no column bases ( Adam 1992 , 74 ) ) . The Colosseum , however , exhibits dramatically reduced orders . The engaged columns are now provided with bases , whilst the shaft , bereft of entasis , leads to a simplified capital . Surmounting this a triple-fascia architrave on each level ( regardless of order ) sits under a plain frieze and relatively simple cornice . The only decoration to show here and not at the Theatre of Marcellus is a more pronounced archivolt , with a small degree of fluting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorn the building like this ? The orders are not structural , and simply form a veneer superimposed on the arcades . The answer to this lies not in the building itself , but in our perception of it ; if we were to consider the building without its fatade of Greek orders , it would appear disconcertingly massive . Whilst allowing for a mechanism to articulate the entrances , the use of the fornices serves to scale down the building , making it more accessible . In this way when relating to the building , we look not at the whole mass , but at a single bay allowing the grandeur of the building to be appreciated without feeling alienated from it . <p> There is , however , no known precedent for the stacking of orders in this way . The Theatre of Marcellus , which would appear to be the major influence for the flavian amphitheatre , does show some similarities , but only the lower two storeys survive . The stacking of orders was not a new feature of architectural design , with early precedents such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the Parthenon ( 438 BC ) being well known . However , these only stack two orders , usually a slender ionic or doric on top of the architrave of a lower storey of doric . Vitruvius was well-aware of such a practice as he recommends that the upper range of columns be three-quarters of the size of those below and whilst such a format works well when restricted to two orders , if extrapolated further it rapidly becomes extreme . His failure to comment on this suggests that the stacking of three orders was unknown to him and as such the Colosseum and perhaps the Theatre of Marcellus may be the first examples of such a practice . <p> In summary , the design of the Colosseum speaks to us on a number of fronts . The political significance of such a structure is immense , and clearly served to establish the flavians as the true inheritors of the Julio-Claudian empire whilst destroying the memory of Nero and removing any trace of him from the map of Rome . As a functioning building it also breaks new ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still used in today ? s stadiums . However , its building method was not particularly revolutionary and save for its scale and the use of the stacked orders as decoration , the Colosseum does not stand out as a tremendously innovative building . It is the political manipulation and the solution of the functional and structural problems which makes the Colosseum demand respect to this day . 97493 @qwx507493 <p> Claudius <p> The theatre of Marcellus <p> La Bocca della Verita ( Mouth of Truth ) , from about 100 B.C. , is a giant marble disc sculpted into a human face .

The topmost tier will be open again , too , giving tourists a panoramic view of the city for the first time in almost 1,500 years . Meanwhile , Rea and her team keep digging up more surprises . Earlier this year they uncovered a secret passage , elaborately decorated with mosaics and plaster carvings , that was built to let Emperor Commodus ( 177-192 ) slip away from angry mobs . <p> The restorers have added a few improvements to the old ruin .

I do not understand yet , as a mere reader of newspapers and internet , the behavior of Codacons , which in order to block the works puts its nose into private matters ( the outcome of the battle-Gherardi Lucci ) . The question has long become grotesque , and is another example of the inability of the administrators to conclude anything ; they actually have delegated to the courts the management of these things . Meanwhile , despite numerous sentences , the millions of Della Valle are still unused , while they were available since November 2011 ( see Restoration and controversy n. 1 ) . What a pity ! P.S.

Tomorrow , from 9 to 11 , the union FLP has launched a new assembly at the amphitheatre ; in case of high adhesion there could be another temporary closure of the monument together with the Roman Forum and the Palatine.Comment Given that the problem is broader and regards all Italian museums , in this case everybody complains and there is n't anyone to work to solve the problems !

Some - maliciously - claim that many have been transferred behind a desk in an office , everybody knows that this is a practice in many areas of public employment : many try to avoid tasks that do not like , which often are not even remunerated .

The first stage of works will affect the top ten arches of the Colosseum over the full height of the northern prospect : the works , worth 6.5 million euro , are expected to last 915 days , or a little over two years .

This one of the Colosseum is an issue that regards more generally the state of crisis in which the Italian museums operate , mainly for lack of staff . A note of the trade unions states that " the places of culture in Italy and Rome are open to the public more than in any other country in Europe : 11 hours a day for 6 or 7 days a week . Workers who make this possible are exhausted , due to the severe shortage of staff , and are exasperated because for more than nine months they have n't been receiving about 20% of their salary . " The unions CGIL of Roma and Lazio asks from the Minister Bray " a serious employment policy , to eliminate the policy of disguised work , which uses ' fake ' volunteers , consultants and interns .

It will be in any case necessary to modify the traffic system in the area , because soon the works for the metro C subway will restrict Via dei Fori Imperiali just in front of the Colosseum .

About 160 companies are qualified for this kind of works and hope to get a slice of the cake . <p> 1 December 2011 - RESTORATION WORKS AND CONTROVERSY #2 - ARI ( the association of Italian Restorers ) has sent an open letter to the newly appointed Minister of Heritage , Lorenzo Ornaghi , asking to stop the bidding procedure for the restoration of the Colosseum , in order to avoid irreparable damages to the Colosseum . ARI maintains that the Special Commissioner Roberto Cecchi has interpreted the law so that the call for tenders of Aug. 8th 2011 was destined in fact to building companies and not to companies specialised in restoration of monuments . Moreover , the restoration of the monument has been the subject of a " saggio esecutivo " by the Istituto Centrale del Restauro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colosseum . In conclusion , ARI believes that the Colosseum will receive more damages than benefits by the Tod 's Group operation . <p> 19 November 2011 - RESTORATION WORKS AND CONTROVERSYUnder Secretary Francesco Giro ( now ex Under Secretary after the fall of the Berlusconi government ) announced that the restoration works for the Colosseum will start between May and June 2012 . The delay is due to the " newness " of the sponsorship ( by the shoe company Tod 's Group - see below ) . In the meantime , Codacons , a consumer association , has appealed the administrative tribunal against the entrusting of the works to the Group , as they maintain that the sponsorship infringes the bidding law . The bids are actually two : one of 8.7 million Euro regarding the restoration of the facade and a new barrier in the ground floor arches and another - of about 4.6 million Euro - for the construction of a " centro servizi " ( service centre ) between the Colosseum and via Celio Vibenna . Codacons claims that the Special Commissioner Roberto Cecchi went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , that the call for tenders - indefinite and vague - allowed for the entrusting the works directly to the Tod 's Group , despite a first negative evaluation of their proposal . Moreover UIL , a Trade Union , had also appealed the Rome Tribunal through its National Cultural Heritage " Coordinamento " , for basically the same reasons , adding also that 25 million Euro for the exploitation of the Colosseum image is a gift to Tod 's , since " ... any economist would evaluate the agreement over 200 million Euro , considering the exclusive rights and the duration of over 15 years with a communication plan ... saleable all over the world . " UIL informs that recently Volkswagen asked our Cultural Heritage Ministry for permission to use the Colosseum for advertising , and were ready to fork out between 500.000 and 1.500.000 Euro ( proposal that could not be accepted because of the 21 January agreement ) .

The head of Tod 's shoe company , Diego Della Valle , signed on Jan. 2011 an agreement with the authorities committing 25 million Euro to restore the monument .

Here is the text of the agreement ( in Italian ) . <p> March 2003 - Paul McCartney at the Colosseum - there have been two concerts : the first one on the 10th inside the monument , for about 400 people paying about 500-100 Euros a ticket ( money is destined to the Stop Land Mines charity ) and the following night another great one outside , in front of 500.000 people .

@@47389043 @889043/ <h> Passion Plays <p> The University of Sydney News - 24 February 2000 <p> Passion plays that inspired violence in Rome - By Anne Sarzin <p> When Associate Professor Nerida Newbigin travels to Rome in September to meet the Pope at the Roman Church 's Jubilee ? marking the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of Christ ? she will also get a chance to bring her own research alive . <p> Professor Newbigin will walk in the processional footsteps of people who produced passion plays in the Colosseum . These religious plays were sometimes highly inflammatory , inspiring hatred of the Jews . They were prohibited in 1539 by Pope Paul III after one provoked violence in the Jewish Quarter . <p> Professor Newbigin will attend a Jubilee conference in Viterbo before presenting the proceedings to the Pope on a Sunday dedicated to university teachers . While in Rome she will follow the processional route taken by members of the 15th to 19th century Confraternity of the Gonfalone , a male-dominated institution for the laity that played a significant role in Roman life . <p> In collaborative research with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of New York , Professor Newbigin , of the University 's Department of Italian , has examined the literary and historical records of the Confraternity of the Gonfalone . <p> For a short period between 1490 and 1539 , the Confraternity produced plays for Easter in the Colosseum in Rome . They also ran a hospital for pilgrims , gave dowries to respectable virgins , looked after the sick and performed pious deeds on special feast days . " It was a grassroots expression of devotion and spirituality , " Professor Newbigin said . <p> Professor Newbigin , who worked previously in the area of Florentine religious drama , has researched the Gonfalone 's records contained in the Vatican Secret Archives . When the Gonfalone disbanded in the 19th century , the Church took over their properties and archives . <p> The Confraternity used the Colosseum as a theatre for their dramatic performances . The crowd , possibly as many as 70,000 , assembled in the arena and the players performed among the ascending rows in the amphitheatre . " They put a lot of effort into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of doing plays properly and in a dignified manner , " Professor Newbigin said . <p> The plays were re-enactments of the events of the Holy Week of Easter ? the miracles , temptation , passion , and resurrection of Christ . In a typical year , the Gonfalone assembled on Good Friday and walked in devout procession from the Santa Lucia Church , through the Jewish Quarter , to the Colosseum . At the end of the play , they carried an actor representing the dead Christ back from the Colosseum to their church , singing hymns and flagellating as they walked . <p> The Chapel of Santa Maria Della Pieta in the Colosseum , used by the Confraternity of the Gonfalone for its plays , was demolished in the course of archaeological restorations in the 19th century . <p> " The history of the Jewish community in Rome , which was there before the birth of Christ , is fascinating , " Professor Newbigin said . " In a dramatic text printed in 1501 , we find that a series of choruses added to the basic text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred of the Jews . We have evidence that in other cities the Jews were advised to stay indoors during Lent , the six weeks before Easter , when preachers whipped up the populace to a fever pitch . Although we ca n't find a document that states exactly the nature of what happened in 1539 , we do know that the Gonfalone used such preachers . <p> " In 1539 , as the Confraternity passed through the Jewish Quarter , a riot erupted . The violent incident prompted Pope Paul III to put an end to the plays , despite the Confraternity trying several times to start them again . In subsequent years , their procession went to St Peter 's , there were no plays and they no longer passed through the ghetto . <p> " The church always had an ambiguous relationship with the Jews . Based on their reading of the Book of Revelations , the church saw it as the Pope 's responsibility to protect the Jews whom , they believed , should be present at the end of the world . The rhetoric associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the Jews were placed in that small space for their own good . " <p> The Colosseum , which featured so prominently as the space where the Gonfalone dramas were enacted , was begun by Vespasian in 71AD . In 80AD inaugural gladiatorial games were held there . But a careful reading of 18th and 19th century sources reveals that , contrary to popular myth , Christians were not fed to the lions . <p> " Although the amphitheatre was a scene of bloodthirsty entertainment , it was not a site of mass persecutions of Christians , " Professor Newbigin said . " No doubt there were some Christians among the slaves , prisoners and gladiators , who fought with beasts in the Colosseum . The idea of the Colosseum as a place of mass persecution of Christians was cultivated in the 17th century . " 
@@47389045 @889045/ <h> A M P H I T H E A T R V M <p> The amphitheatre is a Roman invention , but ... What is an amphitheatre ? IMO nobody has explained it better than Bill Thayers in his page on the subject : <p> Now before we start , repeat after me : an amphitheatre and a theatre are different types of buildings . Amphi-theatres are " theatres in the round " : amphi- means " around " in Greek . A theatre is a space with a stage , and the audience is on one side of it . People need to hear , so a theatre is relatively small . An amphitheatre is for action : it 's a sports arena , where the spectators sit around the field . They need to see , but they do n't really need to hear , so an amphitheatre can be much larger . <p> The picture on the right ( taken from **28;66;TOOLONG ) shows a Roman theatre and an amphitheatre , still preserved . The city is Arles , in southern France <p> As explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladiatorial fight dates back to 264 BC , when the sons of Brutus Pera offered such a spectacle in the Forum Boarium in Rome ( an area on the left bank of the Tiber used as a cattle market ) to honour the memory of their father . Again in 216 the Forum hosted a combat of 22 pairs of gladiators ; in 183 sixty pairs of gladiators fought at the funerals of Publius Licinius Crassus ; in 174 a show lasted for three days . For a long time in Rome , for lack of a proper amphitheatre , the shows were organized in the Forum or in the Circus Maximus . In the Forum stalls and awnings were prepared for the spectators . In 384 BC censor Gaius Maenius had wooden balconies built on top of the shops around the Forum , and since then the word " maenianum " indicated the stalls of an amphitheatre ( this according to the grammatician Sextus Pompeius Festus , as reported by AA.VV . Il Colosseo , Electa ) . <p> The oldest amphitheatres have been built in Campania ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated at the end of the II century BC ; some others ( Avella , Pozzuoli , Telese ) at the middle of the first century BC . The one of Pompeii , probably the oldest one made of stone , dates back to 69 BC . In Rome the law prohibited the building of structures for shows . Pompey in 55 BC managed to build a theatre only by justifying it as an extension of the Temple of Venus , thus overcoming the ban . Pliny the Elder reports that in 53 or 52 BC C. Scribonius Curio gave games and shows in Rome , and for the occasion he invented an original machine . It was composed of two theatres which could rotate and form one arena . In the morning the public sat in the theatres , then the semicircles were rotated to close the space , so that in the afternoon the people could enjoy the gladiatorial games . Pliny also deplores the fact that the Romans after the first day did not budge from the seats , even while they were being rotated , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls : ... theatra iuxta duo fecit amplissima ligno , cardinum singulorum versatili suspensa libramento , in quibus utrisque antemeridiano ludorum spectaculo edito inter sese aversis , ne invicem obstreperent scaenae , repente circumactis ? ut constat , post primos dies etiam sedentibus aliquis ? , cornibus in se coeuntibus faciebat ampitheatrum gladiatorumque proelia edebat , ipsum magis auctoritatum populum Romanum circumferens .

Sulla , around In the meantime the word amphitheatrum started to indicate the thing that was previously called spectacula , or in greek Theatron kynegeticon ( hunting theatre ) . The first mention belongs to Vitruvius ( De Architectura , I , 7,1 ) .

It seems that wooden structures continued to be popular , regardless of the danger . In 27 AD in Fidene , not far from Rome , one of these wooden amphitheatres collapsed under the excessive weight , killing 20.000 spectators ( if we believe Suetonius ) , or killing and wounding 50.000 ( according to Tacitus ) . <p> Taurus ' amphitheatre , though still in use for a long time , had become inadequate for the splendid shows of the imperial capital , and it seems that Caligula , a great lover of the games had to host the shows in the Saepta , a big public space . Nero in 57 AD finally had a wooden amphitheatre built - it only took one year - for his shows . Suetonius and Tacitus tell us that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it used the longest wooden beam ever seen in Rome : 120 ft. long and 2 ft wide .

" We are not going back to the Colosseum ? s gruesome and tragic origins but will instead give space to art and culture , " Melandri said . The festival will include three tragedies by ancient Greek playwright Sophocles performed between July 19 and Aug. 6 .

There is a similar model of the Colosseum in the amphitheatre itself . I do n't know if one can get a 3d picture . I say : get the real picture , come to Rome and see it . Ciao , Andrea <p> I have a question for you . I am very interested in the exact architecture of the coliseum . I have been there and loved every second basking in its glory . I am a 3D Modeler and I am wanting to recreate to exact detail the coliseum . Do you know of any resources that show the blueprints for the coliseum . Or do you yourself have any blueprints for it ? Thanks . Brett <p> I LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THANKS ! ! ! Thank you so much . That does help . I hope you and your family have a happy holiday season . Brett <p> MORE MODELS Hello , I am doing a research project on the Colosseum . I 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was any other information that you think could help in my paper . The topic is very vage , but i wanted to really concentrate on the architecture . If you have any pictures or descriptions of the interior , especially the very center , that would also help . I was also wondering if you had any ideas on how i could make a model of the colosseum . Something not too large because i 'll have to find a way to get it to school . But i really want it to be realistic and show as much detail as possible . And i 'm willing to spend a lot of time on it . The project is due on December 18 so i have a few weeks to work on it . Thanks you so much , Samantha <p> Dear Samantha , the Colosseum is very big , and even a model is a great challenge ; I think you have seen the page on models under the architecture menu . I thought about your problem , and what I suggest is that you use polistyrene foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape by means of a hot wire ( they sell such instruments in hobby shops ) and that you build only a section of the Colosseum , even less that a quarter of the structure , and that you slice it and show how it was built . You can find some plans in the page **25;96;TOOLONG . Look at the image sect.jpg ; you may just paint the inside instead of making real holes for the arches . Try to show a plan of the underground chambers where the shows were prepared . Good Luck Let me know how it 's gone Ciao Andrea <p> MODELS AGAIN Your website is great . I was wondering if you had more of the information I needed . I am making a scale model of the colosseum as a math project . There are not enough measurements for me to do so . If you could supply me with the information , it would be much appreicated . Thank You , Cheng <p> Dear Cheng , I 'll give you all the measurements I have ( in metres ) . Ellipses : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ellipse of the arena : 75 x 44 <p> Circumference : 527 <p> Max height ( external wall ) 48,5 <p> The arches are 4.20 m. ( 13 ? 9 " ) wide and 7.05 m ( 23 ? 1 " ) high on the ground floor , while on the upper floors they are only 6.45 m ( 21 ? 2 " ) <p> Ciao Andrea <p> UNDERGROUND TOUR Would it be possible if one of your staff or someone else give me a tour of underground at Colosseum ? It is for my history project at University of Hawaii at West Hawaii campus . I am a student ... Any input would be greatly appreciated . Aloha , David Kona , Hawaii <p> Dear David , it is now possible to visit the underground of the Colosseum . It is open to the public for a guided tour , except for days in winter when too much rain is expected ( it may flood ) Ciao , Daniele and Andrea <p> WHO OWNS THE COLOSSEUM ? I am doing a college research paper on the Colosseum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the Italian Government ? " . I need information about this wonderful building today . I was lucky enough to visit Rome in April , but did not know I would be doing this research . There are not many books available on the subject . Thank you , Pat <p> Dear Pat , the Colosseum is part of the State assets . Hope you enjoyed your stay here in Rome , Yours sincerely , Daniele Pepe <p> Hola Lourdes ! Para los externas contrafuertes see the images in the home page and in the page history/rediscovery . Look also under other/imagegallery . I do n't know of any suitable site on the net . Auguri per i tuoi studi , Ciao Andrea <p> CREDENTIALS Would you please send me a list of your credentials . I need to use your website for a school project and my teacher wants me to have proof that the seite that i am using is trustworthy and reliable . <p> Dear ... , My " academic " credential is a degree in political sciences at Rome University . I love my city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hobby . My references for the site are other books , like for anyone doing a study of this kind . In the field of history or archaeology , where all is left to interpretation of hints , generally the credibility of a theory can not be proven by scientific evidence . While reading about the subject I have understood that much of what has been written on the Colosseum is based on some interpretation of the hints we have . I understand your teacher : the problem of the sources and their reliability/credibility is an old one . If you go deep in any subject , you soon realize that the problem of the " original " sources is the most disturbing one . If we take the Colosseum as an example , the original literary sources are few ( they appear in the source page in latin ) , and they have generally been taken as gospel . Example : the fact that Martial says that naval battles were held in the arena has compelled many archeologists to read literally his words and explain that some structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other studies say that naval battles could n't be held at all in the arena , because of the architectural structure of the monument . Were naval battles held in the Colossem or not ? Who knows . There is now a new explanation of it : Martial did not really mean the Colosseum when he wrote about naval battles , but he meant another place or another kind of show , different from what is generally intended as naumachia . Can now Martial , the original source , be taken as gospel ? This should teach us that the truthfulness and reliability of books and papers ( and all information ) on the Colosseum ( and I imagine on every subject ) is as good as we can control it . In other words : Mr. X makes a statement . If he indicates his sources I can go and check . He may have misread or be interested , for some reason , to prove some theory . If his theory is supported by a citation of some other author , should we take it for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to go as back as to the Latin sources . They are very few . You also can start from those , and form your opinion . By the point of view of academic credibility , my site does little more than try to report in a concise way the views of some of the available literature on the subject . I hope your professor will be satisfied . Good chicken hunting , Andrea Pepe <p> WOW , IT WAS HELPFUL ! ! ! thanks , this will help me more than i thougt it could <p> SHALL PROFESSORS APPROVE ? I would like to have some information about who the creators of this website are and what back ground you have for the creation of this site . One of my students is using your website as a resource for her paper and I would just like to make this preliminary check before I approve this site as a valid resource . Thank you , Dott.ssa Lisa Cesarani NYU in Florence <p> Dear Dr.ssa Cesarani , you 'll find some information on the credentials in the " disclaimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " disclaimer " in the main page in English ( the first page that appears with the menu ) . Best Regards , Andrea Pepe <p> SAMPLES Dear Sir/Madam Hello , I am S. from Korea . Your homepage looks fabulous and makes me interested in some pictures in the homepage . Fistly , I saw one particular page which was about the structure of Colossevm . Moreover , there was some pictures of Samples of Colossevm which I was deeply impressed . So , may I ask whether you have some more pictures of Samples and I wonder I can have some unshown pictures , please . Anyway , I deeply appreciate for reading my mail and I am looking forward to hearing from you . Yours Faithfully S. <p> Dear S. , thanks for the compliments . The picture in the homepage is mine , like many in the site . In the Italian homepage there is the same picture but treated in a pictorial way . A lot of pictures have been reproduced from other sources . There is an image gallery where you can see most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and then " image gallery " . I do not understand exactly what you mean for Samples of the Colosseum . Models , maybe ? Ciao , A. Pepe <p> SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE NO MANNERS ... BUT I ? M PATIENT name : XXX Hi ! I was wondering f I could ask you some questions if so my questions are : How is the Roman Colosseum maintained and repaired ? If people still do events there ? Who was the architect ? If your wondering why I 'm asking you all these questions I 'm doing a school report on the Roman Colosseum . Answer back soon ! <p> Hi XXX , the word " please " would have been welcomed , anyway ... <p> - it is the State that pays for the maintenance of the Colosseum - yes they have started recently to have shows in there - the name of the architect is unknown . You could have found the answer to all of these questions in my site . Check the FAQ page . Ciao Andrea <p> WHO MADE IT ? How many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know exactly how many people built the Colosseum . Some estimates have been done of several thousands of workers , also considering that it took only 10 years to build it . Some shortcuts have been taken : the stone pieces of the arches are modular . i.e. have the same size , so that they could be mounted in any arch . We do n't know much either about who the workers were . Legend is that Titus used jewish slaves , prisoners from his wars in Palestine , but we must consider it a rumour , because the ancient sources do not report at all such a thing . The majority of the scholars believes that , given the quality of the construction , mainly made in blocks of limestone and tuff , cement vaults and bricks , most of the work force must have been quite skilled . Therefore if slaves were employed they probably were not a majority . Ciao Andrea <p> SOMETIMES THERE ARE FUNNY STORIES ... I was just reading a news article about the gladiators wanting to get their jobs back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what one of them did to me last summer . I have battled a weight problem for most of my life . In June , my wife and I were on a Globus tour and were visiting the colosseum when one of the gladiators stuck a plastic sword to my stomach and yelled out , " TOO MUCH SPAGHETTI ! " Everyone started laughing and I 've never been so embarrised in my life . My wife and I paid over $7000 for that trip and that one incident ruined the whole trip for both of us . It is something that should never have happened . If that is the way these gladiators treat people , then I do n't think they should have their jobs back . I know that I would have had a much better trip if I 'd never seen them . <p> SITE MAP I love your website , it helped me on my research paper . I just wanted to suggest adding a Site Map . Because you have so many links , and at times it gets confusing . A site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navagite through the website better . It was just a suggestion : ) <p> Dear ... , there is already a site map ( I know it 's quite a vast site and it gets confusing ) . You can find it under the menu Around &gt; Site Map . But if you did n't find it many others have n't so I 'll try to make it more simple to find . Thank you for your comment , Daniele Pepe <p> NAVAL BATTLES My friend tried to tell me that the roman coliseum was filled with water so ship battles would occure . Is this true and if so give referances. thank you <p> Dear Tyrone , the story of naval battles held in the Colosseum is matter of fierce debate . Martial , latin writer , mentions some show like that maybe took place in the Colosseum , but the archaeologists are very doubtful about it , given the structure of the arena , drains etc . The text below can be found at the page " disclaimer " ; see also the page on naumachiae under " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that Martial ( De spectaculis ) says that naval battles were held in the arena has led many authors to find an explanation as to how the arena could be filled with water and then emptied . Some other studies now say that naval battles could n't possibly have been held at all in the arena , because of the architecture of the building . Were naval battles held in the Colosseum or not ? We are not sure anymore . And then we meet a new explanation of it : Martial did not really mean the Colosseum when he wrote about naval battles , but he meant another place or another kind of show , different from what is generally intended as naumachia . Can at this point Martial , the original source , still be credible ? Can we find another meaning in his writings ? And again , can we trust the edition of Martial 's works ? Which edition ? Is the translation adequate ? Is it the only version and/or interpretation of the original parchment codex ? Because there might be another codex that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do we do then ? With limited time and cultural resources , we generally stop in front of printed paper that looks credible enough . The credibility threshold rises with the degree of knowledge . <p> MORE NAVAL BATTLES Very interesting site . I 'm curious about how they got full scale fighting ships into the arena , and how they flooded it for the mock battles that are supposed to have been held <p> Dear Robert , the matter is subject of fierce debate . The fact that Martial ( De spectaculis ) says that naval battles were held in the arena has led many authors to wonder how the arena could be filled with water and then emptied . Some explained that when it was first inaugurated the Colosseum was n't fitted with the underground passages , which were made later , by Domitian . Some recent studies now affirm that naval battles could n't possibly have been held at all in the arena , because of the architecture of the building , draining system and all . Were naval battles held in the Colosseum or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet a new elegant explanation of it : Martial did not really mean the Colosseum when he wrote about naval battles , but he meant another place or another kind of show , different from what is generally intended as naumachia . ... And so on ... Books have been written on this , but IMO nobody knows for sure yet . Ciao Andrea <p> SECURITY AND SHOWTIMES How was security handled at the colosseum during the empire ? What time would the games start and end ? <p> Security in the Colosseum was held by the army , probably praetorians as the other armies were n't allowed to enter Rome , and by vigiles , a kind of police . The games started in the early morning , around 8 a.m. and continued non-stop until dusk . Daniele Pepe <p> libitinensis ( named after the Roman goddess of the underworld , Libitina ) for the dead gladiators ; <p> sanavivaria for the ones who saved their lives , <p> triumphalis , for the winners . <p> The main axis of the Colosseum is oriented more or less SE-NW ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main axis , which is also natural since that is the direction of the ludi . The sanavivaria should be on the opposite side . I do n't know which is the triumphalis one . If I have read it I do n't remember it . <p> There were 18 Vestals at a time : 6 novices chosen as young girls of 10-11 years from the best senatorial families , families without stain in their backgrounds . 6 were the practicing Vestals , and 6 were " retired " and acted as teachers for the novices . Probably the Vestals themselves would have suggested names of novices , but the Pontifex Maximus would have had to make the final decision . The work of the Vestals was to tend the sacred fire of the hearth , symbolic of the home . They also had to prepare sacred ground grain for sacrificial rituals and to function as models of moral behavior , since they had to remain virgins for their 30 years of service . After that time they could marry , but few did . For breaking their vow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . They lived in palatial quarters in the Forum behind the round Temple to Vesta where the sacred fire was kept . They had their own box at the Colosseum , and witnessed from their ring-side seats the games , along with the rest of the audience . <p> I add : originally women were not admitted to the games ; later on this prohibition fell into disuse and the amphitheatres provided opportunities for meeting the other sex . After this period of permissivess , reaction came : August assigned special seats to all the classes , guilds and authorities , and relegated the women to the higher tiers . The Vestals were an exception : they were the only women who had a box in the amphitheatre . I do n't think they had any role on the occasion , except that of showing themselves in public , like VIP today do at the stadiums . <p> MODELS Hello , I am doing a research project on the Colosseum .

Look in the books of the bibliography . <p> COMPLIMENTS ? GLADIATOR THE MOVIE Hello and Thank you for this marvelous website ! Currently , I am finishing up a report on the architectural similarities and differences in the movie Gladiator ( 2000 ) to historical documents . They used CGI - Computer Generated Imagery - to recreate the Colosseum to great detail . I have not found too many inaccurate details in the movie . I would appreciate your opinion on the topic and any factual mistakes they made . Thank you ! <p> Dear Kenny , I am not an expert but I can say that the film was quite accurate in reconstruction . Of course there will be hundreds of discussions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I think that there were too many trapdoors in the arena . Surely there was a big central one and many all around , but I think that the arena was free from obstacles during the fights , also from poles . Fights were credible , and the costumes were accurate enough . I liked the " uniforms " of the soldiers in Germany at the beginning of the story , though the fire throwing machines would have been impossible to operate in that terrain . They were used in the sieges of cities . A more expert archaeologist friend of mine said that the film was OK , but that the hairdo of the women was not really consistent with the historical period of the story ( fashion changed during the centuries ! ) . I had n't noticed .... Ciao Andrea <p> WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE ? Hello , I am David from Spain . I am Working at tv program that is a quiz show . It is called " Who wants to be a millionare ? .

You and your office colleagues will enjoy my site at last Ciao Andrea <p> FOOD &amp; SNACKS How did the Romans provide food and water for the spectators at the Colosseum and were there bathroom facilities at the Colosseum ? ThanksThe spectators ate fruit and nuts at the games , and some people probably also ate the animals who were slaughtered ( remains have been found in the sewers ) . As to water , It is not clear how and where , but many archaeologists guess that there must have been toilets and fountains , since traces of piping , placed on the pillars at regular intervals , have been attributed to the presence of drinking fountains and probably also toilets with running water . <p> MONEY How was the Colosseum paid for and by whom ? I imagine that something of such great magnitude would take more than government money.Dear Reynaldo , things were different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really exist . There were steady institutions , but government and the rulers ( the emperors ) were basically the same thing . The Colosseum was paid for by the Flavian emperors ( a family ) that had taken over the power . Some formal rules had to be respected ( homage to the gods and the Senate ) but since Caesar times the emperors had convinced the Romans to accept the foreign ( eastern mediterranean ) concept that the king was a god . In the case of the Colosseum the money probably came from the booty of the wars in Palestine waged by the Flavian emperors . Actually , if we think of the wars waged today by the Bush presidents to protect their oil-based interests , things are not all that different ... Only , I think that the Bushes did not build an equivalent monument <p> SPELLING - V or U ? if you did n't notice , the title bar Says " colossevm " is it soposted to be spelled with a " v " ? I do n't  think so . Dear Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a " V " ( see the writing of " Claudio " in the image below ) , so I thought it could have been ironic to write the titles of all the pages like that .

@@47389050 @889050/ <h> E C H O E S <p> Running Head : Roman Colosseum <p> Echoes from the Colosseum : Building today on yesterday <p> Monika Mickutd <p> DTCC <p> April 20 , 2004 <p> Dear Cel Brant : <p> The following is my term paper about the Roman Colosseum . During my research , I have gathered a lot of wonderful information and facts about the ancient engineering and architecture . In addition , the information broadened my knowledge about certain building materials , methods and terminology . <p> I found it surprising that not many architects or engineers know about old-fashioned building techniques . It was very difficult to find a qualified interviewee on the topic , but Andrea Pepe gave me a very detailed discussion about the Colosseum . Even though he is not a professional archeologist or architect , she is one of the creators of the Web Page www.the-colosseum.net which was as the main source for this research . <p> I believe that I will be able to incorporate the knowledge I gained in my architectural work in the future . In addition , programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to broaden everyone ? s view . Romans ? passion , precision , and skill reflects in every their building , even after 2000 years . Today ? s structures deserve long lasting life and appreciation as well , which can be achieved by combining both modern discoveries and ancient secrets of engineering . <p> I enjoyed working on this research paper , and I hope you will enjoy reading it just as much . If there are any further questions that you might have , I will be more than happy to answer them . <p> To improve modern structures , knowledge about the ancient engineering methods is important . Roman Colosseum , which was built in less than 10 years and stood for nearly two millennia , is one of the examples to learn from . It was built next to the lake , so drains were installed 8 to 10 m below the arena . When engineers reached the clay bed , they filled a doughnut shape foundation with concrete . Because the first tier of arches was built with travertine stone , construction was carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Architect is unknown , but his careful details of the design entitle the Colosseum to be " perfect " . <p> In approximately ten years , ancient Romans managed to erect and complete an enormous structure of the Roman Colosseum , which is also called the Amphitheatrum Flavium . Emperor Vespasian started the building in 72 A.D. , while his son , emperor Titus , dedicated it in 80 A.D .. Today , after nearly two millenniums , the Amphitheatrum Flavium still remains one of the oldest , most perfect , and most important examples of architecture and engineering . The unknown architect of the Colosseum considered every detail so carefully and precisely , that building conquered the biggest two enemies : a destructive nature of a human and time . <p> An unsuccessful search for qualified interviewees about the Colosseum showed that there is only a fraction of architects who would know about the ancient engineering methods . In addition , many of today ? s modern buildings fail ? young ? or while being built . For example , the 5-story garage belonging to the Tropicana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The idea of combining modern achievements in engineering and architecture with the ancient world ? s secrets is reasonable . It is impossible to uncover every detail of the Colosseum ? s design and construction because it was built so long ago . However , learning the major discoveries that the archeologists have found over the centuries is crucial . <p> After numerous uprisings and disasters in Rome , Vespasian was loosing his fame as an emperor . To regain Romans favor back , he decided to give his nation a public building as a " present " to them . The Colosseum was to be built on the land previously taken away from the Roman people , where emperor Nero had his palace ( " Colosseum : Gladiator ? s Story " , 2004 ) . As the Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill said to the BBC News correspondent B. Baron ( 2004 ) , " emperors depended crucially on the Colosseum for their fame . " <p> The Colosseum served its political and public purpose well . " Munera " ( gladiator fights ) , " venationes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( naval battles ) were the major " games " that attracted approximately 55,000 people each time for bloody entertainment . Thumbs up from the emperor meant life for the looser gladiator , while thumbs down meant death . About 90% of the gladiators were granted the thumbs up sign ( " Colosseum : Gladiator ? s Story " , 2004 ) . <p> On the present location of the Colosseum , emperor Nero had his " Domus Aurea " ( Golden Palace ) with huge gardens around it . After Nero ? s death , Vespasian decided to give this land back to the Roman people in a shape of public building . The site was surrounded by four hills : Palatine , Velia , Esquiline , and Celio . It was on the shore of a little Nero ? s lake , which during certain seasons caused the site to become a wetland . <p> Drainage and foundation had to be engineered very carefully because of the heavy superstructure for this type of land . To prevent the future settlement of a building , Romans reached a clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major support for the foundation . Enormous drains were located the way , that no matter what " the bottom of the arena remains 10 meters above that of the drain " . Below is Keith ? s Hopkins ? s ( 2003 ) description of the foundation : <p> drains were built 8m ( 26ft ) underneath the structure , to take away the streams that flow from the surrounding valleys and hills . Then foundations , roughly in the shape of a doughnut , made of concrete : under the outer walls and seating , they are 12-13m ( 39-42ft ) deep , while under the inner ellipse of the arena , they are only 4m ( 13ft ) deep , and designed in strips beneath each of the concentric walls . ( See Figure A ) <p> The excavation area had a perimeter of 530 meters ( 1739 ft ) . It was filled up with Roman cement , mortar , and limestone . For additional firmness and strength , Romans hammered all three materials . " The entire base of the Colosseum was equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To make the excavation less labor intense , Romans used the excess soil and " waist materials " from the previously existing houses . By adding all this spoil around the excavation , Romans lifted the level of the site and deepened the foundation by approximately 11 meters ( 36 ft ) ( Hopkins , 2003 ) . <p> Engineers reinforced the foundation by two 6 meters ( 20 ft ) deep and 3 meters ( 10 ft ) wide brick walls . While one of the walls follows the outer layout of an ellipse shape of the foundation , the second wall follows the inner ellipse , directly under the arena . <p> It is known , that during dedication of the Colosseum in 80 A.D. , Titus staged a ship-battle scene in the amphitheatre . The arena was filled with water , about one meter deep , therefore , basement could not exist jet ( Hopkins , 2003 ) . <p> Within a year or two , emperor Titus built so called " subterranean area " , which laid directly on the foundation . It contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performances satisfying the spectators : rooms for gladiators , cages for wild animals , stage scenery equipment , and decorations , special machinery for animal control , elevators , etc . ( Velius , 2001 ) . <p> The top elevation of the basement is like a maze . Numerous narrow passages were utilized to lead animals to their cages or elevators , so that the main corridors remained safe and free for circulation . Most of the substructure walls follow the elliptical shape of the Colosseum , while others , however , " are parallel to the major axis . " Standing on the brick pavement base and holding wooden floor of the arena from the top , these walls reach up to 6 meters ( 20 ft ) height ( Platner , 2003 ) . <p> The Colosseum has its own original shape of an ellipse . It was designed by combining two semicircular theatres facing each other ( see Figure B ) ( Velius , 2001 ) . Jones M. W. ( 2000 , p.88 ) suggests the way of drawing the shape of the amphitheatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major ( x-x ? ) and minor axis , similar to the coordinate system . Then , draw a right triangle with 3:4:5 ratio , so that the 90 angle occurs on the origin ( 0 ; 0 ) . <p> Continue drawing triangles as in step one for the remaining quadrants . The sides of the triangles should be extended at the points A and A ? each way . It will set the boundaries for the ellipse . <p> Distance A-A ? is set to be equal to the width of the arena , which is centered on the minor axis and indicated with points C and C ? . Then , draw an arc so that it crosses points C and C ? while the center of an arc is B ? and B respectively . Close the end of an ellipse by drawing an arc from point d1 and d2 with the center being A ? . Repeat it for the opposite side as well . <p> For the rest of the structure , the width of the cavea has to be determined ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width of the arena ) . Follow similar method as for drawing arena ( step 3 ) . <p> The major axis of the Colosseum measures 188 m ( 617 ft ) and it is oriented WSW-ESE , while the minor axis is 156 m ( 512 ft ) long . The height of the Colosseum reaches 48.5 m ( 159 ft ) ( Pepe A. , Pepe D. , and McElwee , 2003 ) . <p> The first ( ground ) floor contains of 80 arch entrances divided evenly along the perimeter , which is build in Doric style ( Hopkins , 2003 ) . Arcs are 4.20 m ( 14 ft ) wide and 7 m ( 23 ft ) high . The pillars in between the arches are 2.40 m ( 7.87 ft ) wide and 2.70 m ( 8.85 ft ) deep with a column of them ( Platner , 2003 ) . <p> Arches of all three floors differ in order . Second and third floors are built Ionic and Corinthian styles respectively . They also are smaller than those on the ground floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft ) . Between each pillar is a half column . The fourth floor has no arches , but rectangular windows instead ; a window above every other arch of the third story . <p> Romans covered the foundation by 90 cm thick travertine layer . " The base blocks of the pillars were anchored to the floor by pivot and melted metal " in previously marked locations . Builders could perform construction on the first and second floors at the same time . They raised the " skeleton of pillars " to the second floor and cemented them with 2 ft long brick arches for firmness . While still working on the ground floor , construction of the " rampant vaults " for the cavea and seat support could be carried out on the upper levels as well . According to the interviewee Andrea Pepe , this original construction method is the greatest structural detail of the Roman Colosseum : <p> In my opinion , the most outstanding factor is the building technique , i.e. doing the first rounds of arches in travertine so that the completion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under this first structure . It took only 10 years to build ! ( For full interview see Figure E ) ( Personal communication , March , 2004 ) <p> So that arches would be able to carry heavy loads ( especially the ones on the first tier ) , Romans used the keystone technique , which allowed transmit forces from the top of an arch to its footing . Because of its shape , the keystone transmits forces to the " voussoir blocks " , which during construction are temporarily supported by a wooden frame . From the Voussoirs forces travel through the impost to the pier until it finally reaches the foundation of an arch ( Crystal , 2004 ) . <p> Pillars on the first floor were filled up with tufa , while the ones on the second floor received " cement aggregate " with " brick facing " . A lot of stone at the higher levels of the Colosseum was recycled from other buildings ; for a firm block connection , Romans used metal clamps . <p> While the first tier of arches rests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns lay on the pedestals ( Smith , 2004 ) . The unknown architect calculated the biggest pressure to fall on the first and second stories . For that reason the largest blocks of travertine make the exterior of an amphitheatre , while smaller ones are in the interior . The rest of the building Romans finished with " blocks of peperino and concrete " ( Platner , 2003 ) . <p> Next to the overall structure , fourth story looks modest . It looked like an attic , without corridors , and with Corinthian pillars resting against the walls ( Smith , 2004 ) . Three consoles were placed between each pair of pillars , right above the windows . Consoles contained sockets for the wooden posts holding velarium ( awning ) ( see Figure D ) ( Platner , 2003 ) . <p> Each arch of the second and third floors held a statue of either emperor or god , while bronze shields decorated exterior walls . White marble covered the seats and walls ; sealing were ornamented with painted stucco . Higher floors , however , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class spectators ( Hopkins , 2003 ) . <p> According to the archeologists ? discoveries , Vespasian was responsible for the first two rows of the arcades to be built . He dedicated the Amphitheatrum Flavium right before his death , in 79 A.D. His son Titus added third and fourth stories . He expanded seating for lower class Romans and dedicated it with 100 day games in 80 A.D. Vespasian ? s other son Domitian finished clipea and decorated the exterior of the building with bronze shields ( Platner , 2003 ) . <p> Some sources claim , that slave labor was used for the most of the construction , because the amphitheatre was erected so fast . Others , however , say that the Colosseum is too perfect to be built by slaves . For the interview , Andrea Pepe said that workers were skilled , and slaves only did rough stone cutting ( personal communication , March , 2004 ) , when Mark ( marq78 , personal communication , March 10 , 2004 ) claims , that slaves did the majority of work , just like for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews see Figures E and F ) . <p> Romans used a variety of materials , most of which were different species of stone . The actual stone was determined by the loads to be carried : <p> They are used based on how much of a load they can support . Travertine is at the lower levels , as it can support the most , and tufa and brick are found in areas that require less loading . ( Personal communications , March 10 , 2004 ) <p> Some travertine blocks were cut into pieces of 5 10 feet . Each one of them was marked to indicate its exact location ( Smith , P. , 2004 ) . Tufa was used to fill in the gaps , while cement was perfect for vaults because of its light nature ( personal communication , March , 2004 ) . Romans consumed about 300 tons of metal for the clamps connecting the blocks ( " The Roman Colosseum " , 2001 ) . Most of the stone was quarried in the lands of the Roman Empire . For convenience , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building area . <p> 80 arch entrances let the spectators and performers into the Colosseum. 76 public entrances were marked from I to LXXVI ( 1-76 ) counter-clock wise , while the four at each axis were unnumbered ( Hopkins , 2003 ) . Emperors and other nobles utilized the unnumbered entrances at the short axis of the amphitheatre . One of the entrances led directly to the imperial box , and another to a similar seat for the emperor ? s guests . Entrances at the long axis of the Colosseum were dedicated to the gladiators , their teachers and owners ( Platner , 2003 ) . The western arch was called " Libitinarian Gate . " To honor deceased gladiators and killed animals , they were carried out through this gate ( Crystal , 2004 ) . The opposite entrance leads directly to the arena and subterranean area ( Platner , 2003 ) . <p> There is a pattern of 5 different entrances to the amphitheatre , which is repeated all around the perimeter . The 12 " b type " paths led to the lower senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the upper senators ? seats . 20 " a " paths led to the " maenianum primum " and to the upper sections . 16 " c " and 16 " e " paths led to the same corridor of the " a type " . <p> Corridors were " running uninterruptedly round the building , behind which again is another precisely similar corridor " ( see Figure C ) ( Smith , 2004 ) . About 5.8 m ( 19 ft ) towards the inside from the outer wall of the Colosseum , there is another similar wall , and about 4.5 m ( 15 ft ) further , there is one more , creating two main passageways of the ground floor in between . Almost directly above , on the second and third floors , similar corridors are located ( Platner , 2003 ) . <p> The first corridor , at the outer rim of the amphitheater controlled main circulation . Eighty walls dividing the space behind the second corridor served multiple purposes . It supported the structure , then , part of it was a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second part of it took to a similar third hallway . Fourth corridor is slightly smaller , because one of its walls is the same as podium , which is thicker than the rest of the walls . The entire space under the cavea was dedicated to the easy and quick circulation of the spectators ( Smith , 2004 ) . <p> A long axis of the arena is about 80 m ( 258 ft ) , and short one is about 46 m ( 150 ft ) . The wall surrounding it is called " podium " . It is about 4.5 m ( 15 ft ) high and on the top holds first few rows of the spectator seats as well as the imperial box ( Velius , 2001 ) . For additional protection from wild animals , a further fence was erected inside the arena ( Hopkins , 2003 ) . <p> The wooden floor was covered with about 15 cm of " harena " ( sand ) to absorb gladiator and animal blood . Sometimes the sand would be already painted in red to cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also was hiding numerous trap doors for the animals to appear in the middle of the fight scene ( Scott director , 2000 ) . So that animals would not jump over the podium , trained archers sat in the niches placed in the service tunnel between the podium and arena . <p> During the first year after dedication , naval battles were performed in the Colosseum . Before the games , wooden floor would be removed and the arena would be filled up with water . Since it required long and careful preparation , naval battles were removed to another site ( " The Coliseum of ancient Rome , " 1997 ) . <p> About 10,000 slaves , war prisoners , and volunteers were killed in the arena of the Colosseum . The last gladiator fight was in 404 A.D. , but animal hunt shows were held until the 6th century ( " The Coliseum of ancient Rome , " 1997 ) . <p> A clear distinction between the classes of the citizens was very important in ancient Roman society . The seating arrangement in the Colosseum reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the podium were dedicated to the senators with their personal chairs . Emperor sat on the podium as well , in his personal imperial box . <p> High-class citizens , such as knights and other rich Romans sat at the second level called " maenianum primum . " Third level was divided into tree more parts . " Maenianum secundum imum " was for the middle class citizens and military men . Low-class Romans had their seats assigned at the " maenianum secundum summum " , while very poor and women were not allowed lower than to the forth story to the standing area only , " maenianum summum in ligneis " . <p> Noble ones enjoyed white marble seats ; some of them were with cushions . Lower class Romans watched the games sitting on the wooden benches ( " The Coliseum of ancient Rome , " 1997 ) . Architect designed the building to hold about 55,000 spectators , which was possible . But " except for the front rows on the podium , spectators were packed like sardines in the tin " left with about 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Above the " maenianum summum in ligneis " a platform was built . Archeologists predict it to be a space for sailors , who maneuvered velariums ( awnings ) . 240 wooden posts supported velarium at the top of the Colosseum while stones in the ground held the ropes to assist the sailors . Although it has not been proven , that stones around the building were necessarily used for the awnings ( personal communication , March , 2004 ) . <p> Velarium protected the spectators from the burning summer sun . It also provided cool air for the cavea . Because of the hole in the middle , it " sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide the breeze for the audience " ( Communication , 2004 ) . Awnings covered about one third of the inside because of the limited length of the post supporting it ( Hopkins , 2003 ) . <p> The Amphitheatrum Flavium lived through multiple disasters . In 217 the upper floor caught on fire . Three earthquakes in 442 , 470 , and 847 weakened the structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle ages . During the Renaissance , part of the stone from the Colosseum was recycled for other buildings . Because of the drainage failure , passages of under the arena filled up with dirt . Earthquake in 1231 destroyed a big part of the wall from the Southwest side . <p> At the beginning of the nineteenth century , restoration works began . Firstly , remains of the outer wall were reinforced . In 1840 ? s more arches were restored , and in 1870 , half the debris was removed from under arena . A lot of restoration jobs were performed since WW2 with the major project in 1978 . Then more arches were rebuilt . Small works on the Colosseum continued up until the year 2000 . <p> Travertine pavement around the Colosseum in the shape of square is the only spot , which remains at the same level as in the antiquity . <p> Only 32 arches on the northern side ( XXIII to LIV ) still exist . The original arena floor is long gone , but a wooden stage was built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Barron , 2004 ) . Marble no longer covers amphitheatre ? s walls or seats . Archeologists have only found 65 capitals of columns , 9 bases of columns , pieces of cornices and consoles , and fragments of the barriers . <p> Recently , the mayor of Rome , Valter Veltroni , and architect Aymonino considered the reconstruction of the Colosseum . To redesign the area around the arena , rebuild the missing wall with red brick is in their plans ( for more comments about the article see figure C , question 8 ) ( Willey , 2004 ) . <p> In the eyes of Gibbon , the Colosseum is perfect : " Nothing was omitted , which in any respect could be subservient to the convenience and pleasure of the spectators " ( Smith , 2004 ) . It also is perfect structurally . Not many buildings across the world can carry that label of " perfect , " especially today . Ancient engineering methods seem to be ignored by many builders .

He gave an interview via e-mail to assist in writing this research paper . <p> Q : According to you , what is the most outstanding structural detail of the Roman Colosseum ? <p> A : There are many : the formal elegance , the solidity of the construction , the organization of the spaces ( entrance/exit system , underground spaces for machines and beasts ) . In my opinion the most outstanding factor is the building technique , i.e. doing the first rounds of arches in travertine so that the completion of the construction could take place at the same time above and under this first structure . It took only 10 years to build it ! <p> Q : Please explain , how did the Romans make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , if any , did they use to assist the sailors ? <p> A : There are many theories about the Velarium , but I find most of them unsatisfactory . We don ? t even know for sure if the ropes were attached to the stones placed around the base of the amphitheatre and how they were utilized ( see the velarium page ) . I am ignorant of sailing matters , but I imagine that the vele must have been very very thin , so as to save weight , and that sailors used devices that reduced the effort to pull the ropes ( these contraptions then were already known to builders ) . <p> Q : From my ancient history classes I recall the fact that there were big pitchers under the spectator seats in the amphitheatres . At first the researchers thought it served as a bathroom , but later it was discovered that the pitchers were used for the acoustical purposes . Could you comment this statement ? How did it serve its purpose and it was placed in the structure ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the pitchers . Imagine the smell ... In the Colosseum they could not have been stored under the seats because there is no " under seat " room . The seats were like steps . For the Colosseum , recent studies have hypotheses that there may have been toilets ( which are very reasonable , considering that the games lasted all day long ) . Maybe for the pitchers the acoustical purpose makes sense ( an enormous jug band ! ) . <p> Q : Someone told me that one of the Colosseum ? s mysteries is the bathroom . What would be your theory about the placement of the bathrooms in the Amphitheatrum Flavium ? <p> A : I leave the theories to the experts . They have identified certain places as probable toilets . The fact is that the Colosseum was used for centuries afterwards for different purposes , and many traces of the old fittings have been lost . <p> Q : Some sources also state that slavery was used to build the Colosseum ; other sources however , state that the amphitheatre is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory do you support and why ? <p> A : Slaves may have been used for the menial jobs ( manpower , brickmaking , rough cutting of the stones etc. ) but the quality of the final construction suggests that the workers were skilled . We understand from little details of the construction that it was subcontracted to 4 different builders , one for each quadrant . Keep in mind that building in general was an art in which ancient Romans were experts . They really built things to last for centuries , as it is witnessed by innumerable remains all around the Mediterranean . <p> Q : During my research I found that the reason the Colosseum is structurally strong and still remains is the different materials used such as tufa , travertine , brick , and cement . How do all these different materials work together ? <p> A : <p> Travertine is extremely solid and can stand a very heavy weight . <p> Tufa is a good rock for filling spaces and some types of it are very resistant . <p> Bricks are adaptable and light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very light if mixed ? as they did ? with pumix stone , and is fast to cast . <p> Q : Isn ? t it important to take into account the different expansion factors , resistance , etc. , of the different materials while designing the building ? <p> A : Yes of course . Especially resistance , in the case of the C ... That is why the main structure is made of very resistant travertine , and the other structures were built afterwards . In any case they are all " stone " materials . I imagine that with modern materials like concrete , steel and glass the expansion factor is much more critical . <p> Q : Right by the Colosseum there is one of the main roads . Constant traffic moves around the foundation of the Colosseum . What kind of the major damage does the traffic do to the Roman Colosseum and how can it be prevented ? <p> A : In my opinion the biggest damage to the foundations may be caused by the underground railway line that passes very near the Colosseum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation a little , but great damage is caused by the smog , that attacks the travertine and corrodes it . There have always been projects to isolate the Colosseum from the traffic ( the latest one re-emerged a few weeks ago ) , but to no avail . <p> Q : BBC News just released the article about the restoration of the Roman Colosseum with the red brick ? Have you heard anything about it , and what would be your position in this issue ? <p> A : I did not really follow this story then ( we have heard so many during the years ! ! ) , but I found the article and these are my comments : <p> " Plans to restore ancient Rome spur dissent By David WilleyBBC correspondent in Rome " " Controversial plans are afoot to revamp Rome 's historic center - to give visitors a better insight into how the ancient city looked . A 78-year-old Italian professor of architecture , Carlo Aymonino , has been entrusted by the city 's mayor with redesigning the area around the Roman forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The proposal to isolate the Forums , the Colosseum and a big sector of the city from modernity was first advanced by the French around 1810 and since then it resurfaced many times . In my opinion the " Parco Archeologico " would be a good thing for tourists and Romans , but then public transport around and beneath it should be greatly improved , so as to substitute the roads that we use now . My motto is : respect the dead but think about the living ! I would substitute the road with an underground line beneath the Forums , under the archaeological stratum , or a kind of tramway , or some innovative mean of transport ( like in theme parks ) . I am strongly convinced that many more underground lines are badly needed in Rome . Road traffic is literally chocking the city , and it also looks lousy . In any case there is no major consensus in Rome about this proposal , which is one of the many that appear every now and then . As for the soaring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His plan is to do away with the modern road leading to the Colosseum , the ancient Roman amphitheatre where gladiators once fought wild animals - and each other - to entertain the crowds . The modern road , built by Mussolini , covers many important ruins . " <p> It is true that the modern road built by Mussolini covers ruins , but the news are that the recent right wing government has had it declared " monumento nazionale " , so that it got the same status of the most important ancient monuments and it seems that it can not be touched anymore ( at least until there is a right wing government that loves Mussolini and his memories ! ) . In the past few years the spaces right and left of the road ( there were gardens ) were excavated , but they stopped at the level of 17th century cellars , which is not at all interesting ( all you see is a maze of small rooms and walls ) and there is no continuity with the rest of the Forums around . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the outer wall of the Colosseum with red brick .

Reconstructing the whole thing would be very expensive ! <p> " He wants to clean out the weeds and the rubble nearby and to reconstruct part of the temple of Jupiter - which formed the heart of ancient Rome - adding a transparent dome amid the ruins . " <p> Hmmm , interesting ! I think of the Louvre Pyramid ! But Italian archaeologists have a very conservative approach about monuments . <p> " Many classical scholars say they are aghast at the idea of turning Rome 's center into what they fear would become an archaeological theme park . " <p> You see ? I told you . They are aghast . What ? s wrong with teaching Roman culture to tourists by modern means ? A theme park gives a service to the customers .

Tourists literally loved it . Ruins are much more interesting if you understand how they were when new . <p> " In modern times , Romans have hotly debated how - and whether - to restore ancient monuments.For many centuries they simply ripped apart the ruins of imperial Rome and recycled the building materials for new palaces and churches . Most modern archaeologists prefer minimalist restoration . " <p> Story from BBC NEWS <p> A : My position in general is that restorations should appear as such ( I think that this is has been for long the trend in archaeology ) and should not try to be concealed . In any case one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unknown ( I think of Knossos , in Crete , a Hollywoodian reconstruction ) . <p> Q : Is it possible to restore the Colosseum so that structurally it would look and serve as it did in the ancient times ? Why ? ( How ? ) <p> A : Yes , it would be possible to restore the monument in this way , but it would be very very expensive and time consuming . As to the why , it would be to produce shows . As to the how , it would not be at all impossible with modern means . <p> Q : Currently , there is a new wooden stage being built on the ruins of the old one , which will be used for modern plays . Is it safe ? <p> A : It is a reconstruction of half of the arena , rather solid and safe . There have already been plays , but very serious ones ( a Greek tragedy in Persian ! ! ! ) , apart from Paul McCartney ? s little concert inside ( 2-300 people ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there is still the halo of the legend of Christian martyrs . Remember that the Pope has revamped the ancient tradition of the Via Crucis ( a religious ceremony about the Death of Christ ) just outside the Colosseum , so there is the danger of appearing sacrilegious . <p> Q : Will the Colosseum ? s basement ruins be able to hold the loads ? <p> A : Noooo problem . The basement is not in ruins . Look at the page on foundations . <p> I posted interview questions on discussion board LONG ... for additional primary sources . A grad student at UC Berkeley Mark ( marq78 ) answered a few of the questions . Because he is taking a class on Roman Colosseum , his answers are considered trustworthy . <p> Q : Some sources state , that there were the slavery was used to build the Colosseum , other sources , however , state that the amphitheatre is too perfect and it was built by the experts . Which theory do you support and why ? <p> A : The Colosseum was most definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no other way they could have finished a building this large in such a short amount of time ( 5-8 years ) . Most of the labor did not have to be skilled , it was hard labor that only required people to lift or pull ropes . <p> Q : During my research I found that the reason the Colosseum is structurally strong and still remains is the different materials used such as tufa , travertine , brick , and cement . How do all these different materials work together ?

One historian writes that during the late Middle Ages , " practically every hamlet from Italy to England felt constrained to offer its version of the biblical tale at Easter . " Another remarks that " the life of the city stopped , shops were closed , convents and monasteries were deserted ; entire populations gathered for several days for ' the shows . ' " <p> These Passion Plays were embroidered and elaborated over the years , and one of the tragic developments was the representation of Jews as the villains . In one passion play , which lasted two days , the first day was a lengthy discussion by devils about their plot to kill Jesus , a plot ultimately assigned to the Jews who were eager to cooperate . The next day 's action included a lengthy ( 700 lines ) horrendous description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunting Jesus . " Around the cross Jews whirl in a dance of abandon and joy , mocking their victim . " <p> The emotions of rage worked up by such vivid drama were sometimes intensified by the clergy .

" The homes of Jews were then bombarded by stones all week , a practice that was officially abolished in the 12th century , but was still being followed a century later .

Indeed , Passion Plays were banned in Rome in 1539 because they were regularly followed by the sacking of the Jewish ghetto along the Tiber River . Pope Innocent IV tried ( but failed ) to stem the tide of accusations of ritual murder against the Jews , a slander that began on the eve of a Good Friday in England when the body of a child was discovered and the story invented that Jews killed a Christian on Good Friday to mock Jesus ' crucifixion . But at other times the authorities reflected the popular mood , as in this example of medieval Spanish law , " We also forbid any Jew to dare to leave his house or his quarter on Good Friday , but they must all remain shut up until Saturday morning ; if they violate this law , we decree that they shall not be entitled to any reparation for any injury or dishonor inflicted upon them by Christians .

@@47389057 @889057/ <h> Passion Plays <p> The University of Sydney News - 24 February 2000 <p> Passion plays that inspired violence in Rome - By Anne Sarzin <p> When Associate Professor Nerida Newbigin travels to Rome in September to meet the Pope at the Roman Church 's Jubilee ? marking the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of Christ ? she will also get a chance to bring her own research alive . <p> Professor Newbigin will walk in the processional footsteps of people who produced passion plays in the Colosseum . These religious plays were sometimes highly inflammatory , inspiring hatred of the Jews . They were prohibited in 1539 by Pope Paul III after one provoked violence in the Jewish Quarter . <p> Professor Newbigin will attend a Jubilee conference in Viterbo before presenting the proceedings to the Pope on a Sunday dedicated to university teachers . While in Rome she will follow the processional route taken by members of the 15th to 19th century Confraternity of the Gonfalone , a male-dominated institution for the laity that played a significant role in Roman life . <p> In collaborative research with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of New York , Professor Newbigin , of the University 's Department of Italian , has examined the literary and historical records of the Confraternity of the Gonfalone . <p> For a short period between 1490 and 1539 , the Confraternity produced plays for Easter in the Colosseum in Rome . They also ran a hospital for pilgrims , gave dowries to respectable virgins , looked after the sick and performed pious deeds on special feast days . " It was a grassroots expression of devotion and spirituality , " Professor Newbigin said . <p> Professor Newbigin , who worked previously in the area of Florentine religious drama , has researched the Gonfalone 's records contained in the Vatican Secret Archives . When the Gonfalone disbanded in the 19th century , the Church took over their properties and archives . <p> The Confraternity used the Colosseum as a theatre for their dramatic performances . The crowd , possibly as many as 70,000 , assembled in the arena and the players performed among the ascending rows in the amphitheatre . " They put a lot of effort into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of doing plays properly and in a dignified manner , " Professor Newbigin said . <p> The plays were re-enactments of the events of the Holy Week of Easter ? the miracles , temptation , passion , and resurrection of Christ . In a typical year , the Gonfalone assembled on Good Friday and walked in devout procession from the Santa Lucia Church , through the Jewish Quarter , to the Colosseum . At the end of the play , they carried an actor representing the dead Christ back from the Colosseum to their church , singing hymns and flagellating as they walked . <p> The Chapel of Santa Maria Della Pieta in the Colosseum , used by the Confraternity of the Gonfalone for its plays , was demolished in the course of archaeological restorations in the 19th century . <p> " The history of the Jewish community in Rome , which was there before the birth of Christ , is fascinating , " Professor Newbigin said . " In a dramatic text printed in 1501 , we find that a series of choruses added to the basic text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred of the Jews . We have evidence that in other cities the Jews were advised to stay indoors during Lent , the six weeks before Easter , when preachers whipped up the populace to a fever pitch . Although we ca n't find a document that states exactly the nature of what happened in 1539 , we do know that the Gonfalone used such preachers . <p> " In 1539 , as the Confraternity passed through the Jewish Quarter , a riot erupted . The violent incident prompted Pope Paul III to put an end to the plays , despite the Confraternity trying several times to start them again . In subsequent years , their procession went to St Peter 's , there were no plays and they no longer passed through the ghetto . <p> " The church always had an ambiguous relationship with the Jews . Based on their reading of the Book of Revelations , the church saw it as the Pope 's responsibility to protect the Jews whom , they believed , should be present at the end of the world . The rhetoric associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the Jews were placed in that small space for their own good . " <p> The Colosseum , which featured so prominently as the space where the Gonfalone dramas were enacted , was begun by Vespasian in 71AD . In 80AD inaugural gladiatorial games were held there . But a careful reading of 18th and 19th century sources reveals that , contrary to popular myth , Christians were not fed to the lions . <p> " Although the amphitheatre was a scene of bloodthirsty entertainment , it was not a site of mass persecutions of Christians , " Professor Newbigin said . " No doubt there were some Christians among the slaves , prisoners and gladiators , who fought with beasts in the Colosseum . The idea of the Colosseum as a place of mass persecution of Christians was cultivated in the 17th century . "

Brett <p> MORE MODELS Hello , I am doing a research project on the Colosseum . I 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was any other information that you think could help in my paper . The topic is very vage , but i wanted to really concentrate on the architecture . If you have any pictures or descriptions of the interior , especially the very center , that would also help . I was also wondering if you had any ideas on how i could make a model of the colosseum . Something not too large because i 'll have to find a way to get it to school . But i really want it to be realistic and show as much detail as possible . And i 'm willing to spend a lot of time on it . The project is due on December 18 so i have a few weeks to work on it . Thanks you so much , Samantha <p> Dear Samantha , the Colosseum is very big , and even a model is a great challenge ; I think you have seen the page on models under the architecture menu . I thought about your problem , and what I suggest is that you use polistyrene foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape by means of a hot wire ( they sell such instruments in hobby shops ) and that you build only a section of the Colosseum , even less that a quarter of the structure , and that you slice it and show how it was built . You can find some plans in the page **25;159;TOOLONG . Look at the image sect.jpg ; you may just paint the inside instead of making real holes for the arches . Try to show a plan of the underground chambers where the shows were prepared . Good Luck Let me know how it 's gone Ciao Andrea <p> MODELS AGAIN Your website is great . I was wondering if you had more of the information I needed . I am making a scale model of the colosseum as a math project . There are not enough measurements for me to do so . If you could supply me with the information , it would be much appreicated . Thank You , Cheng <p> Dear Cheng , I 'll give you all the measurements I have ( in metres ) .

I am doing a college research paper on the Colosseum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the Italian Government ? " . I need information about this wonderful building today . I was lucky enough to visit Rome in April , but did not know I would be doing this research . There are not many books available on the subject . Thank you , Pat <p> Dear Pat , the Colosseum is part of the State assets . Hope you enjoyed your stay here in Rome , Yours sincerely , Daniele Pepe <p> Hola Lourdes ! Para los externas contrafuertes see the images in the home page and in the page history/rediscovery . Look also under other/imagegallery . I do n't know of any suitable site on the net . Auguri per i tuoi studi , Ciao Andrea <p> CREDENTIALS Would you please send me a list of your credentials . I need to use your website for a school project and my teacher wants me to have proof that the seite that i am using is trustworthy and reliable . <p> Dear ... , My " academic " credential is a degree in political sciences at Rome University . I love my city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hobby . My references for the site are other books , like for anyone doing a study of this kind . In the field of history or archaeology , where all is left to interpretation of hints , generally the credibility of a theory can not be proven by scientific evidence . While reading about the subject I have understood that much of what has been written on the Colosseum is based on some interpretation of the hints we have . I understand your teacher : the problem of the sources and their reliability/credibility is an old one . If you go deep in any subject , you soon realize that the problem of the " original " sources is the most disturbing one . If we take the Colosseum as an example , the original literary sources are few ( they appear in the source page in latin ) , and they have generally been taken as gospel . Example : the fact that Martial says that naval battles were held in the arena has compelled many archeologists to read literally his words and explain that some structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other studies say that naval battles could n't be held at all in the arena , because of the architectural structure of the monument . Were naval battles held in the Colossem or not ? Who knows . There is now a new explanation of it : Martial did not really mean the Colosseum when he wrote about naval battles , but he meant another place or another kind of show , different from what is generally intended as naumachia . Can now Martial , the original source , be taken as gospel ? This should teach us that the truthfulness and reliability of books and papers ( and all information ) on the Colosseum ( and I imagine on every subject ) is as good as we can control it . In other words : Mr. X makes a statement . If he indicates his sources I can go and check . He may have misread or be interested , for some reason , to prove some theory . If his theory is supported by a citation of some other author , should we take it for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to go as back as to the Latin sources . They are very few . You also can start from those , and form your opinion . By the point of view of academic credibility , my site does little more than try to report in a concise way the views of some of the available literature on the subject . I hope your professor will be satisfied . Good chicken hunting , Andrea Pepe <p> WOW , IT WAS HELPFUL ! ! ! thanks , this will help me more than i thougt it could <p> SHALL PROFESSORS APPROVE ? I would like to have some information about who the creators of this website are and what back ground you have for the creation of this site . One of my students is using your website as a resource for her paper and I would just like to make this preliminary check before I approve this site as a valid resource .

Best Regards , Andrea Pepe <p> SAMPLES Dear Sir/Madam Hello , I am S. from Korea . Your homepage looks fabulous and makes me interested in some pictures in the homepage . Fistly , I saw one particular page which was about the structure of Colossevm . Moreover , there was some pictures of Samples of Colossevm which I was deeply impressed . So , may I ask whether you have some more pictures of Samples and I wonder I can have some unshown pictures , please . Anyway , I deeply appreciate for reading my mail and I am looking forward to hearing from you . Yours Faithfully S. <p> Dear S. , thanks for the compliments . The picture in the homepage is mine , like many in the site . In the Italian homepage there is the same picture but treated in a pictorial way . A lot of pictures have been reproduced from other sources . There is an image gallery where you can see most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and then " image gallery " . I do not understand exactly what you mean for Samples of the Colosseum . Models , maybe ? Ciao , A. Pepe <p> SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE NO MANNERS ... BUT I ? M PATIENT name : XXX Hi ! I was wondering f I could ask you some questions if so my questions are : How is the Roman Colosseum maintained and repaired ? If people still do events there ? Who was the architect ? If your wondering why I 'm asking you all these questions I 'm doing a school report on the Roman Colosseum . Answer back soon ! <p> Hi XXX , the word " please " would have been welcomed , anyway ... <p> - it is the State that pays for the maintenance of the Colosseum - yes they have started recently to have shows in there - the name of the architect is unknown . You could have found the answer to all of these questions in my site . Check the FAQ page . Ciao Andrea <p> WHO MADE IT ? How many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know exactly how many people built the Colosseum . Some estimates have been done of several thousands of workers , also considering that it took only 10 years to build it . Some shortcuts have been taken : the stone pieces of the arches are modular . i.e. have the same size , so that they could be mounted in any arch . We do n't know much either about who the workers were . Legend is that Titus used jewish slaves , prisoners from his wars in Palestine , but we must consider it a rumour , because the ancient sources do not report at all such a thing . The majority of the scholars believes that , given the quality of the construction , mainly made in blocks of limestone and tuff , cement vaults and bricks , most of the work force must have been quite skilled . Therefore if slaves were employed they probably were not a majority . Ciao Andrea <p> SOMETIMES THERE ARE FUNNY STORIES ... I was just reading a news article about the gladiators wanting to get their jobs back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what one of them did to me last summer . I have battled a weight problem for most of my life . In June , my wife and I were on a Globus tour and were visiting the colosseum when one of the gladiators stuck a plastic sword to my stomach and yelled out , " TOO MUCH SPAGHETTI ! " Everyone started laughing and I 've never been so embarrised in my life . My wife and I paid over $7000 for that trip and that one incident ruined the whole trip for both of us . It is something that should never have happened . If that is the way these gladiators treat people , then I do n't think they should have their jobs back . I know that I would have had a much better trip if I 'd never seen them . <p> SITE MAP I love your website , it helped me on my research paper . I just wanted to suggest adding a Site Map . Because you have so many links , and at times it gets confusing . A site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navagite through the website better . It was just a suggestion : ) <p> Dear ... , there is already a site map ( I know it 's quite a vast site and it gets confusing ) . You can find it under the menu Around &gt; Site Map . But if you did n't find it many others have n't so I 'll try to make it more simple to find . Thank you for your comment , Daniele Pepe <p> NAVAL BATTLES My friend tried to tell me that the roman coliseum was filled with water so ship battles would occure . Is this true and if so give referances. thank you <p> Dear Tyrone , the story of naval battles held in the Colosseum is matter of fierce debate . Martial , latin writer , mentions some show like that maybe took place in the Colosseum , but the archaeologists are very doubtful about it , given the structure of the arena , drains etc . The text below can be found at the page " disclaimer " ; see also the page on naumachiae under " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that Martial ( De spectaculis ) says that naval battles were held in the arena has led many authors to find an explanation as to how the arena could be filled with water and then emptied . Some other studies now say that naval battles could n't possibly have been held at all in the arena , because of the architecture of the building . Were naval battles held in the Colosseum or not ? We are not sure anymore . And then we meet a new explanation of it : Martial did not really mean the Colosseum when he wrote about naval battles , but he meant another place or another kind of show , different from what is generally intended as naumachia . Can at this point Martial , the original source , still be credible ? Can we find another meaning in his writings ? And again , can we trust the edition of Martial 's works ? Which edition ? Is the translation adequate ? Is it the only version and/or interpretation of the original parchment codex ? Because there might be another codex that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do we do then ? With limited time and cultural resources , we generally stop in front of printed paper that looks credible enough . The credibility threshold rises with the degree of knowledge . <p> MORE NAVAL BATTLES Very interesting site . I 'm curious about how they got full scale fighting ships into the arena , and how they flooded it for the mock battles that are supposed to have been held <p> Dear Robert , the matter is subject of fierce debate . The fact that Martial ( De spectaculis ) says that naval battles were held in the arena has led many authors to wonder how the arena could be filled with water and then emptied .

And so on ... Books have been written on this , but IMO nobody knows for sure yet . Ciao Andrea <p> SECURITY AND SHOWTIMES How was security handled at the colosseum during the empire ? What time would the games start and end ? <p> Security in the Colosseum was held by the army , probably praetorians as the other armies were n't allowed to enter Rome , and by vigiles , a kind of police . The games started in the early morning , around 8 a.m. and continued non-stop until dusk . Daniele Pepe <p> libitinensis ( named after the Roman goddess of the underworld , Libitina ) for the dead gladiators ; <p> sanavivaria for the ones who saved their lives , <p> triumphalis , for the winners . <p> The main axis of the Colosseum is oriented more or less SE-NW ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main axis , which is also natural since that is the direction of the ludi . The sanavivaria should be on the opposite side . I do n't know which is the triumphalis one . If I have read it I do n't remember it . <p> There were 18 Vestals at a time : 6 novices chosen as young girls of 10-11 years from the best senatorial families , families without stain in their backgrounds . 6 were the practicing Vestals , and 6 were " retired " and acted as teachers for the novices . Probably the Vestals themselves would have suggested names of novices , but the Pontifex Maximus would have had to make the final decision . The work of the Vestals was to tend the sacred fire of the hearth , symbolic of the home . They also had to prepare sacred ground grain for sacrificial rituals and to function as models of moral behavior , since they had to remain virgins for their 30 years of service . After that time they could marry , but few did . For breaking their vow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . They lived in palatial quarters in the Forum behind the round Temple to Vesta where the sacred fire was kept . They had their own box at the Colosseum , and witnessed from their ring-side seats the games , along with the rest of the audience . <p> I add : originally women were not admitted to the games ; later on this prohibition fell into disuse and the amphitheatres provided opportunities for meeting the other sex . After this period of permissivess , reaction came : August assigned special seats to all the classes , guilds and authorities , and relegated the women to the higher tiers . The Vestals were an exception : they were the only women who had a box in the amphitheatre . I do n't think they had any role on the occasion , except that of showing themselves in public , like VIP today do at the stadiums . <p> MODELS Hello , I am doing a research project on the Colosseum .

Currently , I am finishing up a report on the architectural similarities and differences in the movie Gladiator ( 2000 ) to historical documents . They used CGI - Computer Generated Imagery - to recreate the Colosseum to great detail . I have not found too many inaccurate details in the movie . I would appreciate your opinion on the topic and any factual mistakes they made . Thank you ! <p> Dear Kenny , I am not an expert but I can say that the film was quite accurate in reconstruction . Of course there will be hundreds of discussions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I think that there were too many trapdoors in the arena . Surely there was a big central one and many all around , but I think that the arena was free from obstacles during the fights , also from poles . Fights were credible , and the costumes were accurate enough . I liked the " uniforms " of the soldiers in Germany at the beginning of the story , though the fire throwing machines would have been impossible to operate in that terrain . They were used in the sieges of cities . A more expert archaeologist friend of mine said that the film was OK , but that the hairdo of the women was not really consistent with the historical period of the story ( fashion changed during the centuries ! ) .

ThanksThe spectators ate fruit and nuts at the games , and some people probably also ate the animals who were slaughtered ( remains have been found in the sewers ) . As to water , It is not clear how and where , but many archaeologists guess that there must have been toilets and fountains , since traces of piping , placed on the pillars at regular intervals , have been attributed to the presence of drinking fountains and probably also toilets with running water . <p> MONEY How was the Colosseum paid for and by whom ? I imagine that something of such great magnitude would take more than government money.Dear Reynaldo , things were different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really exist . There were steady institutions , but government and the rulers ( the emperors ) were basically the same thing . The Colosseum was paid for by the Flavian emperors ( a family ) that had taken over the power . Some formal rules had to be respected ( homage to the gods and the Senate ) but since Caesar times the emperors had convinced the Romans to accept the foreign ( eastern mediterranean ) concept that the king was a god . In the case of the Colosseum the money probably came from the booty of the wars in Palestine waged by the Flavian emperors . Actually , if we think of the wars waged today by the Bush presidents to protect their oil-based interests , things are not all that different ... Only , I think that the Bushes did not build an equivalent monument <p> SPELLING - V or U ? if you did n't notice , the title bar Says " colossevm " is it soposted to be spelled with a " v " ?

@@47389062 @889062/ <h> V E L A R I U M <p> THE AWNING <p> Owain Roberts and classicist Norma Goldman answer to questions <p> Question for Goldman : How many people lived in Rome when the Colosseum was active as an arena ? Angie Answer : Estimates vary , but the most reliable sources , based on the number of houses and apartments and the size of the town covering the 7 hills of Rome give a figure of about a million toward the end of the first century when the Colosseum was built , increasing in the second century to possibly a million and a half . That means that with 45,000 to 50,000 in the audience , it was 1/20 of the population that could attend at one time ; tickets ( pieces of broken pottery giving gate entrance and assigned seat area ) must have been highly sought after , with people lining up for tickets as they do today for a world series game . <p> Question for Goldman : How many people did it take to build the Colosseum , and how many bricks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the construction crews involved thousands of slaves to lift and transport the materials . I 'm sure that thousands of skilled and semi-skilled workers were involved in handling the construction materials . If one adds the slaves that were working in the quarries to cut the stones , one gets at least 20,000 to 30,000 people involved . How many bricks or stones went into building the Colosseum ? I have no way of making that estimate . It 's something I have never counted as far as stones , but I would say that from the quarries at Tivoli , which is about 20 miles from Rome where the travertine was quarried , there were 240,000 cartloads of stones brought just for the exterior facade alone . And if you consider that on every cartload there must have been 30 to 40 stones , maybe 50 stones , you get some idea if you multiply that out of just for the exterior facade . <p> Question for Goldman : Many box seats on several levels contain matching sidewall joist holes approximately 4-by-4 at about 7 and 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used and these do not represent flooring requiring crotching or lying . Could this possibly be true ? Martin Answer : There was no wood used in the seating area of the Colosseum . It was all a matter of concrete barrel vaulting to hold the marble seating that was installed . Each seat was called a locus , and one was assigned a particular locus in a particular section in a particular deck , all according to rank and class . And as far as I know , no wood was involved in the construction of the seats . <p> Question for Goldman : Was the status of sailors enhanced because of their role in covering the Colosseum ? Jack Answer : Sailors were young men , sometimes even young boys , impressed into the Roman navy from any and all the countries that Rome conquered around the Mediterranean world , and as far away as Britain . They served for 15-30 years before gaining their " diploma " , which gave them freedom from slavery ; they became free citizens , and their children were born then as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the class of knights . Those sent to Rome to work the awning must have been considered very privileged to see the " big city " and all its attractions . They handled huge awnings of cloth equivalent to the size of sails on the " present " day tall ships " , and that must have been a great honour . But the ones who came for the mock naval games called the naumachiae , must have considered them a kind of Disney-land reconstruction of ships , and tragically the naval war games fought on them were fought to the death . <p> Question for Roberts : Were the Roman sailors as skilled as others who lived during that time period ? Andrew Answer : Any sailor , Roman or otherwise , has skills at least comparable with any other highly trained worker but these tend to be a total mystery to landsmen . This has always set the sailor apart from other men . His skill comes in two categories . Technically he is master of the equipment which he uses , that is the ship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard years he knows how to make sound decisions on when to use that gear and how to handle his ship , even in serious life-threatening situations . This is the part which mystifies landsmen but is a common bond between sailors . Roman sailors made possible the rigging of large awnings over amphitheaters since they represented the only large body of skilled workers remotely capable of envisaging the problems that needed to be over-come . <p> Question for Roberts : Which of the methods used in the NOVA program did you favor ? Mark Answer : Though I prepared rigging methods for both systems , the one proposed initially by Prof. Rainer Graefe of Innsbruck University , Austria , had my support . It was the only system for which there is substantial evidence about the masts and furling method used . The evidence is found in the contemporary iconography of Roman sailing ships showing masts , yards , sails , and rigging . Such a system also would have made use of the valuable skills of those who sailed them . <p> Question for Goldman : Were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer : Oh , yes . Every public amphitheater or stadium where people would have to sit out in the sun was tented with some kind of awnings . This was a pampered audience , and in the entire Mediterranean , people did not want to sit out in the hot sun . So there is evidence for awnings in most theaters , in almost all of the amphitheaters , and even in the stadium . <p> Question : Did the Romans borrow construction techniques for the Colosseum from even more ancient cultures ? Elaine Answer : Well , I think all technology builds on what was known previously . One does n't go out and begin to say , " I 'm going to do a building the size of the Colosseum , " and have it come like Athena out of Zeus 's head , full-blown . The arch had to be invented before the arched entrances could be designed . Certainly all of technology that had preceded it-- the building of columns , the whole idea of brick work to face concrete-- all of that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman : What made the Romans actually build the Colosseum ? Martha Answer : The Flavian Emperor Vespasian conceived the idea and put 4 teams of construction workers onto the job . First of all it was a propaganda ploy to return to the people land that Nero had usurped for the private lake in his private pleasure park on the ground of his Golden House . Vespasian was making the Flavian dynasty ( a name like the Windsors in England ) much beloved as the ruling house in this concern for the people . Second , it was to show to the entire world the power and might and ability of the Roman workforce -- its grandiose size and monumental shape and a symbol of Roman majesty . Third , it put to work an enormous labor force , solving vast unemployment problems . Finally it kept the people happy and entertained . They already got free " bread " ; now they got the circuses . It served its purpose well . <p> Question for Goldman : How did they go about flooding it for mock sea battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether the Colosseum itself was ever used for sea battles . I think that after Domician added the substructures , which would be after he came to the throne in A.D. 81 , there never could be sea battles in a flooded naumachiae-- that 's the Greek word for sea warfare . There never could have been , again , the flooding of the Colosseum . But before that substructure was added , the poet Martial says that the amphitheater could change from dry land to the sea very quickly , and we know that there were water courses which run through that valley because there is still water running under San Clemente today , so that very easily the engineers could have induced water into it , and they could have emptied the water by the same channels that took the original lake that was drained in order to install the Colosseum in the first place . So yes , in the first two years there could have been sea battles there . <p> Question for Roberts : It seems that either method needs further support beams closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support any more beams further down toward the center ? Gary Answer : There 's no evidence at all within the walls of any amphitheater or the Colosseum for further beams or pillars , and the supports for the masts that are used on the outside edge or on the top of the wall-- that is , the holes in the walls there-- these must be particularly high to do the job of supporting the horizontal beam which is sticking out on not all of the arena , but much of the arena . As you will have seen , it 's not necessary to have full cover over an arena . As long as about two-thirds of the arena is getting some shadow , it 's adequate for the people who are watching there . There was no evidence of support within the arena . <p> Question for Roberts : Why could n't the suspension system be used , but use the bottom ropes to suspend a series of ropes through the rings on the awning , allowing the awning to retract from the center to the edges ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was working on the idea in the first place , of using a pulley system attached to the underside of a suspending rope . The big problem with this is that we are using natural fibers , and even with well-organized systems , the natural fiber rope stretches and stretches and stretches , and you are in a situation where you could never get sufficient tension and keep sufficient tension for rope , which is harnessed underneath for moving the sails or the awnings to work decently . The other problem is that you need to pull on the rope to draw a canopy in or out . You need to pull against something solid in order to change the direction of the rope to the sail , if you understand . If the part of the block , the pulley that the rope is going through , is attached to a rope which also gives , you have a situation which is far too flexible for it to work properly . This might have worked if the Romans had had steel wire cable , which they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire cable , you can then set up a very rigid system , and beneath that , you can then run a flexible awning system which you can draw it in and out . That 's the reason why we did n't do that eventually . <p> Question for Roberts : Is it a possibility that the Romans constructed a giant circular piece of cloth that was held taut over the Colosseum like a lid on a jar-- no complicated system of ropes ? Abby Answer : How do you propose to hold the lid over this ? You can not just float this in the air . You have to have a system which supports it . You also , of course , have to have a system which can close it off , because you get winds which would make the thing blow away over Rome somewhere , perhaps . <p> It 's not a system that can be controlled properly , and if you think of the Colosseum itself in particular , the size of it would be quite enormous and quite beyond controlling in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use was that it worked in segments and could be in small pieces , like a ship having six or eight sails on each mast , and is then able to take in each sail in turn as is required . And I think this is the flexibility that was built into the system which we eventually devised , which we think was used . <p> Question for Goldman : What does the word " Colosseum " mean ? Greg Answer : Interestingly enough , the building that we today call the Colosseum was never called the Colosseum in its own time when it was used as an amphitheater . It was called the Flavian Amphitheater . The word " Colosseum " means , as the English etymology would suggest , " very , very large . " And the building had next to it a colossal statue of the Emperor Nero over 100 feet high . When the Emperor restored to the people of Rome the land and gave back to them this marvelous gift of the amphitheater , because it stood next to the colossal statue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun god Apollo put on instead , with rays coming out from the head , the name " colossal " that applied to the statue eventually was applied to the Colosseum . But it was n't called that until the writer Bede called it that in the eighth century , A.D. Before that , it was always called the Flavian Amphitheater . <p> Question for Roberts : I think the idea of the booms is a good one , but could they have had a smaller set of awnings covering the important people ? Rob Answer : Yes . It was known that people of importance would , in fact , have their own set of canopies set up over their important seats towards the front of the arena . The way it was set up generally would never , in fact , have covered all the arena , and probably the front row except with the sun at various angles all of the time . So those sitting at the front would have had their own canopies ; yes , there is evidence for that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of excess . Is this accurate ? Scott Answer : It is dangerous to generalize about all Romans . There were some who valued the old virtues of hard work and ethical conduct , but yes , during the Empire there was the same materialism that prevails today -- people of a leisure class with too much money and time who required constant entertainment . The Colosseum provided that kind of entertainment , repulsive as it seems to us today . <p> Question for Goldman : Regarding the mast erected to support the sails , is there any evidence to suggest that they might have been metal-banded for increased strength or height ? Todd Answer : That 's a hard one to answer because we do n't have any of the masts that have been preserved . There was iron metal . There was not the kind of steel that we have today . The iron would only have increased the weight of it . It might have made them more capable of holding the weight of the rope and the cloth attached to the rope , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because no masts have been preserved . <p> Question for Goldman : My main concern is once the canvas-- what was the weight , i.e. , ounces per yard ? -- was in place , whatever method was used , was water drainage/collection and uplift a problem ? How was this avoided ? Howard Answer : The awnings were not put out on days of wind or rain . These were sunscreen awnings . They were not intended as protection from the rain . They were retractable . We know that from the poets who tell us that when the days of wind came up , the awnings could not be put out , and we have evidence that there was a captain of the crew of sailors who read the winds from telltale signs-- just the way one has little strips of cloth on the sheets , the lines of the ships to tell the wind direction-- and the strength of the wind . And when there were windy days , the sails were not put out at all . So there was no reason to have to deflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were sunscreen awnings , not rain screen awnings . The weight has been estimated at 24 tons at 1 pound per square yard of average-weight cloth . <p> Question for Roberts : At the beginning of your program , the architect , Chris , had shown us a drawing of the Colosseum as it might have looked if the Romans had put a concrete roof on it using their system of arches . Would it be possible to use the same concept , but instead of using concrete maybe the Romans could have constructed an arched wooden structure and then put canvas over that ? Nicole Answer : Well , you have the same problems in that even if you make it out of timber , it 's not going to weigh as much , but it 's going to weigh a considerable amount . The wooden structure as such would have been enormous . I do n't know if wooden arches of that size you would require to laminate timber of that size , and the laminating would be done by fastening through a number of timbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job that 's being asked , and I think , frankly , that it would never have been attempted because of the practical difficulties in this . Having then put an arch up , you put a canvas cover over that , which again would be an enormous quantity of cloth . It would flap , it would fray , it would really need to have a means of furling it . I have no idea what system could be used with a permanent wooden framework in place in the shape of an arch . I do n't think this is really a line that should be pursued , to be honest . <p> Question for Goldman : Were n't there structures outside the Colosseum to which block and tackle were thought to be used to raise the sail roof from outside the Colosseum ? Shawn Answer : There are 160 bollards -- these are large , upright stones at ground level -- 57 feet out from the Colosseum . They ring the entire Colosseum , and there has always been controversy over whether these were part of a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ropes on which the sails would be extended . I always thought that because they are gouged so that some kind of windlass or winding device could have been installed on the surface that faces the Colosseum , this argued for them being involved in the mechanism to raise the ropes , and I really still like that argument even though it has been argued that they are not deeply sunk enough to counterbalance the enormous pull that would be required to make them taut . One of them has been excavated , and it was found that they were not deeply set into the ground . That would argue for them being part of crowd control and not part of raising the awning mechanism , even though I argued for that in my article in " Archaeology " magazine . <p> Question for Roberts : Could a wooden circle with pulley attachments have been raised by ropes from outside the structure through the tops of the masts , lifting the wooden circle from the center floor to the center near the opening , and then sails pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof would have sloped down and in toward the center . Sean Answer : Yes . This is making the system more rigid , is n't it ? If you could invent a wooden circle perhaps about the same band as the area where the activity was taking place , and suspended that , you might then have been able to work a system of drilling can drawing canopies in and out . We come back to the problem , that we are dealing here with natural fiber ropes , and the constant weight of a wooden circle , however light you tried to make it , would in fact have been putting a constant tension on these ropes . Natural fiber ropes , hemp , stretch ; they continue to stretch ; and you have to keep adjusting them , and you 're into a constant battle on this one . And frankly , I do n't think a system this requires a great deal of ropes is supported like that is really a good way to go around this . <p> Question for Roberts : Was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the experiment ? Maureen Answer : Roman sailcloth could be linen or cotton which was lighter . Evidence suggests that it came in rectangular pieces which needed joining , which is why the scams on the ancient sails stand out and in some cases have a patch-work appearance . For the experiment cotton was used . The construction of each awning , due to a misunderstanding by the sailmakers , did not include the typical Roman edge and panel reinforcement specified by me . Both for the strength and for visual effect this was a disappointment . <p> Question for Goldman : How were the Vestal Virgins chosen ? Kathy Answer : There were 18 Vestals at a time : 6 novices chosen as young girls of 10-11 years from the best senatorial families , families without stain in their backgrounds . 6 were the practicing Vestals , and 6 were " retired " and acted as teachers for the novices . Probably the Vestals themselves would have suggested names of novices , but the Pontifax Maximus would have had to make the final decision . The work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearth , symbolic of the home . They also had to prepare sacred ground grain for sacrificial rituals and to function as models of moral behavior , since they had to remain virgins for their 30 years of service . After that time they could marry , but few did . For breaking their vow of devotion to the order , they could be buried alive . They lived in palatial quarters in the Forum behind the round Temple to Vesta where the sacred fire was kept . They had their own box at the Colosseum , and witnessed from their ring-side seats these abhorrent " games " , along with the rest of the audience . <p> Question for Goldman : How long was the Colosseum in use , and why did people stop using it ? Irene Answer : The games died out for several reasons . The gladiatorial games , which became abhorrent to Christian conscience , disappeared in the year 404 . This was the last time there were gladiatorial games , although the staged animal hunts went on for another 50 , 60 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them going . It was an enormous expense to import animals from Africa . These poor beasts were deadly sick as they were transported across the sea , and then nursed back to health , but deliberately starved before they would go into the amphitheater to fight against each other or against gladiators . Tremendous expense , and the money just gave out . And that 's really , I think , why they died out : not so much from Christian conscience as from lack of funds to keep them going . <p> Question for Goldman : Did you consider the fact that bullfights are scheduled at 5:00 p.m. , when there is half sun and half shade ? This would support the first theory of sails and beams . Rosalma Answer : Yes , and this does support Rainer 's theories because he has done studies on the effect of the cast shadow from the opposite side of the arena . And the bullfights do start late in the afternoon , and the cheap seats are the ones that are still out in the sun , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , just like they used to be in the ballparks in the United States . The bleachers were in the sun , out of cover , and the people who could afford it sat in the covered part of the stadium . <p> Question for Goldman : The Colosseum is so enormous -- is it know how they handled crowd control ? Victor Answer : Yes , the network of entrances through 76 numbered arches assured that the peoples of each class , noble or plebian , citizen or non-citizen , would go directly via interior stairways and ramps to their assigned seat , just as in a modern stadium . The arch and area was indicated on a piece of broken pottery giving the proper deck and wedge-shaped section , assuring complete crowd control for entry and seating . Then for exit , these same ramps and stairways would assure a quick and easy egress with no mixture of classes . Outside there would have been a barrier consisting of chains between 160 bollards to keep people out before the opening . There were 80 arches in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrances of the gladiators , the emperors and magistrates and Vestal Virgins , and the one next to Ludus Magnus was the gate of death through which the corpses of men and animals were removed . All very well organized . <p> Question for Roberts : If you got a chance to do this experiment again , would you do it differently ? Adriana Answer : The experimental work is on-going though now at Innsbruck University . While there last year and with excellent help from the students on the course , I built to one-fifth scale , three different arrangements for furling the vela . The major future refinement would be a pruning down of the supporting rig and having greater faith in the natural flexibility of the horizontal yard to withstand destructive bending forces . Having performed the calculations on this it is clear that much longer yards could be used in a full-size situation without the need for support other than at the masts . The students also tried to improve on the other system suspended across the amphitheater but despite careful modelling could not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind alley if ancient materials are used . <p> Question for Roberts : I believe that the Romans used the archways in the Colosseum to string parallel ropes across the top . The fabric would then be attached to the ropes using rings . This design would cover the entire building and would fit all of the descriptions . Could this have been the way ? Daniel Answer : Yes . The trouble is , we 're working here with a circular building , and you could certainly support ropes from the tops of the arches . All of these ropes would ... as they come towards the middle , would be like the radials or the spokes of a wheel , and you 'd run into this problem again that , first of all , you have great lengths of rope which stretch constantly . You have panels of cloth which would have to be tapered in order to fit between these radials , these spokes of rope . And you then have a problem that if you try to slide them back , because the inward end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth , then you start drawing it back , it 's not wide enough , in fact , to slide back along the ropes . The whole thing would start to pull in . This problem has been looked at . Whether we 've used arches or whether we 'd use masts , we 'd run into the same problem , unfortunately , and there is no need , anyway , to cover the whole arena with a canvas because the walls are high and the sun moves around and where just a certain area of the arena is covered , it casts sufficient shadow for the people who are watching there . <p> Question for Goldman : Is the Colosseum ever used for events now , other than as a tourist attraction ? Roberto Answer : Several hundred years ago the popes began the preservation of the Colosseum as a sacred place , there having been so many people killed there , and stations of the cross were planted on a Via Dolorosa built around the edge of the arena inside , with shrines and a little chapel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Colosseum became a public monument , the Cross was moved to the side podium , the stations of the cross removed , the chapel closed , all the shrubbery , trees , and plants which were growing inside and splitting the walls removed , the solid floor of the arena excavated , and the substructure laid bare , as you see it today . About 10 years ago there was an exhibition of modern technology on a narrow wooden walkway constructed over the long axis of the arena , and the cry of outrage was so loud , even though the show brought in a hundred thousand dollars the first week , that I doubt that such use will ever be repeated . The Pope still celebrates a memorial to the victims in a symbolic march around the exterior each year . <p> Question for Goldman : Was the Colosseum the original " sports stadium " ? Were there other big gathering places ? Liam Answer : The Circus Maximus in Rome , a long oval-shaped race-course with a spine down the middle , designed for chariot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aventine Hills , probably began with seats cut into the hillside for viewing spectacles of all kinds . When the formal race-course was built with starting gates , permanent stone viewing stands , private boxes for the officials and a more private imperial box high up in the palace area on the Palatine for the royal family , the Circus Maximus could eventually accommodate 250,000 spectators at one sitting , more than 5 times the number that could be accommodated in the Colosseum . Nero built an enormous Circus next to the Vatican Hill where St. Peter was martyred , and the obelisk from Nero 's Circus was eventually moved to where it now stands in the embracing arms of the piazza in front of St. Peters . Domitian , Vespasian 's younger son , built a smaller race-course , probably for foot-races , in the area known today as the Piazza Navona in Rome , and the shape of the Piazza echoes the shape of the race-course . <p> Question for Roberts : There may be a combination of both ideas . Use the booms to suspend the canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stretch ropes across to the opposite boom to extend the canvas to the desired distance , depending on the weather , wind , etc. , the ropes could be adjusted with the support of the booms for added stability . Jamie Answer : Yes . It would be a nice way of controlling the booms in that position-- there 's no argument about that-- by linking the ends of them with ones opposite with a rope that goes across . So you have the center of a spider 's web , I suppose , at the middle , and what we found , the argument that would go against that is that we found that it was very convenient to be able to rotate the booms in towards the walls where the masts were supported in order to be able to work on the booms themselves . Now , that facility would n't be possible if we had rope linking across the arena from the ends of each of these booms . It 's a facility for maintenance that would be essential , because everything , all the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just like working a ship . With a ship , you are always checking ropes , checking for wear , and you need to be able to get at the stuff . Now the other way we can do it , the way we found to do it , was just swing these booms in until we could reach them , and I think that 's probably what was done in antiquity . So I do n't really like the idea of linking them across , just in order to try to extend the canvas . We can make the booms more than long enough , because the trees are long enough for this . And you do n't have to have very thick wood towards the end of the boom , the inner end of the boom , because it 's a good thing there to be thinner , because you 're losing weight all the time ; it 's strong enough for the job . You could have very long booms and have them able to cast more than sufficient shadow over the arena . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks attractive at first glance , I must admit . <p> Question for Roberts : How complicated was the rigging that you did for the bullring roof compared to rigging that sailors of that time would have done ? Trevor Answer : The rigging used in the bullring experiment was based entirely on what is to be seen in the pictorial evidence from the Roman period . What was combined was the rig needed to support the yard , which was suspended like the sprit of a Roman sprit-sail rig , and the awnings furling lines or brails in evidence on the Roman square-sail rig . All gear would have been familiar to any Roman sailor who might have come to haunt us . <p> Question for Goldman : What type of wood were the masts made of , and where were these trees found ? Eric Answer : There are pine trees and there are fir trees in the area around Rome , and I 'm sure that these evergreen trees were the ones that were used because they do grow to great heights . And Rainer Graefe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown , and in his book , Velu Erunt , ( " There Will Be Sails " ) -- and that 's a good title , because that inducement was added on the graffiti " billboards " that were put up announcing that there were going to be gladiatorial games . In his book , " There Will Be Sails , " Graefe describes how he studied the heights that trees grow to so that he could figure out how long the booms could be . They were usually conifer trees . <p> Question for Goldman : Do you think the blood and gore shows that took place in the Colosseum have any parallels to today 's extreme sports , or violent talk shows ? Charlene Answer : Absolutely ! There seems to be an appeal in human nature ( something we try to hide under the carpet , but surely there ) to the violent aspect of human activity . Look at the number of murder mysteries written and presented in the public media in film and television . One of the statistics in the Newsweek book on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent deaths on television and in film by the time he or she is an adult . Look at the slowdowns on the opposite side of the expressways when there is an accident . People are fascinated by death , and the ancient Romans had this terrible flaw in their character that they made the killing of captives , criminals , slaves , or anyone who bucked the system , a source of entertainment . Look at the popularity today of the Demolition Derbies , the fights in the hockey games , the wrestling match absurdities . <p> Question for Goldman : What was the most populated event that took place in the Colosseum ? Scott <p> Answer : I would imagine that the climactic event of the day was the gladitorial contest between two popular heroes . By the way , the games went on all day , so this business of the cast shadow in late afternoon does not apply , because the games did begin early in the morning ; people stayed the whole day-- there were criminals , condemned criminals who were put to death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exotic beasts both to be paraded around and then to fight against each other or hunted , caught , and killed . Then there were the gladiatorial games in the afternoon , where teams of men who had been trained in a particular kind of warfare-- these had been men who had been captured in war who were then put into training camps to refine their war skills in the particular way in which they fought from the countries they came from or to learn new skills-- they were teamed up against each other to fight . And then the climax of the day , and I think the most popular event , would be when the most famous gladiator who fought in one style was pitted against another gladiator who fought in a different style . For instance , there was a style of costuming where the gladiator was completely armored , covered , protected who fought against the almost nude Retarius , the man who fought only with a net and trident . And to have these unequal gladiators fight against each other would have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were like the screen stars-- the women swooned over them . The popularity of them extended to the gambling , the betting that was put on on one or the other winning . The popularity made them the idols of the day . They had short , happy lives . <p> Additional Q &amp; As <p> Additional questions and replies from Owain Roberts and Norma Goldman will be posted here starting on May 28 . <p> Question for Goldman : Which of the solutions shown in the program to cover the Colosseum is best supported by archaeological evidence ? Don Answer : The archaeological evidence from the top of the Colosseum with the extruding corbels with sockets for the masts and the matching holes in the cornice and from coins indicating the masts all around the top show undeniable evidence that the masts to support the robes and the system of awning mechanism did exist . Whether the horizontal timbers to support the " sails " were there , as described by Graefe , is not so documented , and my own opinion is that that system would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the emperors , nothing was too expensive ) , and would not have covered the most important members of the audience , the nobles who sat down front , closest to the arena , except when the cast shadow gave shade , as it does today in the modern bull-ring when the sun is lower on the horizon . Greafe 's extensive work on all amphitheaters has to be considered with respect , and he is best of all authorities to document the feature on the cast shadow and on the length of timbers from trees . My own theory is that the rope oculus system is more practical , although we did not have time in the film to see the longer sails retracted , as the literary evidence implies , for the poets write about days when the winds are so strong that the " sails can not be put out . " I favor a system of extending the sails on ropes going through rings sewn to the edge of the cloth , just as is done on ships . One of my Italian architect friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over 400 years , there might have been many different versions of the awning changed to suit the times . <p> Question for Goldman : How long did it take to build the Colosseum and how much did it cost ? Chloe Answer : Between seven and eight years in all . It was probably begun about 73-75 A.D. and was almost completed in 79 when Vespasian died , for Vespasian 's older son Titus dedicated it in 809 with 100 days of games on one day of which 5000 men and animals were said to have been slaughtered . Titus only ruled two years and Vespasian 's second son Domitian is said to have added the bronze shields at the top and the substructures ( after which there never could have been mock naval games ) for dressing rooms , dens for animals , storage for sets and scenery , elevators and ramps . No one will ever know how much in cash was poured into the project , but it was money well-spent , since it assured the popularity of the ruling family , and the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , having brought back from the Jewish War an estimated 100,000 slaves , probably put to work in the quarries at Tivoli , for there were 240,000 cartloads of travertine estimated alone for the exterior . There is evidence of skilled work done in stone yards for pieces brought already cut and finished to be installed , as is done today in modern construction projects . <p> Question for Goldman : Was the Colosseum considered an architectural wonder at the time , or was it standard , if grand , for that time ? Athena Answer : Absolutely it was considered magnificent in its time , and this is the whole message that was to go out to the whole Roman world , that the Romans were capable of building this enormous structure that was perfection itself in architectural design , in planning , in scope , in execution . Martial , in a whole group of poems that he writes about the spectacle , says that you can talk about your pyramids , you can talk about your hanging gardens of Babylon , but there was nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its own time , it had a reputation , and it was imitated in all of the great cities that the Romans built throughout the Mediterranean world , and even as far as up in England and in Germany . <p> Question for Goldman : What caused the ruin of the colosseum ? What was the reason for not rebuilding ? Travis Answer : Some of the damage to the building was caused by lightning and fire , but the most significant damage was caused by earthquakes shaking the ground so severely that parts of the upper stories , and eventually the entire south wall fell . The fire and earthquake damage in the first through the sixth centuries A.D. were repaired by the emperors , but when the building was no longer used for gladiatorial events ( last ones in A.D. 404 ) or staged animal hunts ( last ones in A.D. 523 ) , there was no reason to repair the damage . And the emperors had little money for such repairs . They needed the money for their bloody wars . When the very severe earthquakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the plunder and reuse of the stones for other constructions began . The steps of St. Peter 's are made of reused Colosseum stones . The capital had been moved to Constantinople , and Rome was becoming a backwater town . <p> Question for Goldman : Why should we assume that the Romans used only one method to roof their arenas ? Is it not reasonable to assume that they experimented with various methods ? Nick Answer : Yes , I agree , that in a building in use for over 400 years , there must have been several methods over the centuries of " tenting " the enormous structure . Covering the audience was the prime concern , and there could have been several revisions in the technology of just how to extend and retract the awnings . They could never have stayed in place , however , for that would have wrecked the top of the building , just as sails on a ship have to be reefed , for the winds at the top of the building are very strong and could wreck the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might have been changes in technology that made different plans possible at different times . <p> Question for Goldman : Is there any evidence to suggest that the Romans knew of and used suspension bridges ? ( which technology could presumably be adapted to a suspension roof ) ? Nick Answer : Cris Wise 's method for the awning is an adaptation of the suspension bridge idea adapted for use in an awning . For their bridges , however , the Romans used construction methods that were mainly based on stone and concrete pier support sunk into water or land with arches between to support the bridge atop . But David Macaulay shows a support of rope skeleton with an oculus in the center , and I agree with that system . In an earlier version , Macaulay shows a criss-cross of ropes going all the way across , and that also is a possibility ( more like the suspension bridge idea of Cris Wise ) . <p> Question for Goldman : Were the bodies of humans killed in the arena simply tossed in a mass grave or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer : The bodies of men and animals killed in the arena were taken out through the Gate of Death at the east end of the ampitheater . From there the bodies of condemned criminals , slaves , and animals were dumped unceremoniously into a common pit . When the site was excavated at the end of the 19th century , the director said that the excavators could only work a few hours at a time , for the stench was still so strong . During the Empire when the gladiatorial games were at the height of their popularity , sometimes the sons of noble families , the second or third sons who could not inherit wealth or position , entered the arena as gladiators , but there is no documentation as to what happened to them after death . Perhaps the families were ashamed of them and did not claim the bodies . Perhaps the families did come to claim them and bury them in the family tomb . No reference has been found about this interesting subject . In any event , the gladiatorial armor -- helmets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all preserved , and these were handed on to subsequent gladiators . Helmets especially were precious , prized objects . <p> Question for Roberts : Why do n't the boom structures show on the few remaining examples ( of how it could be done beside the stamping limits ) ? Is it possible that the same type of boom could be used with all support gear underneath the cloth ? Could the cover be deployed via end wheels at the far end of the booms ( reducing complexity ) ? Could the structures on the outside of the Colosseum be knoches ( I saw no holes to capture the end of poles ) ? Are there any indications that adjustable angle support braces running to the seating area ' could ' have been used or ' pre-loaded overbuilt structures ' like the ones you tried ? Funny you made your test structures in a bull ring when rings may hold the possible answer ( like on ship masts ) ? Paul Answer : The drawings at Pompeii show the booms so there is some evidence of booms being used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same boom to be used with all support gear underneath the cloth . The cloth would drag over the tops of the booms . We did use pulleys or blocks at the very end of the booms in order to pull the sails of the covers backwards and forwards so that 's already being done . He mentions structures on the outside of the Colosseum , I think Norma Goldman covered that quite well . There does n't seem to be any structure outside , there are these stones outside the Colosseum but they 're too shallowly fixed in the ground , and anyway they 're not needed if the masts have all the strains vertically down them , the masts stand up by themselves . He says here he saw no holes to capture the end of the poles . Well , I 'm afraid he 'll have to look again . All these masts have got a hole at the top edge in some way of the Colosseum wall or the amphitheatre wall and then a support a little lower down rather like having a mast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keel in the hole there and the mast then rests against the beam at deck level , it 's that sort of arrangement . There are n't any indications for adustable angle supports . There 's nothing suggesting extra support for poles within the arenas . I do n't understand what Paul means about rings on masts I 'm afraid . <p> Question for Roberts : Would n't a net-like fabric reduce weight , allow wind tolerance and provide dappled shade adequate to the need ? If the riggers were sailors , as am I , would n't they cast a net over the sea of air that would allow its fluid to pass , stow in a small area , dry quickly if wet and bear its own weight without heavy rigging ? Gordon Answer : Yeah , sure , except there 's no evidence at all in the iconography of using net-like fabric . It would probably work perfectly well . The riggers were sailors and they probably just used what they were told to use , that is large canopies so that was that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONVERGING at center ; rather use parallel ropes to a central cross-rope over stadium mid-line . Use the parallel ropes upon which to pull the " sails " towards center rope , just as done with the horizontal poles to support them . Sails could be deployed or retracted in a matter of minutes , as wind might dictate . This is suggested by looking at the picture of an early " roof " shown in program . It appeared to me that the supports were parallel , not convergent ! What do you think ? George Answer : Good question . Roofs over stages were rectangular , that is the stages where people performed in theatres . But you did n't get that sort of arrangement in something like a Colosseum where you had an arena with seating all the way around . Your big problem with any rope system is stretch , it never stops . All the evidence is related to evidence of equal mast spacing to keep these parallel strips evenly spaced across the Colosseum , the masts would need gradually to be further and further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't happen , the masts are all evenly spaced . So the parallel strip system is a non-starter I suspect . There is absolutely no evidence towards it , except over stages . <p> Question for Roberts : Why could n't the rope structure use a central ring-shaped rope anchored by ropes in V 's to the masts . The canopy then could be one solid piece that irises shut by means of a rope through the inner part of the canopy . With this modification to the rope method , you would still have a means of retracting the roof by loosening the iris rope . It also would look much like the renderings you refer to in the story . Troy Answer : Well we did , with Chris Wise 's method , put in a central ring , it may not look too clear . And we ran ropes from the masts to the center ring and in fact cause his method was intended to be allowing the canopies to move backwards and forwards along the ropes to be furled and to be hauled out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of gear so we were n't able to set that part of it up . However , it is a problem because it 's made entirely of rope . Troy suggests here that we could have one complete piece of canvas over there with a hole in the middle and we could draw that out of the edges . Well , the problem there is that if it 's one solid piece of canvas , the circumference of the inner hole is a lot less than the circumference of the outer edge of the canvas . And unless it 's made of elastic , you ca n't possibly pull the inner circle back towards the outer circle , it just would n't work I 'm afraid . It just would n't stretch . <p> Question for Roberts : First , congratulations to all involved for devising two solutions that are both plausible and elegant . Regarding the problem with Chris 's design in the wind : large parade banners and advertising banners strung across city streets are perforated with crescent-shaped slices to lessen the effect of the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Semicircular slits in the canvas would have a minimal ( if any ) effect on the shade provided , but they would allow the wind to pass through with less lifting effect . Michal Answer : He suggests that perhaps perforated canvases would have worked well . Yes , because the packed canvases were already in segments we were actually getting that effect to relieve the pressure of the wind . Now the big problem here is that again when you 've seen it in the film , there was no weight in the material or in the rope . That is there were no booms or pieces of wood so that when the wind got underneath it , it just lifted and flopped up and down . By having the booms in place , you can actually have a great damping effect on each of the canvases . <p> Question for Roberts : I have an idea . If you wanted to extend the horizontal beams farther . You could put in vertical beams to make the horizontals stronger and be able to extend them farther . Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that there 's never been any discovery of what you might want : that is , a line of circular holes somewhere around the edge of the arena to hold the posts which will support the ends of the boom . I think this system is entirely rope supported and is rigged rather like a ship might have been in which case you would n't need vertical posts coming out of the ground further into the arena .

This page shows some of the most important buildings made with the stones of the Colosseum . Surely you 'll recognize some of them ... While putting the page together I noticed how most of the buildings seems to echo the proportions of the original arches of the Colosseum , as if the people who took those stones away could n't refrain from rebuilding something similar . <p> Il Palazzo di Venezia Started in 1455 by Pope Paulus II , was finished in 1467 .

At the end of the XVIII century it was included among the properties that passed from Venice to the Austrian empire as an effect of the Treaty of Campoformio , but in 1916 the Italian government reclaimed it ( Italy then was at war against Austria ) and restored it . During the fascist regime it became the See of the Prime Minister ( the famous Mussolini balcony ) . It was reopened to the public in 1944 and now there is a Museum of different kinds of artworks : paintings , tapestries , sculptures , ancient weapons , clothes , gold and ivory artifacts . <p> San Marco The Basilica of St. Mark was founded in 336 , but it has been rebuilt many times . The one we see today was built in 1455-71 by Cardinal Barbo , who later became Pope Paulus III , for the venetians in Rome . The inside was rearranged in the XVIII century , by adding a baroque decoration , but luckily the front was left untouched . The facade , with its three arched loggia , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon Battista Alberti . It is considered one of the most stylish pieces of architecture of the Renaissance . The bell tower dates back to the XII century . <p> La Scala Santa Built by Domenico Fontana for Pope Sixtus V between 1585 and 1590 , it stands more or less in front of the Palace of Lateran . It was built in order to contain and preserve the old private chapel of the Popes , called Sancta Sanctorum , that was on the first floor of the old palace , called " Il Patriarchio " . The Pope also arranged there the great staircase of the old palace , and it happened that from the XV century the worshippers started to identify it with the staircase that Jesus is said to have ascended , battered and bloody , during his trial at Pilate 's palace , hence the name of Scala Santa ( Holy Stairs ) . This false belief is still alive , and is also reinforced by the glass that covers some of the steps , which are supposed to show the marks left by Jesus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome , remember that you are supposed to ascend the Holy Stairs on your knees . <p> The tribune of San Giovanni in Laterano St. John 's is the Cathedral church of Rome , and the Seat of its Vicario ( which is , traditionally , the Cardinal who deals with the diocesis of Rome , since its real bishop , the Pope , is always very busy in the Vatican ) . It was founded in the IV century on the estate of a wealthy family called Plauzi Laterani , whose properties had been donated by emperor Constantine to the Pope for this purpose . The church was rebuilt many times , and the one we see today was designed by Borromini for the Jubilee year 1650 . Pope Clemens XII rearranged the facade in 1735 , and Leo XIII the apse in 1885 .

The palace was actually built by Giacomo Della Porta , starting in 1563 . The central window was widened up later on , to give more light to the interiors . Maybe not even Michelangelo thought of everything ! <p> Il palazzo della Cancelleria ( the Chancery ) ( right ) Here is another masterpiece of the Renaissance . Started in 1485 and completed in 1513 , it is attributed , maybe falsely , to Bramante , who in fact came to Rome after the start of the building .

After 1870 and the birth of the State of Italy it remained the Chancery of the Vatican , and it still enjoys the privilege of extraterritoriality ( which means that the palace is an enclave of the Vatican City in Italian territory , like the Lateran ) . <p> Palazzo Farnese The Italian Touring Club guide defines it " The most beautiful of the XVI century palaces , that triumphantly closes in Rome the architecture of the Renaissance , started with Palazzo Venezia " . Can I say more ? Three famous architects worked on it : Antonio da Sangallo the Younger started the works in 1514 , Michelangelo took over after Sangallo 's death , and then it was completed by Giacomo della Porta .

After the 1703 earthquake , that caused many travertine blocks to fall from the Colosseum , in 1709 the stones were used by Alessandro Specchi , under the Pope Clemens XI , to build new harbour facilities .

At first , there was only a couple of them , the following year four or five , now there is a legion ( including women posing as " matronae " and older guys in toga as senators ) and there have also been cases of territorial fights .

Unfortunately I had n't got my camera with me ... It seems that 40 of these people have formed an association , which includes centurions , gladiators and even emperors ( probably also including some wives ) , and are asking for official recognition and , possibly , a steady job .

@@47389069 @889069/ <h> S A F A R I <p> Thousands of animals were necessary for the games : when the Colosseum was inaugurated , 9.000 animals were killed , and Suetonius affirms that 5.000 wild beasts were presented to the audience in one single day . Even if these figures are exaggerated , we know for sure that centuries of hunting to provide for the games provoked the extinction of North African lions and elephants . The bears were hunted in Caledonia ( Scotland ) and Pannonia ( today Hungary and Austria ) ; lions and panthers arrived from the African province of Numidia ( today Algeria and Tunisia ) , tigers from Persia , crocodiles and rhinos from India . <p> The task of collecting the beasts and transporting them in good condition for thousands of miles was enormous : animals were chased all over the Empire , and hunting , which was not popular in the late Roman civilization , became an established tradition , from what we can gather from late Empire mosaics and pictures .

The authorities only had to arrange transport to Rome . Later on , under the Empire , the enormous expenses involved prompted the State to organize its own supply system . The legions on the outskirts of the Empire provided the labour force for the capture of the animals , and there were special units exempted from regular service for this purpose .

There was a battle between cranes and also between four elephants ; animals both tame and wild were slain to the number of nine thousand ; and women ( not those of any prominence , however ) took part in despatching them . 2 . As for the men , several fought in single combat and several groups contended together both in infantry and naval battles .

IMO nobody has explained it better than Bill Thayers in his page on the subject : <p> Now before we start , repeat after me : an amphitheatre and a theatre are different types of buildings . Amphi-theatres are " theatres in the round " : amphi- means " around " in Greek . A theatre is a space with a stage , and the audience is on one side of it . People need to hear , so a theatre is relatively small . An amphitheatre is for action : it 's a sports arena , where the spectators sit around the field . They need to see , but they do n't really need to hear , so an amphitheatre can be much larger . <p> The picture on the right ( taken from **28;186;TOOLONG ) shows a Roman theatre and an amphitheatre , still preserved .

Again in 216 the Forum hosted a combat of 22 pairs of gladiators ; in 183 sixty pairs of gladiators fought at the funerals of Publius Licinius Crassus ; in 174 a show lasted for three days . For a long time in Rome , for lack of a proper amphitheatre , the shows were organized in the Forum or in the Circus Maximus . Stalls and awnings were prepared in the Forum for the spectators . In 384 BC Censor Gaius Maenius had wooden balconies built on top of the shops around the Forum , and since then the word " maenianum " indicated the stalls of an amphitheatre ( this according to the grammatician Sextus Pompeius Festus , as reported by AA.VV .

The one of Pompeii , probably the oldest one made of stone , dates back to 69 BC . In Rome the law prohibited the building of structures for shows . Pompey in 55 BC managed to build a theatre only by justifying it as an extension of the Temple of Venus , thus overcoming the ban . Pliny the Elder reports that in 53 or 52 BC C. Scribonius Curio gave games and shows in Rome , and for the occasion he invented an original machine . It was composed of two theatres which could rotate and form one arena . In the morning the public sat in the theatres , then the semicircles were rotated to close the space , so that in the afternoon the people could enjoy the gladiatorial games . Pliny also deplores the fact that the Romans after the first day did not budge from the seats , even while they were being rotated , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls : ... theatra iuxta duo fecit amplissima ligno , cardinum singulorum versatili suspensa libramento , in quibus utrisque antemeridiano ludorum spectaculo edito inter sese aversis , ne invicem obstreperent scaenae , repente circumactis ? ut constat , post primos dies etiam sedentibus aliquis ? , cornibus in se coeuntibus faciebat ampitheatrum gladiatorumque proelia edebat , ipsum magis auctoritatum populum Romanum circumferens .

The first mention belongs to Vitruvius ( De Architectura , I , 7,1 ) .

It seems that wooden structures continued to be popular , regardless of the danger . In 27 AD in Fidene , not far from Rome , one of these wooden amphitheatres collapsed under the excessive weight , killing 20.000 spectators ( if we believe Suetonius ) , or killing and wounding 50.000 ( according to Tacitus ) . <p> Taurus ' amphitheatre , though still in use for a long time , had become inadequate for the splendid shows of the imperial capital , and it seems that Caligula , a great lover of the games had to host the shows in the Saepta , a big public space . Nero in 57 AD finally had a wooden amphitheatre built - it only took one year - for his shows . Suetonius and Tacitus tell us that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it used the longest wooden beam ever seen in Rome : 120 ft. long and 2 ft wide . The descriptions mention decorations of gems , gold , ivory . The wall around the arena had ivory rollers on top , that stopped the wild animals from jumping over , and for more protection a golden net was cast all around , with big pointed tusks leaning inwards . It seems that this theatre disappeared in the most famous of the roman fires : the one of 64 AD.

I never thought to have felt thus tenderly towards Rome ; but the inexpressible solemnity and beauty of her ruined condition has quite bewitched me ; and to the latest hour of my life I shall remember the Forum , the surrounding hills , and the magnificent Colosseum.
