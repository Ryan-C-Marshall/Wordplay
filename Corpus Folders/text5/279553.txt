@@44115724 @4115724/ <p> THis is a thing I could never really figure what type of music Offspring was . Now I believe they are a type of punk . But to me they are just the Offspring . <p> Hysteria <p> 10-28-2004 , 02:05 AM <p> Well it 's an interesting question , one which I believe does n't have a proper answer . <p> Some people say punk , but I classify punk as more Vandals sort of stuff . Some people would say punk-rock , which I think is closer to the offspring 's style , but then you get people calling Good Charlotte punk-rock , so maybe that 's not it either . Not only that , but The Offspring do a few variations , some of their songs are far more rocky , some far more punky . I just classify them as The Offspring , the best genre I can think of them being is Rocky-Punk. : cool : <p> selfrighteoussuicide <p> 10-28-2004 , 02:08 AM <p> i think ' punk metal ' as its a lot heavier than other punk like good charlotte or green day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the genre of Offspring .

The first two albums are punk . Smash is also punk . All the albums are punk , but from " Ixnay " they are more and more rocky , but I think , that " Ixnay " is their best , but it does n't  matter . I think , that now they play skate punk ! Someone said , that its something like Good Charlotte punk , but Good Charlotte is shit ! ! ! Maybe " Hold on " and " Predictable " are good , but my friend borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! " The Offspring " are best in skate punk , because they play it in different way than other skate punk bands .

But you ca n't really classify their style and that 's more than great . And apart fromt that I do n't really care what sort of music it is . It 's just sounds great and even though Ixnay is different from Smash or Ignition ( all albums are different from the other ones ) it 's great . I think that this Offspring style is just good , because the melody always fits to the lyrics . And that 's more important than to stay in a genre .

Punks are bands like the Sex Pistols etc . I do n't think The Offspring or any band today sound like the Sex Pistols , do you ? Therefore The Offspring are not punk , never will be .

@@44115727 @4115727/ <p> This is just my theory , but I think it 's about someone who is an assassin possibly ? And he gets fucked over by someone on the inside . Some of the lyrics that lead me to believe this are , <p> With a thousand lies , and a good disguise This leads me to the conclusion because it makes me picture someone who is there just blending in and has an elaborate cover up because he 's getting ready to pull off some big job . <p> Now dance , fucker , dance I never had a chance They never even knew It was really only you This makes me think of the kid talking to his " boss " saying he took his life from him and brought him into the business and now he 's exacting his revenge by shooting at him ; hence the " dance , fucker , dance ... I never had a chance " The " they never even knew it was really only you " makes me think of how no one would expect someone on the inside to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also some parts about " someone is in your way , time to take him out , nice work you did , you 're gon na go far , kid " That once again reminds me of the boss trying to reassure the kid he 's doing good and would never expect to get fucked over . <p> I 'm sure there 's more , but I 've only listened to the song about 15 times tonight since I got it about an hour ago . So , I 'm sure my theories can be very vague and way off . <p> I apologize for the poor punctuation when describing the lyrics , but I did n't wan na take up more space by skipping a line each time . I 'm just so fucking excited for this album , I 've been waiting 1/4th of my life for this to come out . About 4 1/4 years , and I 'm 18 so the math works : P But yeah I 'm so excited and just wan na talk about this . So let me know what you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RobinoZombie <p> 05-22-2008 , 02:14 AM <p> ill wait until the correct lyrics comes out ; ) <p> BigFish <p> 05-22-2008 , 01:43 PM <p> I think the lyrics are pretty accurate already and its fun to speculate : ) <p> I effin love this song I do n't know what the meaning of it is , exactly .. But , it reminds me alot of my ex , Nick , who was a jerk .. He lies about everything , to keep himself out of shit .. He pretended to be one of his " Best friends " on MSN , to cover his ass , so the friend would have to deal with his shit after he got what he wanted from what he was doing .. He cheated on me &amp;&amp; used me , for sex .. &amp;&amp; told everyone I used him &amp;&amp; was cheating on him , the entire time .. He tried to get into my pants after I had already given him a second change to proove he 'd change , which he did n't take .. He took one of his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a relationship , with her .. &amp;&amp; I guess this song , sorta makes me think of him , in a sarcastic way with , " You 're gon na go far , kid " So , yeps .. &lt;333 <p> I effin love this song I do n't know what the meaning of it is , exactly ..

I do think that artists intend to repeat certain topics in more than one song to deal with it . <p> BitOBear <p> 09-23-2009 , 03:17 AM <p> reposted from elsewhere <p> The song is about a person , the singer , who is first amazed by and then overdone by a person ( the person being sung to/about , e.g. the " kid " ) who used deceit and misrepresentation to make other people take harm or abuse the people they believe to be their enemies or who are seen as an obstacle ... <p> I particular the person being sung about is a vengeful and petty prick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated by " " when I have a guess , as in a wordawkward etc ... <p> Lyrics : <p> Show me how to lie , you 're getting better all the time , and turning all against one is an art that 's hard to teach . Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd , and as you step back into line a mob jumps to their themefeet . <p> Now dance , fucker , dance . He never had a chance . And no one ever knew , it was really only you . And now you steal away , take him outtaken out today . Nice work you did . You 're gon na go far kid . <p> -- Chorus -- With a thousand lies and a good disguise hit um right between the eyes . Hit um right between the eyes .

So play it out , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's something in your way , and now someone 's gon na pay .

And now you lead the way , shownshone the light of day , Nice work you did .

See them running for their lives . <p> ====== <p> Imagery Analysis : ( I 'm about the same age as Dexter , so what I get from the song is likely based on the same cultural assumptions . ) <p> The most important image is " dance , fucker , dance " which most likely goes back to " dancing at the end of a rope " , which is common imagery when combined with rousing a mob to action etc . See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as I can " etc , meaning when someone gets stuck in front of a sea of detractors and has to spend all their time trying to explain things that maybe happened , or maybe did n't instead of getting to get on with their real purpose . <p> In the third , a possible root is as in " now dance , partner " uttered by cowboy-A just before cowboy-A starts shooting in the vicinity of cowboy-B 's feet . The exercise being to publically humiliate cowboy-B by forcing him to jump about to avoid having his foot shot . <p> Additionally the use of " kid " in this form usually refers to an upstart ( youngster ) , fan , supposed appellant , or apprentice ; or a trusted and or trustable close junior associate . ( The diminutive being the endeared or possessed , as in " these are my boys " , " this is my girl " , " he s a good kid " . ) <p> Mob plus lynching is where I put my money . <p> No matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song is a betrayer and a prick of impressive magnitude . <p> The first verse is very much " you got ta teach me that " which is half-sarcastic for how the hell did you do that . <p> As for the " theme " versus " feet " ; The first makes the most sense ( since " kid " can not step back into line if the mob is n't already " on their feet " ) and has a better closure as the mob is marching to the theme of the words . Bit once I saw the second option here I have to admit it matches Dexter 's intonation as well . I choose the former because it 's better and Dexter does n't usually swallow his t 's , making " feet " unlikely . I call it a you-pick line . 8- ) 41164 @qwx451164 <p> 09-23-2009 , 03:36 AM <p> I always thought this song was about Alex Krycek . <p> tony8085 <p> 02-02-2010 , 07:23 PM <p> If I am not mistaken this song is about the fight between not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against GOD . <p> TheOldMark <p> 02-04-2010 , 05:14 PM <p> I have long believed that the lyrics are at least loosely based on Obama . Of course , written before he was president . There are a few lines I believe reference the battle between him and Hilary . This is my interpretation . <p> TommyBoy83 <p> 04-14-2010 , 05:43 PM <p> Alright it 's not about an assassin and it 's not about the book " lord of the flies " When he says hit him right between the eyes that just means shoot to kill or kill in one shot . Not literly kill though . And when he says towards the end of the song " lord of the flies " he 's not talking about the book because where do you think the phrase " lord of the flies " comes from ? It means to be the ruler of a worthless society , so for all of you who are retarded and think that they would write a whole song about a kid 's book just look it up . <p> chicapowerpunk <p> 04-14-2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always i said that this lyrics has double meaning , i believe may be a dad saying to his son about an chance ... we should to know , is the contex .... : rolleyes : : p <p> Jojan <p> 04-15-2010 , 02:49 AM <p> I think it is about oral sex . <p> RexDarr <p> 04-16-2010 , 06:22 PM <p> Has n't this Kid gone FAR ENOUGH ? ? ? ? Seriously ! How far does he have to go ? <p> beccastokes <p> 05-11-2010 , 07:23 PM <p> this song is actually about the book Lord of the Flies by William Golding . It 's a little hard to get at first , but you have to think about it like what Ralph , the protagonist , would say to Jack , the antagonist . the line ' turning all against one ' is about when Jack gets all the boys on the island to try and kill Ralph . the line " dance fucker dance " is about the multiple parts in the book where Jack gets all the boys to participate in a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . the lines about a ' good disguise ' is about when Jack paints his face and gets a ' war mask ' . " hit him right between the eyes " is when the boys kill another , minor protagonist , Piggy . Piggy gets a rock dropped on him , right between the eyes . The strongest evidence , however , is in the last 20 seconds when they say " alibis , Lord of the flies . " <p> batfish <p> 05-13-2010 , 11:15 AM <p> The first verse makes me think it 's about the media stirring things up - " clever words " , " a mob jumps to their feet " . I think it could be a reference to the way the media have been reporting on the situation in the Middle East over the past decade , or just the way some reports in general are totally biased and create a " bad guy " that everyone loves to hate , but who is n't really bad . <p> But that does n't quite square with the lines " So play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scene about me . " Maybe it 's about the right-wing media going after liberal people ? <p> Colbey54 <p> 10-12-2011 , 04:09 PM <p> The first time I heard this song , one subject immediately came to mind . <p> Now , I may be guilty here of contorting the facts the meet my perception of what this song really means , but I have a feeling I 'm not too far off base with this one . <p> While examining the song , I took the following facts into consideration : #1 - The album cover art for this single is a Bald Eagle with a red X over its eyes . The Bald Eagle is a symbol of the US , and the national bird . An X over the eyes , in art , typically means extreme damage or death . The fact that it 's red , I believe , is only accentuated by the fact that the rest of the artwork is black and white , bringing attention to the symbol , not necessarily meaning one political party or another . <p> #2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 .

The Bald Eagle is a symbol of the US , and the national bird . An X over the eyes , in art , typically means extreme damage or death . The fact that it 's red , I believe , is only accentuated by the fact that the rest of the artwork is black and white , bringing attention to the symbol , not necessarily meaning one political party or another . <p> #2 - The album was written from November 2006 - April 2008 .

Check out some stuff by middle period Mr. Bungle , late period Dismemberment Plan , Mars Volta or even a few specks of Dillinger Escape Plan . Extreme metal ( blast beats ) is not as hard as people make it out to be .... the only thing difficult about it is the double bass and once you get that down the rest is easy .

Although I do agree Josh Freese is a kickass drummer because he 's not annoyingly straight-forward with what he plays and he goes super fast ( plus some of the stuff he 's done in non-vandals bands have been amazing too ) . Also , in terms of the whole tribal-metal beats ( i.e. Tool ) , if you have any sort of natural rhythm , it 's the easiest style of drums to play ( although one of the harder ones to actually work into a song without it sounding dumb ) . That being said , Danny Carey plays faster and more complicated than most others in his style , I just used Tool as an example because they were the first that came to mind with that style . <p> The Cheshire Cat <p> 11-27-2004 , 11:32 AM <p> So long as you can keep good time , pretty much everything is the same on drums .

Because they 're really big , commercial success has almost everything to do with it ( that and they also just happened to be influential and were among the first , so it works out for them all around . But that 's not going to matter in the long run . You never hear about Green River , Mudhoney , or Mother Love Bone in the " big " grunge lists ) . MTV 's perceived influence of bands ' popularity is sometimes skewed , I think . <p> Flaming Skull <p> 09-25-2011 , 01:34 AM <p> The Big 4 were so named because they were the top 4 thrash metal bands to come out of San Francisco in the 80s , and I 'm not sure how popular Slayer are where you 're from , but Slayer is a big f-ing deal sales-wise in the US . They also kill ( pun intended ) on tour , which is probably where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel of Death t-shirts . <p> Exodus and Testament were also big thrash metal bands to come from San Francisco in the 80s , but they have n't sold as well as Anthrax over the years , so they did n't make it into the Big 4 ( though I hear Exo was going to replace Megadeth in NYC when they dropped off the bill for a hot minute when Megadave fell i 'll . But , Megadeth played on ) . <p> MTV status has nothing to do with how the Big 4 were selected . I agree . I saw the Big 4 last July and it was amazing . Every band kicked ass ( even though I ca n't stand Mustaine 's voice ) . I 'd pick Testament as an eventual 5th to expand the Big4 , but Exodus are great too ( and Exodus ' guitarist Gary Holt replaced Slayer 's Hanneman for a lot of shows ) . <p> My comment about MTV was because whoever goes there tend to be called " sold out " which is definitely not the case of NOFX ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blink-182 sold more than NOFX and Rancid . Also , NOFX sold more than Rancid . But out of these 3 , the biggest are NOFX , no doubt about that . Blink-182 owe their success to the success of Green Day 's " Dookie " . And so does Sum41 which came shortly after . So again , in my opinion , here are the Big 4 of Punk : -Bad Religion - one of the most influential punk-rock band ever , godfathers of So-Cal punk -NOFX - one of the most successful independent bands ever . And they keep being independent , and look how important Fat Wreck Chords has become , while still being an independent label -The Offspring - still the band with the best-selling independent record of all times -Green Day - influential pop-punk band , after " Dookie " many bands started out covering them and trying to follow their style ... Rancid are not an important band as those other 4 . <p> Flaming Skull <p> 09-25-2011 , 08:57 AM <p> I was surfing net and fortunately came across this site and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read .

I really do n't care very much about where things are located . I have never actively studied it . In grade 9 geography we learned about provinces and volcanoes and stuff . I do n't know much about history either . Once again mostly just learned Canadian history . Perhaps that 's a problem with the education system here - sheltering us too much . <p> I 'm sure not too many people could tell me about Friedel-Crafts reactions , but those are the things that I spend my time and effort and interest on . <p> Anyway , the point is that these people should not be referred to as " stupid " . <p> Aside : I ca n't look it up , but one of the best Onion headlines was about students getting all of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were all these names like Kamchatka " ... <p> nieh <p> 02-04-2005 , 05:21 PM <p> see , that 's the thing . If it were just showing America 's statistics , and they were bad on their own , I could deal with that . As I said before , I suck really horribly at geography so I can see why other people would n't do well . What bothers me is that just about EVERY OTHER COUNTRY ( cept Mexico ) did better than us . And it was n't even like they got 1-2 more right , they did a LOT better than us . To me it 's because we have a tendency to be cocky and never bother knowing what 's going on outside of our borders until it becomes a problem for us because we 're in the mindset that we have no reason to . Argh , stupid people . 41136 @qwx451136 <p> 02-04-2005 , 08:23 PM <p> In grade 9 geography we learned about provinces and volcanoes and stuff . I do n't know much about history either . Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with the education system here - sheltering us too much . <p> It 's not the same thing in Quebec . I had Quebec and Canada geography in 5th grade . I had geography of the world in 7th grade and I had history ( from the homo habilis to 2000 something ) in grade 8 . In grade 9 it was Quebec and Canada geography , again . In grade 10 it was history of Quebec and Canada . Everybody has to take those classes . You have to pass the history course of secondary 4 ( grade 10 ) to have your diploma of high school . One of my option class this year is history of old civilisations . <p> sk8ter-hater <p> 02-04-2005 , 08:37 PM <p> Have n't read all the posts in this thread but : <p> WHAT ? ! <p> I ca n't believe the stupidity involved in that - it 's , it 's incomprehensible ...... : eek : <p> And they say Americans are stupid !

Or not having been taught A LOT about it , anyway . <p> I agree that a lot of people from other parts of the world seem to know a lot more about geography , etc . <p> I guess I just would n't say that " Americans are stupid " ... that 's such a bad stereotype . Arrogant maybe ... I do n't know . <p> nieh <p> 02-05-2005 , 12:15 PM <p> Yeah , arrogance and cockiness are more prevalent than genuine stupidity , it 's just in my head they 're different types of stupidity ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word ' stupid ' still comes to mind for me sometimes . You can only put so much blame on lack of interest though , because I do n't particularly see why an average person in another country would be any more inclined to learn that stuff than here ( unless you take the whole arrogance factor into account ) . For people to not be able to find their own country on a map ... it 's just sad . <p> Holy crap , I just started took the Sample Survey on that article and it 's making me feel even worse ( I du n no why I did n't take it when I posted this thing ) . Only 25% of American 's know America 's population . 35% of Mexican 's know it , 47% of Canadians know it , but only 25% of us ! ? Anyway , I got all of the questions right ... and to answer everyone 's question , there ARE borders on the map on the quiz , with a number inside each country . It asks " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers you can pick from . Since it 's multiple choice , that makes it that much easier . <p> Betty <p> 02-05-2005 , 12:32 PM <p> I think I got 4 wrong on the quiz . Which I suppose is a testament to how generally easy it is . Since geography/history I really do n't know anything about . Also , pop culture I 'm pretty bad at as well . Essentially anything that would be a popular trivia question . I am always disappointed at the lack of science/math on shows like Jeopardy , etc . <p> Only 1 was a map question , which is embarrassing enough , but it could be worse . <p> Some were sorta guessed though ... like Sweden for example ... I have a general idea where it is ... but if the options had only been beside each other ... I would n't have known which one it was . <p> nieh <p> 02-05-2005 , 12:44 PM <p> Yeah , to be honest , I would have missed like 3 of the map ones had they not been multiple choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 02-09-2005 , 06:44 AM <p> i can n't believe it most of chinese younster can locate irap or america on a map i especially have interesting on geogrophic i can locate any country on a map when i was 13 another question : can you locate china on a map ?

In music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , album or even artist is common practice . Many people , governments , religious sects , education systems , retailers and lobbying groups censor music for many reasons . From all around the world , artists songs , albums and even the artists them selves have been banned or blacklisted . In modern times artists from all over the globe have been banned or blacklisted : Eminem in the US , Afghani artist Farhad Darya by the Taliban , Cuban artist Gorki Carrasco imprisoned in 2003 , in 1998 Algerian artist Matoub Lounes was assassinated , religious authorities in Pakistan banned artist Junoon and Iranian female artist Parissa faces sever restrictions because she is a women . The horrors of racial hatred during World War II censored artist as well , in Stalins Russia artist Dmitri Shostakovich was banned and harassed and Hitlers Nazi-Europe banned Austrian artist Arnold Schonberg . There are three ways music is censored : through political programs , on the airwaves and in the market place . All three of these are a disgrace to our Constitution as well as UN standards laid out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of Human Rights and must be abolished . <p> Music is n't just banned because of the use of profanity in its lyrics ; often music is banned on its subject matter . Thought our Constitution gives us rights to opinion , radio stations censor songs and blacklist artists . Take for example , the boycott and destruction of albums by radio stations of The Dixie Chicks after their anti-Bush remarks . Another example System Of A Down and Rage Against the Machine are frequently discriminated against because of their political views expressed in their lyrics . <p> Born in Algeria in 1956 , Matoub Lounes was of French origin ; he refused to speak Arabic and protested the Algerian government during its civil conflicts . During a riot he was shot five times by a police officer and left for dead , his recovery lasted for two years . Then in 1994 , the Armed Islamic Group , also known as the GIA , an Islamic extremist group , abducted him and condemned him to death . However , as a group of Lounes supporters gathered for a demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Islamic people if Lounes was murdered , the GIA quickly released Lounes . Four years later , while driving on some mountain roads Lounes stopped at a roadblock , the men who surrounded his car and began firing upon his car , killing Lounes and seriously injuring his three passengers , the GIA eventually claimed responsibility for Matoub Lounes murder . However , many still speculate that the Algerian government was really responsible for his murder . <p> Matoub Lounes is an extreme case of censorship by religious fanatics and/or by the government . In our everyday lives were exposed to censorship every time we turn on our radios . Censorship on the airwaves is nothing new ; one of the earliest examples of censorship on the radio is of George Formbys " When I 'm Cleaning Windows " , in 1940 it was banned on BBC radio due to " smutty lyrics " . Eminem has been blacklisted many times in the past and the Federal Communications Commission , FCC , has even fined and penalized radio stations for playing his songs . Censoring songs on the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to resampling ( inserting a new word ) . The words that are censored are , among many others , are the Seven Dirty Words as pointed out by American comedian George Carlin . On October 30 , 1973 Pacifica radio station WBAI-FM broadcasted one of Carlins version of his " Seven Dirty Words " routine uncensored . That day the FCC received many complaints from angry parents , who were upset that their children had to listen to the routine on live radio . The FCC and Pacifica radio station went to the Supreme Court to fight the issue , however , the Supreme Court went in favor of the FCC . The FCC then regulated when radio stations could and could not air uncensored material , this is that during 6am to 10pm radio stations should censor their material , and during 10pm to 6am it is acceptable to play uncensored material . The spectrum of profane words has been both expanded and cut down . In Carlins " Seven Dirty Words " the words " piss " and " tits " were included , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn " and " asshole " are recognized as profane and are censored on the air . <p> One of the most sought after Beatles records is their 1966 " Yesterday and Today " original pasted-over album . The album cover you will see today is the reissued cover , however when it was originally released it featured the four band members in white smocks covered in blood and surrounded in dismembered baby dolls . Capitol Records pulled all of the " butcher " " Yesterday and Today " albums and replaced the cover with what you will find today . With many of the records they just pasted the new cover over the old cover . Today this album is sold from 800 dollars and upward on Ebay . The more common use of censorship in marketing today is the use of the Parental Advisory stickers , which are either placed on the wrapper or the album itself . This sticker has been in use for " explicit lyrics " since 1985 , the Recording Industry Association of America is responsible for the sticker . It is estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticker . Some politicians have tried and pushed for legislation to prosecute retailers who sale albums containing the sticker to minors . It is generally agreed that seventeen is a suitable age to purchase such albums . <p> Danish research assistant for the Centre for Human Rights , Karen Hald complied her arguments against music censorship in her essay made available thanks to Freemuse.org , " Music A Human Right : Music and The Universal Declaration of Human Rights . " She Claims , " Like all other human beings , every individual musician is protected by a number of human rights . He or she has the right to freedom of association , freedom of religion , to family and private life , to food , housing , education , etc. all according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . All human rights are as important for musicians as they are for everyone else . However , two of these rights are of special relevance for musicians : the freedom of expression and the right to participate in cultural life . Together , these two offer a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The essay uses the UNs Declaration of Human Rights , which was first drafted in 1948 . Hald claims that music encompasses the ultimate act of expression by human beings , that lyrics proclaim human emotion and that even the melody of a song expresses emotion and that these are both protected under Article 19 of the UNs Declaration of Human Rights . Which guarantees the right to freedom of expression . The essay also points out the European Court of Human Rights bold statement on freedom of expression , " Those who create , perform , distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society . Hence the obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on their freedom of expression . " The essay claims that , as it is the right of musicians that it is improper to impose any type of censoring of that music , regardless of its lyrical content . Hald does however point out a few exceptions that include , propaganda and protection of national security . A very recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon Bikindi , who was convicted on December 2 , 2008 for direct and public incitement to commit genocide . The UNs Declaration of Human Rights , has no way of protection artists from these violations . Therefore in 1966 the UN issued two new international Conventions to establish means of international reaction against human rights violations : first the Convention on Economical , Social and Cultural Rights , then the Convention on Civil and Political Rights . <p> Halds second argument deals with Article 27 of the Declaration of Human Righs , the rights to freely participate in the cultural life of the community . She claims that music in itself , aside of being an act of expression , is a cultural activity . Hald points out that Article 27 guarantees the freedoms ; to produce and perform music , to listen and enjoy music by other artists , the right to protect ones own musical interests , and the freedom to play ones own cultural music . However , unlike Article 19 there are no committees that artists who feel this right has been violated can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this planet , it is understood by all people and cultures . It is a violation of human rights that are guaranteed by not only the UN but of our own government in our Constitution to censor any music in any form . As Karen Hald says , music is a human right . Censoring music is , as defined by our First Amendment Rights , a violation and unconstitutional . <p> Not to be an asshole , but I actually tried to read it ... and then got annoyed/frustrated before finishing the first paragraph due to the complete lack of English grammar . : -/ Your entire first paragraph consists of lists of things that were improperly organized . <p> Normally I try to refrain from complaining about grammar , but this IS an English paper .

I do n't drink when I get up in the morning , and although I drink more than is good for me , that does n't make me a full-on drunk . I enjoy drinking , and do so quite often , but that 's not alcoholism . Alcoholism is a much more serious problem than just being drunk a lot once you leave home . It 'll probably cool down after your first or second year . <p> What I think I mean is that it 's more of a dependence on alcohol rather than simple overconsumption .

Bassist , Guitarist and Vocalist has never been a problem for us mainly because me and Tony can play bass and guitar and we can both sing fairly well so if we get a jackoff guitarist or something we can switch him to something he 's actually good at and one of us can take over that position . <p> nieh <p> 11-27-2004 , 12:42 PM <p> it depends on what you 're trying to play ... why are you saying bass in easier than power chords ?

I do n't really think the fish-in-a-barrel thing applies here . It works for things like , when shitty comedians joke about Michael Jackson , Paris Hilton , or the Kardashians .

It 's reasonable for people to question why it is . Also , more importantly , Fox News is actually relevant- it influences a lot of people in the US , so what 's wrong with talking about it ?

Punk is extremely boring and easy . Ca n't compare Metallica with a 2 minutes ( or less ) punk song .

There is awesome classical stuff around , or try the SILENT HILL games soundtrack , that 's real amazing . Led Zeppelin as well , try fingerpicking ( I find it a real challenge on the electric guitar , but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arpeggios , they sound awesome and it helps you a lot with the soloing stuff .

How do I guess ? They are doing an anti-religion song . <p> I think it 's about people being brainwashed . So they are left in the dark and it 's difficult to get rid of it . Masses can be brainwashed by a religion . <p> Hero song is an interesting guess too . My bet is on Secrets from the Underground for a hero song . It reminds me of those vampire hero movies like Twilight . <p> We have also , Drove , promise lyrics . &amp; Fire raining in on you lyrics . <p> But , it difficult to connect with anything . <p> TeddyBearArmy <p> 05-03-2012 , 09:30 AM <p> oh yeah , the anti religion song .

Maybe , it 's only against abuse of religion . Even great scientists can be religious and probably all people have some beliefs . If you do n't believe or do good things then you are probably a bad person . But , I guess in the internet age people do n't need to be extremely religious , there is a place to improve yourself , for everyone , and I guess for some people it could be a problem to have some religious dogmas in their heads ... <p> randman21 <p> 05-03-2012 , 11:03 AM <p> I also believe this is " Hurting As One , " but where are we getting these themes from ?

I always took that one as more of a message against brainwashing in general ; whether it 's a cult , negative media messages , or what we experience from society in some ways . It does n't seem to mention religion at all . It does n't appear to imply either . At least that 's what I think .

That 's not what this topic 's about . It 's about remembering the lives and deaths of every one of the Nazi 's victims . <p> Mr.Fletcher <p> 01-27-2005 , 09:26 AM <p> Mr.Fletcher -you do n't really know what I 'm talking about , do you ? or what you yourself are talking about , for that matter . <p> the Holocaust was n't just the killing in Auschwitz - it was everywhere . people in Auschwitz had to live under terrible conditions . yes , for a short time , until they were killed . but the torture &amp; horror that went on in other camps .. what I 've heard &amp; also what I have n't heard will never leave my mind . <p> Amersfoort was a Dutch concentrationcamp &amp; it was one of the most horrifying ones ever to exist . still even most Dutch people do n't have a clue , that there even was one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEVER hear anything about the camps , where they pulled out my grandfather 's finger- &amp; toenails . where they stuck a hose up people 's asses , until they 'd puke bowels &amp; poo , what lead to their deaths . &amp; so much more , I do n't even want to think of . <p> Sry , my mistake . Yes I know ' holocaust ' is a name for the overall . <p> Auschwitz was the biggest concentration camp in whole Europe . There were like three parts of Auschwitz : Auschwitz I the oldest part , Auschwitz II Birkenau and Auchwitz III Monowitz . <p> People there were also treated inhumanly . Medical experiments were made on the imprisoned ; women had to birth children in places full of germs and rats , people were executed , forced to work over their abilities . They were dying becouse of epidemics , hunger , tortures , punishment . Not only Jews were killed in Auschwitz . There were also Gypsys , Polish people the elite of polish community - leaders , scientists , sportsmen , writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalities . <p> Since 1940 to 1945 about 1,1 - 1,5 million of people died in this one concentration camp . <p> JoY <p> 01-27-2005 , 09:48 AM <p> I know all this . but that does n't take away the fact , that it simply was n't the only camp . people -were- treated horribly , but not just there . that 's my point . the only thing , that makes the difference between Auschwitz &amp; some of the rest , are the gas-chambers . BUT extermination also took place in Kulmhof , Belzec , Sobibor , Treblinka &amp; Majdanek. &amp; I do n't care if in the end less people were killed there , than in Auschwitz - people were killed . Auschwitz may represent that &amp; be the symbol of the Holocaust , I just think many people forget about the reality of this &amp; how many other places there were , besides Auschwitz , where people were tortured , robbed of freedom , killed , excluded from society , etc . <p> &amp; you forgot mentally disabled . <p> ( do n't think I dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. ' passionate ' ( though that is n't the right word ) about this subject . ) <p> Mr.Fletcher <p> 01-27-2005 , 10:02 AM <p> Who talks about disliking ? we just discuss . I do n't  think people forget about other camps , places . I assume they remamber and show their compassion by visiting those places , bringing fresh flowers and candles as a symbol of a memory that still lives inside them . The fact is Auschwitz was the biggest of them all . Through years it became a symbol of the holocaust . That 's why there 's ' the fuss ' about Auschwitz . If for example Kulmhof was the biggest , there will probably be a fuss over the Kulmhof . That 's quite obvious . 41154 @qwx451154 <p> 01-27-2005 , 10:11 AM <p> shatskater , have you ever been in Auschwitz ? Have you ever seen the crematory , the barracks , piles of cut hair , empty boxes of Cyclone B on your own eyes ? Have ever talked to a person who survived the concetration camp ? If not , you should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> *agrees* It was so ... meh . Du n no . Impressive is the only word I can think of . <p> Vera <p> 01-27-2005 , 11:30 AM <p> For a person who supposedly has studied these things , shatskater , you do not seem to realize the way Hitler 's ideology worked . <p> Born a Jew , always a Jew . Being Jewish did not mean just belonging to a different religion , it meant that you had Jewish BLOOD running in your veins . The same animal blood that had wrecked the originally divine Aryan race during centuries and centuries . It was thanks to Jews that Germany lost WW1 . <p> You ca n't convert from being a Jew into an Aryan . If it would 've been that simple , that many Jews would n't have been killed . <p> The question whether Hitler truly believed in his ideology can be asked and ca n't be definitely answered but what remains is the fact that the man acted according to his ideology . To rid his Great Germany of everyone who was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps that did not only kill Jews , they also killed regular Germans who had something that might poison the Aryan blood . Even people who had epilepsia were sent off to the camps because epilepsia was considered a genetical disease . Children with disabilities ( mental or physical ) were killed , as well . <p> It is extremely tactless to make Jew jokes on a day like this , in a topic like this . It is inconsiderate and stupid . Even if you do find it funny , you should realize that there is a time and a place for certain jokes and this was definitely not the correct time or the place to show off your " twisted sense of humor " . Not realizing that really makes you more ignorant than your lack of spelling or your often rather stupid comments have previously proved . <p> Also , you said that it was the peoples fault for following him . Remember 1930 's depression ? It was then that Hitler 's party 's support rocketed . Often in times of recession , people seek promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the people 's side . Anti-semitism had always existed in Europe . Propaganda works . But ultimately , in Hitler 's nation , you did n't have the right to think differently . If you did , it was very likely you would be the one sent to the concentration camp yourself . Many Germans did hide Jews in their homes or organized it for some of the Jewish population to flee the country in order to protect them . <p> In short , no , it was not the people 's fault . They did n't go , " Hey let 's kill a couple of million Jews ! " , those who were n't brainwashed definitely did n't support it . <p> Again , for a person who has supposedly studied these things a lot and knows " quite a lot " , you do n't seem to know jackshit . <p> Eccentric Sara <p> 01-27-2005 , 12:39 PM <p> Somethign stirred in my mind , so I googled up and managed to find a poem on this . <p> Vultures by Chinua Achebe <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbingers of sunbreak a vulture perching high on broken bone of a dead tree nestled close to his mate his smooth bashed-in head , a pebble on a stem rooted in a dump of gross feathers , inclined affectionately to hers . Yesterday they picked the eyes of a swollen corpse in a water-logged trench and ate the things in its bowel . Full gorged they chose their roost keeping the hollowed remnant in easy range of cold telescopic eyes ... Strange indeed how love in other ways so particular will pick a corner in that charnel-house tidy it and coil up there , perhaps even fall asleep - her face turned to the wall ! <p> ... Thus the Commandant at Belsen Camp going home for the day with fumes of human roast clinging rebelliously to his hairy nostrils will stop at the wayside sweet-shop and pick up a chocolate for his tender offspring waiting at home for Daddy 's return ... <p> Praise bounteous providence if you will that grants even an ogre a tiny glow-worm tenderness encapsulated in icy caverns of a cruel heart or else despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perpetuity of evil . Jeez ! How random ! We did this poem for GCSE English ! It was in the big booklet of poems and stuff they give you to study ! ! ! Anyway , yeah , I think the Holocaust was hideous , but I have to say I do n't know that much about it ! We studied it in Year 9 History ( when I was 13/14 ) , but I have n't done any history since then , so my knowledge is really patchy . Going to Auschwitz does sound interesting though . <p> RXP <p> 01-27-2005 , 12:42 PM <p> I saw the documentary on the BBC last week . It was awful I did n't watch yesterdays one . I coudl n't . <p> Mota Boy <p> 01-27-2005 , 12:56 PM <p> Come on people , the guy has demonstrated multiple times in the past that he 's a borderline retard without the ability to reason . I do n't think you can get mad at him for posting Holocaust jokes in a thread about the anniversary of Auschwitz 's liberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the kitchen floor . Why y'all would allow one moron to derail this thread is beyond me . <p> That said , I 've been to the Holocaust museum in Washington D.C. and found it fascinating and horrifying , but not as deeply moving as so many people had portrayed it to be . I think that I 've heard about the atrocities committed there so often that hearing about them for the umpteenth time , even as well presented as it was , did n't shock or deeply move me , for I 'd already heard everything . <p> Still , actually seeing some of the ovens , the shorn hair and decaying shoes , and hearing firsthand accounts of time spent there was powerful , but nothing that I was n't prepared to see . <p> Vera <p> 01-27-2005 , 01:14 PM <p> Why y'all would allow one moron to derail this thread is beyond me . It pains me when people are ignorant and stupid about this particular crime against humanity . Partly because it happened so close , both geographically and ... timely ( ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . It 's just frustrating and makes my blood boil . <p> Also , it 's easier to rant at some motherfucker than start remembering every horrible detail you have heard about the death camps . It 's a really strange event , the way it has affected future generations so much . It 's like this big something that wo n't leave our minds no matter how hard we might try . <p> HornyPope <p> 01-27-2005 , 01:48 PM <p> I 'm surprised there was only one enfant-provocateur in this topic . Usually they form a wolfpack . It 's not a question of being mean or ignorant on their part but rather the search for attention . Happens all the time . Do n't waste your breath . <p> Moving on . <p> I bought a book today on the marking speaches of the 20th century . As I skimmed through it I saw Elie Wiesel 's name . I 'm a fan of his . Read his two books--L'aube and La Nuit . The latter about his personal experience in the Holocausat and more specifically- Auschwitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as a man , who 50 years and nine days ago had no name , no hope , no future and was known only by his number , A7713 . <p> I speak as a Jew who has seen what humanity has done to itself by trying to exterminate an entire people and inflict suffering and humiliation and death on so many others . <p> In this place of darkness and malediction we can but stand in awe and remember its stateless , faceless and nameless victims . Close your eyes and look : endless nocturnal processions are converging here , and here it is always night . Here heaven and earth are on fire . <p> Close your eyes and listen . Listen to the silent screams of terrified mothers , the prayers of anguished old men and women . Listen to the tears of children , Jewish children , a beautiful little girl among them , with golden hair , whose vulnerable tenderness has never left me . Look and listen as they quietly walk towards dark flames so gigantic that the planet itself seemed in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from everywhere , a gathering of exiles drawn by death . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba . <p> In this kingdom of darkness there were many people . People who came from all the occupied lands of Europe . And then there were the Gypsies and the Poles and the Czechs ... It is true that not all the victims were Jews . But all the Jews were victims . <p> Now , as then , we ask the question of all questions : what was the meaning of what was so routinely going on in this kingdom of eternal night . What kind of demented mind could have invented this system ? <p> And it worked . The killers killed , the victims died and the world was the world and everything else was going on , life as usual . In the towns nearby , what happened ? In the lands nearby , what happened ? Life was going on where God 's creation was condemned to blasphemy by their killers and their accomplices . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba . <p> Turning point or watershed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting man 's dreams and endeavours . After Auschwitz , the human condition is no longer the same . After Auschwitz , nothing will ever be the same . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba . <p> As we remember the solitude and the pain of its victims , let us declare this day marks our commitment to commemorate their death , not to celebrate our own victory over death . <p> As we reflect upon the past , we must address ourselves to the present and the future . In the name of all that is sacred in memory , let us stop the bloodshed in Bosnia , Rwanda and Chechnia ; the vicious and ruthless terror attacks against Jews in the Holy Land . Let us reject and oppose more effectively religious fanaticism and racial hate . <p> Where else can we say to the world " Remember the morality of the human condition , " if not here ? <p> For the sake of our children , we must remember Birkenau , so that it does not become their future . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then : weep for them , our Father in heaven , for they were deprived of their right to be buried , for heaven itself became their cemetery . <p> shatskater <p> 01-27-2005 , 04:17 PM <p> For a person who supposedly has studied these things , shatskater , you do not seem to realize the way Hitler 's ideology worked . <p> Born a Jew , always a Jew .

@@44115780 @4115780/ <p> Serious question . Liberals suck and so do conservatives , but libertarians seem to get it right most of the time . So why are liberals so goddamn scared of libertarians all of a sudden ?

Anyone who knows 5th-grade American history knows that our nation has had problems in the past with big corporations getting together and completely buttfucking people throughout an entire industry . Libertarians tend to argue in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give the corporations more tax breaks and more money , they 'll do the right thing on their own and put that money back into the economy and create more jobs ! " And we 're just expected to trust them to do " the right thing , " without any failsafe against them choosing to do otherwise . Trickle-down economics is bullshit ; when the rich get richer , they do n't make more jobs , they hoard the money and drought the economy . <p> - ) they tend to NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY 'RE TALKING ABOUT . Tax protesters , for instance , who protest not " excessive " taxes but the very concept of taxes in the first place , as if they 're completely unaware of the fact that SOME taxes are needed to run a country ( see : city lays off entire police force because they ca n't afford to pay them LONG ... Wanting to abolish the IRS without considering an alternative means to raise the revenue that would be lost en masse by such a closure . Wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue that would entail . Bitching about " high taxes " when we have historically low federal tax revenue . Wanting to completely abolish the Pell Grant . Wanting to cut from Medicare and Medicaid so they can afford to give more tax breaks to the top 25% income bracket , calling MD and Social Security " entitlements " as if that were a derogatory term ( you pay into them , therefore you 're " entitled " to a return , simple as that ) . Among other things . <p> Just off the top of my head . <p> ospringfan112113 <p> 08-14-2011 , 12:08 AM <p> libertarians seem to get it right most of the time libertarian philosophy is based on fairness and common sense and So why do they suck so much ? <p> Personally I do n't care for liberatarians ethier .

These people are stealing our money and telling us it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new wonderful jobs that will begin to appear when we start using our imagination.They have no idea what they 're , but as long as they keep getting paid its all good for them .

However , real life does n't allow such a simplistic view to actually function .

Then you have things like racism , sexism , and other issues that keep people down . Obviously a white male has a much better chance in this world to follow the " hard work = more money " mold , but a black female ?

Also , Communism-seeking socialist states do not need an all-controlling government , in fact not a government at all . This is the problem with both Communism and Libertarianism - neither of these concepts CAN be " tried out " in their most fundamental , according-to-paper forms . In order for Communism to function without a government , every single person in a nation would have to just AGREE to work as a Communist state , which is impossible . No nation is ever unanimous about how their nation is run . Therefore , a government is necessary , and will generally devolve into a power-hungry one . That 's just nature . <p> Basically , both Communism and Libertarianism sound excellent when you write it down and outline it ; but they ca n't work in real life . <p> This is off-topic I know , I just do n't want to see anyone here drawing lines between Communism and USSR .

I 've come to believe the whole deregulation ( or even to too much regulation ) aspect of this crisis has been overstated . Housing bubble or no housing bubble , the most important problem everyone seems to be overlooking is the horrible job the Federal Reserve has done . Recessions by the most part are a monetary phenomenon . Put simply , when there 's an excess demand for money and the money supply does n't increase sufficiently , we get a recession . As the sole issuer of money , the Federal reserve completely fell asleep on the wheel . And I do n't mean to take a Ron Paul position with his whole end the Fed campaign and going back to the gold standard . For all his government intervention opposition , going on a gold standard is one of the biggest government interventions one can make . My position is quite the opposite since I would like the Fed to do more while RP wants less . Still , I would agree with Ron Paul , for completely difference reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a government failure . As long as the government insists on having a monopoly on currency , any blame on major business cycle fluctuations should fall on government . Technically the laissez-faire alternative to the Fed is " free banking " where banks are allowed to issue their own currency . Theoretically , banks would expand the money supply as needed to avoid recession in times like these . While I 'm skeptical that free banking would would be better than our current monetary system , as long free banking does n't exist , all responsibility and blame needs to fall squarely on the Fed . Thus , I want to once again pimp a NGDP level targeting rule LONG ... for the Fed to follow .

The name American Idiot speaks about the government and is n't immature , although I guess the song could be viewed that way . Whenever I look up the lyrics to any song on Dookie , I am almost repulsed by the immaturity . The pictures on the inside cover of that album are immature , too .

That 's natural , when you find a song nothing special , and it keeps playing on a radio . It can get real boring . I love the offspring songs , but I reckon that , to a person who does n't like their music , it can be terrible listening to their songs over and over in the radio , which was what happened during the smash and americana era . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone I know that has bought Smash still remains a fan today , and everyone that I saw criticizing negatively The Offspring during the Smash era still criticizes them today . <p> The main problem is their lousy marketing , indeed , that 's my opinion ... it even looks like they 're not interested in selling their product ... there 's no publicity at all to the Offspring DVD in my country .. it 's unbelievable , and the DVD is a real masterpiece ... <p> SeX PistoL <p> 07-25-2005 , 02:20 AM <p> it green day all over agian 41168 @qwx451168 <p> 07-25-2005 , 03:01 AM <p> i read an Interview with Noodles about this <p> On that subject , a lot of your early fans might say that The Offsprings music changed from Smash , through Ixnay ... into Americana . Some people felt that the record companies forced you to create a more " commercial " sound or whatever . Is that true , or did it come from within the band independently ? Firstly let me say there was no pressure ever from our record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the muscle to do what we wanted and on every record we wanted to progress our sound . Actually , when we made Ixnay we felt pressure to make a more hardcore record , and maybe some pressure to make a record full of Come Out and Plays . It was an intense time , but we decided , " *uck it , let 's make what we want " ... I do n't  think Ixnay was that different , maybe Americana a bit . But I do n't  think it was our fans , just other people giving us shit , you know , sour grapes ... I think whenever you succeed or sell a lot of records , rise in pop music or whatever , there is always going to be criticism . 41177 @qwx451177 <p> 07-25-2005 , 03:21 AM <p> thier are very few people who like hard , fast punk and catchy pop tunes like " Hit That " .

EOTL , HYE , kID , SATS . <p> I thought Hit that was 10 times better then OP or Pretty fly . I also found great songs on CO1 and Splinter . Lightning Rod , CGMHAY , MMA , Denial . <p> The band 's music has changed .

If you are going to insult the offspring do it somewhere else . <p> Chngthwrld <p> 07-25-2005 , 10:59 PM <p> I wonder why people diss Pretty Fly so much . I do n't like it as a song to listen to so much but the sarcasm in that song is hilarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who adopted the song and started to sing it . I think this song has been one of the biggest jokes ever . It cracked me up every time I saw a white boy with baggy pants , some Fubu 13 or whatever shirt , cap the wrong way on his head and with a fake gold big necklace singing to Pretty Fly getting pumped up especially on the All the girlies say I 'm pretty fly for a white guy . People started even copying Guy Cohens style . Jesus ... <p> I think all this was even funnier here in Finland because out of 5 million we have like 10 000 black people here and there are no ghettos here and still these white boys wanted to be so bad ass gansta rappers . I really love Offspring for doing this joke because I hate those guys . Luckily the trend is not so big anymore here . Maybe they got the joke after a while and started crying and bought some decent clothes : p <p> Original Prankster on the other hand is one of the shittiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip it on the CD but Offspring has made so much better music that compared to that it sounds shitty . But if you compare it to other music in radio etc. today even OP is brilliant . The song is pretty dull , poppy and it has Redman that we could have lived without . It is n't even catchy like Why Do n't You Get A Job was . <p> Hit That is n't one of my favorites but I still like it a lot . It always brings personal memories the subject is cool and the song just flows right . <p> Well that was my two cents . <p> barangatang <p> 07-25-2005 , 11:18 PM <p> man they just wan na make music ! ! ! thyere fucking musicians for shits sake ! ! ! if i wrote a songd 1/23 as good as a offspring song i would be hella happy . 41118 @qwx451118 <p> 07-26-2005 , 02:02 AM <p> I met Offspring with Pretty Fly , I decided to buy the album because of Pretty Fly .

And that 's great <p> L <p> MotaBoy <p> 07-26-2005 , 02:21 AM <p> I 'm not as big a fan of latest stuff against the old stuff simply because the music does n't appeal to me as much , still good but not as good in my opinion . To not like a song/band because someone else classes it as something you look down on is close minded and fucking stupid . <p> platinumpt <p> 07-26-2005 , 02:21 AM <p> Yeah , but The Offspring are a band that just does n't fit in the mainstream scenario . <p> There are a few bands that if you ask people about them and they 'll tell you about 10 songs they know from them . But The Offspring just does n't fit there , sometimes I ask guys who are in their 30s about the band , and they tell me something like " never heard of them " , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show them a song or two , they recognize them , and say " yeah , I remember this " , but still with a strange expression in their faces , like disappointment , or something . <p> Pretty fly was good for them , I already was a fan of The Offspring a few years before and after all these years I still remain a good fan . But they concentrated too much attention , and many people were expecting what would come after americana ... and even for me , Original Prankster was a little disappointing ... the song does n't make any sense , I think , it does n't criticize anything , like pretty fly did , and does n't have a catchy melody , like pretty fly or why do n't you get a job had ... it was just something intermediate , therefore it was a failure ... but I like it anyway , generally the fans like the stuff the band produces , ' cause we are the ones who really understand them ...

Pee on me all you like , it really wo n't do much for me long as it 's not all weird and smelly , but if you love it everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This thread is finally reaching it 's unavoidable destination . <p> I have a sneaking suspicion a girl I am sleeping with wants to pee on me and is too embarrassed to tell me . <p> What ...

Wish I 'd known that 5 or 6 years ago . <p> : D I think I figured it out a few years ago . It was a worthwhile discussion that stuck in my head and eventually made my hard-headed self realize my argument was n't too strong . It 's a very small thing , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think helped me ( as well as other things ) to become less of a weirdo and idiot ; ) Peeing in the shower was just one of the steps ... <p> I think people generally overreact to urine far too much . It 's not going to hurt you . Yes , it 's generally gross , but it 's not dangerous . You do n't need to be concerned about your safety . If someone took a big shit all over the shower then yeah , probably go ahead and bleach that badboy . But urine ? Piss off . Good one ; ) Totally right , though . It 's gross , but it 's not like someone is advocating golden showers or drinking it . It 's just going down the drain with the rest of your bodily scum . <p> Duskygrin <p> 05-28-2013 , 11:21 AM <p> Healthy urine is good for your skin . That 's because of urea which I 'm told is contained in a handful of skincare products ( most notably foot creams ) . <p> Llamas <p> 05-28-2013 , 11:35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's because of urea which I 'm told is contained in a handful of skincare products ( most notably foot creams ) . <p> As long as it does n't pass through the genitals , it 's actually really healthy stuff .

It 's pretty gross upon exiting the body , though . <p> T-6005 <p> 05-28-2013 , 01:55 PM <p> What ...

I sort of hope no sneaking suspicions grow from this wondering . I 'm not sure this knowledge would be beneficial . People are into some pretty strange things - but I think the fact that it 's treated as a ' secret ' fetish makes it weirder than it should be . Being open and up-front about these things really allows for a different vibe about the whole thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am honestly not into that . " If it does n't work for you , it does n't work for you , but that does n't make whatever you 're talking about the worst thing in the universe . <p> And to be entirely fair , I do n't know for sure . But discussions have been pretty wide-ranging so I 'll figure out the weird thing soon enough . Just judging from the surrounding subject matter and such , this is the conclusion I am going with . I love finding out the things that people are into - particularly friends . It just makes everything so much stranger . <p> As long as I do n't have to enthusiastically call someone by a family honorific . Because . Fuck . That . Shit . <p> WebDudette <p> 05-28-2013 , 07:13 PM <p> I have somewhat of a pee thing , some of it 's cool , some of it 's definitely not my thing .

I do n't know if actually explaining my pee thing would make it more or less strange . I have before in a thread bighead made about fetishes though , I think . <p> I 'd wager that fetishes and quirks are way more common than it seems , just that no one ever talks about it , because no one ever talks about it . I 'm not talking about masturbating exclusively to foot job videos or anything , but like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting or whatever every now and then . <p> But what do I know , maybe this is all wishful thinking because I like watching women pee . <p> What actually constitutes a fetish ? How would you guys define it ? I 've got a thing for pubic hair and female ejaculation , but I would n't call either of them fetishes . <p> There are some seriously bizarre fetishes out there . There is a subreddit where people challenge other people to cum on things and post pictures , it was pretty active . I also stumbled on a fetish for girls in those mesh body suits , but then with regular clothes on top , which is ... strange . Still , I do n't think twice about most things , no harm no foul . <p> Man , I spend too much time looking at porn . <p> " Melyssa K " Kennedy <p> 05-28-2013 , 10:31 PM <p> Does anyone think that women sit down to pee in public bathrooms ? <p> WebDudette <p> 05-28-2013 , 10:48 PM <p> I sit all over public toilets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no visible piss or shit , it 's whatever .

Deep down he knows its wrong , and he does n't necessarily like it " I shut my eyes , it hammers in my head " So he has some inner-anguish that he hates how he s over there killing people , however its also been pounded into his head that there is no other way , that is the right way , and he needs to do it .

It 's sure they kill people but it 's not only what they do . <p> Also Noodles said it was a " guy " in the song , if it were a soldier , he would have precised it , imo , because it 's not a minor detail . <p> When you talk about Dexter basing his song on a real event whom happened overseas , which " sea " do you mean ? Well I 'm not sure if I making sense in my previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical of America , as far as I know . I 've never heard about school shootings in other countries , apart from terrorists , but they act on religious purposes so it 's not like in america whither school shooters act under the influence of drugs or alcohol or simply &amp; generally because they 're mad . <p> But as you said , hell yeah , Hammerhead rocks ! ! ! <p> The fridge 's door theory deserves more interest that you guys can imagine . I 'm sure Dexter once woke up at night and went to the fridge but found nothing to eat . And Hammerhead was then created . <p> point taken , the school shooting to me just does n't make any sense with the lyrics though . " I am the one , camo and guns , risk my life to keep my people from harm " " I sacrifice with my brothers in arms " " Locked and loaded , voices screaming let 's go .... here we go " " stay the coarse , risen up a force , i believe i serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are crushed , nothing left were a man once stood " " but i 'm just doing what i 'm told " " and then , a biblical passage , which was referenced in times of danger , if you 're the shooter and a school shooting , why would you think that ? Just my two sense , it does n't seem like a singular person on a mission . But i guess we 'll have to wait til ' Mr. Holland reveals it . <p> rlplaymaker <p> 05-13-2008 , 11:03 AM <p> Hammerhead is all about school shootings <p> LONG ... <p> oh , well I 'll be damned <p> Jesus <p> 05-13-2008 , 11:23 AM <p> Hammerhead is all about school shootings <p> LONG ... <p> Pfff , you and your facts . <p> Rave21 <p> 05-13-2008 , 02:38 PM <p> I was also thinking school shooting , but now i 'm just confused ......... i wonder what 's on the other side of my fridge door <p> Windextor <p> 05-13-2008 , 03:16 PM <p> To me the song seems like its about a soldier trying to justify his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> edit : Oh shit i am wrong , haha <p> 2L8IW1N <p> 05-13-2008 , 04:12 PM <p> Actually since this is pretty much a " 2 part song " , I believe both halves have different meanings , but are connected . And the ' confusion ' part is both halves kind of have lyrics about the character the other half is speaking about . <p> confusing I know , but read : <p> The first half is about a soldier , who is going to war , thinking he " serves a greater good " . Such as an American going to another country and say you 're supposed to be living like us , we are perfect , so I 'm going to kill your government so you can re-form and be like us ... <p> The second half shows what that soldier is defending ... We have our own crazy people in our own nation that are terrorists . These kids that go into schools so mad at the the " world " , so dissatisfied with their own lives , that they go through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this though , " through the doorway , what 's on the other side . Never knowing exactly what I 'll find , voices screaming let 's go - come on do it here we go " . Meaning these kids go into classrooms guns blazing not even knowing who they 're shooting or why . <p> The best part of the song : <p> " Yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil : for thou art with me " Actually a biblical reference here . The Bible teaches to not be afraid of the ones who can only destroy your body . It is only God that can destroy your soul . <p> But then the confused student shooter takes over again - " Locked and loaded , gon na find my truth " - Kids that do this are confused about their life , they do n't know who they are or what they want . they are pretty empty inside . " Now I 'm busting through , all hell breaks loose " - They 're going through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students hiding under their desks screaming " teacher come help me " . This however COULD also be another biblical reference , as Jesus was a ' teacher ' to so many . <p> Of course Dexter is the only one who knows the true meaning behind his lyrics .

Unless of course they assume that there 's an even number of each color ( 250 and 150 as opposed to 249 and 151 ) in which case if they all follow that logic it would only take one party for all the red hats to figure it out . <p> They 're really not ' highly intelligent ' though if they do n't know what color hat they 're wearing . <p> nieh <p> 01-06-2006 , 11:02 AM <p> There 's no reason why the 250th party would bring anything new to their attention .

Wrong . Judas Priest ( and Iron Maiden ) are both New Wave of British Heavy Metal . NWOBHM . <p> NWoBHM : Acronym for " New Wave of British Heavy Metal " . After the initial success of British bands like BLACK SABBATH and DEEP PURPLE in the Mid-Seventies , Metal celebrated a strong comeback in the early Eighties ( and Great Britain ) , propelled by bands like IRON MAIDEN , JUDAS PRIEST and SAXON , to name but a few , creating a very ( nowadays called ) traditional style with distinct riffing and rhythms . The NWoBHM soon also splashed over the borders of Great Britain and thus created an almost world wide resurgence of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal , maybe being the initial jump start for the whole genre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , they 're that prog . <p> Jebus , get a dog . <p> edit : wait , they 're american .

Y'know , just as symbols ? <p> There is a general agreement among Western historians that the Armenian Genocide did happen . The International Association of Genocide Scholars ( the major body of scholars who study genocide in North America and Europe ) , for instance , formally recognize the event and consider it to be undeniable . Some consider denial to be a form of hate speech or/and historical revisionism . <p> Although there has been much academic recognition of the Armenian Genocide , this has not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the United States , the United Kingdom , Israel , Ukraine , and Georgia , do not officially use the word genocide to describe these events . <p> Although there is no federal recognition of the Armenian Genocide , 39 of the 50 U.S. states recognize the events of 1915 to 1917 as genocide . <p> In recent years , parliaments of a number of countries where Armenian diaspora has a strong presence have officially recognized the event as genocide . Two recent examples are France and Switzerland . Turkish entry talks with the European Union were met with a number of calls to consider the event as genocide , though it never became a precondition . <p> What I personally love is that the Holocaust deniers ( the big Holocaust , not the Armenian one ) , while partisan , radical and usually outright insane ; actually have a feeble leg to stand on . The evidence of the Holocaust has left them with enough blank spots and wiggle room , and it 's indeed possible the Holocaust did n't happen . It 's insanely unlikely , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things about it that just do n't add up , and all the offered explanations sound extremely weak , although they 're probably true . So if your personal beliefs and politics really really really really really really really want the Holocaust to be a hoax , you sorta have the slightest grounding of reality to found your views on . As unlikely as it is , it 's possible that somehow it was all exaggerated and faked . <p> Armenien Genocide deniers , on the other hand , have nothing to back their beliefs up . The facts are absolutely undeniable , the genocide happened . There 's no wiggle room , no ' what ifs ' , no black spots , absolutely nothing that does n't add up . The only reason they deny the genocide is because their government will lock them up if they admit it happened , which is hilarious . <p> SkunkIt <p> 10-09-2006 , 03:05 PM <p> are you stupid ... <p> armenian genocide is a big lie .. <p> Fuck you , my great , great , etc. grandma had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halocaust . <p> You guys killed so many of us from both sides ( Armenian and Assyrian ) , that some people are marrying into their families ( lolz ) to keep the tribes alive and I have about 100 cousins , most of which I 've never met . <p> SkunkIt <p> 10-09-2006 , 03:14 PM <p> You 're Greek ? <p> SkunkIt <p> 10-09-2006 , 03:30 PM <p> Oh , ok .

NATO took in the slavic countries to make sure they would n't turn into the retards they were and end up in communism again ... <p> and we can do a whole lot against slavs ... did u not learn anything from the Cold War ? fucker. we left ur whole slavic race impoverished , ruined and exhausted . <p> and the only reason we lost in vietnam was because , for the first time ( and the last ) in American history we have fought an unrighteous war where those stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . so we went there to prevent communism and to save the french 's asses cuz they could n't manage their own colony . and how could they call it a victory when they have had about 1,5 million military deaths + 4 million civillian deaths while we had only 60k deaths ? that 's a pretty fucked up victory if u ask me . <p> and see this ; if you had even bothered to look at the major victories in slavic nation 's history , you would see that they were all phyrric victories , and defeats were always ultimately decisive . <p> oh how can anyone forget the battle of maritsa when 70,000 of your " mighty " slav race AND a bunch of other low races were totaly slain by 10,000 turks ? <p> and by the look of your profile u are a gothic-emo kid ... so go cut your arms or smthing and do n't  attemt to talk in topics you do n't  know of . <p> Calengurth <p> 10-27-2006 , 12:47 PM <p> Did n't you previously imply that Russians were not Slavs ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little retards . <p> in all of the researches that were done on th topic , the Turkish government and the Turkish Armed Forces have opened their archives fully to every single researcher that has asked permission . <p> however , the armenian government has only allowed a few foreign researchers into their government archives . <p> if u ask me , there is something that the armenians are trying to hide from those who they do not trust ? <p> and my friend is in turkey now because he works at Izmir NATO base , and he said he spoke to some armenian-turks in Izmir , and he said many of them say that if that was real , then them being where they are should not be possible . <p> oh and we helped all the former warsaw pact countries at the fall of USSR . <p> Calengurth <p> 10-27-2006 , 02:04 PM <p> i 'm pretty sure had the US not helped you guys , you would be under russian rule again by now . <p> H1TThat <p> 10-27-2006 , 02:55 PM <p> i 'm pretty sure had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ russian rule again by now . <p> Hmmm ..... People may respect this comment had you guys won Vietnam . But no . Or maybe even if you guys were on top of the Iraq situation , but ... no . <p> Sin Studly <p> 10-27-2006 , 03:02 PM <p> lmao ... NATO took in the slavic countries to make sure they would n't turn into the retards they were and end up in communism again ... <p> Which Slavic countries are we talking about here ? Before we continue , I think you should let us know which countries are Slavic in your fucked-up imagination , since the Russians do n't seem to be slavs . <p> and we can do a whole lot against slavs ... did u not learn anything from the Cold War ? fucker. we left ur whole slavic race impoverished , ruined and exhausted . <p> They were impoverished , ruined and exhausted before your country existed , and they still managed to win WW2 for you and go neck-to-neck for 50 years , even beat you at the space race . <p> and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time ( and the last ) in American history we have fought an unrighteous war where those stupid asians tried to get away from french rule by communism . so we went there to prevent communism and to save the french 's asses cuz they could n't manage their own colony . <p> You lost in Vietnam because you were pussies . Half the number of slavs could have won it , because they would n't be bombing politically approved targets and acting like pussies , they 'd be taking names and cutting off heads . And they 'd have won . <p> and how could they call it a victory when they have had about 1,5 million military deaths + 4 million civillian deaths while we had only 60k deaths ? that 's a pretty fucked up victory if u ask me . <p> Because Saigon fell and the American Army ran away . The same reason the Germans lost WW2 when the Russians landed in Berlin , despite being able to say " Oh well , we killed more of them than they killed us " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the major victories in slavic nation 's history , you would see that they were all phyrric victories , and defeats were always ultimately decisive . <p> You 've got it the wrong way around , I 'm afraid . Victories against Russia were always phyrric . Even when you win a battle against Russia , you 're losing . Napoleon learned that at Borodino when the Russians served him up to Wellington on a platter . <p> oh how can anyone forget the battle of maritsa when 70,000 of your " mighty " slav race AND a bunch of other low races were totaly slain by 10,000 turks ? <p> Yes , it 's terrible . Of course , the low races had sticks and stones and the Turks had elite jannisarries , which makes their defeat to Dracula 's army of 30,000 women and children with pitchforks much worse . <p> and by the look of your profile u are a gothic-emo kid ... so go cut your arms or smthing and do n't  attemt to talk in topics you do n't  know of . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studly <p> 10-27-2006 , 03:24 PM <p> Whatever , it 's all Greek to me . <p> Sin Studly <p> 10-27-2006 , 03:50 PM <p> I know how to pronounce it , just not to spell it . <p> Anyways , enough talk , have a video . <p> Do n't play with the Serbs .

@@44115816 @4115816/ <p> I heard this story but I 'm pretty sure it was Noodles and he had good reasons : he was with family . If I would have been at his place maybe I would have done the same . Anyway , I think it 's stupid , if you do n't know him or at least met him you can not say that he 's a jerk or not . <p> That 's weird , because I ca n't seem to get over how much they really " DO " care about their fans . Dexter is n't a jerk , they care about us a lot . But they have lives to . And that was Noodles who said no in Disney land ... and he did give very good reasons , just think about what you would do in that position .

Do YOU want to work when you 're trying to spend time with your family ? Remember that being a rock star is Dexter 's JOB , and rock stars have much longer hours than most jobs . After all that , when he 's trying to take a vacation , I think the last thing he wants is to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ? He might not give autographs , but I 'm sure he does n't mind talking to fans , so long as they do n't try to monopolize his time . <p> Plus , you have to think about the kid . He 's probably trying to raise the kid as normally as possible , which is n't exactly easy given his status . If the kid saw his dad signing autographs all day , it might give him a warped view of reality ( Or her , I do n't know much about Dexter 's family ) . Have you seen how prissy other kids with famous parents turn out ? Dex probably does n't want that for his kid . <p> killboybowerhead <p> 11-08-2004 , 08:08 PM <p> Regardless i cant see why you 'd think they are douches when they are obviously rich and havent blown it on coke and they still go out there and do their best to deliver the music we all love and tour the world so all of us can get the chance to see them ... They do n't  need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fans and their enjoyment of being around us ... I think when you spend the majority of the year on the road you sometimes need family time that 's why that kid got stiffed . Also are n't  they the ones that put their album on the internet and gave out 1 million dollars hmmm that 's sounds selfish <p> Amelia <p> 11-08-2004 , 08:11 PM <p> I have met Dexter many times over the years and he is one of the nicest " rock stars " I have ever met . He is a really great guy and he cares about the fans . mikez911 will back me up on this . I think that even famous people need a chance to live normal lives and if he was at Disney and did n't want to sign autographs then that is his right . When he is off the stage and having family time then he is simply " dad " or Bryan . I think that people need to respect that . I do not believe for one minute that he does n't care about the fans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does . They all do . <p> B.B Joker <p> 11-08-2004 , 08:14 PM <p> A LOT of stars wo n't sign autographs when they 're with their families . Do YOU want to work when you 're trying to spend time with your family ? Remember that being a rock star is Dexter 's JOB , and rock stars have much longer hours than most jobs . After all that , when he 's trying to take a vacation , I think the last thing he wants is to have to sign more autographs . Is n't meeting him randomly good enough ? He might not give autographs , but I 'm sure he does n't mind talking to fans , so long as they do n't try to monopolize his time . <p> Plus , you have to think about the kid . He 's probably trying to raise the kid as normally as possible , which is n't exactly easy given his status . If the kid saw his dad signing autographs all day , it might give him a warped view of reality ( Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ) . Have you seen how prissy other kids with famous parents turn out ? Dex probably does n't want that for his kid . <p> Dude , i 'm a musician myself , and i have to say that you 're pretty much wrong with the whole " JOB " thing , it 's not just ANY job , it 's his fuckin life , it 's who he is , and it 's who he will be remembered by , and his fans are part of his life , forever and always . No doubt about it . So what i 'm trying to say is that it WAS wrong for Dexter , or Noodles , or whatever Offspring member it was to say NO to the kid trying to get his autograph , an autograph takes only like 10 seconds to do . If he ca n't take 10 seconds out of his Social life for his fans he 's fuckin up . I hate to say it cuz Offspring is my fav . band of all time . <p> thank you for reading this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kind of dumb asking for an autograph , i usually shy away from a celeb or someone like that when i see them because i do n't  want to invade them , but if it were the offspring i 'd have to go up to them , because i 'd have to ha , but i would n't ask for an autograph , kind of tacky i guess , i 'd jsut want to talk about music and their music and all that , but if they are with the family i would n't expect them to pay any attention to me , nor would i go up to them , if anything ill just scream out dexter rocks or offspring rock or some shit like that , but watever i think they care about their fans , they did give a million dollars away you know . <p> Sketch <p> 11-08-2004 , 08:51 PM <p> you smell like poo ... <p> Faye <p> 11-08-2004 , 09:23 PM <p> First of all we ca n't judge people we do n't know and we do n't even know it this really happened ' cause lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If that really happened with Dexter or Noodles , I ca n't say they were right or wrong cause , again , I du n no under which circomstances this really took place . I think that once you 're as famous as they are , and you have as many fans as they do , you can not totally separate personal life from the fans , cause you 'll bump into a few of them occasionally . Even being with the family , I think they should sing autographs and all , if the fan is being polite and all himself . Beu I do n't really know what I would do in his shoes , so it 's kinda hard to judge . <p> neocon58 <p> 11-08-2004 , 09:24 PM <p> That 's weird , because I ca n't seem to get over how much they really " DO " care about their fans . Dexter is n't a jerk , they care about us a lot . But they have lives to . And that was Noodles who said no in Disney land ... and he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do in that position . They are great guys and are only human . <p> mandy <p> yep . it was noodles that said no. and it was because he was with his daughter . in an old noodles journal entry he said something like : " when i spend time with my daughter , i 'm not part of the band . we go places for her , not me " or something along those lines . he also apologiesd to the dude that asked him <p> Sketch <p> 11-08-2004 , 09:37 PM <p> you know who i think is a jerk is that mean old simon cowell from american idol . I mean the guy just tears those poor singers apart . i 'd like to see him get up and sing in front of millions of people . it just hurts me to see those young hopeful youths have there dreams smashed . i really thing william hung could be the next michael jackson ... <p> offspringbaby2004 <p> 11-08-2004 , 09:51 PM <p> yep . it was noodles that said no. and it was because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said something like : " when i spend time with my daughter , i 'm not part of the band . we go places for her , not me " or something along those lines . he also apologiesd to the dude that asked him <p> oh yea , it was from the journal . I could n't remember where I had read that . And yes he did apologize , he went out of his way to tell the guy why he would n't give him an autograph and apologized . I think that is very caring : ) What more do you want ? ? ? : p <p> mandy <p> psimate <p> 11-08-2004 , 10:11 PM <p> i met with the guys in this year ( in March ) and they are very nice , but an autograph .... 10 seconds maybe but i can understand Noodles too , and he apologized ... i think Nood is very nice , i talked to him so i can say that , so i cant decide that it was wrong or right .... : cool : <p> thommo17 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little brat when i 'm buying their cd 's buying their clothes dvd 's ec , fuck me get it right you dickhead <p> wilsonkck <p> 11-09-2004 , 12:51 AM <p> They are n't jerks GOD <p> They released conspiracy of one online THEM not havker nerds THEM They also entered people into a draw 4 a million bucks when they downloaded a song , now what jerk gives u something free then gives you more for not buying his cd . <p> Also Dex took a fan in his plane to a gig if i remember correctly . Plus they hand out beer during der concerts <p> And everyones rude at some time just cos der famous does n't  make them perfect . <p> I could say more but there is evidence of their dedication to fans so because some little kid got turned down for one goddamn autograph is n't the end of the world . <p> I do wish theyed update the website more though and there was more music video downloads but oh well <p> You 're sounding as reliable as 60 minutes right now . Went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why the hell would Dexter be at Disney Land/World/whatever the hell you 're talking about ? What an extraordinary stroke of good luck this " kid " had ! <p> Do n't go bad-mouthing people you know nothing about . You need to get out more . <p> well , if you went to disneyland , probably with your family , would n't you just like to spend time with them ? my friend ran into noodles at an angel game , they talked , but she did n't  ask for an autograph because he was with his daughter . like anything else , there 's a time and place for stuff like that . 41127 @qwx451127 <p> 11-09-2004 , 06:37 AM <p> i found this random website : anecdotage.com , and randomly found this : <p> Offspring frontman Dexter Holland and guitarist Kevin " Noodles " Wasserman were once given $848 by Blender magazine and instructed to spend it on some worthty project . After some discussion , they elected to make a beer bong . Total cost : $12 . The boys were asked what they planned to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to drive into L.A. and see Metal Shop at the Viper Room , " Holland explained . " Then , " Noodles added . " We 're going to bail someone out of jail . " Who ? " Whoever they 've got ! " <p> The band indeed later dropped by the local jail in the wee hours to plead for the release of a homeless man named " Dave . " When the prison had no record of a " Dave , " Noodles took over : " How about a ' Mark ' ? What do you have in the way of Marks ? Come on , you must have seen somebody who does n't deserve to be here ! " ( They eventually gave $400 to another homeless man named Harold . ) LONG ... ******* <p> would a jerk do that ? <p> Obie2trice <p> 11-09-2004 , 06:47 AM <p> haha good reading , thanx <p> emmylou <p> 11-09-2004 , 07:08 AM <p> i met dexter nad he was super nice to me and , y friends and took time to talk to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard one story to .

Secondly , please provide proof for your claim . <p> BaneOfEvil3 <p> 11-09-2004 , 01:00 PM <p> I 've got a question : <p> Why do you all care so much ? <p> Seriously ... Is n't it enough that they make fucking awesome music for you ? Do you really need to know everything about them ? Seriously ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name being Bryan .... Why would you even CARE about that ? ! <p> So what if Dexter was a total asshole ( Which he 's not , I 'm guessing ... ) ? At least he helps make this music for you to listen to .

@@44115826 @4115826/ <p> Everyone has some kind of fascination that strikes others as odd . I always like to hear about these , and I always like to tell people about mine . Usually I find that people have pretty good reasons for their interests , no matter how weird they may initially seem . Like when I just tell people one of mine , like for instance , Suriname , they do n't get it at all . Then after I explain all my reasons why I think Suriname is awesome and fascinating , they understand , and even appreciate it , but still not nearly enough to share the fascination at the same level . Which is exactly the effect I would hope for . They understand my passion , but it 's still , like , MINE . It 's still a weird , special , odd little passion that feels like part of who I am . <p> I have a friend who excitedly jumped at an opportunity to work at the city dump . He 's a smart kid who could have easily gotten a better-paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me why trash fascinates him . And after hearing him get all excited and passionate in his explanation , it had the same effect on me . I sort of understood it . <p> My latest one is cephalopods . Squids and octopuses are popular species on the discovery channel and stuff , and people think they 're scary/gross/cool , but my interest in them goes a bit deeper . Basically I like them because I see them as humans ' most likely successors for the dominant animal species on Earth . Meaning in millions of years , I think it 's plausible that all humans can be dead and the world will be run by descendants of squids with capabilities of space travel . <p> I actually have a few reasons for this . First is their intelligence . Studies have shown that cephalopods are by far the most intelligent class of invertebrates , but what 's more remarkable is that the intelligence is the result of an entirely different nervous system than that which gave rise to human intelligence today . In fact , it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problem-solving intelligence has ever evolved outside of mammals and birds . Second is their excellence at niche partitioning . We 've all heard how nobody ever saw a live giant squid until 2004 . I do n't think that 's an accident . As the most intelligent and largest animals occupying their niche in the deep sea , they 've already built up a dominant role for themselves with no natural competition , which has included steering clear of the Earth 's most dangerous species , Homo sapiens . Basically they 're one of the most left-alone species in the world , allowed to go about their evolution peacefully , and it 's paid off for them in ways we may never know- because we do n't know how many there are . It just blows my mind to think how the amazingly complex cerebral physiology we see in the animals we consider " intelligent " has evolved TWICE . Cephalopod intelligence is an up-and-coming study that has still been insufficiently researched ( opportunities for me , mayhap ? ) , but it 's generally agreed upon that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debunk the historicist view of evolution , and could really serve as a tool to tie up some loose ends in newer structuralist views . <p> So , does anybody else have any weird fascinations to share ? <p> Endymion <p> 09-03-2007 , 02:51 PM <p> i 've always wanted to learn how to dislocate my jaw like a snake so that i could fit large things ( ie a baby 's head ) in my mouth . <p> i 'm aware that that 's not what you meant . <p> i guess the weirdest fascination i have is i love watching families fight . not the mother vs father sort of couple fighting , but the stuff involving kids . it 's so fun watching what sort of bullshit reasoning parents will pull out of their ass to try to con kids into believing something . or when kids get way too pissed and start crying or otherwise throwing a tantrum , watch which parent caves first . 41152 @qwx451152 <p> 09-03-2007 , 04:26 PM <p> I have no idea if this is at the same level as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions . <p> For instance , if I 'm watching tv with someone and it 's a comedy , and a joke is made , I immediately turn to the person I 'm watching tv with and watch their facial expression change ( or not change ) with the sudden stimulus .

It 's very nice to have an arc laid out for myself , especially after finishing up college only to realize that I 've never really had a goal in life , just a series of tasks .

The industry standard . Good sticks , without a doubt , but if you are breaking them that often , I 'd suggest looking into the Promark Japan oak series . Those sticks freaking last forever , especially if you do n't rim shot on the snare . They are a bit heavier than standard sticks of the same size , so I 'd suggest just getting slightly smaller sticks in oak . <p> I personally LOVE heavier sticks ( might be a result of all the corps-style stuff I do ? ) because of the feel , the control I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my drums . <p> It 's not always the whole stick that breaks , most of the time its just the top of the stick that splits in half:D <p> Thomas <p> 06-10-2008 , 09:51 AM <p> Ah , I see .

I really really like it , if I could just find a good place to put it . <p> I usually use Pro-Mark 5B Jap-Oak sticks . But I usually start out with 2B sticks and move down the line . If I 'm really having fun I might go all the way down to 5A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And i 'd play more with 7A , but I find that I break them way too easily if with the Jap-oak ones , so I do n't buy them much anymore . I most use Nyon tips on my sticks , however , with the larger sticks and speciality sticks I use natural wood tips . When i 'm just having fun I use a wide range of sticks : 747 New Generation Rock sticks for fast beats and punk . Zildjian Rock sticks for metal . And a left hand 2B/right hand 747 for expermintal , rock , punk and jazz . I also use a 7A left hand/ Zildjian Rock combo for fast snare and heavy cymbal hitting expermintial/pause beats as well as I guess tribal beats . <p> Which brings up something , what sticking combonations do you drummers use and for what ? And how wide is the range of sticking sizes that you use ? <p> Andy <p> 06-25-2008 , 09:30 AM <p> adom : I use mainly Vic Firth American Classic 5B ( wood tip ) sticks now .

To this day , I do n't understand how I managed to pull that one off . <p> I 'm so sad . I have to go without my RG for a week ( i finally got around to getting that Super Distortion installed ) , and my other two *working* electrics do n't compare at all . My GRG does n't stay in tune , and my Telecaster needs to have it 's truss rod/intonation adjusted ( major fret buzz ) . My Srat lookalike is under reconstruction , you could say ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only kept the body ) . But I still have my Epiphone Acoustic &lt;3 <p> I would n't go quite that far , I 'm sure they could n't handle too much of a beating . Their made for jazz , not metal . I have n't had the chance to hear a pair of K hi-hats before , but I asume , from the other cymbals on that line and the Dark K line , that they 'd be fantastic . <p> Have you heard the K Hybrids yet ? Unlaved , Z like bell area , and the rest is laved and hammered K style . I 've also had the rare chance to play a raw K , unpolished , unlaved and hammered in the K fashion . <p> If you 're into Jazz check out the Legecy Collection . Personally I hate them , I 'd never buy one , a waste of time and money . But of corase I do n't play Jazz . <p> Thomas <p> 07-05-2008 , 12:58 AM <p> Oh , my hats have handled many beating by drummers with horrendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the chance , try out a full set of them . And the bell is K Custom , not Z Custom . ; ) <p> And I 've never heard of the legacy collection , which is weird because I 'm usually REALLY on top of this sort of thing . They are n't Zildjian releases , are they ? They do sound interesting to me because I am a jazz drummer and I 'd like to try out some jazz cymbals . <p> Speaking of jazz cymbals , I have a Zildjian &amp; C.i.e . Vintage ride that is unbelievable . That series was made to mimic the old time cymbals from the 20 's and 30 's and holy cow , those things have color like you would n't imagine . I 've used that thing with a big band before and I 'll tell ya , it made the entire ensemble sound better and classier somehow . 41161 @qwx451161 <p> 07-05-2008 , 09:11 AM <p> Nej , asss jag orkar inte fixa en bild nu . 41135 @qwx451135 <p> 07-05-2008 , 01:54 PM <p> I knewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm not completly sure , but I think the Legecy line is from Sabian . <p> Thomas <p> 07-05-2008 , 05:26 PM <p> hmmmm ... must be something new ? Let 's hope it makes up for those godawful APX cymbals . <p> btw , have you heard of the new Zildjian Pitch Black cymbals ? Look like pieces of crap to me and all the reviews I 've heard have been very negative . Apparently Travis Barker is going to be playing with them , so they are sure to sell like hot cakes , which is really really sad . 41135 @qwx451135 <p> 07-06-2008 , 06:18 PM <p> No , I 'll have to look into them . <p> GBH2 <p> 07-15-2008 , 08:31 PM <p> my freakin sweet new axe LONG ... i like to think of it as my mini white falcon <p> So yes , I have finally taken pictures of my guitars , and I hope to upload them sometime later .

In my previous post I showed the guitar I had and mentioned a drum set I wanted to get . I also showed another guitar I wanted to get but I lost interest in getting it . <p> So here 's what I have now . <p> Here 's the drum set , I got it probably a little bit after my old post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibanez RG 2EX2 , a Fender American Standard Strat , and an Ibanez AEL20E Acoustic-Electric guitar . <p> A long time ago I was n't even interested in strats and thought I 'd never get one , but that was when I first started playing guitar and based it solely on looks . But I really like their sound and also like the way they look now . <p> Ryder1234 <p> 04-16-2012 , 01:05 PM <p> I 'm just about done a guitar I started making in 08 haha . Finally , I just painted it yesterday and i 'm working on the electronics now , still a bit of routing to do though . The electronics and neck are from and old Squier Tele that was n't that nice looking anymore , but the parts were good so I took it apart . I originally wanted to have the same electronics/hardware as a Les Paul , but I do n't really have the money and I already had the Tele parts . Eventually when I save up some cash I 'll either upgrade to some better Tele Pickups and electronics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want it finally done : P <p> I did n't use any pore filler on the wood and did n't prime it before painting , I wanted to see the wood grain through the paint cause it 's oak and has really nice grain patterns . I just did like a coat and a half of black and a single coat of clear , then polished it with rubbing compound and buffed it . It 's got some really good shine to it for how quick I did it , I 'm impressed haha . All those autobody courses I took seem to be working , the last few guitars I 've painted have turned out real well . <p> JANNY <p> 04-17-2012 , 06:21 AM <p> One tom is missing .

Pretty good for a quick paint job at least : ) <p> Here 's an album documenting the change from how it used to look to what it is now LONG ... <p> Ryder1234 <p> 11-29-2013 , 01:56 PM <p> My RG and Strat , both repainted by me . There 's a story on the RG in the post above this , as for the strat I really just wanted to paint another guitar after i did the RG , and that design kinda popped into my head so i went through with it . <p> This is my guitar . Nothing fancy , it 's a Starcaster I got like 8 or 9 years ago . LONG ... ( https : **26;1868;TOOLONG ) This is the sticker on the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that photo . LONG ... ( https : **26;1896;TOOLONG ) This is my bass . It 's a 6-string Sound Gear by Ibanez . LONG ... ( https : **26;1924;TOOLONG ) <p> Here 's my kit in the set up I 've been using lately . I have a few other cymbals , two other toms , and a couple other snare drums , but this is the way I like it . The shells are nothing to write home about , but I do think that I have managed to prove that good heads and good tuning can make even a lower end drum kit sound professional .

All people wanted to talk about was Green Day . I did n't  really think it was helping our career , and we did n't  really have much to say . " <p> Omg , did not know that . 41140 @qwx451140 <p> 10-11-2008 , 02:20 PM <p> It bugged us that the Offspring got big for about three or four months , " Mike remembers . " Not Green Day . But we had just taken the Offspring on tour , and they were so mediocre that we just thought it was weird . " <p> i know fat mike thinks the offspring suck live but nofx are one of the worst live bands ever i would love to see a interview with dexter saying something like ' ' when we were touring with nofx i used to wear earplugs during their set ' ' and see how fat mike reacts <p> RonWelty <p> 10-11-2008 , 02:26 PM <p> i know fat mike thinks the offspring suck live but nofx are one of the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dexter saying something like ' ' when we were touring with nofx i used to wear earplugs during their set ' ' and see how fat mike reacts <p> Its fun , because everyone says that , maybe , the big thing of the Offspring is that they give a terrific show live ... 41119 @qwx451119 <p> 10-11-2008 , 02:28 PM <p> meh ... whatever ... he was just jealous . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 10-11-2008 , 02:36 PM <p> It 's Fat Mike , he always says stuff like that , in fact , i 'd be more surprised if he complimented anyone . The bands have pretty good relationship with one another , let 's not try and turn this into some sort of feud . <p> Alex101 <p> 10-11-2008 , 02:52 PM <p> i know fat mike thinks the offspring suck live but nofx are one of the worst live bands ever i would love to see a interview with dexter saying something like ' ' when we were touring with nofx i used to wear earplugs during their set ' ' and see how fat mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i used to wear earplugs during their set and see how fat mike reacts " ? lol <p> Jaded skies <p> 10-11-2008 , 03:03 PM <p> I kinda agree with him . I mean he probably did n't  just pull this out of his ass . I would n't doubt dexter said that , and i really with they would have . NOFX is by no means a bad band . In fact they 're great . They just get smashed before shows too often and turn out to be that one band people just go see to see what kind of crap they 'll say or what they 'll do . Whicle the offspring still sound decent live , They 're interaction with fans sure has gone downhill .... 41122 @qwx451122 <p> 10-11-2008 , 03:25 PM <p> Yes I 'm sure the only reason that NOFX never got big like Green Day and the Offspring was because they did n't send in that one video to MTV . The fact that people wanted to talk to them only about Green Day in their interviews shows that NOFX just are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> EDIT : ... and this " explanation " of Mike 's about their history did n't help . 41140 @qwx451140 <p> 10-11-2008 , 03:36 PM <p> I kinda agree with him . I mean he probably did n't  just pull this out of his ass . I would n't doubt dexter said that , and i really with they would have . NOFX is by no means a bad band . In fact they 're great .

Whicle the offspring still sound decent live , They 're interaction with fans sure has gone downhill .... <p> i agree that the offsprings crowd interaction is not as good as it used to be but nofx are all crowd interaction i do n't know about anyone else but i go to concerts to hear music not 10 mins of talking <p> that being said i 'm not trying to make anyone mad just expressing my opinion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fat Mike is a dumbass . I always thought so . But NOFX is n't a terrible band . They 're just a simple , plain , punk band . It seems that they 're too afraid to admit that they sold out , too afraid to experiment and make more complex music . Plus , I hate political music . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 10-11-2008 , 04:50 PM <p> meh , Fat Mike is a dumbass . I always thought so . But NOFX is n't a terrible band . They 're just a simple , plain , punk band . It seems that they 're too afraid to admit that they sold out , too afraid to experiment and make more complex music . Plus , I hate political music . <p> Well , they did write The Decline , but this is getting off topic . <p> nameless <p> 10-11-2008 , 05:55 PM <p> if he was being serious about the offspring being not too good then i 'd probbaly say he was slightly jealous as they were kind in the same boat , independent label and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he saying that The Offspring/Smash is mediocre , but Green Day/Dookie is n't ? Now , Dookie is one of my favorite albums of all time , ( mainly due to its **25;1991;TOOLONG ratio , which is high on both sides ) , but the only real special thing they did there was the vocal harmonies . At least there are a lot of things on Smash I ca n't play . <p> EDIT : wa wa wa boobs <p> Autonomist <p> 10-11-2008 , 07:26 PM <p> The reason NOFX did n't get big has more to do with them being a shit band than anything else , and I promise this is n't bitterness over the jab at The Offspring . NOFX suck , always have and probably always will . 41122 @qwx451122 <p> 10-11-2008 , 07:50 PM <p> The reason NOFX did n't get big has more to do with them being a shit band than anything else , and I promise this is n't bitterness over the jab at The Offspring . NOFX suck , always have and probably always will . <p> Yeah and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , real fast . If you 're going to keep playing simplistic , unmelodic music at least use switch up the message once in a while . But I digress . His statement reeks of jealousy . On the one hand the fact that he mentions how the Offspring and NOFX toured together seems to point at a " why not me ? " mentality . On the other , he says that they chose relative obscurity . Mixed messages , Michael . Mixed messages . <p> JeromeFleur <p> 10-11-2008 , 09:51 PM <p> yeah , uhhhh maybe it 's a dumb question to ask , but my english is not perfect , and i do n't know nofx that much ... but when he 's talking like that about the offspring , he 's probably ironic , right ? it 's his type of humour , i guess ? <p> Budzy <p> 10-12-2008 , 02:40 AM <p> NOFX ? Wtf ? Does this band even exist ? If they do then they must suck so bad that I 've never heard of them . : D <p> Teach them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 03:27 AM <p> i have nothing against NOFX , but that 's just sour grapes coz the offspring are good and popular . <p> i mean if you choose not to send ur vids to mtv then you ca n't get jealous of those who become popular because they did . <p> medi01 <p> 10-12-2008 , 03:32 AM <p> NOFX ? Wtf ? Does this band even exist ? If they do then they must suck so bad that I 've never heard of them . : D <p> Teach them for calling the Offspring mediocre . <p> FAIL . NOFX are a popular punk band , just they 're on they 're own label and not that ' heard of ' . <p> Budzy <p> 10-12-2008 , 04:22 AM <p> FAIL . NOFX are a popular punk band , just they 're on they 're own label and not that ' heard of ' . <p> i know who they are . it was my attempt at a joke , because they took a stab at the offspring . <p> The Search Button <p> 10-12-2008 , 04:33 AM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobody really knows about . <p> As for the topic . Everyone is entitled to their dumb opinions . <p> ThunderPX <p> 10-12-2008 , 05:22 AM <p> Fat Mike admits he is an asshole , last I checked . <p> Also , Dookie is boring . <p> RonWelty <p> 10-12-2008 , 05:24 AM <p> Fat Mike admits he is an asshole , last I checked . <p> Also , Dookie is boring . <p> well said ! ! ! <p> dffpunk <p> 10-12-2008 , 06:44 AM <p> What is with all the hatred towards NOFX on these forums all of a sudden ? Has it always been here like that ? Err , I mean , to me , NOFX are like the second most favorite band ( after the Offspring ) ... confusing it is : confused : <p> And I do not think that NOFX and Offspring are the right example of " non-likingness " between bands . They are both just very sarcastic(imho) . People need to chill out . <p> Ninty Man <p> 10-12-2008 , 09:00 AM <p> Meh ... I really dislike NOFX , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band is a pain in the ass sometimes- even I like franco-unamerican or there 's no fun in fundamentalism- MMM ... but he said New America of Bad Religion sucks , and that 's fail in life <p> Rutegard <p> 10-12-2008 , 09:58 AM <p> meh ... whatever ... he was just jealous . <p> probably : p <p> Fat Mike admits he is an asshole , last I checked . <p> Also , Dookie is boring . <p> see ? that 's his humore then ... <p> findout5 <p> 10-12-2008 , 10:01 AM <p> The best career move he could make would be changing his name from Fat Mike to Fat Fuck . Apparently fast food is not only bad for your body , but also to the brain ( as shown by him in the interview ) ! NOFX are a boring band , that write about stupid stuff ( at least in the 80s and 90s ) ... My vagina has 2 sets of lips ... WTF ? ! ? ! Oh , and I 'm sure that when they made a video they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fat Mike , eat shit and die ! 41119 @qwx451119 <p> 10-12-2008 , 10:16 AM <p> hahaha ... I do n't really have anything against them . I do n't like them by any stretch of the imagination though either . I 've got " I heard they suck live " . Do n't care for it at all . <p> dffpunk <p> 10-12-2008 , 10:18 AM <p> The best career move he could make would be changing his name from Fat Mike to Fat Fuck . Apparently fast food is not only bad for your body , but also to the brain ( as shown by him in the interview ) ! NOFX are a boring band , that write about stupid stuff ( at least in the 80s and 90s ) ... My vagina has 2 sets of lips ... WTF ? ! ? ! Oh , and I 'm sure that when they made a video they did n't want airplay ... does that even make sense ? ? <p> Fat Mike , eat shit and die ! <p> You are funny . <p> randman21 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOFX ... somewhat . More than casual , but much less than diehard . I put Punk in Drublic up there with the really good albums of that year . Although the interview did n't bother me much at all ( it is all the way from 1994 ) , I have a thing about people saying stupid stuff just for the purpose of being controversial , especially when they do n't mean it ( if they are in fact on good terms with the Offspring ) . <p> Jesus <p> 10-12-2008 , 11:07 AM <p> Most of the replies here are kinda akward . Given that Fat Mike 's complaints in regard to an Offspring live show are the same as a shitload of people here have . That there setlists are usually the same for a tour and that the shows are sort of scripted ( same banter between Dexter and Noodles , or the same thing every show like a Basket Case part during the Smash Tour ) . He did n't understand that because they ( the offspring ) have such a huge back catalogue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting for The Offspring themselves . <p> And I 'm pretty sure Dexter and Noodles would disagree with the slashing of NOFX ( as do I ) . Given that they are close friends like each others music . Fat Mike has been on stage with them , just as Noodles has played with them too . <p> but he said New America of Bad Religion sucks , and that 's fail in life So did 99.99% of Bad Religion fans when that album came out . Their site was a blast back then .... <p> Jesus <p> 10-12-2008 , 11:33 AM <p> His statement reeks of jealousy . On the one hand the fact that he mentions how the Offspring and NOFX toured together seems to point at a " why not me ? " mentality . On the other , he says that they chose relative obscurity . Mixed messages , Michael . Mixed messages . <p> For what it 's worth the article RonWelty posted is from 2006 and it is just a bunch of things thrown together from previous interviews to create a timeline . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994-1995 I think and some other : <p> Mucomo : So what do you think about that . Two years ago Offspring was opening up for you guys . <p> Fat Mike : Oh I was so jealous for a couple months . Totally . We were bummed . I was so bummed . Cause we 're a better band - I think . But now , I 'm really happy for them . Honest . No shit . Because I understand it . And when I listen to Offspring next to what 's on the radio - next to Pearl Jam - they fucking blow Pearl Jam away . If you put the Offspring next to a lot of punk bands , they 're totally average . But if you put them in the big business music scene , they fucking smoke . And that 's how the music works . Some bands are great , and they 're big . And some bands are n't good , and they 're big . Nirvana was a band that was totally awesome , and they deserved everything , cause they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the punk of the old days or the punk of the new days ? <p> Fat Mike : I think the whole music industry , and punk bands , is the greatest it 's ever been . I 've never liked a lot of bands , and there are so many good bands coming out . You listen to the radio and you hear good songs , all the time . That 's totally new . <p> The crowds , they 're getting a little bigger because punk rock 's popular . I do n't care , whatever . I do n't really think about it . One of our best shows , last tour , was in Oslo in front of 200 people . But it was perfect , fucking prefect . We were laughing on stage all the time because funny shit kept happening . Like the Offspring - the one thing that really bugs me about them is they play the same exact thing every night . Same jokes - they do a little Weezer , a little Green Day . In between every song he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band . It makes you like a circus act , and you 're performing for these people . And I do n't feel that way when I 'm playing . I feel like I 'm just doing my songs . I 'm doing my thing . I might do the same jump every night , but I 'm not going to be performer for them . I 'm not a show . 41122 @qwx451122 <p> 10-12-2008 , 12:11 PM <p> Well this actually makes some more sense . He is kinda saying that while they 're not really a " punk " band , they 're better than most mainstream music . And that punk is better than mainstream music . So therefore NOFX is better than Offspring . ( Still , I think NOFX are boring . ) <p> But I agree with his assessment of their crowd interaction . How many times are they going to tell the audience how " fucking beautiful " they are ? 41140 @qwx451140 <p> 10-12-2008 , 12:18 PM <p> Most of the replies here are kinda akward . Given that Fat Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as a shitload of people here have . That there setlists are usually the same for a tour and that the shows are sort of scripted ( same banter between Dexter and Noodles , or the same thing every show like a Basket Case part during the Smash Tour ) . <p> i did not hear fat mike say that the offspring setlist are all all the same or the shows are scripted or he did not like them playing basket case i read him say they are mediocre <p> He did n't understand that because they ( the offspring ) have such a huge back catalogue of songs and he did n't understand how that could be interesting for The Offspring themselves <p> well they only had 3 albums then but i can see how they could have played more songs off the first 2 records 41119 @qwx451119 <p> 10-12-2008 , 12:18 PM <p> haha .. yeah ... they can be a little repetitive . Though when you think about it , it makes sense to be that way . They 've got a lot to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every show , then i 'd imagine it 'd get confusing really fast . I did get a good laugh at their encore bit at the show i went to . I know they do that often enough , but I 've never seen em do it , so it was funny as hell to me . <p> I 'm just waiting for a diehard creed fan to turn up here going off about the " even jesus hates creed " shirt that Dexter wore for a bunch of shows 10 years ago . Now that would be fun . <p> Rutegard <p> 10-12-2008 , 12:34 PM <p> I 'm just waiting for a diehard creed fan to turn up here going off about the " even jesus hates creed " shirt that Dexter wore for a bunch of shows 10 years ago .

It 's one of my things . Since I did n't grow up on rock , when I finally got into it , I did n't have the filter that would have gotten rid of stuff like Creed . <p> And thanks , Rutegard . You , too : ) 41119 @qwx451119 <p> 10-12-2008 , 08:16 PM <p> Haha , I know . It 's one of my things . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally got into it , I did n't have the filter that would have gotten rid of stuff like Creed . <p> And thanks , Rutegard . You , too : ) <p> hahaha ! yeah , such refined filters as mine take years of development . <p> RageAndLov <p> 10-13-2008 , 01:37 AM <p> Fat Mike : Oh I was so jealous for a couple months . Totally . We were bummed . I was so bummed . <p> This explains a lot why he talked so unfriendly about Offspring . But I agree with Mike . Offspring is mediocre . The shows are very similar with only a few changes if any at all . And very little interaction with the fans nowadays . Maybe the guys in Offspring are shy ? : p <p> But members of The Offspring are friends with at least Fat Mike . Noodles wrote this in one of his music journals : <p> " I 've also been talking with Fat Mike from NOFX lately about getting involved with a project he s been working on called Punk Voter www.punkvoter.com . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punk rock 's popular . I do n't care , whatever . I do n't really think about it . One of our best shows , last tour , was in Oslo in front of 200 people . But it was perfect , fucking prefect . We were laughing on stage all the time because funny shit kept happening . <p> Yeah , Norway is fucking awesome ! <p> JeromeFleur <p> 10-13-2008 , 03:42 AM <p> I 've just got one thing to say to Fat Mike , and to all of you : <p> The bird is the word . <p> the b-b-b-b-b-bird , the bird , the bird is the word . <p> RonWelty <p> 10-13-2008 , 03:52 AM <p> I 've just got one thing to say to Fat Mike , and to all of you : <p> The bird is the word . <p> the b-b-b-b-b-bird , the bird , the bird is the word . <p> someone is watching too much Family guy <p> ben123 <p> 10-13-2008 , 06:03 AM <p> I 'm a big Offspring fan . I like NOFX as well . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , but they 're great . And they have a really special music mostly cause of its simplicity . <p> But I ca n't disagree about not being themselves on their shows . Sometimes I could say it looks like a really bad movie scene . They have many shows during the tour . It 's not about thinking out a new program every night , but it could be cool if they would be themselves on the stage a little more than now . If you have a great mood , much energy to share it with the crowd , do it . If the mood sucks and you 're tired , just play the set and say " thank you " . It 's a lot better than saying same stuff every show . Do it like Lagwagon , like NOFX , like No Use For A Name . They are all themselves on their shows and its just so cool . <p> randman21 <p> 10-13-2008 , 06:51 AM <p> The thing for me , though , is when I go to a concert , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not necessarily in the mood for a standup routine . I want to hear music and mostly music . And I do n't really see the correlation being mediocre and crowd interaction . 41119 @qwx451119 <p> 10-13-2008 , 08:14 AM <p> I know right ! When I see a band live , all I care about is that they blow me away with bitchin tunes . I saw Van Halen , and they were trying to interact with the crowd and do bits that they 've been doing for decades , and all I wanted was for them to continue shaking the foundation . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 10-13-2008 , 11:22 AM <p> The thing for me , though , is when I go to a concert , I 'm not going to Yuk Yuk 's , so I 'm not necessarily in the mood for a standup routine . I want to hear music and mostly music . And I do n't really see the correlation being mediocre and crowd interaction . <p> It 's personal preference really . Sometimes when i see a band live it 's cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , ie the last time i Saw Against Me ! live they hardly said a word , but crammed as much music as they could into their 1 hour 20 min setlist . It was great . <p> Then again , the last time I saw the Offspring , they had tons of crowd interaction , ( ie Noodles and Dexter joked around with US , and even squirted us with a fire hose ) <p> I find that interaction sometimes makes the show seem a bit more personal but then again , sometimes its just nice to get blown away by the music . <p> findout5 <p> 10-13-2008 , 11:29 AM <p> someone is watching too much Family guy <p> You mean Full Metal Jacket ! lol <p> RonWelty <p> 10-13-2008 , 11:45 AM <p> You mean Full Metal Jacket ! lol <p> no , last Family guy episode , had that sketch , in fact , was a tribute to that song . But yeah , that song appeared too in that film . <p> Ninty Man <p> 10-13-2008 , 03:12 PM <p> I know right ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about is that they blow me away with bitchin tunes . I saw Van Halen , and they were trying to interact with the crowd and do bits that they 've been doing for decades , and all I wanted was for them to continue shaking the foundation . <p> sorry to bump this but i just noticed the offspring are mentioned in the nofx song Whoa On The Whoas <p> Tomasisko <p> 02-08-2009 , 04:28 PM <p> sorry to bump this but i just noticed the offspring are mentioned in the nofx song Whoa On The Whoas <p> Yes they are mentioned ...

The bands have pretty good relationship with one another , let 's not try and turn this into some sort of feud . <p> Yea , I was under the impression that Fat Mike and Dexter were pretty good friends . NOFX= decent , mediocre , run of the mill punk music , pretty good . But I think fat mike is a piece of shit , personally . Good musician , total d bag though . <p> randman21 <p> 02-08-2009 , 06:53 PM <p> thanks i do n't know why i never noticed that before : confused : Hehe , even I knew that and I 've never even heard the song .

I like punk , believe me , but I 've never liked that band 41125 @qwx451125 <p> 02-08-2009 , 09:59 PM <p> I like both bands and everyone is entitled to their opinion . <p> And Fat Mike is an asshole , so I 'm not surprised <p> Autonomist <p> 02-08-2009 , 10:05 PM <p> I ca n't respect anyone who would think NOFX is the greatest band ever , even if that person is a member of NOFX themself . <p> Oxygene <p> 02-09-2009 , 01:12 AM <p> Fat Mike is full of shit : " they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for only willing to tour with awesome bands .. at least according to their definition . <p> Dumb fucking hypocrite . Why would you take a " mediocre " band on tour anyway . There are hundreds and thousands of bands lining up to tour , why would you take out a shitty one ? <p> Fucking liar . <p> Oxygene <p> 02-09-2009 , 08:02 AM <p> Serious question : Why does anyone give a fuck ? <p> Should n't you be LittleMissNihilist ... what kind of question is that ? : ) <p> Oxygene <p> 02-09-2009 , 09:48 AM <p> A serious one .

I started my Ruby version again last night . <p> Out of the two , I chose Charizard , but I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM <p> I 'll be honest , my favorite final form of a starter is Empoleon . As a water/steel type , not much could even scratch it . It cancels out like most of their respective types ' weaknesses , like grass , thunder , fire , and ground . <p> I also picked piplup as my starter pokTmon when I got Diamond .

Yes , that is exactly what he was . What did he do ? He slept , he slept and he complained . The mother fucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand grew up tough . Was he a usless crybaby when he was young ? No , he ran with the Squirtle Squad , a gang with calamitous intent . Wartortle ? He was pretty bad ass , I mean war is in his name . Not to mention his indestructible shell , the fact that he is a well trained killing machine , and oh yeah ... HIS FUCKING WATER CANNONS . <p> That said , I do like Venasaur , but Blastoise could destroy him as well ( super high def. , ice beam ) . <p> edit : Ash is an idiot , he should have evolved pikachu when he had the chance .

Raichu &gt; Pikachu . <p> Interesting points . As you 've said , Ash was an idiot . Furthermore , the fact that he imprisoned poor creatures in balls with no oxygen was rather doubtful . Why would they obey him in these conditions ? While most pokemon went along with what these 11 year old trainers ( aka psychopaths ) said , Charizard knew it was unfair bullshit . <p> " Why should I fight for this dude who imprisons me in a ball that 's one hundredth of my size ? " thought Charizard as Ash furiously screamed commands at him . Charizard sometimes let out a tear after such harsh treatment - something ANYONE would do in this situation . <p> Blastoise is maybe stronger , but Charizard stood up for his principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving poor pokemon . <p> In any case , he knew he could have defeated anyone he wished . He did n't give a fuck about these set-up battles , and about the wants of his moronic trainer . <p> Charizard was an honorable pokemon . One which could discern right from wrong . One which decided to stand up against Ash and such trainers . Blastoise is the real pussy . He maybe got his military training and shit , but he got it for the wrong reasons to help the wrong people . He was weakminded like most pokemon were . <p> Charizard is a hero . Blastoise is his trainer 's puppet ( and quite frankly , he 's quite retarded to not realize it ) . <p> 0r4ng3 <p> 03-12-2009 , 04:56 PM <p> There 's always the other argument . <p> The argument that none of it actually happened . LONG ... <p> WebDudette <p> 03-12-2009 , 05:06 PM <p> I 've actually toyed with a theory that all the pokemon trainers are people in an insane asylum . <p> I 've also come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bible . Ash is the second coming of Jesus . Brock , Misty , and Ash 's pokemon , disciples and/or followers . Gary Oak , though probably not Satan himself , may be one of his pawns . He is always trying to convert ash , he is always over indulging , bitches and what not . Team Rocket , Jews maybe ? Prof. Oak , he may be God . He seems to have a distaste for Gary , and he has blessed Ash with an awe inspiring power ( pikachu ) . The other Gym leaders may be other religions , trying to convert people to follow their ways . The Pokemon fossils may be a part of another creation that God has cast from the world , or something scientists put their to dissuade the idea of a God . <p> At one point it was far more thought out then this , I seem to have forgotten a lot of my initial points on the subject . Oh well . 41125 @qwx451125 <p> 03-12-2009 , 05:42 PM <p> Blastiose has always been my favorite because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game all those years ago . <p> Ahhh , memories ... 41171 @qwx451171 <p> 03-12-2009 , 06:30 PM <p> I hate the show . In my mind , Pokemon was supposed to be gritty and dark . Evil corporations stealing Pokemon and trading them for tokens at a casino . A horrifying mutated beast , grown from a single cell from a mysterious specie , blowing up a lab , killing the scientists inside , and flying to a cave just beyond Cerulean . A tower , built for the remembrance of Pokemon passed , possessed by the spirit of an angry mother Marowak getting revenge for the murder of her children . The channelers within the tower , their blank eyes staring deep into your soul , while the melancholy music surrounded you ... Not forgetting the revival of Rocket in Jhoto , who chopped off the tails of innocent Slowpoke and sold them . <p> I really got into my Pokemans . <p> PS Venusaur rules and it 's a disgrace not to have it in the above poll . I am angry now . : mad : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel the need to include Venusaur in the poll . I just assumed that people voting for him would simply do so out of pure pity because he 's so pathetic and no one likes that lazy plant thing .

So does Fire . Water blocks fire , so that equalizes .... but the turtle thing ( WTF is it 's name ) from Ruby/Sapphire still breaks Empoleon because it learns Earthquake and gets a 50% type bonus for the damage , plus another 100% from Empoleon being weak against it . Same with any fire dude ; the fire dude kicks the shit out of Empoleon because fire and fighting both eat Steel for breakfast , and that monkey thing 's third form is both . <p> As for first-gen , I think it 's safe to say that Blastoise has the advantage . He 's faster than Venusaur ( the slowest of the original 3 ) and knows Ice Beam , which has a 200% modifier because Venusaur is double-weak against ice , so he 'll kill Venusaur before he even gets a turn . Blastoise is strong against fire attacks , has good defense to resist Charizard 's flying and physical attacks , and beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a turn , he very likely only has 1 turn to KO Blastoise ; there 's simply no way he 'll survive more than 1 Hydro Pump ( assuming it hits ) , and even if you only use Surf ( which actually hits more often ) , 1-3 turns and Charizard is dead . <p> So I have to go with Blastoise .

@@44115848 @4115848/ <p> When it comes to albums , the choice of artwork makes a strong first impression , and represents the album for the listener . I 've honestly missed out on some good albums the first time around because the artwork was downright unappealing . While only being a relatively recent fan of The Offspring , I can say that all their albums are solid . But the artwork ? Some more awesome than others . So I 'm asking you ; what 's your favorite Offspring album artwork ? ( This is mainly for albums , but if there 's an EP , single , or other release of note , feel free to mention it ) . <p> I 'll go ahead and rank the artworks in my own order : <p> 10 . Rise and Fall , Rage and Grace LONG ... Being completely honest , it just strikes me as amateur . The design itself is nice , but it 's very basic , and the limited use of colors is n't easy on the eyes . It just seems like a lot of basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my least-favorite incarnation of the band 's logo . 9 . Conspiracy of One LONG ... Again , my complaint with this one is the very basic design . It 's not poorly done , either , it just seems generic ; this would n't jump out at me on store shelves in 2000 . Yes , The Offspring has a badass logo , but this cover just kinda shoves it in our faces . Never really cared for the graffiti font too much , either , but it 's all aesthetically pleasing , at least . 8 . Ixnay on the Hombre LONG ... After Smash , we 're beginning to see a skull motif in place . The Mexican calavera-inspired art is striking , but seems a bit weird and out of place . In my opinion , it does n't really seem consistent with the general theme of the album ( only the occasional wacky songs ) . I guess in a way , it is symbolic of The Offspring finding their own way , and not caring what others think . 7 . Ignition LONG ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an enigma . Ignition as a whole offers a more deep and reflective side of The Offspring , but the title comes from the song " Burn It Up , " which is one of the more fast-paced punk cuts on the album . Either way , the cover shows a relatively calm picture of fire from behind a stone wall , with the text being written in a relatively uninteresting font . I do n't know why , but something about this cover just makes me think of the early 90s in terms of design Note : I am aware that this album has an alternate artwork LONG ... however , I do not consider this important in the slightest . 6 . Splinter LONG ... I actually like this one , it has a strong composition and looks nice . But I ca n't help but wonder how well this represents the band itself . Oh well , I guess it 's inspired by the softer tone of most of the tracks . I also love the logo here ; it was a nice , subtle way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG ... What can I say ? It 's very lively and animated just like the album itself . I feel it really represents The Offsprings off the wall humor , and sums up the album well ; you do n't know what to expect . 4 . The Offspring ( Nitro Records ) LONG ... While it 's a bummer that the original artwork for the album was censored ( the exact reason being unknown ) , the new artwork , made by Mackie Osborne , still does the album justice . It 's dark and creepy ; a perfect atmospheric approach to the album 's content . Meanwhile , The Offspring logo contrasts well with the background . Apparently , the band prefers this to the original . I do n't blame them . 3 . Days Go By LONG ... The message of the album artwork is clear , made even more obvious by the title Days Go By , but the simplicity of the design is where it truly shines . The atmosphere is creepy as ever with desolate woods in the background , accented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . It definitely feels like The Offspring . 2 . Smash* LONG ... What can I say about something so iconic ? It 's a very ' punk ' representation that suits the album well . A very ominous image to compliment the music . Meanwhile , " SMASH " is written in a basic font , which actually makes it more interesting . 1 . The Offspring ( Nemesis Records ) LONG ... " Mad " Marc Rude is somewhat of a legend in the punk community , and after looking at some of his artwork , it 's not hard to see why . The Offspring wanted to make a real album , and did n't let anything get in the way ; they got in touch with the esteemed Thom Wilson ( of Dead Kennedys and T.S.O.L. fame ) , as well as Mr. Rude . To me , this artwork goes along great with Noodles ' screeching guitars and Dexter , I mean Keith 's , wailing vocals . Probably most fitting when stacked up against " Beheaded . " <p> * And yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bummer . <p> Jojan <p> 11-03-2013 , 05:12 AM <p> Something like this . <p> The Offspring from 1989 Ixnay on the Hombre Americana Smash Days Go By Rise and Fall , Rage and Grace Ignition Splinter Conspiracy of One The Offspring from 1995 <p> Dulce Maria <p> 11-22-2013 , 05:10 PM <p> the rise and fall , rage and grace one . it 's my favorite album cover art . Days Go By it 's also a great album cover art one aswell . <p> " Melyssa K " Kennedy <p> 11-23-2013 , 01:37 PM <p> I am particularly fond of the Ixnay and Conspiracy of One covers . Splinter is my least favorite . <p> Moglie <p> 04-14-2016 , 01:19 AM <p> Conspiracy of One is my favorite . It 's just a classic and everyone knows that cover even people who do n't listen to the Offspring . <p> dffpunk <p> 04-14-2016 , 08:38 AM <p> Conspiracy Of One hands down , if we count the individual song artwork as well , the colorful images do really suit their music the best .

I understand people not liking CC , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " enemies " ..... the offspring have n't done an entire punk rock album since ignition really , all the others got some different stuff , so nobody can expect an album full of rock songs .

Though I do kinda like CC , I like it more that the band is still into writing songs and performing , and that they 're actually having fun doing it . Even if you do n't like CC , it 's coming out just as the band is performing all of Ignition live and rotating their setlists on a level they have n't done in about 7 years ( Warped Tour 2005 ) . If this is the " price " fans have to pay for new albums , shows , and maybe a Smash anniversary in a couple years , I think most of us can manage to live with that . <p> http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kGxXRbSFDg <p> Britpunk <p> 06-13-2012 , 03:32 PM <p> Well of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's their job . <p> Still , Forbes and LA Times in the space of a few days ...

If it were a , shit , I do n't know who 's " in " these days , you crazy kids , Katy Perry song , every single critic would be fapping all over it . Why does the backround of the artist matter so much , as long as the song is enjoyable ? And yeah , I think it is a good song . And it 's not really that far off from the band 's usual business . <p> DMelges <p> 06-13-2012 , 03:37 PM <p> Funny how if The Offspring had released the most amazing song in the world , no one would be writing about that . <p> TheNooseIsFalling <p> 06-13-2012 , 03:44 PM <p> Funny how if The Offspring had released the most amazing song in the world , no one would be writing about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 3 years in the music industry .

The more shit you get the more succesful you become . <p> That 's what pisses me off about this whole CC thing . So it 's a crappy pop song , so what ? Does it really destroy your life and your love for the band ? <p> Seriously , they should be getting credit for the awesome songs they write , and the amazing shows they have been giving us this tour . Not destroy their entire reputation because of one song . <p> They have made it clear that this is a silly and fun song . They know it 's dumb but it 's still a fun song . They had fun writing it , so let it be . <p> Angelo <p> 06-13-2012 , 04:12 PM <p> While the article does have a point , the writer comes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lame motherfuckers need to get over themselves , and fast ! <p> When will people get it ? Dexter just writes shit that he enjoys in one way or another . He digs fast , in your face punk . He likes a lot of pop . He 's been influenced by middle eastern musical sensibilities . How anything he writes is a surprise to anyone ( particularly fans ) just shows how out of touch they are with this fact . Not to mention how much they project their own wants and desires on to him . <p> The dude flies a jet for fun : He no need yo ' monies ! <p> The dude wrote THE best selling indie record of all time , without even trying : He no need yo ' approval ! <p> The dude could write " Cruisin ' ... " all day long - IF he wanted to : Get over yourselves and move on to the next track ! <p> I wuv you Dexter ! ! : D <p> This rant was n't intended for ( or at ) anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't seem to get Dexter as a song-writer , yet claim to be " in the know " in one way or another . <p> Llamas <p> 06-13-2012 , 04:17 PM <p> Are you guys seriously complaining about journalists doing their job ? " omg they do n't write about my favorite band the way I want them to ! THEY 'RE SO STUPID ! " This is what they 're paid to do . You rarely see articles about how great a new song is by credible sources . We 're not talking TMZ here . <p> Wait for the album reviews before you start blowing your whistles .

Does it really destroy your life and your love for the band ? <p> No , it does n't ; but the thing is when it 's your favorite band they 're talking about it 's natural to get upset specially when A LOT of us saw this coming . <p> Seriously , they should be getting credit for the awesome songs they write ... Not destroy their entire reputation because of one song . <p> Bingo . That is what a lot of us have been trying to point out . We always hope that the new stuff is going to be as good as the previous ones . I know everybody moves on , life goes , days go by what have you , but it 's just hard to break away from the past and you can see that reflected on the audience . Everybody is just loving the new vibe with the band bringing old stuff . Fans always hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have made it clear that this is a silly and fun song . They know it 's dumb but it 's still a fun song . They had fun writing it , so let it be . <p> Why let it be ? If we loved the song we could go on forever ? This is something that is bothering me - and a lot of other members for that matter - because it did not happen when RAFRAG came out ; people would go on and on about Fix You and Kristy . For some reason , CC is bringing the best - and the worst - in people . <p> Now concerning the article : <p> The song ( Pretty fly ) also does n't  stray too far from the groups well-established sonic sensibilities , keeping the work in line with The Offsprings well-established vision . It helped re-establish The Offspring as a powerful voice in alternative rock a little more than four years after the groups breakthrough album , Smash ... <p> There . A pop song ? Certainly , but still within the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need to record a song resembling for instance Vanilla Ice ( or Eminem ) songs . Perhaps that is not what CC was meant to be . If so , I still can not comprehend its purpose ( should there be one ) . If it is a joke , I still think it is a bad one - not lyrically . Now , if it 's not a joke , what in this world is it ? <p> I sure hope the intention of CC , song and video , is to flop to exactly get the media attention artists like Gaga , Kate Perry or totally absurd Minaj because seriously how can Kate Perry be as successful as Michael Jackson single-wise ? <p> Degstur Lolland <p> 06-13-2012 , 05:34 PM <p> There . A pop song ? Certainly , but still within the scope of what the band has always done meaning the band did n't need to record a song resembling for instance Vanilla Ice ( or Eminem ) songs . Perhaps that is not what CC was meant to be . If so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) . If it is a joke , I still think it is a bad one - not lyrically . Now , if it 's not a joke , what in this world is it ? But , the thing is that if they did Pretty Fly again they would repeat themselves . Even the video is not as exclusive as PF because it would n't be very punk today . You 're not punk enough , Camila . : D <p> Alien Invader <p> 06-13-2012 , 05:38 PM <p> A LOT of us saw this coming . <p> Exactly . So .. um .. keeping that in mind , why are people getting so upset ? <p> offsrx <p> 06-13-2012 , 05:38 PM <p> this : " Perhaps the track had been intended as a joke , something akin to " Pretty Fly , " but there 's a big difference between intent and execution , and its difficult to think the band has become the thing it once lampooneda group of clueless trend-chasers . " I 'm so sorry but - this is impression which CC left on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It still kinda is : ( I knew that other people were gon na bash the song .. Offspring you 've should n't done this song ! : ( <p> Camila <p> 06-13-2012 , 05:39 PM <p> But , the thing is that if they did Pretty Fly again they would repeat themselves . Even the video is not as exclusive as PF because it would n't be very punk today . You 're not punk enough , Camila . : D <p> Oh ... So now being punk nowadays is actually not being punk ? Well , it makes sense because that 's what Dexter and Noodles said on that interview right ? ! <p> Now I see it hahaha <p> Britpunk <p> 06-13-2012 , 05:40 PM <p> Camila , <p> I just do n't see why its worth getting all stressed over . The band presumably thought it was a good idea to record and release the song . I trust their judgement in this ( I also genuinely like the song , joke or not , but each to their own , eh ? ; ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothering with , and certainly not worth worrying about . Hell I remember when Ixnay came out and NME utterly slated it , saying that the only saving grace was that Gone Away sorta sounded like a U2 b-side . And yet Ixnay consistently appears near the top of most fan 's Offsrping album-rank ( at least on the message board ) . <p> It is also worth reading this article LONG ... It 's about food criticism , but it speaks volumes about why critics will often write comically bad reviews , when a simple ' i do n't like this song ' , or simply ignoring it will do - people remember bad reviews - they share them around - they get the website a whole bunch of hits , which == more advertising revenue . <p> Back to your post , you talk about how people ' went on and on about Fix You and Kristy ' after RAFRAG - but it sounds like that kinda annoyed you . Assuming it did , do you not think that going on and on about CC is n't gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it or are fairly ambivalent towards it ? ( i know there 's plenty who are guilty of this , so please do n't feel i 'm picking on you - i 've responded to other CC posts in the past ) . <p> Finally I just think everybody just needs to relax a bit . The album is out in 8 days in a few places so most of us will hear it by then or shortly after - if not on the bands soundcloud , then at least on youtube ( i assume nobody torrents anymore since its damned easier just to buy music nowadays ) , and I think then we 'll be able to listen to CC in the context of the album . It may be jarring and horrible , but we 'll see .... <p> Degstur Lolland <p> 06-13-2012 , 06:06 PM <p> this : " Perhaps the track had been intended as a joke , something akin to " Pretty Fly , " but there 's a big difference between intent and execution , and its difficult to think the band has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm so sorry but - this is impression which CC left on me after listening to it for 1st time ..

Yeah , that PJ song is definitely an attempt to alter their style , but a whole different ballpark from Crusing California .

The one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 U " in the verse and Marc Anthony 's " I Need to Know " in the chorus . Although I guess it was n't the same because he was already somewhat relevant after doing that James Bond song and all the Audioslave stuff . <p> I think the viral factor alone will propel CC at least somewhere . I doubt it will be a durable mainstream hit though . I expect to hear it primarily in cheap public high school hangouts that are run by foreigners who just take a wild guess as to what " the kids " like . I used to frequent this sushi place that played " Friday " twice in 30-minute periods . Often . <p> findout5 <p> 06-14-2012 , 01:33 AM <p> We should have one thread just for the bad reviews CC is going to get .

Some " change " or " following trends " does n't necessarily have to be a bad thing ( if it 's moderate and credible that is ) .

In fact , there have been instances of autotune in at least the last three Offspring records , but they 're there for correction . <p> The " Californiaaaa " bit on CC is an aesthetic decision based on the current trend of using auto tune as a vocoder rather than a functional tool for restorative purposes .

And , so that you know , he got divorced from his 1st wife ( soundgarden 's former manager ) and she left him on a bad financial situation ( rumors are she even took his grammy ) .

It 's just very very hard to notice because they 're so close . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=hZz8X8Un5Dg he 's talking about it at 3:22 and I think that 's what they 're doing at 1:22 . And this guy is a great singer . <p> I used 0 autotune , it was n't even really that wide spread when we recorded ... Feel free to find anything off key on our album . <p> Oh yeah , I am a shitty singer ! Not even mediocre ... But bad . <p> DarrellOCguy <p> 06-14-2012 , 02:02 PM <p> Anyone remember this ? <p> http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=-OgwDVaCiSw <p> Was n't the end of his world . <p> No but it could part of the end of the world soundtrack . God that 's awful . Never liked soundgarden alot but that is really bad <p> Llamas <p> 06-14-2012 , 02:53 PM <p> Honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Studio time is really expensive and sometimes you ca n't afford that many hours to get the best possible take , and minor tweaking is needed . <p> In fact , autotune is a lot less conspicuous than most people realize-- it 's probably in a lot of the records you listen to . It 's not usually as obvious as the " californiaaa " bit in CC . In fact , there have been instances of autotune in at least the last three Offspring records , but they 're there for correction . <p> The " Californiaaaa " bit on CC is an aesthetic decision based on the current trend of using auto tune as a vocoder rather than a functional tool for restorative purposes . That I 'm not crazy about , and it 's a really annoying sound . <p> I know the Offspring has used it on previous records ; it 's very obvious on songs like Fix You and Kristy . I can recognize it pretty easily , actually , even when it 's not intentionally obvious . Again , quite a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Studio time is expensive , yes . That 's why you practice like crazy before entering the studio so that you can record in less time , and that 's why signed musicians make more money than most of us . If I 'm paying 40 euros for your concert and another 15 for each CD , then use that money to create honest music , please . I really like how Cake made their last album with equipment that was entirely run on solar power , in a little cabin in the middle of nowhere : D That shit 's badass . <p> Hey Man Where 's Everybody <p> 06-14-2012 , 03:00 PM <p> I know the Offspring has used it on previous records ; it 's very obvious on songs like Fix You and Kristy .

I really like how Cake made their last album with equipment that was entirely run on solar power , in a little cabin in the middle of nowhere : D That shit 's badass . <p> That is pretty cool . A bare-bones approach to recording can yield some really good results , like the first Bon Iver album . But I just ca n't bring myself to be bothered by the use of autotune as a corrective too-- I guess I do n't see how tuning a singer 's voice is any different from editing the timing ( which is standard practice ) , double tracking to fatten up vocal lines or EQ trickery during mixing . The end result is sound over time . There 's a million lies in a recording , why tuning a singer 's voice is such a taboo , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I record myself without autotune ' cause I still have to learn to use it ... but I 'm more punk if I shound shitty .... or at least it 's a good excuse : ) <p> KickHimWhenHe'sDown <p> 06-14-2012 , 08:20 PM <p> On the topic at hand , it is said that there 's no such thing as bad publicity ... I disagree <p> It 's not punk to repeat yourself . Only Bad Religion repeat themselves , but they are retarded anyway . It 's punk to imitate once lampooned shit now . Clueless ? They have just made modern shiz into punk . I strongly disagree <p> NoGuessing <p> 06-14-2012 , 08:42 PM <p> Can we dispel the myth Bad Religion recycle the same album again and again please ? <p> The only copies I can think of are Sanity/Infected and the intro for I Want to Conquer the World/Wrong Way Kids . <p> Suffer and The Dissent of Man are worlds apart . 41141 @qwx451141 <p> 06-15-2012 , 12:01 AM <p> Can we dispel the myth Bad Religion recycle the same album again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I like them , but you could put almost every song in every album and it would fit . <p> NoGuessing <p> 06-15-2012 , 12:16 AM <p> Nah .

I 'll grant you the Suffer/No Control/ATG years were pretty similar , but apart from that each album sounds distinct to me . <p> Llamas <p> 06-15-2012 , 05:19 AM <p> Why is HAU so obsessed with what is and is n't punk ?

I 'll grant you the Suffer/No Control/ATG years were pretty similar , but apart from that each album sounds distinct to me . <p> Bad Religion manages to make a little changes with each album that allow them to remain fresh and unique , but nevertheless , i can pretty much tell you how each album from them will sound ; its not as if they reinvent themselves . And that 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
@@44115851 @4115851/ <p> So I 'm pretty sure XYlophonetreeZ and I will be the only ones posting in this , but that 's fine , because I needed to ask him a quesiton . <p> You told me to get their mixtape or whatever , but I ca n't remember the name or where you said to get it = ( . <p> And for everyone else , this is a kickass band with about as many influences as any band out there , and they pretty much have a song for everybody . Committment , their newest , is a tad less broad , but Throwing the Game is one of my favorite albums , and everyone should check it out . <p> nieh <p> 02-14-2006 , 03:38 PM <p> I 've heard of them before . What are they like ? Give us some songs ! 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 02-14-2006 , 03:39 PM <p> They 're not like anything , really . I 'll upload a couple of my favorites here in a second . 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 02-14-2006 , 03:52 PM <p> All of these are off Throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical Altrock song , but much catchier . Stubhy 's voice is great in this one . This is the type of song you 're looking at for a good portion of Committment . <p> Bossman LONG ... One of the more well known songs off the album , has a reggae edge in it , especially when the reggae singer is actually singing . Major coincidence , huh ? Good all around . <p> 3 to 10/Cd 's Caddy , pt 1 LONG ... Has some hardcoreish punk stuff , and also some hiphop/rap stuff , and even some basic rock . Also a hell of a catchy bridge towards the end . Probably my favorite song on the album at the moment . Also a great pump up song . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 02-14-2006 , 04:27 PM <p> OK , so the thing I told you about was The Red Tape Outtakes ( Demos and Heartbreaks ) , which is a compilation of stuff they 've done throughout . It 's got some really old stuff as well as some brand-new stuff . Because of this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sound a little unfinished , but it contains some of my favorite songs of theirs nonetheless . You can order it via their website ( www.luckyboys.com ) . But since it has some of their best songs , I 'll upload some of them . They have comments about the songs in the liner notes , and basically it sounds like they were really pissed off at Elektra ( who has since dropped them ) for not including some of them on the record . But here are a few of the highlights of the album , recently added to my Savefile page ( http : **34;2076;TOOLONG ) . I picked 4 songs that are not only all good , but represent the diversity of the record . I might even upload the rest later so that you can get it without having to order it . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 02-14-2006 , 04:31 PM <p> 3 to 10/Cd 's Caddy , pt 1 LONG ...

Dude , I love that song . They close every show with it . There 's an extended instrumental part and Stubhy goes " Alright , I 'm gon na need two words outta you guys . The first word is ' shit . ' The second word is ' warrant . ' " And the crowd has really gotten into it everytime , and they finish off with a bunch of crazy improv stuff , usually involving Joe playing guitar behind his head or something . It 's a great time . <p> Also , if you get Red Tape Outtakes , they provide clever hints that can help you figure out who " Cockboy " really is. 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 02-14-2006 , 04:59 PM <p> I 'll probably order it either way , just because I collect cds . Thanks a bunch , I 'm definately getting those . <p> New EP is out ! I got it for my birthday ( : D : D ) , and it 's pretty good . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just wish there were more . It 's called How to Get Out Alive , and it 's got 5 songs , including a cover of " Anything , Anything " by Dramarama . I especially love " The Struggle " and " Like Rats from a Sinking Ship .

How unpersonal is that ? ! <p> Hey gang , we 've decided its time to address all the rumors going around concerning the band right now . As you 've no doubt noticed , we have n't announced our fall tour dates yet . The reason being is that the band , after 9 years playing together , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out after our 9 week tour this summer and most of us are looking forward to being home for awhile and having some sense of normality .

We are still definitely locked in for Songs From A Scene in Chicago in late December , so if you ca n't make it out next weekend there will still be a couple chances to catch us . Our fans are seriously some of the most rabid , loyal , hard partying kids and I hope you know how much we 've appreciated you all over this past decade of rock n roll .

Also , he has some projects in the next months that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But perhaps most importantly , Stubhy got engaged after the Bowling For Soup tour and is planning on getting married next year . <p> Ryan has become an entertainment writer for the Insider ; a new weekly focusing on arts and entertainment in the western suburbs .

He 's also playing tennis twice a week and drinking obscene amounts of rum . <p> Jason is playing/writing music everyday . He 's enjoying his new apartment , BBQ'n , checking out new bars in the neighborhood , and preparing for a cold ass winter . <p> Joe is trying to break the record for the most consecutive hours spent reading harry potter . He 's doing fine and working in Naperville . <p> Also stay tuned for a live acoustic cd as well as the forthcoming book ; Medicine and Gasoline / On the road in America with Lucky Boys Confusion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be safe ! ! <p> Go Stubhy ! 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 04-03-2007 , 08:11 PM <p> *missin ' u* : ( <p> Llamas <p> 04-05-2007 , 06:53 AM <p> I missed this thread before . They 're not broken up ? Has there been any news since then ? Cause that 's awesome . <p> They seem a bit more generic than LBC , though . Idk if I 'll buy an album of theirs or not . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 04-07-2007 , 01:37 AM <p> The second song listed on their myspace is really good . The first one is pretty good . The third one , Strawberry Lake or some shit or whatever , is honestly one of the worst songs I 've ever heard in my life . <p> I 'll probably get their EP . <p> Llamas <p> 04-07-2007 , 02:15 AM <p> Someone link the myspace ... ? 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 04-19-2007 , 01:08 PM <p> I 'm not a big fan of Stubhy 's new project but I love LBC , if anyone is ever looking for any rare LBC tracks , lmk because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM <p> Oh man . I just found their myspace . Butterfly is like 10,000 out of 10 . Holy shit . I love it . Trying too hard is totally 10/10 . VERY good . Baby Baby is probably 9/10 . Also very good . Strawberry Lake is like 7/10 . The voice effects are really annoying , and it 's just way too boy band poppy . <p> Based on these songs , I like them as much as LBC . However , I 'm a newer fan of LBC , as I had n't heard them at all until this past summer when I saw them live with a friend and met them backstage . I grew to like them very quickly , but I have n't been a fan long enough to feel the loyalty others probably feel . I really , really enjoy Butterfly and Trying Too Hard .

With the exception of " Trying Too Hard " and " Medicate My Wounds " ( the latter grew on me as I came to realize it 's a brilliant songwriting departure , and quite a pretty song ) , I thought their debut EP was kinda meh . But songs like " Baby Baby , " " Butterfly , " and especially this new one which is my current favorite , had all damn well better end up on their next release , because they 're generally just way better than the other stuff . <p> Llamas <p> 06-04-2007 , 02:06 AM <p> I so totally agree . Strawberry Lake grew on me , but it 's still a very average song . Driving Too Fast , Trying Too Hard and Medicate My Wounds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own even those songs . I rather wish they could just release an LP ... but I understand why they ca n't . But you at least made me realize maybe why I 'm liking them more and more ; their songs are getting better and better . : ) 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 06-04-2007 , 11:03 AM <p> Shock Stars better than LBC ? I would n't go that far : ) I got ta check out this new Shock Stars song though . Biggest Mistake was actually an unreleased LBC song I believe that Stubhy released with the Shock Stars . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 06-06-2007 , 01:15 PM <p> This just in : I am officially declaring " Medicate My Wounds " the best song thus far of 2007 . LBC and Stubhy have proven themselves capable of many things , but Stubhy really went out into uncharted waters on this one . It 's not the most original song ever , but it 's a very touching , beautiful song with some things that he 's never done before and he pulled it off magnificently . Kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 06-06-2007 , 03:37 PM <p> Hey dude , can you send that to me ? 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 06-07-2007 , 07:38 AM <p> Yeah , I started really liking it on the second play . The Lyrics are amazing . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 06-07-2007 , 07:47 AM <p> Hey dude , can you send that to me ? Unfortunately , no .

Once I get my paycheck soon , I 'll probably buy the EP online . <p> H1TThat <p> 06-28-2007 , 09:19 AM <p> I checked out thier myspace , and they sounded pretty good . So i got Comittment . Holy fucking shit , this is some funky catchy awesome shit . I 've listened to the album around 5 times through now . FUCK FUCK FUCK , its great stuff . 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 06-28-2007 , 09:27 AM <p> " Throwing the Game " is a better album in my opinion , as it has a much more diverse range of music styles . <p> Llamas <p> 06-28-2007 , 09:41 AM <p> I bought How To Get Out Alive first ... and then Commitment . Then I downloaded Throwing the Game and uh , Growing Up ? I ca n't really get into EPs unless I 'm already into a band , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . When I got Commitment , I was in love for a while , and then fell in love with Alive . I 've yet to really get into the other two . I 'm sure part of it is because I do n't have the actual albums , as I tend to get into albums more if I buy them . I 'm weird , I know . I think my favorite album at this point is Alive . It 's not the most diverse , but each song is extremely well written . Such a strong EP . <p> I still like Commitment quite a bit , but I find it overly poppy at this point . I 've listened to Throwing the Game more , and I think it 's probably a better album , even though I 'm not totally into it . 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 06-28-2007 , 12:22 PM <p> Throwing the Game is their best album and I absolutely love How To Get Out Alive but Commitment does have a few of my favorite songs like Closer to our graves , Broken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I absolutely love this band but I 'm having troubles finding these albums : <p> I really want the actual cd 's but I could only find them for insane prices at Amazon .

Might not work that well all the time though since my internet connection 's been fucking up a lot lately . <p> Sham <p> 10-07-2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm listening to their Myspace right now . Hey Driver is pretty shitty , but Needle in my arm is pretty good <p> Hey , I agree about Hey Driver , however I would say i 'm a fan of The Power of The Ganja . However those songs on their myspace are not a great judge of their other work , you should see about downloading some of their stuff from Throwing The Game and How To Get Out Alive . 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 10-13-2007 , 08:49 AM <p> I agree , Throwing the Game is the most diverse stuff , and How to Get Out Alive is the most ' mature ' sounding . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 10-13-2007 , 11:03 AM <p> Agreed completely . Commitment attempted to be that " mature " sound , but the music was probably even more formulaic than their earlier stuff and it just sounded like they were n't having as much fun . How to Get Out Alive is still a bit formulaic ( e.g. a gang-vocals bridge in BOTH The Struggle and Cigarettes ) , but it 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Commitment is a bad album and I love Hey Driver . 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 10-13-2007 , 11:22 AM <p> That all said , I do n't think Commitment is a bad album and I love Hey Driver . Totally . Committment got me into them as well , so I go back and listen to it all the time . The only songs on it I do n't really like are the first and last tracks . 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 10-13-2007 , 07:00 PM <p> Commitment is a good album too , I 'm a fan of the band so I can listen to anything they put out . There are definately some misses on it though . A lot of people hate Blame , I actually like it . Songs I do n't like as much on commitment are Hey Driver , You Were n't There and Beware . How To Get Out Alive has The Struggle , When Bad News Gets Worse , Rats from a sinking ship and Anything Anything and it is an EP so that 's pretty damn impressive . Throwing The Game is pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blends old LBC and new LBC . It pissed that they still are touring the East Coast , only the midwest , hopefully soon . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 10-17-2007 , 10:47 PM <p> http : **31;2313;TOOLONG Wow , Stubhy is SUCH A FAG now . And even though he sounds increasingly like the dude from Fall Out Boy with every new song they put up , I really like Shock Stars on the whole . And I really like their newest song " Dancing on Thin Ice " even though it sounds almost exactly like a Fall Out Boy outtake . Fuck me , I 'm gay . <p> Llamas <p> 10-18-2007 , 12:10 AM <p> Holy fuck . He ( and his entire band ) look like flaming homos . <p> I enjoy all their songs besides Strawberry Lake . That song fucking sucks . But yes , they do sound more and more like Fallout Boy ... but not shitty . <p> Dancing on Thin Ice is good . 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 10-18-2007 , 02:13 PM <p> wtf , Strawberry Lake is fantastic . <p> Treez : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just listen , I 'm fine . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 10-18-2007 , 02:33 PM <p> Holy fuck .

I must agree with every point here . 41129 @qwx451129 <p> 10-18-2007 , 05:26 PM <p> Fuck both of you . Strawberry Lake is fantastic . <p> Llamas <p> 10-18-2007 , 09:43 PM <p> Sure , if you like horribly shitty pop songs that sound like a bad attempt at NSYNC. 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 10-20-2007 , 08:06 PM <p> I must agree , Strawberry Lake is bad . Shock Stars does n't really have a unique sound to me like LBC did . Its funny there is a section of " Dancing on thin Ice " where all the lyrics are taken from an old song from LBC called " She Said " that they never recorded . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bump this after seeing some promising news on their Myspace . Stubhy posted this blog that stated that an LBC " Lost " album could be released in the near future . I was pretty unsure if I would ever hear anything new from them and I hope this happens because I really liked how they sounded on their last EP and would like to see how they would follow it . Original blog post below . <p> First and foremost , Ryan Fergus ( our drummer ) just had a beautiful baby boy ( well , his wife did ) , his name is Ryder Michael Fergus . <p> I went to go see him a couple days after he was born and he 's very cute and is going to be a little hellraiser for sure ! ! <p> On just a slightly smaller note , my chinchillas are going to have babies ! I 'm just being stupid but yes , they really are , if we have more than 2 we might find homes for a couple , they can have up to eight ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing an acoustic set at Flatlanders in Lincolnshire similar to our Beat Kitchen shows that we just played . Last time we played in January the show sold out . These shows are a lot of fun , we tell stories about the songs - as long as the crowd is n't too obnoxious - and drink and have an intimate party setting show . Make sure to get tickets soon or get there when doors open . <p> July 26th Lucky Boys Confusion at House of Blues Chicago ! ! ! It 'll be our only full band show of the summer , get your tickets asap , they will go fast - we will announce the other bands very soon ! <p> BIG NON-BABY NEWS ! ! ! I have a new band called the Insecurities . We are kind of like a Ryan Adams , Bright Eyes , Counting Crows , Bruce Springsteen vibe mixed with songs like South Union , King Of Apathy &amp; Never Like This . We do n't really have any quality recordings up right now , just some stuff I did myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some live videos of our first impromptu show . We filled in for Shock Stars after 3 practices , it was still awesome just a little loose . June 10th we start recording our studio album and we have some great names helping us out with the project - Steve Gillis ( Filter ) , Dan Duszynski ( This Is Me Smiling ) , Brian Sherman ( Shock Stars ) and of course , James Harley ( LBC , Quiet Drive ) and a plethora of my musician friends doing cameos on it . <p> So please , please go check it out now and add us and we 'll put the songs up in July or early August ! <p> www. myspace. com/theinsecuritiesmusic <p> On more news , American Taxi ( www. myspace. com/americantaximusic ) , Shock Stars ( www. myspace. com/shockstars ) and the Insecurities ( www. myspace. com/theinsecuritiesmusic ) will all be taking part of this years MOBfest ( www. chicagomobfest. com ) . MOBfest is an annual showcase of up and coming Chicago music and is a really great event to expose some worthy bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Insecurities play at 1130 so it 's plenty of time to come out and rock both shows that night and catch Shock Stars the day before . <p> We are making the AmTaxi/Inept the official pre party and the Swizzle Tree/Insecurities the after party so come and party with us ! ! You might just see some cool cameos . <p> Any other news ? Oh .... still working on getting that LBC " Lost " album out ... ssshhhh ..... <p> Stubhy <p> Oh yeah , to the kid that kept screaming throughout the 21plus Beat Kitchen show while I was trying to telling stories , you 're officially on the asshole list ! There are other amazing fans that would have appreciated the show that did n't get in and you ruined moments of the show for the people around you . You can now only redeem yourself by video taping yourself doing 200 push ups while blasting " I 'm A Bitch " by Meredith Brooks on repeat and sending it to Stubhy@aol.com. 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 02-11-2009 , 01:47 PM <p> Even though I no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will be releasing a new full length album on May 24th , 2009 . It will be their first full length since Commitment in 2003 . I will definitely have to check it out and see if they are still good . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 02-11-2009 , 02:32 PM <p> Whoa , awesome . I thought they were done for . Though I 've got ta say , Stubhy 's really gone downhill . I enjoyed some Shock Stars stuff , but the Insecurities are awful . Hopefully having the band back together will improve his style . <p> By the way , do you have a link for this piece of news ? There 's nothing on their myspace. 41173 @qwx451173 <p> 02-11-2009 , 03:23 PM <p> Whoa , awesome . I thought they were done for . Though I 've got ta say , Stubhy 's really gone downhill .

In December 2008 , at their 8th annual Songs From A Scene shows at the Metro in Chicago , the band announced they will be releasing a new album sometime in 2009 . It will be the band 's 3rd full length studio album , following 2003 's Commitment . According to guitarist Adam Krier , the tracks have already been recorded for the new album . <p> On January 30 , 2009 at the Rave Bar in Milwaukee , Lucky Boys Confusion announced that they will hold an album release show for their upcoming , unnamed album on Sunday May 24th at the Double Door in Chicago . <p> LONG ... <p> Edit- I just did some hunting on AbsolutePunk and apparently the songs were recorded during the How to Get Out Alive era ... I consider that album to contain some of their best work so that is good . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 05-15-2012 , 01:37 PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sort of lost interest in what these guys were doing after Stubhy joined that fucking awful Insecurities band . Well , he went and got himself out of that shit and formed a new band called- I shit you not- The Super Happy Fun Club . <p> They have a single called " Way Back ( The Conflict ) " and an EP called- I again shit you not- " Go Fun Yourself . " <p> It sounds like a total joke , but the music 's actually kind of good . Nothing real original here , but it 's pretty decent punk-influenced pop rock . Of the various projects he 's been involved with ( also Shock Stars and The Insecurities ) , this is definitely the most similar to LBC . <p> You can listen to it all for free on their soundcloud page http : **34;2346;TOOLONG 41161 @qwx451161 <p> 05-15-2012 , 01:49 PM <p> Hey , thanks for the update ! Sounds pretty good and indeed similar to LBC . <p> Llamas <p> 05-15-2012 , 04:26 PM <p> I actually miss Shock Stars . Maybe even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nk.net+-+News%29 This is really sad , and a little eerie that it would happen the day after I bumped this thread . <p> Joe was a really good guitarist and always had tons of fun . I remember how he always played behind his head when they closed with the extended version of " 3 to 10 . " One of my best memories from their shows was one time when Stubhy and Adam briefly went offstage , presumably to yell at the sound guy because he sucked at that show , and Joe led the other guys in a punk cover of " Part of Your World " from the Little Mermaid with gratuitous vulgarities inserted in the lyrics . <p> Little known fact : Joe was actually Cockboy , the band 's recurring character that they kept mentioning in songs ( " He had a pimp caddy , you know you ca n't blame us , but we had to make the backseat , backseat famous " ) . I figured this out when I got their B-sides comp The Red Tape Outtakes . One of the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes said something like " There 's a rumor that Cockboy played the solo on this song while smoking a joint , but I was there during recording and can testify that it was none other than Joseph Peter Sell . So only half of the rumor was true . " Well , the band also had one live recording on that album called " The Power of the Ganja , " and in that song they reveal that Joe is the only member of the band who did n't smoke weed . Just a fun bit of trivia . <p> LONG ... Article reveals that he 's been fighting undisclosed health problems for a little while . Did n't know that . Knew that he drank like a fucking animal and had gained a lot of weight back in the middle part of last decade , though . <p> Edit : LONG ... Another article , reveals he had pancreas problems and had struggled with multiple addictions . Some nice remarks from Stubhy. 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 05-18-2012 , 08:58 PM <p> Just a couple of videos of Joe being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? v=YYPvBtShHzU ) Band playing 40/80 , check his solo at the end . ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=t0ZBPnTCNd0 ) <p> Llamas <p> 05-19-2012 , 05:30 AM <p> I actually met Joe the first time I saw the band . I did n't know who they were , but they were playing at Milwaukee 's Summerfest festival , and my best friend loved them and wanted to see them . While I was waiting , I went to check out their merch tent and was gon na buy one of their B-sides albums , because the only other one they had available was the last EP , How to Get Out Alive , and I do n't like buying EPs because there are n't enough songs to make it worth my while ( unless I 'm already a huge fan ) . But the merch guy was trying to convince me to buy the EP ( I guess the band was much prouder of it , and since they 'd released it independently , they 'd get more of a profit off the sale ) . I still did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs , but the guy told me that if I bought it , he 'd see if he could take me backstage to get it signed . I bought it , and Joe was the only member kind enough ( keep in mind , they were getting ready to go on - I could n't blame the other guys for not coming out to meet me ) to come out and talk to me a bit . He was so kind and friendly , signed my CD , and gave me a heartfelt thank you for buying it . His attitude made the show 100x more enjoyable , and it definitely helped turn me into a fan . Plus , after buying Commitment and checking out their others , How to Get Out Alive is probably the best thing they ever did . Definitely worth it . <p> But Joe was a super nice guy , and I 'm actually legit sad he died so young .

Also , Jim Lindberg 's vocals are obvious on Never Gon na Find Me , if I 'm not mistaken . <p> Mr. Orange <p> 06-11-2006 , 12:09 PM <p> Well I have all of AFI 's albums and Black Sails is the only one that 's credits Dexter with backing vocals . He does backing vocals in Malleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weathered Tome , and God Called in Sick Today . <p> Davey is credited on Ixnay and Americana . I thought that was him doing the vocals in Pay the Man , but I 'm not possitive . If you look in the Greatest Hits booklet , Davey is credited for backing vocals in Pretty Fly , but not The Kids Are n't Alright . <p> Jim did some backing vocals on Splinter , but as far as I know he did n't do any on Ixnay . He 's not credited in the booklet anyway . 41148 @qwx451148 <p> 06-11-2006 , 08:02 PM <p> Yeah , Dexter contributes to roughly half the Black Sails songs , just mostly in the form of " woah " s and " go ! " s , but he has a few lyric lines too ( " Pure sweetness " , " my friend " , " I know that I left it in too long " come to mind on Clove Smoke Catharsis ) . <p> As for Davey , I know he 's credited , but am I the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not denying he did backing vocals on Ixnay and Americana , it 's just that I ca n't for the life of me hear them . I mean , he 's not like Jim , Davey has a really distinctive voice . I should be able to hear him singing there ... anyone know any specific parts he does ? <p> And as for Jim Lindberg , I can definitely hear him on the more " serious " tracks of Splinter , but was n't he on a couple of other newer albums too ? Ixnay or Americana or something ( might be uncredited , I 'm not entirely sure , just seem to remember that being said somewhere pretty officially ) ? I ca n't hear him there . But then again , that can be attributed to the fact that he has a pretty normal voice , and I could be mistaking his stuff for just being Noodles or Greg or something . <p> Harisn <p> 06-11-2006 , 09:23 PM <p> I know Davey was on some Americana songs ... what part of Change the World can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocals are obvious on Never Gon na Find Me , if I 'm not mistaken . <p> For the chorus , I can definitely hear Davey , and maybe even Jim I think . The first pair of whoa 's starting at 1:26 definitely include Davey , and the pair of whoa 's starting at 1:37 sound a bit like Jim to me . I 'm sure Davey is there for the first whoa 's on all the other parts of the song . Maybe more obvious at 2:13 ? <p> Mr. Orange <p> 06-11-2006 , 09:51 PM <p> Well , like I said before , I think that 's Davey doing the vocals in the first part of Pay the Man ( See the way the wind blows ... ) And I could never hear him anywhere on Ixnay . The reason I thought he was credited is because they recorded Pay the Man for Ixnay , but they never put it on the album , so I thought they felt they had to credit him even though what he did did n't end up on the album . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be him doing the woah 's in Change the World but I 'm not sure .

But I do know it was written for Ixnay. 41148 @qwx451148 <p> 06-12-2006 , 05:59 PM <p> It was n't completed around the Ixnay sessions . They had an outline , and parts of it written , but it was n't complete . I think they reworked it a year or so later , then subsequently threw it on the Americana record . <p> And the first half of " Pay The Man " is n't Davey . It 's Dexter singing through a decoder , that 's been established . ; ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah , we were wrong . <p> As for Davey , I think he actually spelled it " Havoc " for a while there .

Faith No More - A Small Victory <p> After plowing through a variety of great hooks both musical and vocal , this song finally peters out with Mike Patton intoning " If I speak at one constant volume/at one constant pitch/at one constant rhythm/right into your ear/you still wo n't hear .

It 's difficult to put into words exactly what visceral feeling I get from this song ( sure did a shitty job describing it in my original post ) , but imagine something like an insanely heavy barrage of guitars , drums and screaming that suddenly gives way to a psuedo-psychedelic midtempo doubled guitar part that moves and grooves until everything drops out except for the 3-note bassline . But then the screaming and the guitars and drums reenter in an monolithic , thundering crash and take on an entirely new dimension , like the feeling of the destructive force of a thousand destroying angels coming to burn all the proud and strong on this earth , finally pouding to its close , leaving a ponderous , evil little guitar riff to sweep up the wreckage .

Even if it has not , I consider and pretend Trust In You as one of the best songs on RFRG for me . <p> But people , come on ...

@@44115866 @4115866/ <p> It 's no secret that If you 're a one hit wonder , a severe and sudden drop-off in the size of your fan base is inevitable . But some bands manage to fade completely into obscurity despite having a significant period of popularity and a fan base that once took them seriously . In some cases , this even happens to bands who had more than one popular album . And furthermore , while a band like The Offspring is n't quite what you 'd call the most relevant , they 've at least maintained a sizable base of hardcore fans . Yet , this is n't the case for other groups . Here are some that I can think of : <p> Hoobastank Velvet Revolver Bush <p> I honestly do n't know one person that remains a fan of any of these bands despite them having success over an extended period of time . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 10-25-2012 , 01:03 PM <p> Smash Mouth <p> I looked them up randomly a couple weeks ago , out of curiosity : the only shows they seem to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-25-2012 , 01:35 PM <p> Smash Mouth.For that I would like to refer you to my last month 's top 5. http : **29;3172;TOOLONG <p> Actually I 've been a fan of them for a long time , especially they 're early punk stuff . Magic 's alright too , that album came out probably right after you last checked them . Check out Perfect Planet ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Cinl4XgGNpM ) . <p> I looked them up randomly a couple weeks ago , out of curiosity : the only shows they seem to play these days are like State Fairs.As far as I know they have n't really toured outside of the US for years now ... and it 's mainly fairs indeed . Though I would definitely travel a bit to see them play . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 10-25-2012 , 01:52 PM <p> I disagree with Bush being on this list , but otherwise solid choices . <p> I always tend to think of late 90s alternative bands like Tonic , Nine Days , Fastball , and Vertical Horizon . No one cares about those bands at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of bands that I guess you could call " post-grunge " who are also good choices for the list . Seven Mary Three ? Days of the New ?

No one cares about those bands at all anymore . <p> All good additions . But you 'd insist that Bush still has a respectable fan base ? I sure as hell have n't noticed . Bush seems to have a couple songs that you might still hear at a sports arena or jukebox , but I do n't know anyone that is actually into their whole discography and takes them seriously . I might be wrong though ... they were awfully successful at one time . 41125 @qwx451125 <p> 10-26-2012 , 02:38 AM <p> Eve 6 come to mind .

Running Away was a pretty good song , but The Reason was terrible . Also , Hoobastank was such a huge Incubus-wannabe , and I do n't think I ever noticed that when they were popular .

They 're pretty much becoming the Journey of the 90s . <p> I think their first album was one of the first albums that our generation understood better than our elders did . Music critics and older siblings made fun of us for listening to it , and now years later we 've revisited it and said " Hey , this album is actually really good !

Still , two songs ... unless there are others which I 'm not finding on Youtube , I still du n no if that counts . <p> Looking up Vertical Horizon reminded me of another one : Switchfoot . They were pretty big like ten years ago , with quite a few hits over a few albums . I actually kinda dug them - they had a few ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=O25SH4bb1Uc ) legit good songs ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CYxFEFklMPA ) . ( I 'm always amused when people get in Youtube fights over stupid shit . Like , it 's expected on a video that 's about gay marriage or abortion ... but when a fight thread breaks out due to someone hating a song , it 's just hilarious to read . ) <p> Third Eye Blind- do n't get me wrong , I absolutely love their first album and it was super important to me , but I have n't been able to get too into their new stuff . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past several years , however , and therefore do n't belong in this thread . I think I read that they were the #1 most requested band at college campuses . But I think that 's 100% due to nostalgia , and not because they 're still a really good band . They 're pretty much becoming the Journey of the 90s . <p> I got ta disagree . I actually think their first album was not that great , minus the last three songs which are fucking epic and straight-up amazing music . However , some of their more recent albums have been pretty high quality . I quite enjoy their album , Ursa Major . Like , I totally dig this song . ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=YDqzu36KnAk ) <p> Also , The Wallflowers , and that one is just sad , because they 're a damn good band . Really , really damn good .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was totally re-minded why I liked it so much . <p> I agree with you The Wallflowers are a damn good band . <p> What about the Gin Blossoms ? They had a couple of great songs . <p> Llamas <p> 10-27-2012 , 06:48 PM <p> I was going through my cds and I found my Switchfoot cd . I forgot I had it . Listened to it and I was totally re-minded why I liked it so much . Minus the religious lyrics ( I 'm not religious and find religious lyrics kinda annoying , but lyrics are so much less important for me than music itself ) , they are/were a really good band . Really some fantastic songs . <p> I agree with you The Wallflowers are a damn good band . Definitely , and I like Jakob Dylan 's solo work , too , but the Wallflowers were quite a bit better than him alone . <p> What about the Gin Blossoms ? They had a couple of annoying songs . <p> Fixed that for you ; ) I have a high school friend who loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a couple concerts ... they suck so , so much . 41142 @qwx451142 <p> 10-27-2012 , 06:53 PM <p> I 'm not religious either Llamas so I know what you mean . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 10-28-2012 , 03:27 AM <p> I got ta disagree .

I have n't heard many people say that their newest stuff is better than their first album , but I do love scattered moments of their third and fourth albums , particularly " Faster , " and " Ca n't Get Away " from Out of the Vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue is pretty good , just really disjointed , which makes sense given all of the tension going on in the band at that time . Out of the Vein has several good songs , but overall the album leaves me with a weird feeling and I almost always skip lots of tracks . Ursa Major is probably more solid overall than Out of the Vein , but it sounds like a different band to me , probably because it is one ... only two original members left . It also has a few too many smarmy and cheesy moments for me . <p> I guess I just like the first album because it came out during a big period of general music discovery for me , and it 's one of the only albums from that era that has aged well for me . It is sort of hard not to be sick of the shit-ton of singles from it , I do still appreciate that the guitar work is great throughout , the lyrics are sort of emblematic of its time period , and as you said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my 3eb music in my iTunes just now , I noticed another band that would be a perfect addition to this thread : Toad the Wet Sprocket .

Fucking horrible , piece of shit album . I do n't even know why the fuck I ever liked Walk on the Ocean . <p> Llamas <p> 10-28-2012 , 05:55 AM <p> Ha , I used to say that if you listened to the last four songs on their first album with a girl , it would highly increase the chances of sex .

There are a lot of songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major is good throughout . I agree about Blue - that 's by far their worst album . Very disjointed , and far too poppy/slicked-over . Out of the Vein is alright ... which songs on Ursa Major do you find cheesy , though ? I also did n't know that another member left the band . When Kevin left the band , I assumed they were finished for good ... especially with how bad Blue was . But they came back with a decent effort in Out of the Vein , and then I felt they really came back with Ursa Major . <p> I guess I just like the first album because it came out during a big period of general music discovery for me , and it 's one of the only albums from that era that has aged well for me . It is sort of hard not to be sick of the shit-ton of singles from it , I do still appreciate that the guitar work is great throughout , the lyrics are sort of emblematic of its time period , and as you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . I will always love the S/T album , due to it being one of my first like 6 albums and it coming out when I was just discovering music . Plus I agree it 's one of the few that has aged well for me . My first few albums were Alanis 's first two , Jewel Pieces of You , Cher Believe , Natalie Imbruglia Left of the Middle , Eve 6 , NSYNC , City of Angels soundtrack , Third Eye Blind , and Chumbawamba Tubthumper . Cher and NSYNC I only listen to nowadays for pure nostalgia , well aware of how terrible it is . Natalie and Jewel I can still appreciate ( their old stuff - new stuff sucks ) , but I hardly ever listen to them anymore . The old Eve 6 albums are great , but when they reunited , they 'd lost it . But I still love those first three albums . I do n't listen to that Chumbawamba album anymore , but it introduced me to them and they 've got INCREDIBLE stuff if you exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid , but I never listen to soundtracks anymore . Alanis and 3eb are the only two that really stuck for me , where I still willingly to this day listen to those albums and truly enjoy them , while also enjoying and appreciating their new stuff ... though Alanis is still one of my top artists and I anticipate every album . <p> As I was looking through my 3eb music in my iTunes just now , I noticed another band that would be a perfect addition to this thread : Toad the Wet Sprocket . I remember I liked that " Walk on the Ocean " song , and even though I ALWAYS hated that " All I Want " song ( not the Offspring song stfu ) , which was the only other one that anyone knew , for some ungodly reason I decided to get the whole album .

I only remember one song by them , and it was Hey Bulldog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Last Summer album , which I bought because of the Offspring ; ) Otherwise , I honestly did n't know that band at all . Were they really that popular ? <p> bighead384 <p> 10-28-2012 , 09:21 AM <p> I have a really bad impression of 3EB . First of all , the frontman acted like such a lame douche when I saw them at a DC radio festival that The Offspring played at . He kept saying all these typical hippie one-liners , like " unite as one " and shit like that . Me and my friend occasionally laugh about it . I did n't think they were all that great either . I do n't like the lyrics to that " I want something else " song . He 's bragging about doing lines of coke and it just rubs me the wrong way . I usually do n't care about others drug use , but it just seems weird in that particular song . <p> Llamas <p> 10-28-2012 , 02:03 PM <p> Steven Jenkins is a ridiculous douche . In 2002 , I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the openers ... they were awful . I think Jenkins was probably drunk or on something , and he was just a totally pompous dick who barely sung and left most of the singing to the audience - even in songs that were n't singles , and it was n't even THEIR show . Their song topics are also often uninteresting to me , but I 'm not a lyrics person usually . I do n't consider myself a big fan , I only bought their S/T album , would never pay to see them again ... but they write some solid songs . Good music . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 10-28-2012 , 02:14 PM <p> Was about to say more or less the same thing .

@@44115867 @4115867/ <p> I know people who believe that music simply has no place for politics . ( Bear with me , as it 's quite hard to do this opinion justice with articulacy , when it is not my own , but I am trying ... ) One of the reasons people have used to support this is that using the influence of music and the popularity of a particular musician to sway people 's opinions is just as contrived and assumingly brain dead in principle as a politician manipulating statistics and kissing babies to gain favour . They would argue that music should be about reaching out to people and moving them and not trying to make people think a certain thing or change anyone 's opinion . <p> I personally believe slightly different ; that music is about personal expression and message and everyones right to that , but in the sense of having the effect of stirring up like-minded people into standing together on a subject they believe in <p> Just thought it had the potential to be an interesting thread and wanted to know what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 11:23 AM <p> I wish more artists would do politics .

@@44115868 @4115868/ <p> I know there was already a thread about French bands before , but it did n't seem good enough to bump it . It always seems hard to find good rock bands in France ( and a lot of them tend to get successful for singing in English ! lol ) . When we try and think about bands , its hard . <p> And some bands were more like of my friends ' parents ' generation like : La Mano Negra LONG ... ( that I really like ) , they combined : rock , flamenco , ska , ran , salsa , reggae and african rhythms ... which was probably quite rare at the time ( 1987 ) . There songs were in French , English , Spanish , Arabic ... And the origins of the name were : La Mano Negra ( " The Black Hand " ) was an alleged anarchist organization in Spain . The Spanish police accused most of the Spanish anarchists of being part of the organization . The songs I think about the most are La Mala vida , King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=cnTRkKyYqoA ) My favorite album of theirs is " Putas fever " <p> Most people do n't know Mano Negra and have only heard of Manu Chao , the singer of that band , who went and did a solo career and seems to be very successful in england ( and always goes to the glastonbury festival ! lol ) . My favorite of his albums is " Clandestino " most of the songs are in spanish . <p> People always mention Noir Desir , LONG ... which was a good rock band , that I never listened to ( but my sister did ) and since , there was this bad stuff with the singer killing his wife ... so people do n't want to talk about them that much . anyway , I guess my favorite song of theirs is this one : Un jour en France : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6EKmYhFk42M It talks about the bad stuff in france , FN ( the extreme right ) so racism and other shit ...

But it 's not to lie about that many of the song are pretty easy . The Offspring 's a punk rock band , and in punk rock they use power chords which makes it pretty easy to play along with . <p> But they absolutely have other chords and stuff that they play , and some heavy intros , solos and other diverse riffs ( like The Noose , oh man that rocks ! ! ) which is really hard . I think everyone knows that many Offspring songs are easy to play , and that 's nothing to be ashamed over , because it 's punk rock ! All bands use power chord ( well , many ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band just because they use alot of power chord , absolutely not . I do n't know too much about this stuff , but it 's much used in heavy metal and so , and bands like Deep Purple , Black Sabbath , AC/DC , Metallica etc. are using it much ? <p> edit : <p> self esteem must be one of their easiest songs , definitely but , unless you 're a beginner , they 're mostly all easy and quick to learn <p> Self Esteem is one of their biggest hits , and that 's one of the easiest to play ? The simple are very often the best . : D <p> Gayman <p> 12-28-2008 , 07:06 PM <p> Well .... yeah ... like Free ? said , a song with no or very little palm muting would be best to start with ... <p> come out swinging <p> 12-28-2008 , 07:25 PM <p> Well .... yeah ... like Free ? said , a song with no or very little palm muting would be best to start with ... <p> This refers to All I WANT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says MAKES SENSE . : D:D <p> Szandi <p> 12-28-2008 , 11:25 PM <p> The kids are n't alright , Elders , Pretty fly , I like better playing , Dirty magic and Kick him when him down . but my favourite the Kick him when him down . <p> To play most of them all you need to know is power chords and palm muting .

Lead guitar is a bit more tricky , but still duable ( although it takes a bit more time to learn it ) . I knew what you meant in your post . <p> However , i did n't think about palm muting ( after seing other comments about MMA ) , maybe it could be a bit harder for a beginner ( i did n't have much problem with palm muting , i learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> randman21 <p> 12-29-2008 , 05:16 AM <p> Yeah , palm muting came very easy to me .

@@44115876 @4115876/ <p> I 've always been under the impression that the Offspring was anti-drug , but at the same time , certain things seem a bit confusing to me , like that clip of Ron smoking what appears to be a joint at the end of that homemade Mota video , and how Dexter seems to have a very apparently clear idea of what it feels like to get high , judging by the Mota lyrics . <p> Anyone know anything else about this ? <p> Cock Joke <p> 03-01-2008 , 01:33 PM <p> They do their drugs in private , I 'm sure .

I have to go now anyway ... have fun ! 41165 @qwx451165 <p> 01-01-2006 , 02:06 PM <p> As long as you have an intelligible reason to hate someone or something it 's understandable .

It 's way cute when more people do it . Because it 's actually true . <p> young greg <p> 01-01-2006 , 02:30 PM <p> I did n't read any other posts in this thread because I did n't feel like it , but I have something to say : <p> A bigot is a bigot is a bigot . We should see no differences between racists , sexists , elitists , or those who discriminate based upon sexual preference . A Nazi is no different than Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell. 41147 @qwx451147 <p> 01-01-2006 , 03:01 PM <p> A bigot is a bigot is a bigot . We should see no differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminate based upon sexual preference . A Nazi is no different than Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell . Wrong . A Nazi is a type of fascist that believes in a complicated and large dictatorial state . Pat Robertson is just a christian asshole . Calling him a fascist is a dangerous oversimplification . <p> young greg <p> 01-01-2006 , 03:31 PM <p> Wrong . A Nazi is a type of fascist that believes in a complicated and large dictatorial state .

Calling him a fascist is a dangerous oversimplification . <p> My statement referred to their bigotry , which does run common among them all , albeit in different forms ( but dangerous nevertheless ) . 41147 @qwx451147 <p> 01-01-2006 , 03:53 PM <p> My statement referred to their bigotry , which does run common among them all , albeit in different forms ( but dangerous nevertheless ) . And again , that does n't matter . Just because Nazis are racist , does not mean all racists are nazis . That is a stupid way to generalize . <p> Jakebert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny how people bitch about hating racists for believing in stereo-types , when they stereo-type all racists as being rednecks and white trash . <p> And again , that does n't matter . Just because Nazis are racist , does not mean all racists are nazis . That is a stupid way to generalize . <p> That 's not what I 'm saying , dude . Of course all racists are n't Nazis , just like all dogs are n't beagles . <p> What I 'm saying is that I hate the way some people denounce racists and sexists , yet they say nothing of those who attack homosexuals . Their selective nobility pisses me off . They need to realize that none of these forms of prejudice are acceptable . 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 01-01-2006 , 10:06 PM <p> I understand the point everyone was trying to make a page ago , and it 's valid , but : <p> you hate racists , racists hate blacks . where 's the difference ? <p> This is a very dangerous oversimplification of something that is anything BUT simple . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of the lives of a group of people ( which falls under the racists category , and ALL forms of racism , intentional or unintentional feed this " machine " , so to speak ) , and hating that very same institution . Power is something that must be taken into account in all of these situations . <p> Racism being as simple as " hating someone based on their race " died a LONG time ago . <p> I know you were all just trying to make a point to Amazed , and like I said , it was a valid point , but the two things are NOT THE SAME AT ALL . <p> Endymion <p> 01-01-2006 , 10:22 PM <p> =/ sorry johnny . <p> secks ? <p> Mota Boy <p> 01-01-2006 , 10:31 PM <p> Yeah , I 'm with Johnny . This whole " you ca n't hate racists " bent seems to me to just be an oversimplification . It 's one thing to hate people because of something like race - something over which they have no control , and hating someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can be anti-racist without being hypocritical , sweeping generalities aside . <p> http : **25;3272;TOOLONG ? comic=682 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 01-01-2006 , 10:44 PM <p> =/ sorry johnny . <p> secks ? <p> Yes , secks , and lots of it ! <p> And Mota ( I just remembered ; if I do n't know you well enough to call you that , now would be a good time to let me know ) : well said . <p> Mota Boy <p> 01-01-2006 , 11:02 PM <p> And Mota ( I just remembered ; if I do n't know you well enough to call you that , now would be a good time to let me know ) : well said .

So use whichever you prefer . <p> *grabs your hand and strolls into the sunset* <p> Haha , sweet ! And it 's nice to get that bit of romance after agreeing to secks Endy up . <p> it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm sure you 'd agree that killing people based on their ideologies is a deplorable suggestion . it 's not like allowing someone to randomly hate others causes those others harm , so long as they ca n't act against other people against their will . meaning ... random farmer acting racist = not a problem ( it 'd be nice if things were different , but they 're allowed to have their beliefs ) , politicians creating racist laws etc = problem . <p> True indeed . Very true . <p> BUT I feel that the reasons politicians attempt to create racist laws is BECAUSE of those random racists and acts of racism that we ignore so very often ( policies need beneficiaries , and policies are usually made in an attempt to gain political power , no ? ) . This is why that random farmer acting racist is a problem ; he enables that kind of shit . <p> I 'd argue that , while some may see overt expressions of racism as more dangerous , ignoring what seems like harmless racism is what leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what allows so many of us to just dismiss alarming facts ( like the lynch-like events in Jasper , Texas , in 1998 , and the fact that schools are more segregated now than they 've been since Brown v Board , and the obvious divide in life opportunities promoted by power structures ) , and still think that racism is n't a problem in the U.S. <p> So yes , killing those racists is definitely irksome , which is why I work to educate , and if that fails , I simply dismiss . 41175 @qwx451175 <p> 01-02-2006 , 06:12 AM <p> I do n't think Endy was making the point that racism should be ignored if it 's only the odd person , more that saying " I hate all racists and want to kill them all " is hypocritical in itself . Let 's not forget , most racism stems from two things - environment and ignorance . It 's a dangerous mix . That 's why education is a far more effective tool than " trying to kill ' em all . " 41176 @qwx451176 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post , but what I 'm saying is that the ignorance is indeed dangerous as you said , and the innocent connotation of the word " ignorance " has to be completely shattered for that very reason . <p> Amazed <p> 01-02-2006 , 11:27 AM <p> That 's exactly what I 'd want . It 's way cute when more people do it . Because it 's actually true . <p> Then go ahead and do it . I do n't give a fuck . Hate me all you want . <p> Sin Studly <p> 01-05-2006 , 07:25 AM <p> Wrong . A Nazi is a type of fascist that believes in a complicated and large dictatorial state . Pat Robertson is just a christian asshole . Calling him a fascist is a dangerous oversimplification . <p> Wrong . A Nazi is a National Socialist ; somebody who believes in some extent of state regulation or ownership in economy as well as somebody who believes in promoting nationalist ( or pan-racial or pan-religious ) unity amongst the populace . There is nothing to say a Nazi must necessarily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion within the intricate and varied beliefs of National Socialism . The only required aspects of National Socialist beliefs are Socialism and Nationalism . Yes , the third reich were National Socialists . They called for state control over vital and semi-vital industry , and had a program of promotion for pro-German and pro-Aryan unity . The only people identifying with Nazism who do n't qualify are a very small percentage of the various skinhead guttergangs , who are overwhelmingly anti-socialist , although most of them are pro-nationalisation of things like energy and phone services . <p> Claiming Nazism is the belief of only the violent guttergangs and the Third Reich is no different to claiming that communism is the belief of Stalinists alone . 41147 @qwx451147 <p> 01-05-2006 , 07:40 AM <p> That , and Hitler was well-known for his anti-socialism , and anti-socialist laws . <p> The name socialism in effect , seems to be chosen for the appeal it would have to the target class ( the masses , the biggest voting electorate , the vast majority of the population , the working class ) more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being said , there were aspects of Nazi Germany that were inspired from socialism and socialist thought . A comparison of Nazi Germany to the USSR or to the Paris Commune or whatever , would bring about severe differences , right down to everything from product distribution to pedagogic method . <p> SaiKYoU <p> 01-05-2006 , 07:51 AM <p> fascist people = brainless people <p> I do n't give a shit about hitler or those neo-nazi groups , but in my country we had a stupid fascist dictator ruler after the 1936-1939 civil war that the spanish republicans sadly lost That guy was a creepy stupid ultracatholic and racist idiot called Franco , and after the war , the democratic republic was exterminated , the freedom executed , and he rulled the country till the 70s , when he died and democracy started . With all of this , imagine how i feel when I meet that kind of people who say " Kill Afroamerican people " Also , about comunism , Stalin was n't a comunist , the only comunist i know was Lennin , and Lennin was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if i were i would be troskist and not stalinist ... Also , Xenophobism is for cowards : cool : <p> Sin Studly <p> 01-05-2006 , 07:59 AM <p> That , and Hitler was well-known for his anti-socialism , and anti-socialist laws . <p> Anti-communist . And the Reich were n't anti-communist , really , they simply used the Communists as a scapegoat , in much the same way they used Jews . In reality , they were socialists , they appropriated businesses for the State , etc. etc . Techinically , they were socialists , obviously they were nationalists ; hence , their beliefs were valid national socialist beliefs - that does n't mean they 're condoned by all National Socialists . <p> Oh , and SaiKYoU , Franco was the best thing that ever happened to Spain .

One bit which caught me was " White people want to kill us in many different ways while still making money " , " I saw my friend smoking a cigarette the other day they 're making money while he s killing himself " .

However " Out West " as we call it in the poorer neighbourhoods you have a lot more people smoking . Difference is Australia 's poorer neighbourhoods are n't full of blacks like in America , they are generally full of White Aussies and Arabs . ( Sydney anyway ) . So I know it is n't a case to deliberately kill of Black people but merely something which seems to appeal to the lower class communities . oh dude you idiot . Think about it . Overt marketing is illegal . But if they can make black people smoke it , then white people will .

The point the nigger made is pretty much the same as claiming a white drunk driver ( who gets into his car drunk without caring about the potential lives he may end ) is deliberately trying to exterminate the black race . Why not the white race ? Why not women , or men , or cripples ? <p> It 's not so much that ' whites smoke too ' as it is ' this crazy motherfucking nigger thinks that every time a black person dies it 's because of some International White Conspiracy ' . And everybody knows the Gentiles have nothing to do with that , yet he refuses to differentiate between kyke and aryan .

At this very moment I came up with one . <p> And the rain comes ( He realises how bad things are ) And the world is on my head ( Everything bad what he was speaking about in verses strikes him at the same time , he feels overburdened ) Crave the sun ( He wants things to become much better ) But I cant get out of bed ( But he does n't know how he can change anything , he realises that he is weak and powerless ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another newborn idea . There are two persons in song - the one who realises how tragic things are ( the singer ) and the other , who did n't notice that and with whom the first person is speaking .

How does it feel ? When you have it all ? - I think it means the same - do you feel okay when you 're having all you need for living - I mean you have material things like money , home , cars ... anything ! 2 . How can you live ? With nothing at all ? - I think that means - yes you have material things , but no real friends , no family or maybe you just do n't have soul , no feelings , no emotions , you are lost in the material world and the question is how can you live like that ! 3 . Where do you run ? Where do you go ? - I think that means what are you going to do now where and how you 're going to find your lost soul ? ! 4 . When the holes in your truth Are starting to show ? - That probably means you thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're getting things wrong and everything is fucked up ! 5 . And the rain comes And the world is on my head - these are the consequences of what was done ! 6 . Crave the sun But I cant get out of bed - it means you were thinking you 're going to reach the sun - high in the sky , but now you realized that you 're getting nowhere and the sun is so far away ! 7 . How can you take ? Without giving back ? - that means - you got your material world but you got ta pay somehow , so this is the reason your soul got lost ! 8 . How does it work ? When its really cracked ? - it means you got what you want but you were cheating and now things are going harder than you thought and it 's not working anymore ! 9 . How does it feel And no wonder Hearts and minds have been won - I ca n't understand this part - which hearts and minds have been won maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice for you ! 10 . How does it feel And I wonder How its all come undone - maybe it means something like in the begining things were going really nice and you thought everything was going to be fine but now everything is fucked up ! 11 . Want it You got it You 're sorry You bought it You 're sliding Want it You got it You 're sorry You bought it Ca n't hide it - it means you first got what you want than you 're sorry about it cause you lost your soul and you 're now sliding to the end of the line ! 12 . Tell me who do you see Cause you look a lot like me - I guess it 's a single person that thinks about life in third person and in the end realizes that it 's looking at his or her self and life and it says who do you see cause you look a lot like me - oh , fuck I am you and you are me ! So that was my vision for all the meanings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undone ... : ) <p> Gustavo <p> 07-30-2008 , 11:47 AM <p> 1 ) How does it feel when you have it all ? <p> a . When you have power/lot of belongings and so on b . When you have the world in your head , like the chorus . <p> As far as I could understand it 's like when everything is just fine in your life , you got everything you 've ever wanted . <p> 2 ) How can you take without giving back ? <p> Does it have to do with " twisting knives turning on to someone else " ? I mean , the way the world treats you reflect on how you treat it ? <p> I think it 's like , when you get help and you 're not helping . <p> 3 ) " And I wonder how it 's all come undone " <p> I 've actually never understood the meaning of come undone . : o <p> I think it is something related to someone who has never faced hard times and this person watches everything falling apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were tow persons in the song , too .

A request had been filed in 1994 by Robbie Fields , owner of Posh Boy Records who controlled rights to the album on which " Bloodstains " appeared , claiming that the Offspring had lifted a riff in their hit song " Come Out and Play " from " Bloodstains " and that he should be paid royalties for its use .

She came from the town of Rosemount , and would say it very much like " Roooowz-maaaahhhhnt " with the typical long , round O and the nasally ahhh . It was super adorable , haha . Very , very few people in that state actually throw around " oh dontcha know , yah der eh ! " unless they 're making fun . <p> For me , Chicago accents are the worst .

I'mpretty sure they do this on purpose , since it 's very distinctive . <p> You can probably find hundreds of similarities to Hammerhead breakdown chords ... seriously , did someone think The Offspring made the chords first to this date ? It 's 2008 and variations of new bar chords is tough times to find out . You make a punk song with bar chords and I 'll find you a song which you stealed . The point is , who gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it . Besides , I do n't like that Nirvana song at all . <p> I was going to say the same thing , It 's so true . <p> It 's not just the riff that makes a song either , Just because it 's the same rhythm does n't mean it 's alike at all . The drums , Bass , lyrics , Vocals , other effects or instruments ; they all come into play to make the song very , very individual . <p> Llamas <p> 05-05-2008 , 12:45 AM <p> After J.S. Bach and Mozart , no new music has been done . <p> Nah , Bach and Mozart were n't even the pioneers ! There were much better composers before them ! Bach sucked , anyway ! : ) But seriously , in the realm of such simplistic music ( structurally ) , the stuff bands like Offspring , Nirvana , MCR , and Sum 41 write has SO LITTLE to work with that things will always sound similar to something else . <p> In closing , the lyrics to a German pop-punk band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you remember me ?

All I Want/The End of the Line . They use exactly the same riff . <p> Oddly , the breakdown of Hammerhead reminded me of " Miss Murder . " Not that they sound anything alike whatsoever , but the structures are somewhat similar . The way that the screams start halfway through the breakdown , etc . I 'm sure there are a million songs that do that , but Miss Murder was just the one that instantly came to mind when I heard Hammerhead . <p> Sing the chorus to " have you ever " during the chorus of " dirty magic " . <p> Pull the shades razor blades you 're so tragic hate you so love you more so elastic things you say games you play dirty magic <p> some days my soul 's confined and out of mind sleep forever some days i 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the same melody . 41120 @qwx451120 <p> 05-05-2008 , 06:04 PM <p> At 2:38 into Hammerhead if it werent for a few snare strikes , the songs would be almost identicle .

The choruses quite similar in melody indeed ! <p> I know people always say that Self Esteem and Smells Like Teen Spirit have very similar riffs , which is totally true , but people always forget to mention Little Things by Bush ( http : //youtube.com/watch ? v=lfl4K2L811E ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All three songs are unbelievably good . <p> The difference between Hammerhead and Nirvana 's song is the second chord being played . Hammerhead goes from D to C to F to C. The nirvana song goes from D to B to F to B. Thus , the two are very similar . Smells like Teen Spirit and Self Esteem are n't though . <p> Never noticed the similarity between Dirty Magic and Have You Ever . Do n't hear the similarity between All I want and The End of the Line though . <p> nieh <p> 05-06-2008 , 06:37 AM <p> ps . The breakdown sounds like " Lounge Act " , not " Stay Away " ... <p> I du n no , the song he has linked in the first post has almost the exact same bassline as Hammerhead. 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 05-06-2008 , 09:44 AM <p> You do n't mean the riff at the beginning End of the Line , do you ? That opening riff sounds nothing like the riff at the beginning of All I Want ... can you specify where the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End of the Line and the verse riff in All I Want . It 's not that prominent in All I Want , but it 's there and it 's the same thing . <p> camilo andres <p> 05-06-2008 , 10:51 AM <p> Sounds similar , I did n't realize that until I read this thread . Do n't forget that the beginning of " Self Esteem " is almost like that from " Smells Like Teen Spirit " . <p> And Teen Spirit reminds me of Boston 's More Than a Feeling , and this one at the same time is so close to Kingsmen 's Louie Louie . Another similar song is De Musica Ligera by Soda Stereo . But nevermind , all songs souds simmilar because all their riffs are chord progressions .

I 'm pretty sure if you listened to them back to back , you would n't know when one ended and the other started , except for maybe a few times . It 's almost like one , giant song , just like the last . So in reality , they 've released pretty much a 2 hour song . <p> The worst part about it is you can actually hear parts of songs that were in the last album , almost completely unchanged and thrown into a new album . Pretty pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bono , and trying to make AvA like U2 . Everything 's so forced . He needs to go back to playing pop-punk , along with the other guitarist .

They have some decent melodies hidden in their songs , the problem is that they 're buried under an enormous amount of unneccesary production .

He wants something on the same level as U2 or Pink Floyd , but unfortunatly for him , Blink 182 was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angels and Airwaves is that everything they do reeks of effort .

This one really does n't . The melodies are basically the same from song to song , sounding pretty dull in the end .

I really liked " When Your Heart Stops Beating " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are one of those bands that I would n't say I 'm a fan of , but I ca n't really dislike them because they 're so bland and inoffensive that there 's nothing to hate . <p> EMehl6 <p> 10-25-2007 , 08:02 PM <p> How do you see them as bland ? They 're songs have a lot of different elements to them , and they do n't all sound the same , unlike another band lol . <p> Llamas <p> 10-25-2007 , 08:13 PM <p> Of Blink , AVA and +44 , my favorite is +44 . However , they 're pretty bland . All three bands are kinda bland , but +44 definitely is . They 're just a typical pop-punk band . Mark 's voice is good , but it 's indistinctive , and none of their songs do anything new . They 're just a very straight forward pop-punk band . That 's not a bad thing . I really do enjoy the album . However , I would n't buy their music or pay to see them , because they are nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> Everything they do has been done a million times before , and not in that R.E.M . style " putting a new spin on things we 've heard before " type of thing . <p> Vera <p> 10-26-2007 , 12:15 AM <p> Oh shit , I was under this impression Atom left the Offspring for an AWESOME band that I might actually enjoy listening to ! <p> Well , Everything 's Magic is an okay song , but nope , nothing amazing . Sounds kind of like a band I *might* like , were it just better with vocals . <p> The studio version of Everything 's magic was so bland that I could n't even comment on it but the live versions is just plain bad . The first album had it 's moments but overall is was pretty poor and I ca n't say I expect better from this album . 41127 @qwx451127 <p> 11-05-2007 , 09:27 AM <p> i just threw up a little <p> crrrN <p> 11-06-2007 , 05:28 PM <p> Omg , this just sucks . I ca n't believe Atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised " the best thing that is going to happen in rock music " or some lame crap he promised a few years back . <p> The only thing great to rock music that could happen by his hands , would be if he 'd quit AVA right now . <p> So i finally picked up I-Empire , and while its not spectacular , it is definitely better then what I expected . Call To Arms , Everything 's Magic , Secret Crowds , Star of Bethlehem and Rite of Spring are all solid tracks . The cover art is kind of silly , but its apparently by the guy who did a lot of the Star Wars art . Overall , it was a large improvement from their debut , and is quite possibly the best post-blink effort of any of the original members . <p> patoff10 <p> 11-11-2007 , 03:22 PM <p> The album have been n1 on iTunes ( USA ) since it starts <p> SuperKnux <p> 11-12-2007 , 01:09 PM <p> Hey um , could somebody upload " I-Empire " or repost a link to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me to get this record saying it 's great and all . But seeing as I got bored of the debut rather quickly , I 'd rather not spend my money on this release ( unless it really blows my mind ) . <p> So if one of you all could be so kind , can you upload the album for me ? It would be very much appreciated . <p> ive only heard the new song on kerrang but i like it , hopefully they can work a good set live now with the new album ! <p> SuperKnux <p> 11-13-2007 , 06:23 PM <p> Thanks a lot Tijs , really appreciate it . <p> This album ai n't that bad . I like it , but I doubt I 'll be buying it . Thanks again , man . <p> maddie <p> 11-16-2007 , 05:08 PM <p> i agree . i think this album is solid . i mean , they 're not trying to be like other bands ... doing something totally different . they even started a site to load podcasts and blogs so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a pretty awesome move . 41120 @qwx451120 <p> 11-17-2007 , 07:59 AM <p> Omg , this just sucks .

Every song on that album sounds exactly the same . Liek the whole housr of it is just one big song with no change in tempo , or melody , and it 's mostly whining about " daddy did n't love me " . They just should 've covered this song ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=GuTevbwE49A ) <p> jim109109 <p> 05-24-2008 , 07:38 PM <p> sum 41 tries something new with every album , they 're each different especially the newest album , which would be ok except for the whining and love songs and overall girlness of it <p> does this look infected sounded the most like the offspring , definitely half hour of power/all killer no filler sounded a bit like the offspring <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of power = their best albums does this look infected = 3rd best album 41151 @qwx451151 <p> 05-26-2008 , 07:57 AM <p> I voted Sum 41 , but I 'm ready to explain why ! : D When I was younger I new only some neo-punk bands and I meant that , that 's a real punk . : D I was a dick ! But I still think that Sum 41 sounds sometimes like the Offspring . I liked them before , but then they totally screwed up with Chucka I guess ? ! Anyway I hate them now and never will respect them as a band again ! : D Pennywise sounds awesome , but not like Offspring . They got their own style . Bad Religion the same . And Social Distortion ? If I 'm not wrong , their one of the reasons , why we 've got Offspring today ? ! : D <p> FrancoDaHui <p> 05-26-2008 , 08:29 AM <p> Bad Religion sounds like the Offspring ... or does The Offspring sound like Bad Religion ? <p> i think the offspring sound like bad religion <p> and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound a lot like something SHITTY the offspring would have done 41172 @qwx451172 <p> 05-26-2008 , 08:32 AM <p> I started this thread way back in ' 05 .

They both have a different sound of their music , examples : Bad Religion 's music is more hardcore and faster than The Offspring 's , and The Offspring 's music is more alternative rock/pop punk-ish than Bad Religion 's . That 's the difference between The Offspring and Bad Religion . <p> Forza <p> 05-26-2008 , 09:20 AM <p> looks like alex101 did , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have knack for reviving old threads . <p> ad8 <p> 05-26-2008 , 10:26 AM <p> Weird ... but not as epic as that valedictorian thread:D <p> ppronni <p> 05-26-2008 , 10:58 AM <p> Sum 41 sounds the closest to The Offspring ! <p> I think the same . Actually , my two favorite bands are Offs and Sum 41 . <p> BTW Sum 41 said that their album Does This Look Infected is mainly influenced by The Offspring . That 's why it 's my favorite one . <p> Other bands that sound like Offspring could be Sun Eats Hours , italians , and Millencolin 's ' Home from Home ' album . <p> Count Orlok <p> 05-27-2008 , 05:30 AM <p> I 'm not really a fan of SUM41 , but I admit they sound similar to The Offspring on some songs.It would n't be a surprise if they were inspired by The Offspring.But Offsprings way better than them:cool : ! <p> livininchaos <p> 05-27-2008 , 12:57 PM <p> Are you kidding ?

" Disgusted by these words , Phalaris ordered its horn sound system to be tested on Perillos himself . When Perillos entered , he was immediately locked in , and the fire was set , so that Phalaris could hear the sound of his screams . Before Perillos could die , Phalaris opened the door and took him away . Perillos believed he would receive a reward for his invention ; instead , after freeing him from the bull , Phalaris threw him from the top of a hill , killing him . Phalaris himself is said to have been killed in the brazen bull when he was overthrown by Telemachus , the ancestor of Theron . <p> I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The body has defense mechanisms to cope with such things . Passing out , for example . A skilled torturer , of course , would be able to master his art and presumably keep you in maximum effective agony . I would expect the most effective methods would involve deceptively mild techniques employed incessantly . Much like the way you troll this place , actually . <p> The worst thing I can imagine is not bad things happening to me but to those I care about . Though if you subjected me to enough physical pain I 'm sure my opinion could temporarily be altered . In fact , the worst thing you could probably do would be to torture me , all the while telling me that you would stop if I simply asked you nicely to go kill someone I loved instead . Because I expect most people could be broken to that point fairly quickly , and then imagine what living with that would feel like . <p> nieh <p> 05-16-2013 , 06:31 PM <p> Leng Tch'e In this form of execution , the condemned person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body over an extended period of time . The process involved tying the person to be executed to a wooden frame , usually in a public place . The flesh was then cut from the body in multiple slices in a process that was not specified in detail in Chinese law and therefore most likely varied . In later times , opium was sometimes administered either as an act of mercy or as a way of preventing fainting . The punishment worked on three levels : as a form of public humiliation , as a slow and lingering death , and as a punishment after death . <p> WebDudette <p> 05-16-2013 , 09:04 PM <p> waterboarding , actual drowning , and anything that exploits my ( realtively mild ) claustrophobia is a good start . <p> bighead384 <p> 05-17-2013 , 12:36 PM <p> The KGB already solved this .

Post them here . <p> 1- eyes stabbed with a long needle 2- both hands cut off 3- lit on fire <p> These are terrible in the way that they are not very good methods of torture . Of course , all of these hurt a lot , but there are worse things . <p> 1 . Eyes do n't have that much sensory for pain . Yes it will hurt , but the worst part of this is that you will end up blind . Very impractical for the rest of your life , but not very painful in comparison . <p> 2 . Yes this will hurt , but it 's like the first one ; this is very impractical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding you will be fine . It wo n't hurt more than a normal surgery . <p> 3 .

Almost every torture mentioned here would either cause the victim to pass out ( from shock , hypoxia , overheating , etc. ) , or the sheer physical damage would kill the nerves fairly quickly , or the torture is n't really that bad to begin with ( oh , you 're giving me opium before my torture ? How diabolical ! ) <p> Anyways , aside from platypus stings , which is literally and inarguably the most painful thing possible for a human being to ever experience , ever , there 's Irukanji syndrome which comes in at a distant second with a similar pain-receptor overdrive .

They are then fed gruel with copious amounts of pepper and salt . It 's up to them whether they eat it or not . <p> 6 - The Press Cell The victim is placed in a cell with fifteen to twenty " goats " ( a type of " trustee " who rely on the guards for protection from the other prisoners .

I can leave it home , when I think it 's gon na get me in trouble , or I can rent it out , when I do n't need it . But now and then I go to a party , get drunk , and the next morning I ca n't for the life of me remember what I did with it . First I looked around my apartment , and I could n't find it . So I called up the place where the party was , they had n't seen it either . I asked them to check the medicine cabinet ' cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes But not this time . So I told them if it pops up to let me know . I called a few people who were at the party , but they were no help either . I was starting to get desperate . I really do n't like being without my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of a man , and I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak . After a few hours of searching the house , and calling everyone I could think of , I was starting to get very depressed , so I went to the Kiev , and ate breakfast . Then , as I walked down Second Avenue towards St. Mark 's Place , where all those people sell used books and other junk on the street , I saw my penis lying on a blanket next to a broken toaster oven . Some guy was selling it . I had to buy it off him . He wanted twenty-two bucks , but I talked him down to seventeen . I took it home , washed it off , and put it back on . I was happy again . Complete . People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached , but I do n't know .

@@44115907 @4115907/ <p> I Hate Adult Swim : An Essay By a TV Nerd . By Jakebert , PH.D in Nerdology . <p> I Hate Adult Swim , and Obnoxious Adult Swim Fans . <p> When Adult Swim was first coming out , I could n't have been more excited . I 'm a huge animation buff , and hearing that one of my favorite cartoons of all time was going to be one of the centers of the line up , I was estatic . But , as you 've probably already figured out , I was incredibly disappointed in the end . The reason I got as disappointed as I was and still am is that something like Adult Swim , but with quality , is needed badly . Television animation for adults is a dying art form , at least in terms of quality and legitimacy . <p> The whole thing with them re-airing classic-but-canceled shows like Futurama and Mission Hill is something I really like . I want to state that right away , just so I can acknowledge that I do give it some credit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since prime-time animation was essentially dead , with the exceptions of King of the Hill and the Simpsons , and there was n't room for anything other than reality shows and CSI ripoffs . Giving these shows a chance to reach their target audience is a great thing . <p> The rest of Adult Swim , mainly almost all of the original programming with the exception of the Venture Bros. and Aqua Teen ( 40% of the time . The 60% left is shit ) , are generally shit . The Bob Clampett Show was a really , really good idea , but unfortunatly got canceled because the dumb fanbase that Adult Swim is catering to did n't like it . <p> Do n't get me wrong : some of the original shows that were aired when it first come out were decent . They were underdeveloped , but because of the experimentation they were doing , it was okay for the time being . The problem is that a fanbase of incredibly retarded 14 year olds started clamoring for the dumb " lolz random humor " , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no plots , horrible animation , bad voice acting , and writing that seems like it could come from a 14 year girl 's Myspace . It 's just garbage , and most of the time , it makes my head hurt . <p> Case in point : Assy McGee . I remember for the week before it first aired , everyone I knew was talking about how great this was going to be . " It 's a talking ass ! " " OMGZTALKINGASS ! " And I 'll admit , it got my attention even though the whole premise seems like something me and my friends would have loved in 6th grade , the time that we all thought The Man Show was hilarious . <p> But , that week , I watched it out of curiosity despite the lame premise . And , well , I was correct in doubitng it . The show was essentially comprised of one joke : the premise itself . That 's it . They basically based an entire series on one fucking joke . It 's like " Yes , Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what most of the Adult Swim original shows are now . They take one joke and turn it into an entire premise , and a lot of times that one joke was n't even really that funny to begin with . <p> The other thing that I absolutely hate about Adult Swim is the abundance of " random " humor . For those who 'd like an example of what that is : you know that slightly obese kid you went to school with who walked around saying words like " cheese " , " Captain Crunch ! " , and " pickles " in a really dumb , loud voice ? That 's random humor right there . And it 's not funny unless it 's pulled off completely right , and usually it 's not . Adult Swim is that fat guy who thinks that " random for the sake of random " is inherently hilarious no matter what the context . <p> To me , that 's incredibly lazy writing . Maybe I 'm picky since I 'm a TV nerd who wants to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a pancake monster fighting off an invasion of tupperware aliens is lazy as fuck . There 's no real gag there , it 's just random words that sound " random " thrown together into a scene that is n't even remotely coherent . There 's no depth or intelligence in the joke writing , there 's just things that sound " wacky " when put together . That does n't take effort or talent to write , it takes about 30 seconds of looking around a room for random objects and putting them together . <p> The argument I always get when I point that out is that " cartoons are n't supposed to have depth , they 're supposed to be funny drawings that do funny things " . No , you 're wrong . The best cartoons all have some sort of depth . The Simpsons , King of the Hill , Futurama , Mission Hill , and even the original Looney Tunes/Merry Melodies cartoons all have a lot of wit and subtle commentary and satire in there , and a lot of layered humor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there 's more there than just " omgz wacky random drawings ! ! " . With Adult Swim , even the good shows , you ca n't watch them over and over again like you can with King of the Hill because once the initial response to seeing whatever random , outragous thing they 're doing wears off , it loses the impact it has . <p> Finally , I hate obnoxious Adult Swim fans who think that it 's the greatest thing on TV . They 're even worse than pretentious Seinfeld fans . ( I like Seinfeld , but let 's face it , some of the fans are asses ) . Just about every day , I can expect some person coming up to me and quoting the newest lines from Robot Chicken or Squidbillies , and then get pissed when I do n't even crack a smile at whatever lame joke they 're telling me . These people are the already mentioned fat kid who thinks that saying the word cheese is funny . That alone should be proof enough that Adult Swim fans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 09:34 AM <p> One of the best " reviews " I 've ever read , but I ca n't say if I agree or disagree cause we do n't have that channel .. <p> But however I do love the shows I have downloaded that are airing there like sealab , robot chicken and of course the one and only wonderful Aqua teen hunger force .. 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 03-03-2007 , 09:36 AM <p> Cheese broccoli toes meat pie water pancakes ! LOLOLOLOLOL ! <p> Yeah , as usual I love your posts so much that I have nothing to add but " hallelujah " and " Amen !

I missed the first 5 minutes ( meaning there were only 5 minutes left in the show , as expected ) , but there was a bush baby with laser vision tied to a chair ... on tv , while a shark in a robe laid down watching it .

Do you pull down your underwear but not your pants ? No . Do you pull down both your underwear and your pants ?

Personally I joined the forum/began visiting the website regularly about a year after the Americana-release . I used a 56k modem to download a few Realplayer live-videos and the video of Noodles ' Bloodstains solo . I think it took about 90 minutes to download a 5 mb Self Esteem live video which I saw over and over again . Then all the fuzz about the upcoming CO1 album began and I read all the news and rumours of the album . I remember there were rumours about the track list and the album being titled " Top of the Hill " or something ? It was really exciting because it was my first time looking forward to an album being released . However , I do n't remember what people on the forum were saying about the songs when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online community at that time . I also remember when the video for OP came out and practically all the guys in my class saw it before I did . I actually miss those times when you could n't just download a song or video or see it on Youtube whenever you wanted to . There was something very special about seeing an Offspring video on MTV or hearing it on the radio . Offspring was quite popular here in Denmark in the Americana and CO1-era . <p> Britpunk <p> 05-07-2012 , 04:24 PM <p> I remember a handful of the track names leaked first and I thought ' Pretty Fly ' as a song title was a bit weird - i had no idea what the term meant so in my head I envisioned some weird abstract Jane 's Addiction type vibe . <p> I ca n't remember whether I first heard the wav through theoffspring.net , delirium 's site , or oxy 's , but while i thought it was a bit different , i liked it . I seem to recall most people back on the chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dexter 's experimentation , what with Me and My Old Lady , I Choose and Do n't Pick It Up etc. so something a bit left-field was only a minor surprise for me . I certainly do n't recall a weird or major backlash , but then the internet was n't so crammed full of self-entitled cry babies back then . <p> I also think the band had already had their ' sell out ' tag worn out after Smash went so huge and they signed to columbia - so those of us who were around had weathered all that BS and were mostly just keen to hear new stuff .

I love when they slow down for the ' every face looks familiar ' part , of course I usually love when any song does a similar thing . I enjoy the music more and Davey 's vocals are just so much better . Not only do they sound better but they flow better.The Offspring 's also sounds cleaner and more produced and in this occasion I do n't like that .

@@44115930 @4115930/ <p> This song is a tough one to interpret . To be honest , I 've never really focused on the lyrics before but now I did . Here 's what comes to my mind : <p> I suppose it 's about losing a person the speaker used to love ( and maybe still loves ) , presumably his ex-girlfriend . <p> Now I could lie by your side All serrated for you <p> - This part could mean he 's watching her die . He could lie by her side but he knows it would n't do any good to her . It can only hurt her even more , twisting the " serrated " knife . <p> Down below cancer grows Weeping waits inside you too <p> - Well , pretty much self-explanatory if we take it all literally . It 's only getting worse and making her want to cry in helplessness . <p> Now all our rage begs a stage It 's a waste of time though <p> - Though they 're both angry , showing their rage wo n't help in any way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has turned <p> - Perhaps he 's trying to say she 's dealing with it without showing emotions , taking it " like a man " . I 'm not sure about the " lonely road " part , he might be saying her " lonely path " after they broke up has turned in some other direction where she can seek consolation from someone else . <p> And you faded there <p> - I think it 's like saying you got lost there , or you were trapped . <p> They pretend to care Vultures waiting <p> - They only seem to care , in fact waiting for your death . You are surrounded by " vultures " . They 're only looking for some kind of profit . It 's only him that actually cares . <p> If you do n't like me , certify me <p> - However , he is still not sure if she has any feelings left for him . He 's looking for some kind of confirmation . <p> The chorus part in this case would be actually his ex-girlfriend speaking : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to know if she still " likes " him . Or maybe does n't want to admit it . <p> - I can imagine a new day has come and they 're both quiet now and do n't really want to say anything as they perfectly know there 's a " loaded gun " pointed at her head , meaning it 's already so bad that she can die any moment . Anyway , there 's really nothing else they could talk about right now . <p> All the while in denial It 's too late for me to change <p> - I 'd say he 's blaming himself now for " denying " his real feelings , not letting them out . But obviously it 's too late to do anything . <p> And you were unchained Nothing more had changed I could fake it <p> - She was left to her own devices , she probably wanted that , but nothing had really changed besides the fact of her " being unchained " . He could pretend it 's otherwise though . <p> If you still hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's looking for some kind of declaration . I 'm not sure what is really meant by " confiscate " but I can tell his feelings are pretty intense at this point . Maybe what he intended to say was something along the lines of " if you still hate me , then just kill me or something " . <p> Yeah I do n't know Yeah I wo n't go Yeah Save it I 'm okay <p> - Same answer . <p> Yeah I wont play <p> - She 's tired of everything , fed up with all these " games " . <p> Yeah Go away <p> - She wants him to leave . <p> Yeah Save it I 'm okay <p> She 's still lying to herself ( and him ) , pretending she 's okay . <p> Well , it does n't have to be a girlfriend , it can be anyone he cares about . They must have parted their ways at some point , whatever the reason was , but even now that the end is near they ca n't accept their own mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dexter ever reads this , he will laugh his head off ... but that would be my best shot anyway . What do you guys think ? <p> Hombre <p> 04-24-2010 , 03:57 AM <p> disclaimer07 , good job ! It 's pretty interesting to read your interpretation of Dexter 's lyrics.May be you should try Crossroads ? <p> disclaimer07 <p> 04-24-2010 , 06:26 AM <p> disclaimer07 , good job ! It 's pretty interesting to read your interpretation of Dexter 's lyrics.May be you should try Crossroads ? <p> Well , thanks . I could try Crossroads even though my interpretation would be quite straightforward . <p> But now I am starting to see a connection between Denial , Revisited and Vultures which makes me really think the speaker is talking about his ( ex- ) girlfriend . There may be a reason why Vultures follows Denial on the album . <p> holland25 <p> 04-24-2010 , 06:27 AM <p> I 've always had a feeling that those two songs were somehow connected . <p> dr.vanessa <p> 04-24-2010 , 07:52 AM <p> hey discy ! i really like ur interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an actual death .. cancer could be any ' ' rotten ' ' part of ppl 's soul rage , our selfcentred side that sometimes becomes the reason that sbd is left alone being unable to comunicate with the other person and the peace in their ( any kind of ) relationship is under the ' ' shadow ' ' of a loaded gun so that looks like a ' ' death ' ' .. the worst ' ' death ' ' is when sbd feels dead-alive or when a situation/relationship ' ' dies ' ' cause of the ' ' cancer ' ' in our soul .. Maybe my thought sucks though : o <p> disclaimer07 <p> 04-24-2010 , 09:30 AM <p> Assuming that Vultures is a follow-up to Denial , I 'd guess something really traumatic must have happened to bring them back together . Now she can see that he is her real friend . The " vultures " only want to take advantage of her . <p> Down below cancer grows <p> Well , you 'll have to forgive me for being so shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it is , it 's slowly killing her . <p> dr.vanessa <p> 04-24-2010 , 09:36 AM <p> Down below cancer grows <p> Well , you 'll have to forgive me for being so shallow but I take that one literally . I mean , whatever it is , it 's slowly killing her . <p> I think this song is either about the break up of a relationship or a death . <p> 1 . Break up of relationship interpretation " Cancer " is a metaphor for something destructive that is growing inside the other person ; maybe their personality is changing . The speaker could ignore it but really feel cut-up about it ( " serrated " ) . He 's angry about it , they 've argued in the past , but now he realises it 's a waste of time . <p> " And your style seems worthwhile / But this lonely road has turned " - this is the line that makes it complicated for me . Maybe the other person 's personality has changed , but they 're still a good ( worthwhile ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more ? But that does n't fit with the earlier interpretation of " cancer " , that it 's something destructive . <p> The " vultures " are the other person 's new friends that are n't real friends , they just want to take advantage . They do n't like the speaker but he does n't care ; they can " certify " / judge him if they want . The " loaded gun " is a reference to the speaker and the new friends arguing . <p> In the end the speaker and the other person split up ; the other person is " unchained " . The speaker could have carried on pretending ( " fake it " ) so the other person hates him for not trying . But he says he 's not going to play along . <p> 2 . Death interpretation The other person is dying - not necessarily from cancer , that could still be a metaphor . But the speaker sees them dying and it hurts him ( " serrated " ) . <p> " Now all our rage begs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage in grieving ( I think - along with denial , acceptance etc ) and they wish they could skip it . <p> " And your style seems worthwhile but this lonely road has turned " A good person is dying but it 's too late , the person 's turned a corner &amp; is n't going to get better . <p> " Vultures " are the people who only pretend to care ; maybe they stand to get something ( inheritance ? ) out of the person who is dying . <p> After the other person is dead ( " unchained " ) , the speaker could pretend to live a normal life ( " fake it " ) . ( The following lines from " if you still hate me " to " I wo n't go " I ca n't make fit with this interpretation . ) <p> Finally the speaker is bitter and angry about the whole thing and is tells people who are concerned / pretend to be concerned not to bother , he 's okay .

Bees play a major role in pollinating fruit trees and flower blossoms .

@@44115937 @4115937/ <p> This thread is meant to be directed towards the boys in Offspring to hear the fans . The response to Dexter on piano playing " Gone Away " has been huge . It 's a cool twist to the song and it holds a special place in my heart . Having my mom pass away in early ' 09 , then hearing Dexter play that song the way he did on my birthday in Irvine , CA ( June 5th,2009 ) , it made me love Offspring even more . So I am hoping that there are others out there who have heard that version of the song , and would like to see it on the next album .

@@44115944 @4115944/ <p> I 've never really heard a remastered album that truly impressed me . I always find myself having to go out of my way to search for any discernible difference ( other than noticing that it is usually slightly louder ) . I 've read reviews of remastered albums , and I do n't think I 've once read a positive commentary on " what a great job they did " with remastering some classic album . <p> What I 'm wondering is : Are remastered records basically just a scam that convinces people to buy a product that is practically identical to one that they already own ? I sometimes wonder : Just how much time and effort do record companies really put in to remastering an older album ? Are they really digging deep and making intricate changes to the sound levels ? I 've always felt that they do very little to affect the listening experience . <p> In fact , it seems like the only thing the audio engineers who remaster albums CAN seem to do is make minor adjustment that allows the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I feel like the lame extras they include ( like stickers or a downloadable band-themed background desktop ) are just there to " beef up " an essentially meatless product . Also , it seems that records are remastered much more often these days , although I 'm not sure . However , I would guess so since recording technology is so much more advanced and convenient in current times . <p> Have you ever heard a remastered album that blew you away ? I know I have n't . <p> RageAndLov <p> 05-12-2013 , 08:56 PM <p> Like you say , remastered albums are usually just louder in order to compete with today 's loudness war . I 've never heard a remastered album that was different than the original one , except in volume . <p> bighead384 <p> 05-12-2013 , 09:04 PM <p> What an album cover says : Newly Remastered ! What I see : Louder By an Almost Unnoticeable Difference <p> Haha . That could be a meme-ish thing . <p> Rooster <p> 05-13-2013 , 12:13 AM <p> I mostly agree with Bighead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is completely unneccessary . And overpriced too , as in the case of Nirvana 's Nevermind super deluxe edition - nobody wants to pay freaking 90 for 5 discs of the same songs over and over ( now they dropped the price of the set to about 50 in stores here , and it 's still too much ) . <p> There are rare exceptions , however . For example , Mad Season : Above ( deluxe ) sounds brilliant , in fact it has lost little dynamic range compared to the original 1995 release ( they both average at 9 db , which is excellent for these times ) . The sound is crisp , quiet when it needs to be and punches you in the face when Layne let 's loose with his vocals . You really do notice that the mastering has been done properly this time . The bonus material is also great , as the set also contains a DVD with two full concerts with additional bonus footage . I have n't got the original release so I bought this re-release instead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , true , but I 'm happy it was done as it should be . <p> Jakebert <p> 05-13-2013 , 12:00 PM <p> It really depends on the record . For example , The Beatles remasters that came out in 2009 were 100% necessary because the original CDs that came out in the 1980s were insanely awful , to the point where you could n't hear basslines in certain songs . But the reissues sound completely beautiful , full , and lush and as cheesy as this will sound , the first time I heard them I felt like I was hearing these records for the first time . I remember reading all these reviews talking about how energetic and raw the pre-Rubber Soul albums were but never understanding it until I heard the reissues . The My Bloody Valentine remaster was similar . <p> Really it all depends on how and when the record was produced in the first place . An album recorded on analogue and released on vinyl , then merely transferred from vinyl to CD in the 80s is bound to sound like shit because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that stuff is oftentimes really necessary in order to not sound thin and tinny . But if you 're talking an album like Nevermind that was already really slickly produced and always sounded big and beefy , then yeah , a remaster is pointless . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 05-13-2013 , 01:21 PM <p> Going to have to ( boringly ) echo the sentiment that it depends on the record ; a lot of the time it just seems to make things louder , but for some records like Banner Pilot 's Resignation day it went from almost an unsustainable mess to becoming an excellent album . <p> Retard <p> 05-13-2013 , 02:49 PM <p> Around the same time as those Beatles remasters , the Beastie Boys remastered their 4 classic albums . They sound fucking great . Especially Paul 's Boutique , you can hear almost every sample distinctly unless they muffled them on purpose . That and those came with a second disc full of b-sides and remixes , and the packaging got beefed up a little . <p> Ninty Man <p> 05-13-2013 , 07:26 PM <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to compete with today 's loudness war . I 've never heard a remastered album that was different than the original one , except in volume . <p> Ozzy Osbourne remasters totally rules . <p> Rooster <p> 08-01-2013 , 01:14 AM <p> Bump because Nirvana 's In Utero is also getting ( several ) remastered editions . <p> Looks like they have n't learned anything from Nevermind 20th anniversary editions , of which I still see the very same " super deluxe " copy every time I visit a certain music store ( now it costs half as much as it did when they released it , but it 's still overpriced ) . In Utero 's super deluxe edition will apparently cost roughly the same as the nevermind one ( pun intended ) did , around 90 , having one disc less ( 3 CD + DVD this time ) . And of course it 's gon na be compressed to death again . Even 2CD deluxe edition is still overpriced around 25 , I bought Soundgarden 's Classic Album Selection box set ( 5 albums ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remastered , they were just repackaged original albums so the music had n't lost any dynamic range ) . <p> Bottom line is , I 'm a huge Nirvana fan , but I 'm leaning towards not buying any of these copies . It 's not because of " that 's exactly what Kurt would have hated " mentality , because nobody is in the position of telling what he would want or not . It 's because the price and overcompression do n't make these editions worth buying . I 'm gon na stick with my original copy of the album ( and the vinyl rip of original Albini mixes of In Utero , which have been circulating around the web ) <p> Rooster <p> 09-30-2013 , 01:09 PM <p> ... And of course it 's gon na be compressed to death again ... <p> I stand corrected . The deluxe edition is out now , and as unbelievable as it may sound , they 've done right . This new edition actually has BETTER dynamic range than the original album . We can thank Steve Albini for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are brilliant - both the original remastered album and the 2013 mix of it ( also done by Albini ) sound fantastic , and the new mix is in places quite a lot different than the original mix , sometimes I even prefer a new version of a song to the original one . All in all , this reissue is probably the best sounding version of In Utero out there ( that very likely goes for the vinyl version as well , the album has been split onto two 12 inch 45 rpm black vinyls for better quality , and the 3rd 33 rpm vinyl contains the bonus tracks ) . <p> So , two great deluxe editions this year : Mad Season 's Above and now Nirvana 's In Utero . But while Above deluxe sounded just as good as the original album , In Utero actually sounds even better than its original counterpart . Did n't see this coming at all . <p> Mega Man <p> 10-03-2013 , 01:20 PM <p> I 'm actually in favor with the way they went about the In Utero reissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there 's Super Deluxe , Deluxe , and just the original album remastered . It seems like projects like these were mainly aimed at hardcore fans due to the repetitive nature ( casual fans probably would n't care about different mixes of the same song ) . There 's also brand new mixes for the entire album , in addition to the original . I 'm glad they included the original , untampered . <p> For me , I 've normally bought the " remastered " or whatever edition when I was buying the album for the first time ( that 's normally the most popular at the record store ) . Very rarely would I go out of my way to buy an album again . Also , new additions seem like a big no-no ; like when the bass and drum parts for Blizzard of Ozz were completely rerecorded . In instances like those , it just does n't seem genuine ( they soon put out a more proper " remastered " version ) . <p> In terms of The Offspring , I found Ignition to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't getting much from Smash .

His fans , on the other hand , truly believe that Tool writes the deepest , most intricate music EVER in the entire world , and that if you do n't like Tool , it 's because Maynard 's lyrics are too deep and amazing for you to comprehend .

There 's a difference , but for some reason , I ca n't exactly put my finger on it for now . <p> My answer is Brandon Boyd , which should come as no surprise to anyone here that knows me . Pretentiousness of musicians does n't bother me much , because a lot of indie-art-bands are pretentious as hell , but they pull it off by at least being smart . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real reason to be , and Brandon Boyd is the best example of that ever . The dude tries so hard to sound smart by using big words in his music/speech , but if you pay attention , most of the time he uses them in contexts which make absolutely no sense , mispronounces them , or makes up completely new words by having no idea what he 's trying to say . 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 01-02-2009 , 12:32 PM <p> The thing that kills me about everyone jumping on Bono for being pretentious is that ... well , at least he 's actually trying to do some good in the world .

You should hate Bono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminating 3rd world debt is about as progressive as you can get . <p> Besides , exaggerating what he 's trying to accomplish also furthers his cause and gains more attention to it .

Fred Durst 's public persona is n't very impressive , but face to face he 's a nice guy , very loyal and nice to his fans ( or at least was in 99/00 when I last met him ) <p> The biggest and most hollow douchebag I 've seen in person or somewhat in person anyway would be ( a little bit ) Billie Joe Armstrong ( although the rest of the band is super cool ) , Axl Rose , but the grand daddy of pretentiousness is Jon Davis from Korn . I 've seen the dude ignore members of their opening band , and have his thug answer for him . <p> Which is sad because he tries to come off as this sad lonely kid who got picked on and bullied and shit , yet he 's the most arrogant rockstarish person I 've ever encountered who could n't give a shit about his fans . I knew some dude who was a VJ for and interviewed them who was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the entire band , and ( this was a festival ) had it tattood on like 10 minute later , and Jon Davis could n't be bothered to sign his leg ... he approached him ( the dude - davis was walking around with an oxygen tank on wheels ) and showed him his fresh tats of like Munkey 's and Fieldy 's autograph , and with out even ANSWERING Davis shook his head and walked away . <p> Also Tom DeLonge deserves special mention , for the mere fact that when their show was over , by the time I walked around the stage , and went backstage they were already all on the tour bus and had left . Did n't really impress me , although later I had heard they had a cold or something , but still ... <p> Llamas <p> 01-10-2009 , 04:08 AM <p> Jonathon Davis has always seemed like a dick to me .

Tattoos in and of themselves really devide people , and I would grant you that argument , if Korn was n't a super protattoo band , like limp bizkit is as well . <p> I 've always actually liked both those bands , so Korn was a super disappointment for me , but the biggest assholes of all have to be the guys from placebo . <p> I was standing backstage at a festival talking to my cusin and some other guy was standing there with us , who was a photo reporter , and some dick head walks up to cuts in my word and goes : " Ok , so the band came out of their dressing room now , they are gon na sit down , wait a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and get their autographs , but no pictures " .. <p> and I 'm like " dude , I 'm talking to my cusin here , and WHO THE HELL are you ?

Come on , a lot of stuff is similar . 41158 @qwx451158 <p> 03-18-2008 , 06:42 AM <p> Haha , that 's great . It 's some special way of ripping off . : D <p> What about Half-Truism and Helena guys ? : D <p> mrconeman <p> 03-18-2008 , 06:48 AM <p> Are you guys all completely tone deaf or something ? <p> They have a slightly similar phrasing , but the actual melodies - the note choice , is completely different , which along with the tempo , is why they clash so bad it almost hurt my head when the video played them together . <p> Amiralanal <p> 03-18-2008 , 02:23 PM <p> Not a ripoff . <p> nameless <p> 03-18-2008 , 03:33 PM <p> i did n't  really see any problem with it . i can see why some people may have issues with it but i think the judgements are harsh ! <p> Jack-UK <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RobinoZombie <p> 03-18-2008 , 03:43 PM <p> the phrasing might be somewhat similar , and the guys stole it of the beatles , so i would n't really put too much energy into it . <p> Flash12354 <p> 03-18-2008 , 03:56 PM <p> First of all , let me state my obvious bias being a My Chemical Romance fan . Songs are always going to sound similar , but to criticize a band for having a vague similarity to another band is ridiculous . Especially with Why Do n't you Get A job , since the chorus and other sections are straight from Ob la di Ob la da as a Beatles tribute . <p> My Chemical Romance is n't an " emo " band ... They are musicians just as the the Offspring are . Just because they have become popular and are selling platinum records does n't meant that they are just a new " fad " or the latest trend . Remember that the Offspring were just like this in their Ignition through Americana days . <p> Think of Led Zeppelin . They were widely popular in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to be fan , since they 're no longer mainstream . I am kind of a music snob , so I know how it feels to not want to listen to music just because everyone else is , but criticizing a band for a song having a similar feel is ridiculous . Listen to music such as reggae , and ALL the songs are going to sound the same . They both fall under a " punk " genre , and there are going to be similarities . The chord structure is different , the key is different , the lyrics are different , and the feel of the chorus is different . What the hell is the problem ? 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 03-18-2008 , 04:10 PM <p> This is just as stupid as those a little while ago who started to whine that Half-Truism sounded like Helena ; its all so fucking dumb . <p> malibu43 <p> 03-18-2008 , 04:27 PM <p> Are you guys all completely tone deaf or something ? <p> They have a slightly similar phrasing , but the actual melodies - the note choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is why they clash so bad it almost hurt my head when the video played them together . <p> Jesus H. Mahogony Q. Christ . <p> I was thinking the exact same thing . There is absolutly nothing there that would make me think that the MCR song was influenced anymore by WDYGAJ than it was any other " pop " song from the last 80 years . <p> Wow . mrconeman , lilmiss and company hit the nail on the head . Everyone else should shoot themselves for even listening to MCR in the first place . <p> Ryder1234 <p> 03-18-2008 , 06:55 PM <p> Wow . mrconeman , lilmiss and company hit the nail on the head . Everyone else should shoot themselves for even listening to MCR in the first place . <p> but wait ... not me , right ! ? <p> Dexterina <p> 03-19-2008 , 01:55 AM <p> I think that someone needs to clearly state that mcr are possibly one of the worst bands of all fucking time . <p> Bangbang <p> 03-19-2008 , 06:15 AM <p> I think that someone needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands of all fucking time . <p> I concur . : D <p> holland25 <p> 03-19-2008 , 06:34 AM <p> I think that someone needs to clearly state that mcr are possibly one of the worst bands of all fucking time . <p> Agreed . <p> I hate threads like this one ... <p> Cock Joke <p> 03-19-2008 , 08:03 AM <p> Listen to " Ob-La-Di , Ob-La-Da " from The Beatles first . That 's where it all began . <p> I do n't even see how they should be accused of " ripping off " that song . Yes , there 's a resemblance , but " ripping off " is an incredibly idiotic statement in that particular case . <p> dffpunk <p> 03-19-2008 , 09:05 AM <p> I do n't even see how they should be accused of " ripping off " that song . Yes , there 's a resemblance , but " ripping off " is an incredibly idiotic statement in that particular case . <p> Well , I never mentioned the word " ripping off " .... I think as somebody already said here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 03-19-2008 , 09:55 AM <p> MCR and Offspring can be good at the same time , in the same universe , and the world will not end . <p> Are you for sure ? I mean ... I 'd hate to find out the hard way . <p> Ryder1234 <p> 03-19-2008 , 10:52 AM <p> No , they 're not . This is just turning into a bunch of lame " my favorite band is better than your favorite band " petty bullshit , and it 's got to stop . i do n't  think that offspring is better than mcr in reality , just to me <p> MCR and Offspring can be good at the same time , in the same universe , and the world will not end . Indeed , it will not affect a damn thing.yeah , they 're just a band , not , like hitler or somthing. they just suck in some of our minds <p> Llamas <p> 03-19-2008 , 07:55 PM <p> Are you guys all completely tone deaf or something ? <p> They have a slightly similar phrasing , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which along with the tempo , is why they clash so bad it almost hurt my head when the video played them together . <p> God damn exactly . <p> Also , why do people seem so hellbent on making ties between the Offspring and MCR ? ? Half-Truism sounds NOTHING like Helena . Teenagers sounds NOTHING like WDYGAJ . Similar song structure in the first , similar phrasing in the second ; both of which have been done millions of times in other songs long before the Offspring or MCR were bands . These are not ripoffs . Go listen to " Dani California " by RHCP and " Mary Jane 's Last Dance " by Tom Petty .... or " Girlfriend " by Avril Lavigne and " I Wan na be Your Boyfriend " by the Rubinoos . <p> Gaberelli <p> 04-09-2008 , 09:32 PM <p> That teenager song as actualy pretty decent in my opinion . Does not sound like Why Do n't You Get A Job . <p> Also , I think I 'm one of the few people to have noticed this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americana . It 's pretty uncanny , you should give it a listen . <p> EDIT : here 's the link to the theme song , since it could be difficult to track down if you were n't familiar with the site . And I should also note that the entire theme song does n't sound like Americana , just a recurring part .. You 'll know it when you hear it http : **35;4488;TOOLONG <p> Vera <p> 04-11-2008 , 02:33 AM <p> As much as I would love to call MCR unoriginal and members of the Rip Off Club , the songs do n't sound anything alike . <p> And to the MCR fan who said MCR is n't ' emo ' - LOL ! Okay then . ; <p> findout5 <p> 04-12-2008 , 05:32 AM <p> a ) They do n't sound alike ! b ) I do n't like MCR , so I 'm not " covering it up " for them ! c ) Whoever made that video should probably be aware of a Beatles song titled Obladi oblada or whatever it 's called ... maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 04-12-2008 , 08:35 AM <p> It does n't bear any resemblance to Get a Job . <p> Get a Job is very similar to Ob la di Ob la da by the Beatles , also similar to Cecilia by Simon and Garfunkel . <p> Cock Joke <p> 04-12-2008 , 09:43 AM <p> EDIT : here 's the link to the theme song , since it could be difficult to track down if you were n't familiar with the site . And I should also note that the entire theme song does n't sound like Americana , just a recurring part .. You 'll know it when you hear it http : **35;4525;TOOLONG <p> Hmm . Like a sped up version or something . <p> yelloweyeyes <p> 04-12-2008 , 02:29 PM <p> Yeah , well the chorus of " Why do n't you get a Job " borrows from The Beatles ' " Ob-la-di , Ob-la-da " ..... <p> The chord progression is the same on the songs , but I see that more as " borrowing " than stealing . The theme is a bit similar , but again , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rock songs , and you are going to find some that sound alike . I remember reading that Tom Petty was cool about it , anyway . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 04-15-2008 , 10:48 PM <p> My God ... how could that guy have POSSIBLY thought that godawful recording of those two songs played together IMPROVED his case ? <p> Also , it 's a very , very basic type of melodic arrangement . If you programmed a robot to write songs based on general musicality , about half of the songs would sound like Obladi-Oblada/WDYGAJ ? /Teenagers . <p> Omni <p> 04-17-2008 , 11:57 PM <p> RHCP/Tom Petty not so much , but the STP riff sounds nearly identical to the Danzig riff . <p> tylercosgrove1989 <p> 05-11-2008 , 06:34 PM <p> Haha , that 's great . It 's some special way of ripping off . : D <p> What about Half-Truism and Helena guys ? : D <p> aha ! Now sir , I just want to tell you that you are a smart one . I noticed the similarities between Half-Truism and Helena the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the thing that sounds the most alike . Do I think the Offspring ripped off MCR ? No , but I also do n't think MCR ripped off the Offspring . I think that sometimes bands make songs that partly sound like other songs in music history but that 's just common . Does n't  mean the band literally was like ... " Damn ... I have no more ideas . Hey Bryar , make yourself useful and put in that Offspring album so we can rip it off " <p> OffspringHead <p> 05-11-2008 , 08:15 PM <p> Wow . That 's retarded . They sound nothing alike and it 's a typical opening for any rock/punk song . <p> MarcNitschke <p> 05-12-2008 , 04:03 AM <p> man guy , you have to stop things like this .... music is such an " old " thing , so there is nearly no way you can write a chord progression or a melody that no one else has come up with ...... it is just not possible ... so having a similar song does n't make you a thief ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real similarity ? <p> Pearl Jam - World Wide Suicide : riff after the chorus Incubus - A Kiss to Send Us Off : main riff <p> Aion <p> 05-12-2008 , 03:11 PM <p> mmm .... i 'll give them the benefit of the doubt ... =P anyway it has sort of a similarity <p> OffspringHead <p> 05-12-2008 , 03:14 PM <p> man guy , you have to stop things like this .... music is such an " old " thing , so there is nearly no way you can write a chord progression or a melody that no one else has come up with ...... it is just not possible ... so having a similar song does n't make you a thief ... <p> That 's why there 's a lot of Deathcore and Technical Death Metal coming out nowadays because of how technical and different it is.

@@44115955 @4115955/ <p> This may be the most interesting debate you can come up with when it comes to 2 American rock bands . 2 interesting facts about these bands : <p> 1 . These are 2 of the most , if not the 2 most , influential American rock bands of all time . 2 . These bands toured together 2 years ago . <p> I did n't catch them on that tour , but from what I heard , at least at the D.C. show , KISS was the opening act , and they rocked the house like they usually , do . They got the crowd into it , and they wore them down . Apparently , lots of people went home early , and Aerosmith ended up playing at a half-empty stadium , because they could n't deliver the goods the way KISS did . At least that 's what I 've been hearing about the D.C. show . <p> Anyway . I prefer Aerosmith .

@@44115958 @4115958/ <p> what a bogus scam .. Weenie roast tickets came out 2 days ago and the lawn tickets are already sold out ... i check craigslist and stubhub and people are selling them for well over the original value ... I 'm a huge Offspring fan but I honestly can not justify buying off these f*ckers on craigslist just trying to make some money .. I understand if things sell out they cant sell anymore but to have people overselling them on other websites is just ridiculous to me. my only hope is as we get closer to the date some people will get desperate and me and my buddies can pick up some tickets . such a burrrnnnN ! ! ! <p> randman21 <p> 04-07-2012 , 06:11 PM <p> I think re-selling tickets for more than face value is prohibited on CL . Maybe if you report them enough times , they 'll repost them at a fair price . Post the link and I 'll report as well . <p> Mustardgas <p> 04-07-2012 , 06:18 PM <p> trust me its like online piracy .. so many people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean have you gone to stubhub and typed in weenie roast 2012. tickets normally are going for 60 bucks they are selling them 120 a pop . same thing with craigslist . I know i 'm just complaining but i just needed to vent i guess ... <p> but as the saying goes do n't  hate the playa hate the game <p> mrconeman <p> 04-07-2012 , 06:22 PM <p> Yeah ticket scalping is pretty much impossible to stamp out completely . They 'll probably start tying your ticket to your I 'd or something , if they have n't already in some places . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 04-07-2012 , 06:51 PM <p> Anybody who scalps tickets for more than its face value is scum . <p> Lord Phidias <p> 04-07-2012 , 09:05 PM <p> I just bought yesterday reselled tickets to see Radiohead , I 'm giving those to my gf as a first anniversary present , because she loves them . I struggled for 3 weeks to get those , because the tickets were sold out and after a long research , I found many people reselling their tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the event , so I just paid 200 extra pesos ( 18 usd ) for the original price ( 90 usd each , fucking expensive present ... ) , I 'm very satisfied ! There were also people reselling tickets for more than twice the original value , which is a fucking abuse , it is banned here , if the police catches people doing it it 's prison . So try looking everyday for tickets , everywhere , I heard twitter is a good place to find people willing to sell you tickets for the original price , so do n't give up ! <p> Llamas <p> 04-08-2012 , 05:45 AM <p> Scalpers really are the scum of the earth . What 's sick is how downloaders are being targeted and attacked for " stealing " files online , while comparatively little is being done to prevent scalping . How often is the internet patrolled for scalpers to sue ? And the reason it 's like this is because there 's zero morality involved ; it 's all about whether or not they 're making their money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't really care . The only time scalping is targeted is when people get free tickets and try to sell them for below face value - which is the only time scalping SHOULD N'T be under attack . 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 04-08-2012 , 02:06 PM <p> I disagree . When I get free tickets I ca n't use , I give them away . <p> I do the same , but sometimes people insist on paying me anyway . I think it 's a bit of a grey area ; I think it can be a little scummy , but I did just go 4 months without a job , and I likely would have done something like that because it 'd have been almost ridiculous not to . 41118 @qwx451118 <p> 04-10-2012 , 06:29 AM <p> My friend usually buys more than one ticket for herself for opera and before the show starts she gives the ticket for free to a handsome guy ( if there is one ) who waits outside of the opera house so she can meet someone with similar tastes in music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> samseby <p> 04-10-2012 , 08:34 AM <p> Yeah , the world is a bad place ; ) <p> KickHimWhenHe'sDown <p> 04-13-2012 , 09:31 AM <p> ' t is a shame 41159 @qwx451159 <p> 04-19-2012 , 05:28 PM <p> Seriously , fuck all of you whiners .

If in fact someone does it 's their fault and not the fault of those trying to make some money ... like it or not . <p> Edit : Not quite on topic but even better question is : Are some ticket prices in general justified ? And how much is actually in it for the bands themeselves and how much money is for the management , the agencies , the promoters and the like ?

Always speculating on shit they know diddly squat about . If someone does a painting of a dark , tragic scene , it DOES NOT necessarily mean that the artist is depressed and suffering emotionally . I know that when I write , compose ( ooh snob alert ! ) , paint or draw , very few things are intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionally . Usually I try to make something that everyone can find their own meaning in , which Dexter said he did over and over in interview about the new album . What makes you think Gone Away was any different ? <p> On the rare occasion that I do something tied to something emotional for me , people NEVER interpret what I 'm saying in the way that I feel I " said " it . Things can be metaphorical , they can be literal , they could only share a piece of the story etc . <p> Gone Away could be about anything to anybody . For all we know , Dexter could have been writing about his first ever game system finally giving out on him ( oh you know that gamers get depressed when a system they love breaks or wears out to the point of nonfunctionality ) or his dog could have died or he could have dropped his cone of his favorite ever ice cream that he hardly gets because you can only get it in sweden and how often can you fly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be something he knew everyone could relate to on some level , because we 've all lost something we loved ( whether spouse or ice cream cone ) . <p> You all have all this wild theory that has absolutely no basis in fact ! Jesus christ ! <p> But when death to a certain person is being presented as truth and someone tries to tell the real truth , but get silented , what do you expect ? <p> Leaving flowers on your grave Show that I still care <p> Do people in the USA inter their game systems ? <p> It 's obviously about a death of a close person . It 's written in the way everybody can relate . <p> +1 <p> KyleW <p> 07-29-2009 , 07:07 AM <p> No two people will take the same meaning from this song or , in fact , any song unless the artist discloses what they were thinking when they wrote it .

I guess it 's true for Gone Away though . The song is not exactly mysterious . <p> ( by the way , your joke abut game system really made me laugh . I know exactly what to do next time my boyfriend 's computer crashes now : D ) <p> But ( warning : I 'm going to talk about the eels again ) when E. wrote his biography where he explained some songs he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interesting to understand some of the lyrics that were mysterious to me and I was glad to know the explanation . I do n't like these songs more or less ( this is impossible anyway ) but now I have a better understanding of the lyrics ... and it helps me relate if I need to . <p> The main difference is that he chose to explain it and talked about what the album was about when Dexter Holland chose not to . In that case , private life is more important than curiosity . 
@@44115960 @4115960/ <p> After a long night of listening to Days Go By , I have begun to notice that Dirty Magic is awfully similar to Have You Ever . Especially the chorus .

In fact , I totally do n't mind when a band " sounds like themselfs " . Actually , it 's got to do with something I 'd been thinking some time ago .

LONG ... <p> Fun fact , in an interview with Dotmusic from 2000 Noodles said the following about " Vultures " : " ' Vultures ' is another of my favourite songs on this record , and strangely it 's a lot slower than the kind of song I normally like . Parts of this were written back when we wrote ' Ignition ' the band 's second album , released in 1992 . For me , this song is about somebody who thinks he 's losing his mind in a relationship - if things are n't going well , he thinks he 's going crazy . I know I 've been in relationships where I 've been thinking : ' Is it me ? Am I just totally crazy ?

I do think the ' new ' TSOL had every right to have that name at least till Ron quitted concidering he wrote most of the music ( though jack was responsible for the lyrics ) . Besides Jack basically gave the name away . ( Ironically Joe was apperantly an asshole when the band wanted their name back in 1999 ) . <p> Oh and there are actually no recordings of the band without any members of the original since Mike Roche only quit right after the last album ( Strange Love ) was recorded . ( And Ron slightly before that ) . 
@@44115966 @4115966/ <p> I 've always liked Rancid 's bass work , but otherwise I find basslines in punk music to be pretty boring .

Blink just never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and on , but I would have a very long post . There are the few songs I will post . I bet you never heard of them . <p> RageAndLov <p> 11-03-2009 , 01:46 PM <p> I wo n't even bother to argue about this . The bandmembers themselves know they aren'y punk . I hope that you someday will discover real punk , and then you will laugh at how ignorant you were a couple years ago to think that Blink actually was punk . <p> Raku <p> 11-03-2009 , 02:13 PM <p> I wo n't even bother to argue about this . The bandmembers themselves know they aren'y punk . I love how you are not even listening to the songs . You do n't know shit about punk rock . You do n't even bother to realize that genre 's adapt with the time change . Also just to add they did call themselves punks . The Descendants and screeching weasels inspired them to do songs . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=whWtCmg9sHU <p> I hope that you someday will discover real punk , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago to think that Blink actually was punk . Yeah , well I hope you learn to research your shit before you open your mouth and speak stupidity . Just so you know music changes over time . Nirvana laid out grunge music and now we have new bands being called grunge bands . Why do you think there are many levels of metal ? It adapts with change ... <p> Also , if Blink is n't punk than why the hell are they in a movie called 1994 ABOUT PUNK MUSIC <p> http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iGzt7CHBeeQ <p> However , I think you 're too slow to watch the whole thing .

This includes posting private e-mails and PMs without their permission . This includes the band . Do n't  discuss their private information . <p> So the offence has two elements : <p> - Discussion - Private information <p> One of these elements is lacking . <p> The religion of a band member is definitely private information but we are not discussing it per se as nobody here knows the facts . <p> Considering this , it is speculation more than a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule . If you consider it as a disciplinary rule , a rule that can lead to a sanction , which is the case ( ask RonWelty for more informations ) , it is a fundamental principle that the interpretation must be strict . <p> That means that you ca n't blame someone for doing something that is not exactly prohibited , so in our case having discussion about the private information of the band . <p> Which means that by discussing something that we do n't know for a fact , we are not breaking any rule : <p> we do n't give any private or personnal information as nobody knows .

Lyrically , I think it 's one of their best efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional song format : and " Boot Stamping on a Human Face Forever " is a perfect example of that : it may be a slower song , but it 's one of my favorite tracks from the band . <p> Least favorite : well , i do n't actually think it 's their worst ( which is probably like New America or something ) but i 'm not really a fan of Recipe For Hate . It 's got a couple decent tracks ( ie , American Jesus ) but as a whole , it really did n't " click " with me. 41125 @qwx451125 <p> 09-08-2010 , 01:59 PM <p> Yeah , my favorites are the same as yours , Lamas . Stranger Than Fiction , No Control and New Maps of Hell . New Maps , in my opinion , was better than Empire . Empire had some really great songs on it , but it 's a tight race between the two with New Maps coming out just a little ahead . <p> My least favorite , despite having their signature song on it , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and The Gray Race , but I did like No Substance . I like " Sowing the Seeds of a Utopia " and " The Voracious March Of Godliness " . I can understand people complaints about it , but I still dig some of the tunes on their , unlike Gray Race or New America . 41152 @qwx451152 <p> 09-08-2010 , 02:32 PM <p> Least favorite : well , i do n't actually think it 's their worst ( which is probably like New America or something ) but i 'm not really a fan of Recipe For Hate . It 's got a couple decent tracks ( ie , American Jesus ) but as a whole , it really did n't " click " with me . <p> This is actually kind of funny . The reason I never got into Bad Religion is because my neighbor lent me this cd and told me it was their best and I fell asleep listening to it and gave it back to him . <p> Huh . <p> dffpunk <p> 09-08-2010 , 03:42 PM <p> Recipe For Hate might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " is one of the least interesting songs they ever did imho ) but it has some of their best work ( i.e. Skyscraper is pure brilliance ) . Still this might be my least favorite BR album . My most favorite might be No Substance , it 's a really underrated album and has a lot of underappreciated songs , mainly music-wise , lyrically they have better stuff . Funny thing is , Recipe For Hate and No Substance are those albums which might have the most " unusual-for-bad-religion " tracks . So I guess I like all other albums equally . ( not counting Into The Unknown , no one knows they ever released that abomination : D ) <p> And my least favorite ? Most likely The Gray Race and/or anything without Brett , which I 'm not a fan of . Sure , The Gray Race has some great tracks ( including " A Walk " and " Punk Rock Song " ) , but with Brett not in it , I kinda find it boring . And for No Substance and The New America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 09-08-2010 , 04:35 PM <p> And my least favorite ? Most likely The Gray Race and/or anything without Brett , which I 'm not a fan of .

It was my least favorite of the few albums I 'd heard before , but now that I 've heard them all , I really do n't think The New America is bad . <p> Supa <p> 09-10-2010 , 08:24 AM <p> I pretty much like everything from Recipe For Hate onwards . Before that , everything else is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for Into The Unknown , I really liked it , but it sounded nothing like the rest of their catalog , I think . <p> And their S/T is absolutely awful . <p> ad8 <p> 09-10-2010 , 12:45 PM <p> My Least favourite BR album would be their Self-titled , I guess . <p> It is way harder to decide on a favourite album , but I think No Control just did it as an album . There are many really marvellous songs on many albums , but No Control is just a flawless album , Sanity and The World Wo n't Stop Without You being the only songs I tend to occasionally skip . But then again , it has songs like No Control , You , I Want To Conquer The World , It Must Look Pretty Appealing and I Want Something More that I am just lacking words for to describe the amount of admiration I have for them . <p> dffpunk <p> 09-10-2010 , 06:20 PM <p> Imho , if No Control would not have " The World Wo n't Stop Without You " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 09-10-2010 , 06:50 PM <p> I pretty much like everything from Recipe For Hate onwards . Before that , everything else is just average punk to me , nothing really stands out . Except for Into The Unknown , I really liked it , but it sounded nothing like the rest of their catalog , I think . <p> And their S/T is absolutely awful . <p> Their self titled is like every punk album of the era , with no sound quality , but has The Bad Religion Song , which I find awesome . <p> And ... well ... Into the Unknown is something like ... Creed to grunge ... yes , that should explain my feeling to that record . <p> I LOVE New America , I think even that is kinda poppy , and has some bad songs- well , specifically I love my computer is a bad song- I think is the more honest Bad Religion album in a while , and it has a good production . Is a shame fans constantly prays for Recipe for Hate , which I dislike . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no control , which I find kinda overrated as an album . Suffer is definitely not that good , I mean , is pretty much the same over and over , except for suffer , 1000 more fools and do what you want . <p> against the grain for ME is their top in the hardcore era , anesthesia , modern man , entropy ... <p> The New Brett era is ... sometimes great , sometimes meh. it has the worst bad religion songs since into the unknown- the lie , you do n't belong , beyond electronic dreams , lost pilgrim- but has great moments as well . Bad religion will be always my second favorite band ... XD <p> Homer <p> 09-10-2010 , 07:29 PM <p> The best Bad Religion album is Against The Grain . <p> That is all . <p> Supa <p> 09-10-2010 , 09:54 PM <p> Forgot to say my favorite is probably New Maps Of Hell . <p> ThunderPX <p> 09-11-2010 , 08:20 AM <p> Empire Strikes First is horribly overrated .

( note : the only albums I dislike by BR are the bottom three on this list . I like every other album by them . ) <p> Weirdly , I think maybe Process might even be my overall favorite . Not sure why , maybe memories I associate with the time that record came out or something . But it 's awesome , right mix of old-fashioned BR buzz-saw guitars and the Atlantic-era monster melodies , but with something fresh at the time too . <p> Both No Substance and The New America rock , anyone who says differently can choke on a phallus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stranger Than Fiction , and Brett was just bitching about the former for ad hominem reasons . <p> Suffer obviously gets honorable " we 're not worthy ! " mention . <p> Hell , True North is fucking rad . I love about 80% of New Maps Of Hell , too . Empire 's great musically , the lyrics are all just way too specific and cliche " not mai Presidentz ! " as everything around ' 04 was . And Bad Religion 's usually better than stooping to that , they 're more broad themes than pinpoint first-year-college-kid rage . <p> The EPs all rock . No Control and Againt The Grain destroy . Recipe For Hate is all creative and weird country-folk-y and great . <p> It 's only " bad " in the sense that you rooster-blowers were n't into it . Every track on that album totally kills , you 're just too trupunx to be caught saying anything other than " keyboardz r ghey " . <p> dorkrockcorkrod <p> 07-30-2014 , 04:35 PM <p> There are plenty of proggy bands I like that use keyboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind immediately - but " Into the Unknown " mostly just bored me . They are n't good at progressive rock in my opinion , they 're good at punk . They mostly made that album as a reaction to the admittedly idiotic violence that was occuring in the hardcore/punk scene at that time because they did n't want to be associated with all that . It 's the same reason Ian McKaye started Fugazi , essentially . <p> Also , I will always think of " The New America " as obnoxious , and " No Substance " as uninspired and boring ( aside from the awesome opening track , " Hear It " ) . I think their other albums range from good to great , though . <p> Eskimo <p> 08-01-2014 , 02:56 AM <p> Again : trupunx toolbag . Both those albums have some of the best individual songs they 've ever written . Monster choruses like a motherfucker , uhh , yo .

I thought both were fun and easy . <p> AwesomeAvril <p> 05-28-2007 , 09:50 AM <p> In September 2005 , after seeing Offspring ( Noodles ) 5 times I was inspired learn guitar . I just started taking guitar lessons where I got my bachelors degree years ago ( www.ccm.uc.edu ) . The first year the teacher spent I had used a book and all I learned were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a teacher that is a grad student instead of a professor . We threw out the book so to speak and started with what I wanted to learn to play --- Dirty Magic on Acoustic ( like on the Greatest Hits bonus ) . After that we went to Gone Away . A couple of weeks ago we started on Pay the Man . My last lesson until fall was Saturday and I think I know enough that when the lessons start again in September , I should have Pay the Man down . Of course I do n't  play them as well as The Offspring but it has been fun to learn . <p> One of the biggest problems that I have is with rhythm . Vol32 Hal Leonard Guitar The Offspring Guitar Tab book has a CD with software ( Amazing Slow Downer ) that slows down the songs so that you can learn them . Ive been able to play Gone Away at about 90-95% of the tempo with few mistakes . The software is a limited version that will only play with the songs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of Amazing Slow Downer software so I can practice any song because I would like to learn some other Offspring songs along with some Evanescence and Papa Roach songs . The software is from Roni music ( http : //www.ronimusic.com/ ) . <p> Well , if it really is this early in your playing , I suggest learning some basic first position stuff before you move on to bar chords . Even though Offspring songs are easy , it sounds like you 're just starting out ; and you got ta learn the basics before you try to play straight-up power chords . <p> Steve-O <p> 05-30-2007 , 05:04 AM <p> Practise your power chords , you 'll get better over time . <p> Franka <p> 05-31-2007 , 12:39 AM <p> Thanks very much guys I 'll see what I 'll do . <p> I 'm a she btw xD 41131 @qwx451131 <p> 05-31-2007 , 06:11 PM <p> most of the kids here are probably playing these off tabs , so if I were you i 'd pick your favorite song , because your teacher will probably teach you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as easy as possible for you . <p> SMASH0390 <p> 05-31-2007 , 06:32 PM <p> do n't limit yourself . shoot high for whatever offspring song you really like and your teacher will help you .

@@44115978 @4115978/ <p> Actually it 's not as simple as it might appear . Sure Noodles is the lead guitarist , and takes most of the solos , but he 's also a really sloppy player . Watch any live version of TKAA , I 'm sorry , but the dude basically ca n't play that solo .

At least every time that I 've heard . <p> So do you want a more advanced solo played sloppily , or a simple solo played cleanly ? I 'm not really saying Noodles is sloppy EVERY time either before anyone freaks out , but he definitely does n't hit the notes like on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else they can play like outside of the Offspring ?

However they 're probably the most technically perfect guitarists in the world , I 'd never call them sloppy for changing a song , because they play changes , not miss notes . <p> Sara MZK <p> 07-05-2012 , 01:00 PM <p> Mrconeman is absolutely right . It 's also worthwhile to note that whilst Noodles does play the bulk of The Offspring 's solos , there 's lots of little lead sections peppered about in many Offspring songs , and most of these are actually played by Dexter . Such as the eastern lead riff in " Come Out And Play " , the lead during the main riff of " Genocide " , and the main lead melody in " The Kids Are n't Alright " , as well playing a small amount of actual solos himself . Noodles actually plays rhythm a lot behind Dexter 's leads . <p> Noodles is definitely more sloppy , though this could just be in the live setting , where he moves a lot , and also jumps around . Contrast that with Dexter , who always seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he also does n't move very much , even when he 's not singing . Dexter never sounds sloppy live , but that could be because of things I 've just mentioned . <p> And yep , to compare them with the likes of Michael Romeo , Joe Satriani , John Petrucci and the like would be entirely unfair . Dexter and Noodles play punk rock , and there 's definitely room for sloppiness in that genre , so it 's not a problem at all . I guess whether you prefer Noodles or Dexter comes down to whether you prefer the high energy intensity but sloppy playing that Noodles provides , or the more solid , clean precision of Dexter 's playing . I love Noodles , but I have to say , I think Dexter is underrated as a guitar player . I do n't think I 've ever heard him screw his playing up live . : ) <p> dffpunk <p> 07-05-2012 , 03:59 PM <p> The thing with Noodles ' solos live is imho that he 's not really much TRYING to play them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe also the 3-beer ritual makes for the sloppiness itself ( yeah , you can say 3 beers is a little , but I have been in a band and I know what I 'm talking about ) .

Because Noodles and Dexter have an Endorsement with them . <p> Oh yeah , just because you see noodles with his talman live , it does n't mean that 's the only guitar he uses when recording the albums. yes , he uses gibsons in the studio too . <p> and noodles is n't going to drop his endorsement deal with ibanez just because you think gibsons are better . <p> punkriOt <p> 07-15-2005 , 06:40 AM <p> I like Ibanez guitars , my bass is an ibanez : D <p> So yeah , i do n't have a problem with it at all . <p> The-Offspring-RuLe <p> 07-15-2005 , 07:46 AM <p> Ibanez are good , they have to have different guitars to sound right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM <p> Noodles uses many guitars like gibson fender but on tour he uses ibanez ndm .

If I had my own signature guitar , i 'd play it : cool : <p> Vayaconcornholio <p> 07-15-2005 , 12:53 PM <p> yep noodles has his signature model but there are 2 versions of his guitar there are some differences in finish . first guitar which is in sales has black finish , different bridge LONG ... second has pickguard and chrome finish and the input jack is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one . This guitar seems to change colour ( silve to black ) LONG ... noodles rather uses second guitar which is not in sales . I do n't  know why he created different guitar . Signature model should be the same that he truly plays . Angus young , Tomi Iommi , Tom Delonge ... sale same guitars that they play . <p> ... and there is a pic with noodles playing gibson guitar . LONG ... 41130 @qwx451130 <p> 07-15-2005 , 05:43 PM <p> I think Gibson guitars are much better . <p> notice that the key word there is ' I ' .

Cool ! <p> Yes , Mesa . Read interviews . Anyway , yeah , he has an endorsement with them , duh ! He uses his NDM1 and Dexter uses his RG1570 and no one gets hurt . <p> Vayaconcornholio <p> 07-16-2005 , 04:49 AM <p> on conspiracy of one tour he used VHT amps with dexter and I 'm sure but now maybe he changed his amp . I remember that on americana tour he used marshalls too but now they use only cabinets of this brand . In my opinion marshalls sounds better than mesa but it depends on which guitar , and cabinets you play . 
@@44115980 @4115980/ <p> A lot of people say Jet is overrated . I disagree . I think they 're underrated . Thety get lots of radio play , but no one ever talks about them , and they were n't even considered for the grammies , despite the fact the Get Born was one of the best albums of 2004 . Are You Gon na Be My Girl and Cold Hard B deserved all the radio play they got , and the CD has some really awesome songs that are n't on the radio , like Rollover DJ , Get What You Need , Last Chance , Get Me Outta Here , Take It Or Leave It , and Lazy Gun .

I 'll have to ask him what the URL was again . Actually , I sent you the link . <p> bd007h <p> 11-03-2005 , 11:31 PM <p> send it to me again <p> bd007h <p> 11-04-2005 , 12:02 AM <p> here 's the article from that site <p> Lifted Riffs I heard a long time ago that the main riff from Offspring - Self Esteem was lifted from Nirvana 's Smells Like Teen Spirit , and after listening , it did sound pretty similar to me . I was telling this to a few friends ( Yono and Sunny ) who did n't believe me , so here 's ' proof . ' Again all this shows is that they are very similar riffs , not that one actually copied the other , because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same riff ... <p> While searching the web for info on this , I ran into a page that said Bush also lifted the main riff in Little Things . Also Noe said that another guitar player had told him that the Nirvana riff is actually very similar to Boston 's More Than a Feeling , which really suprised me , but I listened to it , and it was . So here are short clips from each songs ( just the riff ) and a few overlays for you to listen to , so you can decide for yourself , if you do n't believe me . <p> Since all the songs are n't the same tempo , I timed the riff for each song . 4.072 seconds for Nirvana , 4.319 for Boston , and 4.477 for Offspring . Then I increased the tempo ( preserving pitch ) on the Boston and Offspring songs , and then overlaid each on top of the Nirvana , so you could hear the similarites . It 's a little hard to listen to , and the beats are n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording wizard , so it 'll take a little imagination on your part . It 's kind of neat to hear Boston singing over Nirvana 's rough guitar . ( I did n't do Bush , because I was getting lazy . ) <p> As a side note , I do n't see anything wrong with ' lifting ' riffs . A good riff is a good riff . It 's just good to know where the music came from . It 's cool that the riff was a part of 4 songs . Objections , comments , and insights from more knowledgeable people are requested , since I do n't know much more than my ear tells me , which is n't much . Some tab/sheet music comparisons would be better than what I did ... if anyone is up for it . <p> dean <p> 11-04-2005 , 12:33 PM <p> i saw tsol live and thought they were playing got ta get away as the drums were identical , this was some years ago , so ca n't remember wot thesong was tho , but they are not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dexters <p> bd007h <p> 11-04-2005 , 03:33 PM <p> I have n't heard enough of TSOL to make a comparison . <p> dalaksta <p> 11-05-2005 , 05:48 AM <p> Oh yeah , that one Fugazi song on that one album .

They 're way more likely to lash out at criticism or disapproval than they should be . They 'll flirt with anyone , any time . They tend to mistake any attention as sexual attraction ( " I 'm tellin ' ya , she totally wants me , bro " ) .

The Disorder : This guy displays signs of what is known as the Mallenby effect . Basically , this causes a person to overestimate the effects of alcohol during the first few drinks ( called the " absorption phase " by people who study drunkenness ) and will underestimate them later in the night ( during the " elimination phase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , buy a lot of nonalcoholic beer for a party full of teenagers . If drinking with teens is n't your thing ( and legally it should n't be anyone 's " thing " ) then check out most college frat parties where the masses will start screaming " WHOO ! ! ! " within the first 15 minutes that the keg is tapped , long before their system has actually had the chance to absorb any alcohol into the blood stream.Later , the same people will physically display all signs of being drunk , but will claim to be sharp as a tack , because , as they 'll tell you , they drink so much that it , like , would totally take all the booze in this place to get them drunk . Then they 'll plow their Mustang into a drainage ditch and take a swing at a cop . <p> #2 . The Raging Douchebag ( chef Ramsey is one of those ) Do n't step on his shoes , do n't make incidental eye contact and do n't talk to his girlfriend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to any girls because they could be his girlfriend , someday . It does n't take a whole lot to set this type of guy off , and after he 's pissed , screaming and swinging you 'll wish you 'd actually done something worthy of such a tantrum . He 's easy to pick out in a crowd , there 'll be one man yelling while everyone else in the crowd exchanges confused glances along with sympathetic shrugging shoulders . He 's the screaming one , the one trying to finish an imaginary fight with a person who did n't start it . A douche that ca n't be ignored . The Disorder : This is a classic case of Intermittent Explosive Disorder or IED . This guy is a time bomb , and nobody can see the timer but him--he can go off at any moment . Although his aggression normally is n't life threatening , it 's really fucking irritating . Medically diagnosed IED is defined as a behavioral disorder characterized by repeated episodes of aggressive and violent outbursts grossly out of proportion to the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axe body spray is common but unfortunately correlation does not equal causation . A 2006 study by the National Institute of Mental Health has determined the condition to be more prevalent than previously thought , affecting around 2 out of every 25 adult Americans , most commonly seen in male youths . How the researches went about collecting data is not disclosed , though we hope they ruined many a striped shirt on nickel-beer-night while gathering subjects ' reactions . Cases of road rage , domestic abuse and destruction of property usually involve one or more parties with the disorder . Often those with IED will feel a great deal of regret or remorse if bodily harm or destruction of personal possessions occurs . It 's uncertain if the same remorse is felt after chewing out a waitress for forgetting to refill a water glass , though the spit and pubes now hidden in the rest of their meal may balance out the situation . <p> #1 . The Aging Douchebag It seems no matter where you go there 's a grumpy asshole making things awkward for everybody . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checkout . He 'll complain when someone has an accent while in America . And that goddamn hip-hop is always too loud ! He wo n't hesitate to tell you about how much better things were in the past , before the whole world turned against him . The Disorder : This man is suffering from what is known as andropause or " male menopause . " It 's a frustrated state accompanied by anxiety and anger resulting from a lack of testosterone , the production of which diminishes in midlife . The term " male menopause " can also be used as an early detection method , since most men with IMS will hear this term and respond with a loud grunt while shouting about " New Age psychobabble bullshit . " The onset of this disorder is common at ages 40 to 55 but may happen as early as 35 or as late as 65 . Although , a definite age is difficult to pinpoint if the male in question has been a prick their whole life.The development of IMS is also dependent on environmental factors associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal relationships and whatever happens to be wrong with kids these days . The physical symptoms ( which can include loss of sex drive , loss of physical strength and increase in body fat ) only exasperate the sense of frustration and nervousness and increases behaviors that society classifies as douchebaggery . There are free tests and screenings available online to check for IMS , but if you already have it , you probably think the internet is a waste of time for freaks and perverts . <p> Maria Cortez <p> 05-23-2009 , 03:25 AM <p> Damn , that guy made my day !

The remaining 70% is aged 8 months on stainless steel . 10% malolactic fermentation . Description : Color : Light , lemon yellow . Bouquet : Fresh yet intense . Pineapple , citrus and apples with a backdrop of vanilla . Taste : A medium bodied wine with a long , sweet finish . Alcohol Content : 13.5% Total Acidity : 5.9 g/l <p> The wine has a lemon-yellow color . It is rich and appealing with heavy pineapple fruit , toasty oak and a creamy butter texture .

To discourage this action , Don Melchor spread the rumor that his deepest , darkest cellar was the Casillero del Diablo ( Cellar of the Devil ) , so that no one would dare go in there . It worked , and a legend was born . Today , this mysterious and legendary cellar continues to hold the finest , estate grown wines of Casillero del Diablo . <p> The wine is endowed with a remarkable bouquet , complex overtones and a lingering finish . It is well structured , perfectly balanced and boasts a satisfying and lingering finish . Dark and deep red color . Appealing red cherries and black plums with a touch of toasty oak .

They echoed the sound forged in 1976-77 in the seminal punk undergrounds of New York City , London and Los Angeles . <p> In the early days , O.C. punks unyielding musical force slammed up against an immovable cultural object : the Orange County dream of quiet , well-oriented , economically impregnable suburban living . <p> Treating rowdy , often outrageous fans as a gang element , local authorities shut down a series of clubs that championed the music .

Not wanting to pause to break in a novice , Royer and the Agnews left and formed their own band instead . <p> The next few years saw a revolving-door membership . <p> KROQ-FM deejay Rodney Bingenheimer embraced Orange County music , playing highlights from its major local bands on his Sunday night radio show .

Hindsight being 20/20 , I ca n't believe MTV did n't jump all over this record and make Social D the latest hipster greaser band like the Stray Cats . Prison Bound marks the genesis of the country influence on Social D 's sound , but it was n't perfected until this album . The proportions of rock , punk , country and rockabilly are perfectly adjusted on this album . More songs about prison , life as a loser , misfit and overall worthless car-lovin ' , whiskey-drinkin ' , cigarette-smokin ' member of the lower class . If you are ever going to take up cigarette smoking , " Ball and Chain " will provide the necessary inspiration . On this record , Mike and Co. perfect their image , and let 's be honest , the most attractive thing about Social D is that you will never be as cool as they are . This record is somehow greater than the sum of its parts . Country legends like Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haggard wish they could write songs like this ( and Mike Ness feels the same way about their work , just witness the flawless tribute to Cash on " Ring Of Fire " ) . If you 're some kind of microbrew-drinking , cigar-smoking , SUV-driving moron , do n't bother buying this album . This is only for the Pabst , Lucky Strikes and ' 57 T-bird crowd-rednecks , white socks and Blue Ribbon <p> Die-hard Social D fans will tell you this album represents the pinnacle of their career . Do n't believe them . The record starts off strong with " Cold Feelings , " which is one of my favorite Social D songs , then moves to " Bad Luck . " Both of these songs demonstrate the band 's strength in writing rockers as well as slower country-tinged numbers . In fact , " Bad Luck " is classic Social D and must be an integral part of any analysis of their career . The third track is an amazing cover of the country classic " Making Believe " made famous by the late Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' allegiance to county is not a gimmick or image ploy - it 's legit , as anyone can tell by simply listening to his voice . But after these three winners , the record starts to slump and never recovers . The remainder of the record is an instance of " too much of a good thing . " The rockabilly influence takes over and the essence of the Social D sound that makes them stand out is lost . Particularly bothersome are " Born To Lose " and " This Time Darlin ' . " Even the next cover , " King of Fools , " is lacking with respect to their previous successes in covering the classics . This must be an instance of simply trying too hard . If you can buy an entire CD for only three songs , this one 's a worthwhile buy . Else , leave it alone . <p> Most punks know that the first Social D singles are regarded as LA punk classics . These records really capture the aura of the scene in 1980 Orange County . Finding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll easily pay over $40 for each . Or , you could pick up this $13 CD and get all of the tracks on one disc , complete with lyrics and photos that paint the picture of an era long gone which will never be duplicated . If you like 90 's Social D because of their masterful blend of country and honky tonk into rock , you will not be satisfied with this record . This record is pure early 80 's LA punk , and the lyrics could easily serve as a textbook on the scene . The songs are full of the standard themes of the time - the harassment of the punk youth , the dissatisfaction with society and the destructive and rampant drug use of the punkers . All are delivered well and the music provides the perfect background for the telling of these stories from one person who , at the time , was living it . No other album outlines the social life of early punkers so thoroughly and vividly . These recordings set the stage for the landmark Social D album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is honestly one of the best rock albums recorded in the 90 's . After 16 years , some jail time , and more tattoos , they finally got it all together . This is the third distinct Social D sound and even as this is reminiscent of the early 80 's singles , this is something entirely different . This is what rock ' n ' roll was supposed to have evolved into , not garbage like Metallica and Guns ' n ' Roses . " I Was Wrong " is one of my favorite songs of all time . This shows that punks can indeed be mature people who can own up to their wrongdoings . In fact , this whole album shows a new level of maturity that I have never seen from Social D , and a level that is rarely attained by other acts as well . " Dear Lover " and " Untitled " could be called " love " songs , but they transcend that label .

One of the Offspring 's worst songs ever , and absolutely their least distinct song ever . Take away Dexter 's voice , and I would have no idea that this song was the Offspring .

Ed Gein ? <p> Rag Doll <p> 02-28-2009 , 12:50 PM <p> Sarah would probably be better at answering this ( besides being head mod , she works *in* the music industry ) . But , I 'd imagine it has something to do with their contract . The record company probably wo n't allow them to have everything available for free when they could be making a profit off of it . <p> Tijs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discography is already on the website available , right ? <p> Rag Doll <p> 02-28-2009 , 01:01 PM <p> is it ? perhaps they do that because it 's on their own website rather than something owned by an outside company ? <p> Tijs <p> 02-28-2009 , 01:03 PM <p> Yeah , just check out the music section and click the music-note symbol next to a song . <p> ah , yes . i knew that . why did i not remember that . anyway ... the reason it 's not on myspace could still be some weird legal thing . but , ya , that 's just my guess . <p> nevo <p> 02-28-2009 , 01:40 PM <p> Well , they 're discography is already on the website available , right ? <p> Yes , but have you tried them lately ? They have n't worked in a while . The radio works fine , but you 'd have to skip forever to find the song you want . But even then , a person would n't be able to embed that song to their myspace page . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it worked for me . <p> nevo <p> 02-28-2009 , 02:23 PM <p> I just tried and it worked for me . <p> Do they ? : confused : You 're talking about listening to a single track , right ? That has n't worked on my computer in so long , now I have to figure out why . Is anyone else having my problem ? <p> Free ? <p> 02-28-2009 , 02:51 PM <p> It 's nitpicking . If you want the discography , download or buy it . Band is okay with both ways . Even more - they actually uploaded Hammerhead and streamed full RAFRAG online when they were hot . Youtube is a good source of streaming music as well . It 's pretty much everywhere , it 's not 1998 when free mp3s in internet was something amazing , it 's a common thing today . <p> nevo <p> 02-28-2009 , 03:14 PM <p> It 's nitpicking .

I was just wondering why they did n't have it on myspace . Like Rag Doll said , it might be a legal issue . Anyway , I 'm looking at their new radio flash player right now , I 'm going to try and embed Offspring radio to a myspace page , that way visitors will get a different Offspring song every time , I 'll give you guys the code if this works . : <p> Jojan <p> 02-28-2009 , 03:36 PM <p> People abuses the exclamation mark . <p> randman21 <p> 02-28-2009 , 05:19 PM <p> I can say with relative confidence that it 's a deliberate thing .

@@44116008 @4116008/ <p> I know , this topic is brought up a lot , but never seems to go anywhere . What about the early members of the band from 1983-1985 ? <p> First thing 's first Dexter and Greg were the core of the band , playing together since 1983 . How I understand it , this was n't really a band , just two buddies jamming together . It was in 1984 that the actual band was started when they got other members , and this period is easily the most unclear . <p> What we do know is Doug Thompson was the first singer , James Lilja was the first drummer ( confirmed by Dexter ) , and Greg was obviously on bass . There 's conflicting sources as to whether Dexter was on drums ( before Lilja ) or guitar during this first formation ( it 's unknown when he switched ) . <p> That brings us to the guitarist ; Marcus Parrish . Sadly , his role has been mainly lost over time ( not even being featured on the Wikipedia page ) . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band , and a previous forum member has inquired about his role in the band ( and whether he was featured on " Hopeless " ) , to which he replied : <p> No . I left before any recording was completed . There is a rough live jam of a song called " Private World " out there somewhere on cassette but who knows where that went . I do still keep in touch with Ron . He and Chris Higgins are the only current/former band memeber I know . Peace . This is back in 2006 , and the story is that him and Ron went to high school together . So I 'd go as far as to assume that he was the first guitarist in ' 84 , and his departure lead Dexter to pick up the role . That 's just speculation , though . <p> Next , we have Jim Benton . I 'm gon na be honest , I know absolutely nothing about him or his role in the band ( except he was allegedly friends with Doug ) . The common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also those who claim he was a guitarist as well . It 's believed that Lilja preceded Ron Welty , so Wikipiedia tried to fill the void by saying Benton played in between periods when Lilja was n't in the band . Some even say he was the first drummer , which does n't seem likely . <p> Not sure exactly when Noodles showed up in 1985 , not like it matters , but it would be nice to know if he ( or Dexter ) played on " Hopeless . " After his arrival in ' 85 , the band became pretty solid as a four-piece band . <p> The only members accounted for today are Lilja , a successful gynecologist , and Parrish , still a guitarist . Thompson has sadly passed away around the time of Splinter . 41140 @qwx451140 <p> 11-08-2013 , 09:20 PM <p> Wow I never heard of this Marcus Parrish guy before good work : ) also Dexter said in a interview with loveline Jim Benton was the first drummer in 1984 <p> Mega Man <p> 11-08-2013 , 10:16 PM <p> Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been their first drummer then . My source was Dexter 's story behind " Beheaded , " and how he mentions that " James was our first drummer , and this was before we even recorded our first record . " I assumed this was also covering the Manic Subsidal days , but if he specifically mentioned 1984 when referring to Benton , then he was indeed their first drummer . I guess that would make sense , as it 's been said that after Thompson was " forced out of the band , " Benton followed suit . Guess it may not have been on the best terms . <p> Oxygene <p> 11-09-2013 , 12:45 AM <p> I think the reason it 's so confusing is because I do n't really think it was a band , it was probably like " yeah let 's start a band ok go get the beer " you know just sitting around dicking about with instruments and stuff who ever would sit at the drums would be the drummer you know , wether it was Dexter or someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours and opening up for the rolling stones , they were a bunch of nerds hanging around a garage . I do n't think they thought it would ever become a thing , so they probably were n't even paying much attention . <p> Mega Man <p> 12-01-2013 , 09:07 AM <p> Mr. Parrish does indeed have a Twitter , as he actually responded to me : LONG ... <p> Maybe it 's just me , but he does n't seem to excited about the topic . I kept it short , and only asked what the lineup was at that point . <p> His music is also worth a listen to ; I like the garage rock feel to it . <p> Mega Man <p> 02-02-2014 , 07:56 PM <p> Marcus got back to me , and it seems as though he was a part of the first lineup , he says the lineup was : <p> Brian , Greg , Doug Thompson Jim Benton and me . So The Offspring was always keen on having two guitars ; I would love to hear that tape that they cut with Marcus .

@@44116014 @4116014/ <p> Do you consider skate punk to be a real genre ? If so , how would you define it ? <p> Personally , I feel like can identify the sound of skate punk if I hear it , but I ca n't quite define it . I know a lot of 90 's punk has been called skate punk , including The Offspring , NOFX and Pennywise . But then there 's older punk bands that have a more hardcore or thrash sound like JFA or Suicidal Tendencies that seem to be associated with skate punk as well . So what is skate punk ? <p> Alison <p> 01-29-2010 , 01:11 PM <p> I always see punk with a bit of ska influence as skate punk , but also some Pennywise and things similiar to them . But ... I 'm not really sure if I 'd call it a genre in itself ... it seems a bit too vague to be so precise .. <p> 7Seconds <p> 01-29-2010 , 03:09 PM <p> I consider it more of a life style ... <p> RageAndLov <p> 01-29-2010 , 06:04 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pop punk .

" pop punk " . how much i hate that appelation : rolleyes : who was so brave and stupid to connect these two absolutely different music genres ? sure there are some bands and their music style is called like this , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because these bands are not " punk " ... not even close . they have nothnig to do with punk . even their look is not punk . it 's fucking 13 years old emo : p <p> mspunk13 <p> 01-30-2010 , 09:22 AM <p> To me pop-punk means punk-like music many people listen to , but I would n't say it means punk music , which got popular . <p> I think pop-punk bands ' aim is to gain popularity , so they create upbeat songs with distorted guitars ( that 's the punk part ) , but they make them as catchy as possible ( for instance by writing lyrics about love ) and not nearly as hardcore ( that 's the pop part ) . <p> The Offspring probably lies somewhere between pop-punk and punk rock . They had n't sold out until 1998 and they still keep making music with meaningful lyrics . I think they ruined their ' pure punk ' image by creating songs like Pretty fly or Why do n't you get a job ? . <p> Blink 182 say they 're too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on MTV . They like to mask their live-suckiness by looking cool , saying funny stuff etc . They create music for their fans , to make 13yo girls scream loud . That 's what I call pop-punk . <p> Bad Religion , however , do n't give a shit about any of those things . They keep doing what they love doing , their songs are still very fast with very distorted guitars , their lyrics are still amazing and they do n't have to raise their egos by looking cool , anyway , they 're great live . They 're a pure punk-rock band , which got popular , because they write great music , not because they were doing everything just to get popular . <p> And when some people say ' NOFX is pop-punk , Bad Brains is punk ' - it 's really driving me mad , because NOFX do n't give a fuck either , just because many people listen to them and just because they songs are not monotone and thrashy , does n't mean they 're not punk . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strongly disagree . I think it 's totally the opposite . Pop-punk bands are trying to create a punk image of themselves by having full sleeve tattoos , piercings , tight pants , studded belts , skate shoes etc. , while real punkers just do n't give a fuck . <p> Rooster <p> 01-30-2010 , 10:17 AM <p> Pop punk , hardcore punk , punk rock , ... Fuck sorting into genres , if the music rocks , it rocks . Period . Like dffpunk i just call it punk rock . I just see some bands as a part of more melodic side of punk and others part of more agressive , faster-paced side of punk . Some of them are somewhere in the middle between both ( which is what i prefer ) . Skate punk is n't really a genre in my opinion . <p> By the way , Bad Religion are great , BUT there 's something that bothers me with them , and that is the fact that when you 've listened to one of their CDs it 's almost like you 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not saying i do n't like those bands , i really do , but sometimes they just feel repetitive . This very same thing bothers me about hardcore punk ( besides all the kids in the highschool i visited that listen(ed) to hardcore punk just because they thought it would make them look cool super-tough ) - it 's just song after song of play-as-fast-as-you-can riffs , and God forbid you try something different , you 're already called a sellout . I like when a band mixes things up a bit , not just have an album whuch sounds like 1 song burned 13 times on the same disc . <p> And arguing who 's punk and who 's not is just childish . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 01-30-2010 , 10:34 AM <p> I find most people 's perception of what is " pop-punk " is totally off base , and thus leads to an incorrect definition . <p> Bands like Fall Out Boy or My Chemical Romance are not " pop-punk " , and I hate when people use them as leading examples of the genre . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Green Day record once in high school . <p> So saying that Nofx sometimes write and play pop-punk music is n't an insult , its an accurate observation . They may be a punk band , but a lot of their songs have a very clear pop influence , and it 's stupid to try and ignore this fact . Same goes for Bad Religion . <p> The ' punk ' part . I 've come to despise discussions revolving around what is and is n't punk . <p> mspunk13 <p> 01-30-2010 , 11:07 AM <p> Maybe that will sound weird , but to me it seems like there is a difference between a pop-punk band and a pop-punk song . <p> I 'd say NOFX is a pop-punk band because they 're popular but they mostly write pure punk-rock songs , while ... oh ... well . Whatever . You 're right . Everyone has their own definition of pop-punk , I 'd better not start an endless fight : D <p> I have to agree that Bad Religion , Pennywise , Lagwagon and such feel VERY repetitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insult , it 's just another genre . I guess even bands like NOFX sometimes write pop-punk songs . Like Franco Unamerican . Some pop-punk bands write punk songs ( for instance Sum 41 's Tables have turned ) . That 's the way it is . <p> It just really bothers me that the Offspring changed their style so dramatically , not to say that they sold out . I loved the 89-97 times ... : ) <p> And about the play-as-fast-as-you-can riffs ... 90% of songs on Ixnay had the same fast beat over and over again . And if you tell me that Ixnay sounded monotone , I swear , I will create software that will automatically install on your computer and punch you in the face : D <p> EDIT : <p> You know the common denominator that really annoys me ? <p> The ' punk ' part . I 've come to despise discussions revolving around what is and is n't punk . <p> Punk is supposed to be your lifestyle , and that lifestyle is about not giving a fuck . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fuck , while Blink 182 definitely do . In fact , they give lots of fucks . <p> Punk music is often described as fast music with distorted guitars and lyrics about what makes you angry , but punkers believe they do n't need labels . <p> Rooster <p> 01-30-2010 , 11:33 AM <p> And about the play-as-fast-as-you-can riffs ... 90% of songs on Ixnay had the same fast beat over and over again . And if you tell me that Ixnay sounded monotone , I swear , I will create software that will automatically install on your computer and punch you in the face : D <p> Wo n't say that , do n't worry . Maybe i should choose my words better - i 'm more bothered with what stereotypical punk ( or hardcore punk or whatever other subgenre of punk rock ) bands do , and they usually tend to write/play only super fast songs which are very similar to eachother in structure , have similar or the same tempo and similar riffs . You ca n't say that for Ixnay , every song on Ixnay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooks . You can still have an album full of fast songs that do n't sound like the same song all over again . But unfortunately many stereotypical punk bands do just that - find a formula that works well and just use it for every song . Typical example ? The Exploited . I 've seen them live last summer , and GOD i was bored . You hear one song from them , and you have heard them all . Not to say they do n't have skills as musicians , they do . But they 're just boring . <p> Not all punk/hc punk/whatever-punk bands are like that . But a lot ( really A LOT ) of them are . I realise that there 's not much new to invent these days , especially if you play a genre like punk , but despite this fact you can still make an album of songs that sound different one from another . You just have to look at song as a whole and make it different . <p> Alison <p> 01-30-2010 , 11:52 AM <p> I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some Screeching Weasel , some Queers , The Manges , all those kinda Ramonesesque type bands as pop-punk . While other bands like blink-182 , fallout boy , etc are pop bands with punk influences . I do n't  know , I hate this whole having to classify everything we listen to , because it always gets fucked up somewhere . <p> mspunk13 <p> 01-30-2010 , 12:15 PM <p> Typical example ? The Exploited . I 've seen them live last summer , and GOD i was bored . You hear one song from them , and you have heard them all . <p> Holy crap : eek : I 'd be scared as hell - Exploited fans are famous for being aggressive ... But you 're right about their songs sounding the same . I hate that , too . I think that 's the difference between popular bands and not-so-popular bands ... Many Offspring songs have the same structure , but they are SOOO melodic , while , let 's say , No fun at all songs manage to sound exactly the same . That 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Offspring . <p> Rooster <p> 01-30-2010 , 12:26 PM <p> I 'd put it like this : there 's a difference between a band that makes music to make their fans happy ( you know there 's only one way to make a tru punx happy ... well , two actually , but since beer makes everyone happy it does n't really count ) and a band which consists of members who play music primarily for themselves , because they like it . You see them having fun at what they 're doing , and that 's what makes the difference . <p> mspunk13 <p> 01-30-2010 , 12:31 PM <p> Haha ... everyone has their own priorities . Beer has to be the priority . <p> Having fun is definitely the most important thing about playing in a band . I 'm worried about the Offspring not having fun while playing live any more . They seem to treat the music stage like a theater stage , they are always like ' I 'm having a fucking great time ' , then they 'll jump once or twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 01-30-2010 , 12:49 PM <p> Hmm , have n't seen The Offspring live yet , so i ca n't tell if they 're having fun or not . But if the songs are an indication , i 'd still think they like what they 're doing . Still , i 'd like to hear a bit more energy in the next album : ) <p> P.S. : the quite from your sig makes me wonder if that 's the reason why our drummer refuses to use double bass pedal ( he does n't even have it , but during our first rehearsal i could have sworn it sounded like was using it : D ) <p> mspunk13 <p> 01-30-2010 , 12:59 PM <p> The Offspring are definitely still capable of creating great songs full of energy . I just wish they did n't look so bored while playing live . <p> The reason why I 'm not into double pedals is that you ca n't play on the hi-hat and the double pedal simultaneously ( crap , this word is hard to spell ...

Bad Religion , Rancid , Anti-Flag , and the Descendents do n't really have the same driving force and intensity to the majority of thier guitar riffs .

Noodles , are you having a good time ? ' Noodles was like ' Yeah , I 'm having a great time ' , then they played Self esteem and went off stage . <p> dffpunk <p> 02-01-2010 , 03:58 AM <p> NOFX , Pennywise , and Lagwagon ( Guttermouth slightly less so ) all have a different guitar sound . Bad Religion , Rancid , Anti-Flag , and the Descendents do n't really have the same driving force and intensity to the majority of thier guitar riffs . For example , I remember how surprised I was the first time I heard Sinister Rouge by BR , because it 's just got a higher level of energy then most of their riffs . If I had to try and define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say the guitars riffs borrow from thrash and hardcore in a way that those other bands I listed do n't . There 's got to be some difference between " bands that traditionally receive the lable " and bands that do n't . <p> I can see how you separated for example Rancid and Anti-Flag , maybe because they have " fuzzier " or shall I say " dirtier " guitar riffs which can not appeal to everyone 's level/style of energic music . But I 'd put Bad Religion with their guitar style right up there with NOFX , Pennywise , Lagwagon , and even The Offspring , even though each one of them has their own distinctive feature which makes them , shall I say , unique . Anyway , I still do n't know if I got exactly what you said . <p> RageAndLov <p> 02-01-2010 , 04:44 AM <p> I find most people 's perception of what is " pop-punk " is totally off base , and thus leads to an incorrect definition . <p> Bands like Fall Out Boy or My Chemical Romance are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them as leading examples of the genre . They 're nothing but pop-rock bands , who probably listened to a Green Day record once in high school . <p> So saying that Nofx sometimes write and play pop-punk music is n't an insult , its an accurate observation . They may be a punk band , but a lot of their songs have a very clear pop influence , and it 's stupid to try and ignore this fact . Same goes for Bad Religion . <p> I agree , pop punk goes for more or less those bands listed . It 's just that Blink 182 is defined as pop punk by the media and fans who do n't know better . So people who hate Blink 182 and like bands like Pennywise , Against Me ! etc. try to distinguish them from fans of bands which have nothing to do with punk whatsoever ( like Blink 182 ) . 41152 @qwx451152 <p> 02-01-2010 , 09:06 AM <p> Big fucking deal : Making sure that when you tell people that you 're upping the punx , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Not a big fucking deal : Uh , enjoying yourself and listening to whatever you want , regardless of its status as whiney bullshit girly music ? <p> GUYS POP-PUNK IS FOR FAGZ . <p> Llamas <p> 02-01-2010 , 09:21 AM <p> I hate this whole having to classify everything we listen to , because it always gets fucked up somewhere . <p> This .

I think the point is that genres can be defined enough to justify their existence , but people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they involve a lot of grey area . <p> But then that begs the question , how much grey area is there ? How much room for individual interpretation makes sense before you decide that what someone says regarding a specific band/genre is just foolish ? I think that 's where the genre arguments starts to go in circles . <p> RageAndLov <p> 02-01-2010 , 11:31 AM <p> This .

" . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to called ' Anarchy and Moshpits ' by Hardcore Screamers " . Kate ended up liking neither of the two albums .

I 'd much rather someone say " hey listen to this album , have you heard of ? It reminds me of them . " or " it 's really light and upbeat , with a lot of power chords and fast lyrics " <p> RageAndLov <p> 02-01-2010 , 11:56 AM <p> All I 'm saying is that genres help describing the music . <p> Llamas <p> 02-01-2010 , 11:59 AM <p> All I 'm saying is that genres help describing the music . <p> I agree that they have that potential , but usually they just end in arguments . So it 's pretty much better , in my opinion , to avoid them . <p> Alison <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labelled into these really small categories that barely end up explaining what they are anyway . Even the smallest sub-sub-genres end up being very varied because people just ca n't agree on what they think music is . <p> RageAndLov <p> 02-01-2010 , 12:46 PM <p> But why must music be labelled into these really small categories that barely end up explaining what they are anyway . Even the smallest sub-sub-genres end up being very varied because people just ca n't agree on what they think music is . <p> Well , there has to be a boundary . And where that boundary should go is not easy to clarify . However , it is so much easier to call it hardcore punk than the kind of music where the chord progression is fast and few , has an angry feel to it , has a fast tempo , growling or shouting vocals , is presented in short songs and short albums and deals with political , social , sexual , disturbing , shocking lyrics with a dark undertone . This could be the description of one single band , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a record , you 'd have to do that all over again . With genres , you get a collective term for certain bands with some equal traits . Not everyone has the time or patience to either tell or listen to long descriptions of one and one band .

You made your point clearly enough , and believe it or not I understood it . What I 'm telling you , though , is that you 're wrong . <p> Oh , there 's no doubt that at some level there some DIY ethic which galvanized the movement in the 70s , but the dominance of that movement has died away . Punk - as much as you might not want to believe it - is an image . It might be an image tied to a DIY ethos , but denying that the image is there is pointless . <p> The punk movement , in its rampant desire for non-conformity , has created a subculture with its own rules - that 's what I meant when I said norms . Some of those rules are based on your attitude , your approach to music , sure . But in this day and age , just as many ' punkers ' identify themselves by a style of dress . More importantly , tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which cements them as ' insiders ' or whatnot . That people can be defined as punk or not punk is proof enough of that . <p> I ca n't deny the existence of labels , but labels make you fit in , while that 's what punks hate . Having to do this and that because other people do so . To be a punk , you have to fit in with what it means to be punk . Am I as clear as I hope I 'm being ? <p> Maybe not - I 'll try and put it another way . To " not give a fuck about what people want you to do " is n't punk . Only " not giving a fuck about what people want you to do in the context of punk ethos and imagery " is punk . See what I mean ? " Not giving a fuck about people want you to do " if the person is Emile Durkheim makes you Claude Levi-Strauss . Not punk . <p> Fuck , I 'm just not making any sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just trying to prove it . <p> You 'll have to excuse me if there 's some lingering formality in my writing - I just finished a paper on gender representation in the media and terrorism . 41152 @qwx451152 <p> 02-01-2010 , 02:48 PM <p> mspunk : <p> For instance , if a punk band decided they really wanted to do a country album because that 's what they wanted to play , they would be accused of selling out . This follows your definition , mspunk , where doing what you want without caring about what other people think is totally punk . But , selling out is the OPPOSITE of punk , which is what people would say if it ever happened . So are they punk for doing what they want , or are they sellouts for making a more commercially-viable album ? <p> There 's a hypocrisy between what punks say is their ethic : to do what the fuck you want without a care as to what others think , and what punks actually do : call anyone who breaks the standard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punk is ded . <p> RageAndLov <p> 02-01-2010 , 03:04 PM <p> Last time I checked , being punk is not about being apathetic . <p> Alison <p> 02-01-2010 , 03:05 PM <p> Well , there has to be a boundary .

I mean , wtf is skate-punk anyway , punk that skaters listen to ? Like , I 'm not talking about these pretty standard genres like hardcore . Those are easy to set boundaries to . But when you really dig so deep and make things like hardline and straight edge ( since when is straight edge even a fucking genre ) , that 's where it starts to fuck up .

I do what I want , because it makes me happy . I do n't do it for other people . But if I tried to say I 'm punk , because I do what I want , the entire punk community would laugh at me and probably beat me up . Why ?

But such a classification would piss the hell out of a classical enthusiast . <p> Or what about this ? What genre is this ? http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=jgCh8RBOKMY Most people would probably be inclined to call it jazz . But the same goes for this as with the " classical " song above . <p> And what about this ? LONG ... Rap ? Funk ? Jazz ? Rock ? These are all genres that people generally think are really easy to define ... but nobody can even agree on these ! <p> Alison <p> 02-01-2010 , 03:25 PM <p> Oh shit yeah , fuck , I completely forgot about all those other ' hardcore ' bands .

There are lamborghini gallardos and there are lamborghini gallardo replicas . Let 's say you have a dirty gallardo in a super-ugly color with supersmall , rusty steel rims .

To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , I guess . <p> Here 's a real story , I did n't make that up : when I was skating in my local skatepark , I decided to make a little test and strike up a conversation with a guy who was wearing a London Calling T-shirt . I asked him about his favorite songs by the Clash . All he could say ' umm ... London Calling ? ' . I was surprised , I asked if that was it and he was like ' yeah , pretty much ' . He was also wearing skinny pants , skate shoes , he had a studded belt , a studded wristband and a very visible wallet chain . He sucked at skating and at punk music knowledge . I wonder what he had on his iPod . <p> Now , have a look at this picture : LONG ... That 's Jello Biafra . This guy is ultimately punk , yet he looks like the average Joe . Do you really think he gives a flying fuck about people labeling him as less punk than the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so either . And the fact that he does n't makes him much more punk than any clothes would : ) <p> That 's what I meant . The image is just a shell , the attitude is the core and the shell can not exist without the core . <p> I have to agree with this statement , though : <p> To be a punk , you have to fit in with what it means to be punk . Am I as clear as I hope I 'm being ? Yes , very clear . And the statement is very true when it comes to attitude etc. but still , in my opinion , the looks should be treated as a cool extra . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I like to wear skatepunk clothes - I love the phrase you used - to cement me as an ' insider ' . Still , I treat the image as NOTHING more than the cement . <p> Llamas <p> 02-02-2010 , 10:35 AM <p> What do you expect when you go to places like that ?

I 'm not saying it 's always true , but I 've seen it happen enough times . : -/ <p> I actually like what mspunk said in his last post , and wish that more " punks " felt that way - look and style generally do n't make you punk . <p> RageAndLov <p> 02-02-2010 , 04:23 PM <p> NOFX and Bad Religion are popular as fuck , still they manage to stay punk .

The SPCA confirmed that all three dogs were put down because they 'd been beaten so badly by angry villagers . <p> Police had asked the SPCA to collect the dogs after villagers threatened to kill the dogs themselves to protect their daughters . Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe reported that the incident began as a rumour .

No , I was n't aware that there is any segment of society that believes the Holocaust literally did n't happen at all . I 've read about " Holocaust deniers " before , but I always assumed their views have more to do with the Holocaust being exaggerated than not occuring . This can make conversations like this confusing , as there is a great difference between denying the Holocaust outright and questioning the facts of the Holocaust . <p> On the subject of Holocaust denial ( as in denying the event happened at all ) , it comes down to being a free speech issue as previously mentioned . Can we undoubtedly define Holocaust denial as hate speech ? Is inherently hateful to express the belief that the Holocaust did n't happen ? I would say it 's not likely that a person denies the Holocaust happened and does n't hate Jews , but that does n't mean it 's not possible . But then again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that person developing this belief based on an unworkable definition of hate speech ? I 'm not sure to be honest , but I 'm curious about what principal this is truly based on . That 's what interests me about this argument ... I 'm not focused on protecting the rights of people who likely hate Jews . <p> Llamas <p> 04-04-2011 , 11:56 AM <p> Let 's get something straight here . Holocaust deniers do n't deny that millions of Jews were killed ; they deny that the massacre was intentional and was the official policy given by the government . Some also deny the use of gas chambers and concentration/execution camps . These people will not argue that the Jews were n't killed ... they 'll just argue that it was n't GENOCIDE . <p> It 's kind of like Turkish people who deny the Armenian genocide ... they do n't deny that tons of Armenians were murdered and massacred ... but they use this " but they attacked us , too ! " ( even though that happened AFTER the genocide ) crap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who ask where the ashes of 6 million jews are . ; ) <p> bighead384 <p> 04-04-2011 , 12:10 PM <p> Let 's get something straight here .

This is mostly just your opinion here , and individual opinions have no place in issues like this . I 'm sorry , but it seems there is no well-defined principal behind what a lot of you are saying . I can easily imagine someone doing objective research on this issue in a way that has nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into play if a researcher simply finds that 2.5 million Jews died , not 6 million ? Sorry , but I 'm a bit more careful and demanding of concrete logic when it comes to this sort of gray area than some of you seem to be . Maybe at the end of the day it 's best to just stop Holocaust denial/revisionism ... I can sympathize with that view ... but what I 'm saying is , these reasons do n't quite add up to me . <p> Mario , what is an example of a specific policy that is troubling to you ? I think that would advance this debate . <p> PS : Tommy , if part of your argument is ... I do n't know any examples ... I do n't even know any notable figures that have participated in either side of this debate . Then how are you informed enough to form an opinion on the matter ? <p> Because if you had read , you 'd see I 've only debated the philosophical aspects of this issue which can be done without research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm almost certain that is it possible to carry out objective research about how many were killed , but it 's going into dodgy area , it 's going to cause controversy , it 's going to upset people , motivations are going to be questioned , hidden agendas will be suspected ( why exactly should it matter so much how many were killed ? ) . I 'm not quite sure it would be worth it . At the end of the day , it happened , millions were killed , and I do n't think either way that it is possible to get anywhere near an exact figure of deaths . <p> RageAndLov <p> 04-05-2011 , 01:38 PM <p> I agree whole heartedly with freedom of speech , but , I think it really is more complex than that . <p> The trouble is , if Holocaust denial were to be legal , then there is the problem that these groups may spread , that Nazism will spurt up again . What 's to stop these people brainwashing young , impressionable people if it 's legal to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every group has its fanatics , and fanatics regarding something like Holocaust denial are potentially extremely dangerous . I mean , if you look at the KKK , when the film Birth of a Nation was released , you got this huge upsurge of Klan membership , and it led to the refounding of the group . If something along those lines , but in relation to the Holocaust denial were to happen , results could be somewhere along the same lines . If racism had been made illegal in the US , and Birth of a Nation and other KKK celebrating works had not been allowed surface , I think things would have turned out differently . <p> On one hand denying freedom of speech is a slippery slope , but when it involves something that could very potentially lead human hate crimes , then maybe it can be seen as a protection . <p> According to American free speech laws , burning the koran could be construed as free expression . You even have a constitutional right to burn the American flag here . That does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , seriously , when you 're a conservative Christian and Bill O'Reilly takes to the airwaves to call you an insane person with blood on your hands , you fucked up . <p> This is where the American legal system enters into a massive gray area . Doing what Terry Jones did is so massively irresponsible ( and he knew there would be violence and deaths because of it ) that he really should be persecuted , but there are no laws by which he could be prosecuted in the U.S. This is where I sympathize with laws in Europe outlawing Holocaust denial , because Holocaust denial leads to violence in the same way that staging a mock trial and burning a koran leads to violence . <p> I can see how those laws were very useful and most needed back in the days but it has been nearly 70 years now . Also , I know there are a few neo-nazists out there , but they are in extremely few numbers . Is it possible that such laws are n't needed anymore ? Jews are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , those laws are n't hurting anyone , it would just be a matter of principles . <p> WebDudette <p> 04-05-2011 , 03:16 PM <p> Do you guys know anything about the Holocaust ? Do you understand how it was started ? Basically , lies , hate , and rumors were spread about Jews , and then people wanted to kill them . Now imagine if people thought that the Jews were lying about the mass extermination and people started spreading lies , hate , and rumors all over again . People would want to kill them , how is that hard to understand ? <p> This is mostly just your opinion here , and individual opinions have no place in issues like this . I 'm sorry , but it seems there is no well-defined principal behind what a lot of you are saying .

Maybe at the end of the day it 's best to just stop Holocaust denial/revisionism ... I can sympathize with that view ... but what I 'm saying is , these reasons do n't quite add up to me . <p> What are your well defined principles and concrete logic ? We 've already told you that no one is banning or discouraging research . Besides , it 's been 70 years , what possible research could be done to prove it was 2.5 million instead of 6 million . Further on , how is it even relevant ? An attempted genocide is still an attempted genocide . Besides , Holocaust revision , as far as I know , is not the same as Holocaust denial . My concrete logic involving that matter is that the motives that go into Holocaust Denial are the same motives that went into starting the Holocaust in the first place . <p> Because if you had read , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue which can be done without research . <p> You keep contradicting yourself . Philosophy is literally nothing but opinions , that 's all it is . If you have no interest in doing research on something or listening to reasons behind it , why argue ? <p> When you say you find America 's laws on freedom of speech more morally sound , what does that even mean ?

Besides , we have everyday laws in America that restrict freedom of speech for the protection of others .

It 's why white extremist/seperatist groups are taken more seriously in Europe than they are in America . <p> bighead384 <p> 04-05-2011 , 09:16 PM <p> I can debate the relative merits of many things about which I have no experience ; that does not , however , mean that my position on those subjects are unassailable . You 're saying this as if I initially claimed that my position on the subject was unassailable though . I was actually defending myself from the assertion that my position on the subject has no credibility because I have n't done extensive research on it . <p> What , exactly , would be gained from an attempt to prove that " only " 2.5 million Jews were killed rather than 6 million ? I 'm sorry , but I do n't think I should have to explain why pursuing the accurate numbers is best , in this case , and in any case . I see that one could very easily want to pursue this for anti-Semitic reasons , but like I 've said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 04-05-2011 , 09:45 PM <p> Now imagine if people thought that the Jews were lying about the mass extermination and people started spreading lies , hate , and rumors all over again .

If the numbers are wrong , and we should n't correct them because people might think it was a Jewish conspiracy , then we 're basically saying : you ca n't do research on something if it might lead to problems for a group of people . That 's not really a well-defined principal ... that 's what I 'm talking about . And I never said I have all the answers here , I just feel as though there are some flaws with what some people have said . <p> You keep contradicting yourself . Philosophy is literally nothing but opinions , that 's all it is .

This is especially true for people trying to lose weight or for those who were once overweight . If you reached your goal of an average good looking muscular body , then that 's great . You 'd be perfectly fine to keep it that exact same way forever without getting bigger , but in order to keep that body , you have to continue to go to the gym 3/4 days a week .

It 's even worse than those good charlotte shit freaks . <p> kittie sucks ass ... so does death metal ... its fun to thrash around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , the music sucks ... most all girl bands suck ass too ... but i do n't automatically rule a group out just cuz its all girls <p> foxy <p> 03-30-2005 , 02:23 AM <p> Why do guys think all girl bands suck ? <p> because they do <p> T-6005 <p> 03-30-2005 , 04:36 AM <p> Why do girls in death metal bands think that when guys say they suck it 's because they 're female ? <p> On another note , I almost never want to hear someone screaming , but aside from Courtney Love , who sounds like a man , I ca n't stand women screaming . <p> fairy call <p> 04-01-2005 , 07:13 AM <p> There are lots of girlbands that do n't scream really .... even good ones <p> nameless <p> 04-01-2005 , 10:15 AM <p> the problem ive got about all girl groups are the ones that constantly create barriers that are n't  there , saying nobody is taking them seriously because they 're women in rock etc. then there 's the others who think by flashing at people is gon na get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands who i listen to , the people that matter will listen to any good music no matter what ! <p> gender is n't an issue ! <p> bones <p> 04-02-2005 , 04:08 AM <p> there 's an all girl band that we 've played with a few times called the Skanks and they 're ace. 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 04-02-2005 , 09:11 PM <p> Le Tigre puts any band you 're about to metion to shame . And they 're a great feminist girl band . <p> The sound of my neighbor 's cat chopped up in a blender is more tolerable than Kittie . <p> nitropenguin ! <p> 04-02-2005 , 10:18 PM <p> Hey ... Kittie is a pretty good band ! Grr . <p> Le Tigre =/ TKO ! *cringes* 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 04-02-2005 , 10:26 PM <p> TKO sucks . Deceptacon , This Island , FYR , and lots of other stuff ... that 's where it 's at ! <p> no. because that would include Tristania , Nightwish , etc. and Dresden Dolls are too ... too ... too fucking alternative . <p> ANYWAYS . <p> post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 05-24-2005 , 12:20 AM <p> I do n't like punk girl bands . they allways got to prove their punk status in their first song . <p> Jimbob2005 <p> 05-24-2005 , 02:12 AM <p> Oh dear . my sister likes Kittie ( they suck ! ! ) 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 05-24-2005 , 04:25 AM <p> Wait , are we talking bands formed ENTIRELY of chicks , or bands with chicks in them ? cuz i 'm sure we all realise there are some FUCKING awesome bands with chicks in ... <p> Sure this is n't a sexist thread , will chill ... <p> Actually yes i agree ( GENERALLY ) with that statement ... but i du n no if that makes them ALL crap ... it 's not fair to judge them all on the basis of bands like Kittie , let 's be honest now . <p> And i still think it 's a shame that all chick bands are singled out for that reason ... as so far the ones that i 've heard do n't really represent the population of female musicians ... maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks ? ? ? 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 05-24-2005 , 04:27 AM <p> I do n't like punk girl bands . they allways got to prove their punk status in their first song . <p> And i sorta agree with that , but i think it 's inevitable ... as it 's such a male dominated scene at the moment .... <p> kaze <p> 05-25-2005 , 12:04 PM <p> There 's one really good chick band around here , great fun to watch and they write some really awesome song . We need more good bands . <p> I have to admit the majority of chick bands are pretty aweful . I 'm female and I prefer playing in a band with guys they do n't argue with each other about stupid little things . <p> Miletic <p> 06-02-2005 , 09:37 PM <p> all full girl bands do suck and the baddest ones are always metal wan na be chicks sorry girls its just the way it is use do n't  have the voice or drum playing skills needed cause all girl drummers look like there straining there asses off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a chick playing drums they sit realy striaght and like hold there sticks realy tight <p> Alot of girl bands suck . me and my friend are creatin a band but were worried people will think were shit wannabe punks ( like the faders ( SHITE ! ) ) . if we can were gon na try get a guy drummer and maybe another guitarist . but i must say i do n't  listen to any girl bands . but the smashing pumpkins have a girl ... is that a girl or just a guy who looks like one and they 're pretty good . <p> i just think everyone is sexist . <p> Moose <p> 06-03-2005 , 01:53 PM <p> not all guys hate girl bands ... but the reason a lot of guys are turned off by girl bands is simply because they can not relate to them ... it is hard to listen to a no doubt album when it is all about the guy she broke up with and then saying i think you 'll make a good dad , its just hard adjusting to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do girls like guy bands ... well one is because you re more used to hearing those kind of songs from that perspective , and two i think certain artists make a conscious effort when they write certain songs about a girl , they do not always use the word she or her , but use more general terms that way all can relate to it , plus i could be wrong , but i think guy bands lyrically write about a number of different things , while girl bands are mostly stuck on one topic . <p> plus some guys do n't  hear the same strength and energy in a girl 's voice or whatever they seem to be looking for in their music , but i think a band like the lunachicks can probably literally kick most guy bands asses in a fight , especially ones like saliva ... but then again ... when the lunachicks have a song about their period its kind of hard to always go along with that as a guy . <p> its a different sound with different lyrics and may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some reasons to why no one takes girl bands seriously or just do n't  like them , i could be wrong , but whatever . 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 06-04-2005 , 09:41 AM <p> while girl bands are mostly stuck on one topic . <p> Stuck on one topic ? Have you ever listened to The Distillers , Hole , L7 , or My Ruin ? There are many similarities between the lyrical contents and any other male-fronted bands in their genres , as its the life experience which for chicks does n't  ALWAYS revolve around males and periods maybe if you 've only ever listened to mainstream bands with female vocalists I 'll let that comment slide , as you 'd most likely be right , just as every other male band is capable of the same superficial and monotone concepts . Need I list some of the classic greats like AC/DC and other such male bands from that era who based their careers on a content of hell , drinking , women and rock n roll <p> plus some guys do n't  hear the same strength and energy in a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their music , but i think a band like the lunachicks can probably literally kick most guy bands asses in a fight , especially ones like saliva ... but then again ... when the lunachicks have a song about their period its kind of hard to always go along with that as a guy . <p> This part of your statement makes me wonder if you have ever listened to a female sing at all . I mean granted , in some bands with female leads the vocals are n't  screaming or blasted , but do n't  you think Portishead , for example , would sound fucking stupid if Beth Gibbons screamed ? And considering male fronted bands in the same genre such as Radiohead , sing in just the same manner And of course there is Brody Dalle of The Distillers , who rocks the vocals just as well as any bloke Dammit there 's another melodic metal band with a chick singer , and in my opinion she is great BECAUSE she does n't  scream dammit that was a really good example , cant remember the name anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question becomes why do girls like guy bands ... one is because you re more used to hearing those kind of songs from that perspective , and two i think certain artists make a conscious effort when they write certain songs about a girl , they do not always use the word she or her , but use more general terms that way all can relate to it , plus i could be wrong , but i think guy bands lyrically write about a number of different things , <p> This part of your argument almost made me reconsider saying anything at all I mean if you honestly believe that then there really is no hope for you at all . You are entitled to your opinion of course but I just think that maybe you should listen to some of the bands listed above and then come back and see if you still believe the same thing I 'm sure many more people can add other bands with chicks in to make the list longer and better <p> its a different sound with different lyrics and may not be what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of the progression of music , AND OUR SOULS , that this is not true . Otherwise audiences are 50% ( if not more , du n no what the average dude/chick ratio any audience is ... ) ignorant and close-minded NO GOD NOOOOO . <p> originalprankster <p> 06-04-2005 , 04:21 PM <p> I know some good bands with girls that are the lead : <p> Yeah Yeah Yeahs The Distillers Garbage <p> Not all girl bands are bad . <p> Brines <p> 06-04-2005 , 04:53 PM <p> The Donnas are n't bad . <p> Moose <p> 06-07-2005 , 08:50 PM <p> flexing wings i was jsut trying to come up with reasons to why guys blow of girl bands ... i 'm not saying they are true or not ... it just seems possible that guys blow off girls in music the way they do girls playing sports ... even if its good , they will never try to listen or watch it , such as the wnba ... i havent heard enough girl bands to make a statement on all of them , however like you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn a lot of guys off ... and as for the power in vocals ... its all a connection with the brain that 's all ... does n't  mean it is n't powerful , it just does n't  get a teenage guy going to let 's say metallica 's " one " as a girl could get going to " just a girl " ... i mean , i cant put any facts to this , i was just trying to bring about some ideas to why a lot of guys simply do n't  even girl bands an honest try ... i mean i myself do n't  go out of my way to listen to girl bands ... possibly because there are n't  that many on my radio or tv for me to be enlightened by them ... either way i was just trying to get some reasons to why guys may blow off girl bands ... <p> i think it some ways its true ... guys , as most humans , are know it alls , and my ways , and assumers , and all that ... so it would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , because its a girl writing and playing the music , specifically writing the music ... it may sound stupid or babyish , but that 's how a lot of people are when it comes to these things ... i 'm not even saying for myself , if someone i considered credible with music taste told me to check out a band , i would n't care if it was a girl band , i 'm just saying there is something in a lot of guys that say " i wont like this " and simply do not give it a chance ... that 's really it . 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 06-08-2005 , 08:11 AM <p> it just does n't  get a teenage guy going to let 's say metallica 's " one " as a girl could get going to " just a girl " ... i mean , i cant put any facts to this , i was just trying to bring about some ideas to why a lot of guys simply do n't  even girl bands an honest try ... i mean i myself do n't  go out of my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  that many on my radio or tv for me to be enlightened by them ... either way i was just trying to get some reasons to why guys may blow off girl bands ... <p> I understand what you are trying to say , and first of all I should clarify that I was not trying to make a personal attack , it 's just that naturally as a female guitarist and writer , the idea that people wo n't check out my music cuz I 'm a chick is apalling ... you know ? <p> Also I am a huuuuuuuge Metallica fan , and I appreciate the music for what it is ( I should post a link or somat to my impending ' Why Metallica are great ' blog on myspace and maybe this will elaborate for you ) and so I find it hard to understand how the gender of a writer is really relevant ... <p> Also ( again ) proportionally I 'm into more male fronted rock bands than female fronted ones ... So I find it hard , though I think I understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not open themselves up to the lyrics and music without just think " eew chick , fuck that shit in the head ... " etc ... 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 06-08-2005 , 08:13 AM <p> its all a connection with the brain that 's all ... <p> I do n't agree with that at all ... how I see it is that some people are lazy and closed minded and ca n't take the time to really give something a chance . <p> Just realise that I have been incredibly stupid ... I forgot that a teenage boy 's memory and connection to losing their limbs in the torment of war is so much more potent than a girls ... funny that considering I actually studied war literature and probably caught the most vulnerable expressions of the pain and strife ... yeah . 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 06-08-2005 , 11:22 AM <p> People think that girl bands suck because most of them do <p> At least Moose had the capacity to see his " ignorance " on the subject . 41168 @qwx451168 <p> 06-09-2005 , 06:23 AM <p> idonno , some girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chick drummer , she 's cool ( probably wont be our drummer if we find a guy that can drum better than her , no hard feelings ) also i think people like see'ing guys rock it out rather than a bunch of chicks .. 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 06-09-2005 , 08:56 AM <p> also i think people like see'ing guys rock it out rather than a bunch of chicks .. <p> *Sighs* If you do n't care about ability , passion and musical message , and would rather judge purely on superficial elements ... then you 're not half the musician you think you are . Especially if you choose to catagorise the difference between visually being good and bad using a band 's gender . <p> the band i 'm in has a chick drummer , she 's cool ( probably wont be our drummer if we find a guy that can drum better than her , no hard feelings ) <p> I do think that if you find a better drummer then naturally that would be the choice , and anyone who blamed you for that would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender into the equation really necessary on depicting that persons ability ? ? ? Especially since the discussion is in full swing with people who are going to be fired up by that statement . <p> Ergo . Gender should have fuck all to do with how good or bad a band is. 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 06-09-2005 , 08:58 AM <p> Flexing Wings : In my opinion , comments as incredibly stupid as the ones that person made do n't deserve the kind of respect you gave it .

That I perhaps wanted to show people that there are many decent bands out their with females ( probably including many we ALL know and love , like Pixies and Pumpkins ) who obviously have just as much right to be heard ? That I perhaps wanted people to understand why gender should not be a factor in music ? <p> Yeah you 're right man , maybe it does say a lot about me .

Although that 's not really correct , since I never think of whether it 's a girl or guy playing the instrument , and although I have to NOTICE whether it 's a guy or a girl singing , I never really think about it . I do n't see why it should matter . If I think a voice does n't fit the music , then I wo n't listen to it , whether it 's a male or female voice . <p> Endless growling and screaming sounds as ugly from a girl as a guy . But that 's a different opinion . My musical opinion is not going to be based on whether the person is a guy or girl per se . If a girl sounds like shit , then she sounds like shit .

And I 'd use one of them ridiculous emoticons - the one for the wink - if I did n't think that emoticons were ridiculous . <p> Anyways , we 've covered that I do n't think gender matters . <p> Aside from that , I have yet to find a girl rock band I like . I 'm not afraid to say that I loved Courtney Love 's song " Mono " , but that I hated most of the album - but I still believe that that 's due to shitty songwriting . Not that I consider myself an amazing judge of songwriting , unlike a lot of guitar players . Haha , but would it kill my credibility if I said that I was a huge fan of " Call Me " by Blondie or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I think that the voices in those songs fit beautifully . They are n't my favorite songs ever , but I still really like them . <p> Ah what the hell , I can admit to an eclectic musical taste . Even if I 'm going to be considered a pussy by a lot of people on this board for not being hardcore enough . Haha - I love Muse , The Living End and The Offspring , so you could say I 'm in search of a pretty unique sound rather than really liking anything . And do n't try telling me that the keyboard solo in Call Me is n't awesome and does n't make you want to dance . <p> MAJOR EDIT - I just listened to a few songs from The Eyeliners . And like them quite a bit . 41178 @qwx451178 <p> 07-04-2005 , 11:36 AM <p> Hehehe *loves* Blondie rules , and me and you can take down any asshole who wants to argue ! ! !

I do n't know if they 're all girls or if just the singer is female , but they were my favorite band until I found out about the offspring ( although excessive radio play is probably the biggest reason they 're not my favorite band anymore ) . I 've never heard their cover of self esteem but even if it does suck , punk is not Evanescence 's style . They still rock at their own style . Also , Garbage has a female singer , and now they 're awesome ! Their new album is one of the best albums of the year , even my dad likes it . Not only that , I also them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were awesome , everybody I know did , regardless of age , gender , etc . The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are okay , too . The Donnas also are good .

Well , I am a boy and I listen to music from both boys and girls . <p> Some music I really enjoy are music composed by girls , I think the majority I enjoy are from girls more than boys . Well , there are songs made my girls which sound very girlish . This really irritates me and spoils the tune . Sure the music is good , but the girlish part makes me hate the song . <p> The Spice Girls make REALLLY good music , but really , their vocals and their style is very girlish , but their musical eliments are still good , enough for me to listen to personally and think of their beauty . Still not something that should be set for standard . <p> Atomic Kitten makes intreresting remixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , they sound better than the originals in my opinion and the originals are boy bands . Except for one song they composed , their songs sound girlish , so I do n't really like their music , but because of their one song and the songs they remade which sounds better , I am a great fan for them . <p> Now about Boy Bands , they are good and I like them , back in the early days , they are good . I write my own songs and produce them , so I am considered a boy artist , my songs are good . A lot of boy artists like David Gray makes good music back in 2000 . Now , the only thing bad about boy artists is that they sound like emotional teenages and annoyingly , girls like that and their boyish tone . The Jonas Brothers and All American Rejects is a great Example . I hate Gives You Hell because of that one reason , otherwise , their tune is good . <p> Quite honestly , I rather hear the annoying teenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that since I am good with music , I can invite Nick Jonas and Tyson Ritter over just to reproduce a girly song with their teenish voice , that would be funny and interesting . : ) <p> Not only are girl bands bad , metal is bad . I can guarantee you I will hate that album . I 'd like to clarify , I ca n't think of a single enjoyable ' girl band ' . Female artists on the other hand , or bands with females in them , are a whole different story . <p> Free ? <p> 01-15-2010 , 03:31 AM <p> llamas would disagree , Girl in a Coma would be her reason . I would agree with her mentioning Sleater Kinney. 41164 @qwx451164 <p> 01-15-2010 , 08:27 AM <p> What about Gossip ? <p> Superdope <p> 01-15-2010 , 08:51 AM <p> The Pierces . <p> There , I said it , I kinda like The Pierces . <p> Llamas <p> 01-15-2010 , 09:34 AM <p> llamas would disagree , Girl in a Coma would be her reason . I would agree with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't automatically mean you suck ... I think the problem is that , when girl bands first started being a thing , girls were forming the bands to prove a point - not to make good music . And most of them could n't play their instruments to save their lives . But things have changed ... and now there are good girl bands amongst the rabble . : ) <p> haha , i love how no one even gives the guy flack for bumping a five year old thread . <p> I will say this : I have nothing against girls in bands . Who cares what gender they are . However : all-girl bands tend to be gimmicky . If the band was really created with the intention of making music then I 'm all for it . But it seems like many ( not all ) female bands have the intent of doing just that , having an all-girl band . Which detracts from the actual music and succumbs to gimmicks . <p> Some really popular bands have girls in them , Smashing Pumpkins people do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any given time . No Doubt is an obvious success story , and lots of people ( eugh ) seem to like Flyleaf . But it seems like these two bands are known for being ... that band with the chick singer . <p> My point is that unless you 're stupid , no one just inherently thinks all-girl bands are bad . It 's just that there is rarely any good ones because many are started for purposes other than actually making music . I ca n't name any bands I like that are all girls . <p> Edit : to the person above me : I like a few songs by the Soviettes , but I was under the impression they have a guy in their band . And they do . This is an example of a band doing it right . It 's clear they did n't form an all-girl band because they wanted to prove they could . They just ended up with 3 girls and a guy , and they sound good doing it . <p> Llamas <p> 01-15-2010 , 02:09 PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy flack for bumping a five year old thread . Did n't even notice it was bumped , ha . <p> I will say this : I have nothing against girls in bands . Who cares what gender they are . However : all-girl bands tend to be gimmicky .

I was dodging arrows and bullets and stuff . really really cool . <p> Jakebert <p> 09-21-2007 , 07:21 AM <p> lol , ninjas r betterrz den piratez lolz . <p> But really , I 'm not big on hearing other people 's dreams . To quote one of my favorite " It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia " lines : " Hearing someone else 's dream is like looking at someone 's pictures . If I 'm not in them , and no one is having sex , then I really do n't care " . <p> T-6005 <p> 09-21-2007 , 07:31 AM <p> I 'm interested in some of the weirder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a friend of mine from high school sat down next to me and explained that I was dreaming , but that he was also asleep and that people who are asleep can communicate with each other at great distances because we all go to the same place when we dream . It was a pretty cool concept and I was kind of hoping it was true when I woke up . <p> KyleW <p> 09-21-2007 , 07:58 AM <p> Aww I had one three nights ago involving The Offspring but that 's all I can remember from it so I 'll desciribe the one before that . <p> I was on my street on haloween and there was Ben ( my mate ) Lauren ( My mate ) and Kyle ( Me : D ) We appered to be trick or treating ( a little old i know but hey , its fun ) and I was at the bottom of the hill I live on and Ben and Lauren were at the top when I noticed Lauren had stolen a toaster from my neighbours house . That 's all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <p> TBD <p> 09-21-2007 , 08:08 AM <p> I was driving up a mountain with my friend and I repeatedly drove the car off the side of the rode , like 5 times . I do n't get it . I mean , how did my car get back up each time ? <p> KyleW <p> 09-21-2007 , 08:23 AM <p> I was driving up a mountain with my friend and I repeatedly drove the car off the side of the rode , like 5 times . I do n't get it . I mean , how did my car get back up each time ? <p> It was a dream , anything can happen in a dream : D <p> nieh <p> 09-21-2007 , 08:50 AM <p> I had a dream that one of my friends from work broke up with the gay guy from work , even though he 's gay and she 's a girl . I remember being confused in the dream and wondering how they had such a bitter break-up when I did n't even know they were dating in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mota Boy <p> 09-21-2007 , 09:06 AM <p> ... I was dreaming , but that he was also asleep and that people who are asleep can communicate with each other at great distances because we all go to the same place when we dream ... Oh man , that was my first lucid dream ! The summer after second grade , when I was on vacation , I dreamt I was in school , got confused , realized I was dreaming , explained to my teacher what was going on ( " Mrs. Palmer - this is a dream , can I go say goodbye to my friends ? " ) I was really disappointed when it did n't work . <p> I was driving up a mountain with my friend and I repeatedly drove the car off the side of the rode , like 5 times . I hate driving in dreams . The combination of the rigid rules of the road and the free-for-all dream atmosphere always freak me out . I 'm always thinking " What the hell , am I drunk ? God , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm driving on the wrong side of the road or through a bowling alley or some shit . <p> KyleW <p> 09-21-2007 , 09:12 AM <p> I love it when you dream and then sorta half wake up to the point where you are know you are awake and you can control the ending of your dream . Mine normally end with Mr. T Coming down nd going " FOOL ! " Its quality ! <p> Meg <p> 09-21-2007 , 11:09 AM <p> Last night/this morning actually . There were people shoving needles in people 's necks to make them do something . At one point I remember rugby tackling my boyfriend too . I ca n't really remember much more now . But when I have dreams they 're usually shit-scary , as they 're very realistic , sometimes completely mental , and sometimes perfectly plausible . 41118 @qwx451118 <p> 09-21-2007 , 12:02 PM <p> A couple of days ago I had a dream that I was making out with Alan Rickman . Which was pretty nice . I wish I could have the same dream again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dreams fall under one of these three categories : <p> - Being on vacation with my family - Being at the video arcade and not playing any games - Smoking or doing drugs <p> I do n't know why . Dr. Freud ? 41136 @qwx451136 <p> 09-21-2007 , 01:18 PM <p> I 've not been able to sleep well for the last 2-3 days , most probably because of stress and last night , for the 3-4 hours I 've slept , I had weird dreams . : / <p> I had been kidnapped by a bunch of people I did n't know , they projected to kill me and they all thought it was funny . I do n't remember everything they were saying , but at the end , there was a guy in front of me who was trying to attack my face with a nail gun or something that looked a little like that , anyway . <p> I also dreamt that my mother was dying in front of me . Nice . <p> It probably means that I will become a murderer or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed about going to a Wizard magazine convention in a flying pick up truck driven by a Siberian husky wearing sunglasses . <p> It was pretty standard . <p> Oromis <p> 09-21-2007 , 07:49 PM <p> I was floating in the air . I could like swim through the air , I was weightless . It was so awesome . It felt really great , like in the dream my body felt so good , so light , so easy , so powerful . Idk , and i 'm tired as hell right now . <p> T-6005 <p> 09-21-2007 , 07:56 PM <p> I dreamed about going to a Wizard magazine convention in a flying pick up truck driven by a Siberian husky wearing sunglasses . <p> It was pretty standard . I have to admit dreams based purely on the fantastic like this are of absolutely no interest to me . I feel that the most interesting ones are the ones that mix the real world and possible real locations with purely imagined concepts that you can almost believe . <p> Andy <p> 09-21-2007 , 07:59 PM <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late and I 'm very tired so bear with me if it 's difficult to follow . <p> Not my most recent , but my most bizarre : About four years back I had a recurring dream where I was trying to escape from prison . Now , these dreams lasted around six days and each night I was escaping from a different prison in time . By this I mean the first night I was in a medieval dungeon , and in the last one I was in this ultra-modern glass/perspex-walled cyberprison . It was so weird how it was essentially the exact same dream , but in such different settings . <p> I 'm sure a psychiatrist would say that it was my subconscious trying to tell me it felt trapped or something and desperately wanted to find a way out . Whatever . <p> Either way it was well strange . <p> My most recent was one of those ones that was so bizarre that even though I can remember it perfectly , I ca n't even try and piece it together to write a coherent report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in right now . <p> I really do n't dream enough that I want to . No , that 's wrong - we all dream , it 's just a case of whether we remember . <p> Right , I 'm going to eat some cheese ! Dreams ahoy ! <p> Mister sandman , bring me a dream ... <p> SkunkIt <p> 09-21-2007 , 10:28 PM <p> Jumping Flash <p> ! ! ! <p> The last dream I remember , was a few months ago . Me and Byron Lee were on the dance floor doing the Funky Chicken to the " Soca Butterfly " and Mexican women surrounded us , wearing fruit hats and red dresses and singing along with Byron Lee . <p> Thomas <p> 09-22-2007 , 01:24 PM <p> I dreamt that the Playstation 3 went down to $300 . <p> Apparently my sub-concious mind is a very very silly place . <p> Andy <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 went down to $300 . <p> It was a wet dream , yeah ? <p> Thomas <p> 09-22-2007 , 01:49 PM <p> It was a wet dream , yeah ? <p> basically . <p> I was extremely angry when I woke and realised it was a dream . <p> F@ BANKZ <p> 09-22-2007 , 02:54 PM <p> I was in this beautiful garden , pounding the crap out of a shopkeeper . <p> BREAK <p> 09-22-2007 , 03:29 PM <p> Last night I dreamed that my mother died . I was n't upset about it , I just thought " One down , one to go . " She got killed by some random stray bullet in the streets of Washington , D.C. or something . Nobody could tell whether I truly felt no grief or I was just repressing it . I took a few drags off a cigarette and then said " OK , now I can show emotion . " But , you know , I was more sad that my dad did n't die too than anything else . <p> Earlier in the night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking down the street by my house . As he comes up he 's talking all this shit like " C'm on MOTHERFUCKER , YOU AI N'T SHIT , I 'LL FUCK YOU UP " , etc . But the only weapon I 've got is a broom . They ( the martial arts masters , I guess ) told me to hit him between the eyes with it in a thrusting motion . If I did it right , he 'd die , if I did n't he 'd kill me . The first time it seems I did it right , he stops dead in his tracks and falls over . So I let my guard down but then he gets up , pissed off and says " WHAT , THAT 'S ALL YOU GOT , YOU COCKSUCKER ? YOU WILL FUCKING DIE " so I do it again , harder this time . He goes down and then gets up again , swearing and calling me a faggot . This happens at least one more time . Neither of us die though . I hate my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last night I dreamed that my mother died . I was n't upset about it , I just thought " One down , one to go . " <p> you have two moms ? ha <p> goneaway89 <p> 09-23-2007 , 03:46 AM <p> not me but a really good friend of mine had a dream where he fought i want to say it was the silver surfer or some other hero/villain and when he woke up he was standing on his stairs a good 10 feet from his room he tod me the next day i laughed about that one for a while . <p> Offspringfan67 <p> 09-23-2007 , 06:36 AM <p> wow , you guys have weird dreams , my dreams are usually centered around reality with no magic/weird stuff happening . rememberig dreams is challenging though <p> Thomas <p> 09-24-2007 , 06:17 AM <p> I dreamt that someone nuked my school and in celebration , I had sex . <p> Not quite suure about the connection between the two , but it was an enjoyable dream nonetheless . <p> yarock <p> 09-09-2010 , 10:54 AM <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dream , and you acknowledged it , dealing with it , accepting the fact that your heart is not gon na beat no more .. <p> And than you wake up.Nothing is anomalous.Life goes on . <p> Happened to me last night.A really different experience , dying in your dream.It 's nothing like you 're falling off of a rooftop and suddenly open your eyes , it 's really different.I have to admit that it 's hard to not get superstitious , but I 'm having a lot of weird dreams lately.It 's also hard to get relaxed these days , so I 'm guessing the dreams wo n't settle for a while . <p> T-6005 <p> 09-09-2010 , 11:13 AM <p> This thread made me realize something that 's been kicking around in my head for a little while . <p> I 've been dreaming constantly for the last month or so . Like 2-3 dreams I remember a night , and they are all fucking weird . At this point , I just wish they 'd stop . <p> Superdope <p> 09-09-2010 , 02:58 PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my girlfriend . We never got around to solving any crimes , though , because we were too busy arguing over what the name of said detective bureau should be . I even had the brownish trench coat and the magnifying glass and all . 41147 @qwx451147 <p> 09-10-2010 , 05:35 AM <p> I recently dreamt that I started a defective bureau with my girlfriend . <p> That 's what I read at first . That would suck . <p> " Jeg er civilbetjent . " " Nej Ole , du er SENIL dement . " <p> batfish <p> 09-10-2010 , 08:07 AM <p> I 've often been told that you ca n't dream about dying ; if you feel you 're falling , you wake up before hitting the ground . I do n't know how that jives with this - <p> I dreamt the other day that I was burning my own corpse ( of me aged 6 ) in a funeral pyre in the back garden . Strangers turned up and we danced around the fire . I picked through the fire after it had gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked how I could be dead and alive at the same time , my dad replied , " Do n't you know , you died when you were six . " 41153 @qwx451153 <p> 09-10-2010 , 09:49 AM <p> I had a really disturbing dream that I somehow got duped into helping my buddies murder somebody and we had her in garbage bags in a car figuring out where to leave the body . I felt really dirty when I woke up from that one . <p> This . <p> I tend to have extremely realistic dreams . Sometimes they take a turn for the horrific and they are so damn believable . I wake up feeling disturbed as fuck . Ones in which I murder somebody are the worst . Because it 's always someone I care about it . And did I mention it 's so damn realistic ? Upon waking I feel like it really happened . The knowledge that it did n't happen does n't actually help much . <p> Usually though my dreams are fun , full of action and adventure in which the realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrities , or doing impossible things like flying . I can wake up and relate my dreams to someone and they still seem fairly plausible more often than not . But man , the bad ones are bad . <p> ad8 <p> 09-10-2010 , 12:15 PM <p> I recently dreamed that I was in my house and the doorbell rang , but when I opened it there was only a baby and a bunch of wasps attacking it . That was creepy as hell . Oh , and I dreamed that I walked into a night club and smiled at the first girl that was standing in there . That was creepy , but in a different sense . <p> Lizardus <p> 09-10-2010 , 02:11 PM <p> Oh , and I dreamed that I walked into a night club and smiled at the first girl that was standing in there . That was creepy , but in a different sense . <p> Did you had sex with her ? In her vagina ? <p> Free ? <p> 09-10-2010 , 02:46 PM <p> A friend of mine ( who is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell difference between AC/DC and Bad Religion ) was perfectly performing Frank Turner 's songs ( playing an acoustic guitar and singing ) while we were driving in a limousine . I was speechless at how he nailed it . <p> To what T said earlier about sleeping on back - whenever I do I have nightmares . Every single fucking time . Slipping down into a giant snake 's mouth , hiding from a starwars-like LONG ... thing and failing , falling into darkness , etc , in the last one I had a rat sitting on my neck and biting it . I wish I had sex dreams instead . <p> calichix <p> 09-12-2010 , 12:29 AM <p> soooo gross alert- <p> ( I dreamt this after reading a vanity fair article on lady gaga ) <p> so I was scuba diving at night with a faceless dude , and this really effeminate merman swam up to us , he was an albino with long white hair and no facial hair . he said , " i 'm a woman now . " and whips out his dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " no you 're not dude , you 've got ta have these ( at which point he grabs my boobs ) and you got ta have a vagina . that 's a man part you 've got . you 're a man . " and the merman shot off backwards into the darkness , screaming and crying , and we could hear him crying after he disappeared . <p> ultimate wtf . <p> then it switched to a dream about tigers . I was walking across some rocks past a swimming hole to a bamboo fortress up a hill where my homegirl was hanging out , and as I climbed up the hill a bunch of tigers started eating everyone in the water . I got in the fortress and sealed up the holes with mud , and planted spinach , which grew instantly . and we had phones but I did n't want to call anyone cause I was worried they 'd hurt the tigers , and they were so beautiful I wanted to wait it out . then I found some skullcaps with chinese symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not it 'd be a good idea to face a tiger high on mushrooms . 41153 @qwx451153 <p> 09-12-2010 , 01:58 AM <p> Pretty sure this thread caused me to remember a dream this morning . It was an awesome one . Completely like a movie , with a plot similar to The Sixth Sense or The Others . I was n't even in it at all . Just somehow watching it all like it was a movie . <p> It 's kinda funny how all you have to do in order to remember your dreams better is just sort of want to remember your dreams better . And it just happens . <p> For Real <p> 09-13-2010 , 09:05 PM <p> I recently dreamt that family , friends , guests were all going to a special event all dressed up , but going there over the snow on snow mobiles ! It hardly ever snows where I live , so what 's up with that ? Anyways , my mom was very particular about her outfits - at least three outfits/suits/dresses and they all three had to be yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hearing nice pleasant chatter of people saying , " Who are you riding with ? Wait for me ! It 's cold out there , but not too bad ! Man what fun ! " and then I realized it was like a wedding or something . Only thing is , people were traveling very long distances , but quickly , and I saw a map of the U.S. from top to bottom and these people travelled on snowmobiles from top to bottom and back again . It was weird , but are n't all dreams ? However , it was very very lifelike , very real , another dream vision of some sort . Strange , but really cool . : cool : <p> dffpunk <p> 09-14-2010 , 01:45 AM <p> soooo gross alert- <p> ( I dreamt this after reading a vanity fair article on lady gaga ) <p> so I was scuba diving at night with a faceless dude , and this really effeminate merman swam up to us , he was an albino with long white hair and no facial hair . he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his dick , and jizzes. and the dude scuba diving with me said , " no you 're not dude , you 've got ta have these ( at which point he grabs my boobs ) and you got ta have a vagina . that 's a man part you 've got . you 're a man .

Sounds like a screenplay for some Adult Swim cartoon . <p> My Name Was Taken <p> 09-15-2010 , 05:37 AM <p> My dream consisted of a very ... akward confrontation with one of the board members . <p> AllIn All It 's Not So Bad <p> 09-15-2010 , 05:02 PM <p> I had a dream that was very " wtf ? " <p> I was driving my dad 's pickup truck up a set of stairs . <p> No , wait . I was attempting to drive it up a set of stairs . After I drove it half-way up the stairs , I got out of the truck and ate everything in my fridge . I literally ate EVERYTHING in my fridge . Like , it was so empty , that it looked like if it was brand new . 
@@44116034 @4116034/ <p> Okay I realize this was many years ago , but my tour of teh internetz had me stumble upon this site , that had an excerpt from an issue of Guitarworld . In this excerpt Guitarist Zakk Wylde blows off some steam at Dave Grohl and The Offspring : <p> " Nor is Zakk remotely shy about expressing his distaste for some of the songs on Down To Earth or many of the songwriters who contibuted material . He is particularly pissed off at Dave Grohl , the former Nirvana drummer , who now plays guitar with his group , Foo Figters . " If I ever run into Dave Grohl , I 'm gon na kick his fuckin ' ass , " Zakk fumes . " Because I think he sucks , and he wrote this cheese-dick song for Ozzy that I have to fucking play on , And I 'll never forgive him for that . Foo Fighters is a fucking candy-ass girl band , but you got that motherfucker submitting songs , and those douche bags from the Offspring submitting songs too . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo if they tried . Dave Grohl ? Fuck Dave Grohl ! Let him get up there and play ' Mr. Crowley ' ; he ca n't fuckin ' do it ! And it 's like you 're getting this guy to write songs for Ozzy ? Just because he played for fucking Shitvana ? " <p> anyone know anything about this ? I checked " Down to Earth " for personnel , but no sign of Grohl or The Offspring . <p> findout5 <p> 01-23-2008 , 11:13 AM <p> I actually knew this . A few years ago Ozzy was " collecting material " for his new album . Dexter wrote a song for Ozzy that he did n't use . I do n't think this song has been recorded by The Offspring though , and I 'm dead sure Ozzy did n't record it . I also know there were phone conversations - Dexter said it in a interview . <p> I know of one song/riff that Dave Grohl wrote for Ozzy but ended up on a Foo Fighters album - the song Stacked Actors ( from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if there are more ... <p> Zakk Wylde is one of the cheesiest guitar players out there , with all those constantly annoying bendings . He should really wash his mouth with a lot of soap/cleaning products , cos it 's pretty full of shit . Anyway ... Ozzy is so talented that he does n't write music , only words and has a contract and all the following he has . Perhaps Zakk should have noted that ... or the fact that his own band - Black Label Society sucks more ass than a pornstar ! Perhaps Zakk should learn how to write a song ... <p> To conclude , Dexter or Grohl have more talent in their pinkies than Zakk or Ozzy have on both their bodies ! <p> Moose <p> 01-23-2008 , 11:34 AM <p> ... stacked actors is the best song on that album ... that does n't  say much since that album was terrible , but that 's a great song . <p> Jakebert <p> 01-23-2008 , 12:35 PM <p> Jesus , while I 'm not the biggest Offspring/Foos fan in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan <p> 01-23-2008 , 01:58 PM <p> If i saw this big ugly dickhead Zakk Wild i would beat him up , you just do n't throw shit at the offspring . <p> the hitcher <p> 01-23-2008 , 02:56 PM <p> Apart from looking like a bad asterix the viking impersonator if he did disrespect the offspring or the foos for that matter he wants castrating . <p> I also happen to play guitar ... and I believe his bendings/dive bombs are FUCKING ANNOYING . Like I said before , perhaps he should learn how to write songs with the guitar , cos the ones he writes are really lame . <p> Oh , and the Foos 3rd album is pretty sweet . <p> Rest my case <p> holland25 <p> 01-24-2008 , 10:14 AM <p> Well , Zakk is an outstanding guitarist , but I really hate assholes who abuse people they do n't even know , or maybe never met before ... <p> II NOODLES II <p> 01-24-2008 , 10:18 AM <p> Man that 's a bit harsh for the two bands showing generosity towards Ozzy <p> T-6005 <p> 01-24-2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asterix the viking impersonator if he did disrespect the offspring or the foos for that matter he wants castrating . <p> The Offspring rock above him . <p> Asterix is not a viking . <p> ixnay04 <p> 01-24-2008 , 01:25 PM <p> wow .... zack freaked out for no reason . no reason at all . What an ego he has . <p> randman21 <p> 01-24-2008 , 02:37 PM <p> I 've always despised Zakk . He 's the Bam Margera of music . Tries entirely to hard to be pissed off . Other than his appearance on ATHF , he 's completely useless . <p> Llamas <p> 01-24-2008 , 04:39 PM <p> He 's quite a talented guitarist/singer , coneman introduced me to some of his acoustic work ... very respectable , and a better guitarist than Dave or Dexter ... but dude . First of all , if you could write good enough music for your band to play , maybe other people would n't have to try to write for you . Second , regardless of circumstances , it 's just fucking shitty to talk like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your band . wtf . <p> mrconeman <p> 01-24-2008 , 05:00 PM <p> anyone know anything about this ? I checked " Down to Earth " for personnel , but no sign of Grohl or The Offspring . Yes . It was a whole shitty situation where Zakk started his new band , Black Label Society , so Ozzy decided to A : Look for a new touring guitarist , B : have a bunch of different people writing songs for him , but the thing is Zakk did n't agree to this , he has every right in the world to be that pissed off at the bands trying to write his album for him . It was all resolved in the end though , but the only objection I have to Zakk 's little rant is the terribly immature " Shitvana " , but his points were entirely understandable when you know the whole situation . <p> Zakk Wylde is one of the cheesiest guitar players out there , with all those constantly annoying bendings . He should really wash his mouth with a lot of soap/cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway ... Ozzy is so talented that he does n't write music , only words and has a contract and all the following he has . Perhaps Zakk should have noted that ... or the fact that his own band - Black Label Society sucks more ass than a pornstar ! Perhaps Zakk should learn how to write a song ... <p> To conclude , Dexter or Grohl have more talent in their pinkies than Zakk or Ozzy have on both their bodies ! Bullfucking shit . Neither Dexter or Dave hold a candle to Zakk wylde in terms of singing , song writing , lyric writing ( even though Zakk 's lyrics are sub-par at best ) or the physical guitar playing . I 'm not going to bother going into it though , you 're a GOD moron . <p> Jesus , while I 'm not the biggest Offspring/Foos fan in the world , Zakk Wild is a fucking dickhead . I can see how you 'd think it , and yeah chewing out the bands who were asked to write for Ozzy is a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most down to earth and nicest guys to his fans , there 's a new story about him being in a guitar shop and buying kids hella expensive Gibson Les Pauls just for recognising him almost every week . You have to understand he was in a shitty situation . <p> If i saw this big ugly dickhead Zakk Wild i would beat him up , you just do n't throw shit at the offspring . You 're not only an idiot , but to stoop to your level , Zakk Wylde is pretty huge . haha . <p> He 's quite a talented guitarist/singer , coneman introduced me to some of his acoustic work ... very respectable , and a better guitarist than Dave or Dexter ... but dude . First of all , if you could write good enough music for your band to play , maybe other people would n't have to try to write for you . Second , regardless of circumstances , it 's just fucking shitty to talk like that about people who were trying to do a NICE thing for your band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all though , in his eyes he was being replaced in his own band while he tried to do a bit of a side project . And not only could he write for that album , but he wrote a Black Label Society one while writing Ozzy 's . I 'd be pissed off too . It is shitty the way he spoke down about the other bands , but every one of his points were valid , writing for Ozzy kind of has a lineage , his points about Dexter and Dave holding absolutely nothing on the likes of Randy Rhoads , or for that matter Tony Iommi , or Jake E Lee , or Zakk himself were perfectly justified . But yes , anyone who 's heard Zakk Wylde 's solo album would know extremely quickly who the more talented musician is between Dave , Dexter and Zakk . It might not be nice to run your mouth like that , but it 's not like he was wrong . <p> Llamas <p> 01-24-2008 , 05:09 PM <p> Well , then I can see where he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points could be valid . However , I ca n't begin to accept that how he spoke was remotely not dickheaded . I doubt that Dexter or Dave was trying to be an asshole , or say they were better musicians than Zakk ... more like Ozzy was being a dick . Also , if he 's got a problem with these people , I think there are WAYYYYYYY more mature/less disgusting ways of dealing with it . Like , talking to the people involved , rather than ranting and insulting them in a place that will get published . <p> mrconeman <p> 01-24-2008 , 05:12 PM <p> I totally agree , he handeled himself badly given the situation , but y'know , he 's not exactly a gentle soul of a man , he looks like a viking lumber jack , and drinks constantly , you ca n't expect subtlety from the man . Basically my view is that he was spot on in what he was saying , it 's just he could have left the attitude out , but it does n't really make it any less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon Osbournes doing , anything Ozzy 's done in the last 20 some years has been somewhat controlled by Sharon . Who is a cunt . Like , of the highest degree . <p> findout5 <p> 01-25-2008 , 02:56 AM <p> My point again : Zakk Wylde sucks . Offspring + FF Rule . Period . <p> And Coneman , I do n't like being insulted . So , in the immortal words of Eric Cartman : SUCK MY BALLS . <p> Jakebert <p> 01-25-2008 , 10:12 AM <p> Yes . It was a whole shitty situation where Zakk started his new band , Black Label Society , so Ozzy decided to A : Look for a new touring guitarist , B : have a bunch of different people writing songs for him , but the thing is Zakk did n't agree to this , he has every right in the world to be that pissed off at the bands trying to write his album for him . It was all resolved in the end though , but the only objection I have to Zakk 's little rant is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely understandable when you know the whole situation . <p> Bullfucking shit . Neither Dexter or Dave hold a candle to Zakk wylde in terms of singing , song writing , lyric writing ( even though Zakk 's lyrics are sub-par at best ) or the physical guitar playing . I 'm not going to bother going into it though , you 're a GOD moron .. <p> A lot of other musicians balance a lot more projects with much higher quality than Zakk does . He may have technical skill , but he 's a poor songwriter . If he was a better musician , he could have handled all that was on his plate , and done so much more adult-like than spouting off the kind of crap he did there . He sounded like a spoiled child . Zakk generally writes mostly generic butt-rock that , aside from Ozzy 's vocals , blends in with everything else in that genre . He has no right to slag off other bands . <p> And yes , before I get accused of not doing so , I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Label Society , and I 've never been impressed . <p> I can see how you 'd think it , and yeah chewing out the bands who were asked to write for Ozzy is a bit of a dicky thing to do , but Zakk is actually one of the most down to earth and nicest guys to his fans , there 's a new story about him being in a guitar shop and buying kids hella expensive Gibson Les Pauls just for recognising him almost every week . You have to understand he was in a shitty situation . <p> So what if he does nice things , that does n't mean that he gets an excuse for acting like a douche , regardless of the situation . A musician going around and insulting other bands like that in the press , regardless of the situation , is pretty immature . Even when it 's a band I like that does that , I get annoyed by it , mainly because of the ego involved . It 's even worse when the person sounds like Venom Symbiote or some generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think most of us are forgetting that Ozzy 's solo career , minus his first two albums , has generally been one of the most overrated crap-fests in music history . <p> mrconeman <p> 01-25-2008 , 10:51 AM <p> I do n't see where you 're disputing anything I said . I 'm entirely in agreement with you . It was an assholish way to act , but he 's not all bad is all I was saying . <p> And yes , Ozzy 's solo career is an extremely over-rated mess . Besides his work with Randy Rhoads it 's majorly hit and miss , with emphasis on the miss . <p> findout5 <p> 01-25-2008 , 11:37 AM <p> Sometimes I wonder if Ozzy would be as known as he is if he had n't been on Black Sabbath ( he did n't write his lyrics though , Geezer did ) . <p> And I now kind of get the Shitvana talk ... he hates Nirvana cos Nirvana KILLED all cock rock ... and Zakk does use his guitar as an extension of his small penis ... thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratt , Cinderella , Ozzy , Winger and a lot more crap on a daily basis ! <p> MOTO13 <p> 01-25-2008 , 11:58 AM <p> Bullfucking shit .

Mozart wrote for an entire orchestra , but only knew how to play piano- which is n't even in an orchestra . Most of the best writers who ever lived could write for many genres , styles , and instruments , regardless of whether they themselves could play it . I really think that 's irrelevant . <p> SelfEsteem94 <p> 04-17-2009 , 07:35 PM <p> hell , Noodles can play anything i 'm sure . and Zakk probably just prefers classic rock and has no taste for punk music , but the shit he 's saying about bands that probably look up to him makes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 04-17-2009 , 07:41 PM <p> Well .. : Zakc Wylde is awesome ... <p> End of thread <p> he s not bad , he s good but soooo overrated 41125 @qwx451125 <p> 04-17-2009 , 07:55 PM <p> I do n't care how much I dislike an artist 's music , I would n't call them douchebags or say they have no talent whatsoever .

You honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Yours is the dumbest post in this thread .. song-writing OBVIOUSLY trumps musician ship of any form ! In 10 minutes - I shit you not - I could gather a band together on the phone just from the people I know in Budapest who are better musicians at their instrument then ANY of the guys in the Offspring .. perhaps even Pete . I 've been looking for the best music since I was 2 and in the past 15 years I could n't find anything better than the Offspring , and their songs . <p> There are ( more likely than not ) millions of people better skilled at their instruments than the guys in the Offspring . There is however no better music out there . <p> How does song-writing NOT trump musician ship ? <p> I only knew how to play guitar , and shit I taught myself , but from very early on I noticed - to be the best you need the most practice , and who ever is the best is the best because he 's practiced the most . Fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a question of dedication and preparation , and although at the very high ends of the spectrum the shit largely becomes subjective and a question of talent , but ANYONE can become a superb guitar player by dedication . So how is that so special then ? It 's a skill which can be learned , not an ability that you either have or you don't.

As soon as the dumb hair bands ruined metal in the mainstream , all of a sudden Offspring starts playing Punk Rock . Being active in the music industry for the past 20 years , I 've witnessed it FIRSTHAND . &lt;Even the most famous punk musician give them a lot of credit , I 'm talking about the music&gt; Really ? Name the musician ? &lt;Give me your reason&gt; Lyrics are dumb . Music is sub-par . Upper class rich kids playing Punk Rock . Do n't believe everything you 've read about how hard it was for them growing up . Clear enough for you ? &lt;Why are they are n't they punk rock ? &gt; See answer above . ps : Watch a movie called Punk 's Not Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Music War " Or the first Decline Of The Western Civilization . THAT ME OLD SON , IS PUNK ROCK . <p> by SeanZombiePart2 7 minutes ago ( Tue Feb 19 2008 22:46:35 ) Yeah cause they listen to metal growing up means they 're frauds . And coming out of a Social D show which mind you know is n't a punk band cause it 's metal , and they decided to make a band . Oh and they decided to make a band when hair metal died , which happened in the late 80 's , cause ya know they started in 84 . Well if you 've seen PUNKS NOT DEAD then you would know the musicians that did . The lyrics are dumb ? How so ? Do you see Dexter writing lyrics with hidden messages , no he 's straight forward . I never read anything about them growing up on a hard life I dono where you got that from . Once again you have n't given me the reason why you say they 're music is n't PUNK . Not their SCENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then anything , I listen to everything including a lot of metal , so if I started a punk band , I 'm a fraud ? <p> barangatang <p> 02-19-2008 , 11:54 PM <p> Yes they is ! <p> WebDudette <p> 02-20-2008 , 12:05 AM <p> This is the worse discussion ever , like fr srs . <p> But , no they is not . <p> . : SMASH : . <p> 02-20-2008 , 12:20 AM <p> Grow up . What the hell kind of argument is that ? For starters , The Ramones and Sex Pistols were the founders of punk and they fuckin sucked balls . They could barely play their instruments . Argue what you want , but I know damn well that at least 20 Ramones songs have the same chord progression . <p> But with that aside , Offspring are a friggen good band and that 's all that counts , who gives a SHIT what genre they are . <p> Denial , Revisited <p> 02-20-2008 , 12:38 AM <p> Are The Offspring punk ? ............. <p> .................. <p> Do bears shit in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' awesome : eek : : cool : <p> Dr.evil <p> 02-20-2008 , 12:44 AM <p> just to add another for the person above ....... dose a one legged duck swim in circles ? ? ? ? <p> Denial , Revisited <p> 02-20-2008 , 12:46 AM <p> just to add another for the person above ....... dose a one legged duck swim in circles ? ? ? ? <p> Haha that was my original response- but I was n't sure whether everyone would get the reference *high fives* 41176 @qwx451176 <p> 02-20-2008 , 12:52 AM <p> I think The Offspring is punk-pop . I used to think they were pop-punk , but I do n't think so anymore . <p> I also think that , at a time , The Offspring was just punk , but they 've had punk-pop influences as far back as Ignition . <p> Still , I say it does n't really matter . 41124 @qwx451124 <p> 02-20-2008 , 04:58 AM <p> 1 ) Stop posting on IMDB , you 'll live a much happier life . 2 ) I really hate these discussions , especially since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is <p> Ie , if you follow the definition found in the Oxford English Dictionary then <p> Yes the Offspring are a punk band , and that the guys in the band certainly are punk rockers . On a personal level , I certainly would associate the band with the punk scene , even if they have sold millions of albums , and that that punk or pop-punk is the most accurate term to describe their sound . 41151 @qwx451151 <p> 02-20-2008 , 05:09 AM <p> I tried to start this tread , but it got lost somewhere:confused : The Offspring are not the typical Punk-rock band . But as every fan should know , they are from California . So they were influenced by a lot of great Californian punkrockers . And now they got between them . The DVD Punks not dead was released and they are on it . So I think it is clear now ! : D When they started the band they were kinda hardcore , but learned how to play the instruments and made the hell of music . Try to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end I think they belong to what 's called PUNK , they did n't  started it of course , but continued on it . They are my icons ! : D : cool : <p> holland25 <p> 02-20-2008 , 05:11 AM <p> The DVD Punk&amp;#180 ; s not dead was released and they are on it . So I think it is clear now ! : D <p> Well , MCR , Good Charlotte and Sum 41 are also on the video , and I do n't consider them ' punk ' ... 41151 @qwx451151 <p> 02-20-2008 , 05:15 AM <p> Well , MCR , Good Charlotte and Sum 41 are also on the video , and I do n't consider them ' punk ' ... <p> Well sorry , I have n't bought it yet . And only saw something on youTube.com . And Dexter , Lars , Tim and Fat Mike were talking how tough was it back in the 80s:D <p> Peedr <p> 02-20-2008 , 07:17 AM <p> Well , MCR , Good Charlotte and Sum 41 are also on the video , and I do n't consider them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , except , &amp;#239 ; nstead of Sum 41 , I was going to mention The Used . But does n't matter anyway . The point is that being in that film does n't have to mean they 're punk actually . <p> Anyway , my opinion on The Offspring 's genre is following : They started on punk , with some hardcore songs too . They 've been changing and improving themselves during all their activity , they went to punk rock and were part of the scene that got huge . Since 1984 when the band was established , they made some " true " punk rock song , the other ones were poppier , radio friendly , some were political , others were more hardcore . You have to take every aspect of what the ever did .

She 's still at the EXACT SAME point in her life now as she was the day I met her . Still same job she despises ( at Pathmark supermarket ) , still living at home with abusive family , and her new boyfriend has all the qualities she tried to instill in me that would 've kept me home and docile and pathetic . <p> I feel like Jeff Weaver on the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals .

What I meant was that I was performing horribly in an horribly horrible life situation ( that relationship ) , then got saved in the nick of time ( the breakup , which happened right as talks about moving in together were starting to get serious ) and ended up feeling like a World Champ ( going back to school , finding a job , and ending up here , at a really good college ) . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 08-12-2007 , 08:59 PM <p> Ah , OK .

@@44116046 @4116046/ <p> Well , out of three replies ( other than the OP ) from obviously well spoken people , we have a total of seven words and both were trolls . <p> You fucking people piss all over yourselves with the Trayvon/Zimmerman case and you have no idea what actually happend . Here we have video evidence of a beating and nobody cares . Now , nobody was killed , but it simply illustrates unless it 's a black victim , people wo n't even call it a hate crime or even a racist attack and just look the other way . I would like to thank our two fine finger sniffing members who replied and furthered this discussion . <p> Chainsaw <p> 08-15-2013 , 08:19 AM <p> You did n't provide any reference regarding the incident you 're talking about . It 's not that surprising the replies are n't what you hoped they 'd be . <p> MOTO13 <p> 08-15-2013 , 09:31 AM <p> August 9 , 2013 <p> A student in Pinellas County , Florida was violently beat up by three other students on a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , being a " responsible " adult , would do something to intervene and help the victim . But in this case , the student receiving the brutal beating was offered no help . <p> The bus driver , 64-year-old John Moody , was heard yelling into his radio , " I got a fight ! I need help in a hurry , I got a fight I need help in a hurry ! " However , Moody did not intervene or do anything himself to stop the violence . This passive behavior is shocking , coming from a seasoned bus driver with 18 years of experience . <p> The three attackers targeted the student for snitching on them for selling pot . <p> The three 15-year-old attackers were Julian McKnight , Khemradj Lloyd and Joshua Reddin . They beat up the victim so viciously , that he suffered from a broken arm and two black eyes . <p> Police Chief Robert Vincent originally wanted to press charges against Moody for not helping the victim during the incident . Vincent said to WFLA TV , " There was clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare of the children or the child in this case , and he did n't  make any effort to do so . " <p> However , after reviewing the law , Vincent found that school bus officers are not required to intervene in violent situations like this one . <p> Therefore , Moody is not charged with anything . In an attempt to get sympathy from the critical public , Moody said the attack will " haunt " him . <p> Really ? ! What about the student who got beaten up ? He is the one who actually deserves sympathy . <p> The three aggressors have been arrested and charged with aggravated battery . <p> On a side note , some have noticed that this incident has been underreported by the mainstream media . It could be because the attackers in this case were black and the victim was white . <p> Something tells me that if the tables were turned , and white teens had viciously attacked a black student , this would be dubbed a " racially charged " attack . <p> Bottom line : violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Former Rep. Allen West wants to know why more Americans are not outraged about the violent beating of a 13-year-old Florida student on a school bus this summer . <p> " I continue to hear silence on the case of the three black teenagers who viciously attacked the younger white teen on the school bus in Gulfport , Florida , " West , a former Republican lawmaker and television host , wrote on Facebook Monday . <p> " What amazes me is no one is analyzing the lack of adult responsibility . " <p> West added : " No one is asking , especially not the usual race baiters , so I figured I would . " <p> West is referencing the July 9 attack caught on videotape of three 15-year-olds beating a student while riding a school bus . The attack was reportedly in response to the student telling on one of the attackers for trying to sell drugs . <p> " Who leaked the information provided in confidence by the victim about the black teens selling drugs ? " West asked . " Who allowed those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs ? " <p> According to reports , the attackers gave the student a broken arm and two black eyes . Many have asked why the bus driver , John Moody , did n't  physically intervene during the attacks . <p> West wants to know why the school did n't  do more to protect the student . <p> There . For those living under rocks I did a cut and paste on the story as best I could . Apparently these 3 black drug dealing dope heads decided to beat the shit out of a white kid . The white kid , as we shall call him the INNOCENT VICTIM , was brutalized by the 3 black kids , we shall call them probable career criminals and future wards of the state penal system , for telling school officials they tried to sell him drugs . <p> What the Cartman and black power symbols have to do with this is anyones guess . 41153 @qwx451153 <p> 08-15-2013 , 11:23 AM <p> You did n't provide any reference regarding the incident you 're talking about .

@@44116054 @4116054/ <p> After recording a demo in 198814 , The Offspring signed a record deal with a small-time label , Nemesis Records . Then in March 1989 , the band teamed up with producer Thom Wilson ( of Dead Kennedys , Social Distortion and The Vandals fame ) to record their first album , simply titled The Offspring. 14 The album was released in limited amounts by the label , only in a 12 " vinyl format , and a proper CD release did not surface until 1995 .

It is in fact my favorite song , and I believe it is also one of the best sounding songs , with excellent lyrics back it up . This song I think represents the understanding of the world that they had while writing Americana , the album . The entire album is based around this song is one way or another . For incenses , Americana has a line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-bys , tats right away / I want it right now cause my generation do n't  like to wait " and then you look at the song No Breaks , which also talks about this generations fast-pase life style . Also Staring At The Sun , another song I love , is instermental in this album , its philosophy behind the Americana project . In contrast with Americana ( the song ) I believe the certical lines in it are , " Where cultures defined by the/ Ones least refined/ And you 'll be left behind/ If you do n't  fit in " and , " My futures determined by/ Thieves , thugs , and vermin/ Its quite an excursion . " As in Staring At The Sun the lines are , " Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway/ Dodging bullets while you 're trying to find your way/ Everyones around , but no one does a damn thing " and " When I ran I did n't  feel like a runaway/When I escaped I did n't  feel like I got away/ Theres more to living than only surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few lines I posted for each . Staring At The Sun , talks about runing away from Americana and eve when it seems like you away from it you 're not . As Americana says , that our fuuture is deterimened by thieves and thugs , where culture is defined by its youth , where there are strip malls are on every other conor . I do n't  think Americana is a medaphor for what is going on in the world right now , I believe its more of a philosophy about how life is working and playing out right now . The album is based around this , everysong can be conoceted to Americana the song and that philosophy or idea . 41135 @qwx451135 <p> 12-27-2006 , 07:00 PM <p> All that work for 33 post and 52 voters ?

I almost thought I had one , but " orgy " does n't work . <p> 0r4ng3 <p> 01-14-2006 , 03:07 PM <p> Wait , is " gry " in itself a word ? Maybe that 's what he meant by telling us already . <p> 0r4ng3 <p> 01-14-2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't end in " gry " . At least , last time I checked , it did n't . <p> 0r4ng3 <p> 01-14-2006 , 03:16 PM <p> Oh , shit . I just realized . <p> There are only three words in " the english language " . The third one is " language " . Wow , I feel stupid . <p> T-6005 <p> 01-14-2006 , 05:21 PM <p> An hour , easy . <p> T-6005 <p> 01-14-2006 , 05:23 PM <p> It really , really is . But what kind chess are we talking about here ? <p> T-6005 <p> 01-14-2006 , 05:32 PM <p> I meant standard chess vs. speed chess . 41135 @qwx451135 <p> 01-14-2006 , 08:58 PM <p> Most likely this is already on here somewhere on this thread . but i like it , because most of the time my friends are to stupid to answer it right , so let see if offspring fans can ! : p <p> A says the B always tells the truth , B says a always lies . <p> Who is telling a lie , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 01-15-2006 , 01:41 AM <p> I think you did that riddle wrong somehow . If A tells the truth , and says B always tells the truth , that means that B 's statement about A always lying would be true , but that 's a contradiction , and can not be . However , if A lies , it would mean B 's statement is a lie , which is another contradiction because B 's statement would be that A 's lying which would be true , but A 's statement does n't support that . <p> Look at it from the other way . B always tells the truth , yet says A does . Does n't work . B always lies and says that A always tells the truth , which is a lie , which means A would lie , but B already has . <p> If they 're both telling the truth , A would be lying . <p> If they 're both lying , B would be telling the truth . <p> It does n't work . 41174 @qwx451174 <p> 01-15-2006 , 01:44 AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old " The statement on the other side of the paper is true/the statement on the other side of the paper is false " gag .

That was after grunge <p> Yes , yes they are . The Stone Temple Pilots sucked , NIN is industrial and not grunge , and Soundgarden really did n't do anything good after the big 90 's grunge boom . Pearl Jam has been making good music this whole time , despite a lot of the grunge fans disowning them for experimenting . <p> Pearl Jam fits in perfectly with the second wave of mainstream grunge . They mixed classic rock , metal , and punk into one sound . That 's what grunge is . <p> cybermears <p> 08-02-2006 , 10:55 AM <p> are the smashing pumpkins grunge ? <p> 0r4ng3 <p> 08-02-2006 , 11:03 AM <p> I really , really do n't think they are . <p> I just remembered who Stone Temple Pilots are , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeAtHsTaR <p> 08-02-2006 , 11:44 AM <p> I just remembered who Stone Temple Pilots are , and now I wish I had voted for them .

They mixed classic rock , metal , and punk into one sound . That 's what grunge is . <p> Yeah I agree , but apart from a few songs they 've never really had that dirty , grunge sound to them . When you listen to Screaming Trees or Green River and then Pearl Jam , they almost sound too clean . <p> Jakebert <p> 08-02-2006 , 12:14 PM <p> Yes , hence why I said they fit with the second wave of grunge that got huge in the early 90's. 41150 @qwx451150 <p> 08-02-2006 , 03:14 PM <p> Yes , yes they are .

Pearl Jam has been making good music this whole time , despite a lot of the grunge fans disowning them for experimenting . <p> How can you like Pearl Jam , but not the Stone Temple Pilots ? They 're pretty similar . I guess most of STP 's music after the grunge era sucked , but I have n't heard a lot of Pearl Jam 's post-grunge music . From what I hear , it is n't any better . NIN is pretty similar to the grunge bands if they are not grunge . Their music is kind of dark , and grunge music is dark . As for Soundgarden , I like their latest stuff the best actually . My favorite Soundgarden songs are " Blow Up The Outside World , " " Ty Cobb , " and " Bleed Together , " all of which were recorded for their last album . I 've always preferred those songs to " Outshined , " " Black Hole Sun , " " Fell On Black Days , " etc . I know most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's just my opinion . <p> As for Pearl Jam , I saw them in concert a few months ago and they were awesome , but I 'm still not sure about their past few albums before this year . I do not believe they were any more popular than the last few albums of STP , NIN , and Soundgarden . <p> Jakebert <p> 08-02-2006 , 06:11 PM <p> Pearl Jam has a lot more of a blues touch , and do a lot more folk influenced stuff than STP , plus Eddie is a way better songwriter than the guy from STP . <p> I was n't talking about popularity as much as quality . Pearl Jam 's post-grunge boom albums were all consistently good , even if they were n't anything groundbreaking . STP 's post grunge boom stuff was shit , and Soundgarden 's was n't anything great . <p> NIN do n't sound anything like grunge . NIN uses a lot of synths and computer effects , hence them being industrial . R.E.M . ' s " Automatic For The People " was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean it 's grunge. 41150 @qwx451150 <p> 08-02-2006 , 07:03 PM <p> I was n't talking about popularity as much as quality .

The Offspring have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass , GregK is awesome ! <p> i love playing the solo in Have You Ever . its easy but so much fun .

@@44116076 @4116076/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> In democracies , there are commonly two different methods to elect legislature or parliament , which often results in who get to run the government as the executive branch ( but not always , as seen in the US ) . The two ways are the single member district ( SMD ) aka plurality method and proportional representation . <p> The first one , SMD , is not too common among democracies , but it is present in big countries like the US , the UK and Canada . The essence of this method is that a country divides itself into several political districts , often referred to as constituencies , and then the inhabitants in each of the constituencies vote for the one they want to be represented by and the one who wins goes to the parliament/legislature . A person only need the most votes to win , not the majority of the votes . For instance , person A could get 40% of the votes , person B 35% of the votes and person C the last 25% of the votes . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes , she got the plurality of the votes and therefore wins the election of that constituency . The other persons lose and get nothing . Thus this method is sometimes referred to as the " first-past-the-post " method . Person A wins even though the majority did n't want her to represent them , they wanted someone else to represent them . Not very democratic , is it ? Also , the votes for person B and C get thrown away . This often results in that supporters of minority parties ca n't be bothered with voting in their constituencies when they know that their vote wo n't mean a thing . If party A consistently has won the election in a certain constituency , what is the point of voting for party B when all those votes will be thrown away ? It is seen that small parties often have no chance in countries which run their election through the SMD method , because the votes they get wo n't ever count since there always is a bigger party . That way , the smaller parties will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics ends up as a two-party stand off as seen in the USA ; here you get , in practice , to vote for either the Democrats or the Republicans . If you do n't believe in the far right policy , then that 's tough , there is no alternative with any meaning . Any votes for a non-far-right party will simply be thrown into the bin . <p> To sum the SMD method up in an example , we can see how the elections to the British House of Commons went in 1992 : The Conservatives got 41,9% of popular vote and 51,6% of seats in the House of Commons . The Labour Party got 34,4% of popular vote and 41,6% of seats . The LibDems got 17,8% of popular vote and 3,1% of seats . All the other parties got 5,9% of popular vote and 3,7% of seats . <p> A worst scenario could be found in a system like the one US has where there are only to parties capable of winning . If every constituency in the US had an outcome where the Republicans won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the votes , then the Republicans would get 100% of the seats in the House of Representatives . Remember , this is just hypothetical . <p> Not very democratic nor very representative of what the voters want . <p> The other example , proportional representation , is a nation-wide system . Here a party 's share/percentage of the votes is just as high as its seats in the legislature . If party A wins 55% of the nation-wide votes , it will get 55% of the seats in parliament . If party B wins 30% of the votes , it will get 30% of the seats in parliament . So on and so on with party C , D , E etc . Here the parties get what they deserve . It is highly democratic . This is the system that is most used today by democracies . It also is proven that proportional representation gives the most political participation by voters compared to the SMD system . Smaller parties also get a chance to have a say in the political arena as their votes actually count even though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainstream political ideas , you can vote for alternatives and your wishes have a opportunity to be heard and represented . <p> So after the veeeeeeery long summary of democratic election 101 , what is your opinion on these two methods and your country 's use of one of them ? Is a country truly democratic when using an SMD method ? <p> I probably forgot about a lot of things , but just ask and I 'm sure someone can answer you . I also believe many here know all about this and you can just skip down here to the question . <p> I live in a westminster style , first past the post system : it 's not the most democratic process : for example , our Green party gets around 8% of the popular vote , but zero seats in parliament . That said , although in theory am open to a more proportionally based system ( or maybe something like an Australian based preferential based system ) but i 'm relatively content with the existing method : it seems to be efficient enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Half the parliament is voted through the PR system , and the other half through the SDM system . <p> Holding a referendum would be a good idea , but it must be thoroughly explained the difference and the pros and cons between the two systems in order to be fair . A lot of people have the " if it is n't broken , do n't fix it " , although some may argue that the SDM system is n't working as well as the PR system could do in the UK , as we saw in the 1992 general election .

I liken our system to an onion , because each new way in which I have participated , as Congressional clerk , voter registrar , polling worker , and more , has always proved that our system is obscure , outmoded , easily corruptible .

@@44116090 @4116090/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> Why are liberals so afraid of libertarians <p> Serious question . Liberals suck and so do conservatives , but libertarians seem to get it right most of the time . So why are liberals so goddamn scared of libertarians all of a sudden ? Is it because libertarian philosophy is based on fairness and common sense and therefore libertarians are harder to vilify than conservatives ? <p> Well , first why do n't you explain what you like about libertarianism ? Without just bashing everyone that 's not a libertarian , if possible . You mention fairness and common sense , but if possible I 'd like you to elaborate on what you mean by that ? <p> I 'm not " scared " of libertarians , but some reasons I do n't like libertarians : <p> - ) they tend to be for a complete economic deregulation of the private sector . Anyone who knows 5th-grade American history knows that our nation has had problems in the past with big corporations getting together and completely buttfucking people throughout an entire industry . Libertarians tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " if we give the corporations more tax breaks and more money , they 'll do the right thing on their own and put that money back into the economy and create more jobs ! " And we 're just expected to trust them to do " the right thing , " without any failsafe against them choosing to do otherwise . Trickle-down economics is bullshit ; when the rich get richer , they do n't make more jobs , they hoard the money and drought the economy . <p> - ) they tend to NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY 'RE TALKING ABOUT . Tax protesters , for instance , who protest not " excessive " taxes but the very concept of taxes in the first place , as if they 're completely unaware of the fact that SOME taxes are needed to run a country ( see : city lays off entire police force because they ca n't afford to pay them ) . Wanting to abolish the IRS without considering an alternative means to raise the revenue that would be lost en masse by such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lost revenue that would entail . Bitching about " high taxes " when we have historically low federal tax revenue . Wanting to completely abolish the Pell Grant . Wanting to cut from Medicare and Medicaid so they can afford to give more tax breaks to the top 25% income bracket , calling MD and Social Security " entitlements " as if that were a derogatory term ( you pay into them , therefore you 're " entitled " to a return , simple as that ) . Among other things . <p> Just off the top of my head . <p> " I 'm sorry For all the things that I never did For all the places I never was For all the people I never stopped But there was nothing I could do ... " <p> libertarians seem to get it right most of the time libertarian philosophy is based on fairness and common sense and <p> So why do they suck so much ? <p> Personally I do n't care for liberatarians ethier . With some of those reasons that Static just explained.It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves with the return of no jobs and hardly anymore pay . These people are stealing our money and telling us it will all work out when they use it for our new wonderful jobs that will begin to appear when we start using our imagination.They have no idea what they 're , but as long as they keep getting paid its all good for them . Its not like they have any taxes to pay . <p> But seriously I really woud like to hear why you agree so much with libertarians .. <p> The truth of the situation is that libertarianism is like communism ; they are both excellent ideas that just do n't work . I 've always appreciated and supported some of the views of the libertarians - I actually used to consider myself libertarian . That is , until I realized just who libertarians are . <p> Libertarians do n't realize that a country ca n't function without a government , just like Communists do n't realize that people ca n't function under an extremely all-controlling government . They are extreme opposites that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get it . They 're unable to see any flaws in their system , when the truth is that the ideal system ( as seen in the most stable countries in the world ) is something in the middle - a balance of socialism and capitalism . The extremes do not work . <p> So while I have no problem with Libertarian concepts ( sometimes it calls for less government in the right places , for sure ) , the people are nuts . Never met a sane Libertarian . <p> I respect the utilitarian/pragmatic brand for libertarianism supported by guys like Milton Friedman and Leland Yeager . I ca n't stand some of the dogmatic types like Ron Paul and Murray Rothbard who are obsessed with natural rights . You know , the " taxation is theft " guys . Worst of all are the anarcho-capitalists . <p> What are good historical examples of trickle down economics failing to provide for a vast amount of the population ? Is there an particular example where it failed miserably and there was n't another economic factor that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate image that comes to mind is one of an over-privileged and self-absorbed white person who is continuously mumbling something incoherently about " deregulation and privatization " on a constant loop : it 's just hard to take someone seriously when their economic beliefs resemble the ramblings found on the badly xeroxed pamphlets that mentally deranged people like to hand you when you 're at the subway . <p> Also i 'm going to slap the next person i see who suggests that " bringing back the gold standard " is not only feasible in 2011 , but is a good idea to boot . <p> Originally Posted by Tom Gabel <p> Adrenaline carried one last thought to fruition .

Liked the standard late 60 's mid 70 's german b-movie style ( think Elsa FrSulein SS or Messalina , Messalina ! ) , I was wondering if they 'd go all the way at the end . Quite a surprise that they actually did . Only seems like vag penetration though , anal would be nice to add to the stereotype ; ) . Anyway this definitely beats the last first single video , cause the one for benzin was quite crap . I was wondering what they would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to my expectations with this one . <p> Ca n't wait how the new tour show will be like , since it 's hard to beat the last ones . <p> Apparently it really were them and not just " stunt-dicks " in the video . I read it in some magazine . They recorded it in a brothel , hired the porn actresses and everything , They did n't watch eachother when recording sex scenes , the only exception was when the singer was in action - they went to the room and laugh their arses off . They sure had fun : D <p> They did n't tell their wives until after it was already done . They did n't want to comment on the situation ... <p> I 'm not sure , it could still be a well planned hoax , but if you think it this way , it was probably cheaper to actually record everything live than it would be if they had to hire stunt actors and edit the video with some clever CGI <p> BKDH1984 <p> 10-10-2009 , 06:51 PM <p> LONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? : ) <p> I personally was n't that impressed .. although it was nice to see some decent cinematography , with proper lights and shit . Kinda surreal but interesting . Like high budget style . <p> Anyway .. what do you think ? Should this line be crossed , by a mainstream act ? <p> Thanks , Oxy . : D : D : D <p> Kennytar <p> 10-29-2009 , 04:28 AM <p> ... how old are these guys now ? <p> They are all around 40 . <p> About the video ? Uhmmm , its porn . I 'm not saying its good video . I like their surreal and weird videos more ( Like Mein Teil or Seemann ) . Song is rather ok , tho not the best as its always with singles/hits . <p> If I 'm not mistakes then in the " action " they used real male pornstars too .

A lot of the classic greg k/ noodles background vox parts are actually pre-recorded samples during live shows . <p> I think we all have noticed that they use some pre-recorded stuff live , like the drum intro in WDYGAJ , The Montag lieben lachen loben etc etc . I do n't  think these parts really matter if played ' ' for real ' ' or not , But some of the stuff ive discovered recenltly really let 's me down . <p> The got ta keep em separated part is perhaps not so important and seems to be standard operating procedure to use a sample for these days , but the other stuff i really do n't  see the reason for cheating around with <p> I am not convinced .

But if I am not mistaken , the exact same video exists where you stop hearing him . So Dexter 's voice must have been added later . <p> I found videos of it , but the second one probably exist without them talking . <p> It 's really not an issue at all , backing tracks provide consistency and it 's a pretty standard thing nowadays .

@@44116105 @4116105/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> I know all this . but that does n't take away the fact , that it simply was n't the only camp . people -were- treated horribly , but not just there . that 's my point . the only thing , that makes the difference between Auschwitz &amp; some of the rest , are the gas-chambers . BUT extermination also took place in Kulmhof , Belzec , Sobibor , Treblinka &amp; Majdanek. &amp; I do n't care if in the end less people were killed there , than in Auschwitz - people were killed . Auschwitz may represent that &amp; be the symbol of the Holocaust , I just think many people forget about the reality of this &amp; how many other places there were , besides Auschwitz , where people were tortured , robbed of freedom , killed , excluded from society , etc . <p> &amp; you forgot mentally disabled . <p> ( do n't think I dislike you , by the way . I 'm just quite .. ' passionate ' ( though that is n't the right word ) about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just discuss . I do n't  think people forget about other camps , places . I assume they remamber and show their compassion by visiting those places , bringing fresh flowers and candles as a symbol of a memory that still lives inside them . The fact is Auschwitz was the biggest of them all . Through years it became a symbol of the holocaust . That 's why there 's ' the fuss ' about Auschwitz . If for example Kulmhof was the biggest , there will probably be a fuss over the Kulmhof . That 's quite obvious . <p> shatskater , have you ever been in Auschwitz ? Have you ever seen the crematory , the barracks , piles of cut hair , empty boxes of Cyclone B on your own eyes ? Have ever talked to a person who survived the concetration camp ? If not , you should . Maybe this will teach you something and change your behaviour . <p> For a person who supposedly has studied these things , shatskater , you do not seem to realize the way Hitler 's ideology worked . <p> Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean just belonging to a different religion , it meant that you had Jewish BLOOD running in your veins . The same animal blood that had wrecked the originally divine Aryan race during centuries and centuries . It was thanks to Jews that Germany lost WW1 . <p> You ca n't convert from being a Jew into an Aryan . If it would 've been that simple , that many Jews would n't have been killed . <p> The question whether Hitler truly believed in his ideology can be asked and ca n't be definitely answered but what remains is the fact that the man acted according to his ideology . To rid his Great Germany of everyone who was in some specific way very different , he set up concentration camps that did not only kill Jews , they also killed regular Germans who had something that might poison the Aryan blood . Even people who had epilepsia were sent off to the camps because epilepsia was considered a genetical disease . Children with disabilities ( mental or physical ) were killed , as well . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , in a topic like this . It is inconsiderate and stupid . Even if you do find it funny , you should realize that there is a time and a place for certain jokes and this was definitely not the correct time or the place to show off your " twisted sense of humor " . Not realizing that really makes you more ignorant than your lack of spelling or your often rather stupid comments have previously proved . <p> Also , you said that it was the peoples fault for following him . Remember 1930 's depression ? It was then that Hitler 's party 's support rocketed . Often in times of recession , people seek promise in extreme rightwing or leftwing parties . Hitler appeared to be on the people 's side . Anti-semitism had always existed in Europe . Propaganda works . But ultimately , in Hitler 's nation , you did n't have the right to think differently . If you did , it was very likely you would be the one sent to the concentration camp yourself . Many Germans did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jewish population to flee the country in order to protect them . <p> In short , no , it was not the people 's fault . They did n't go , " Hey let 's kill a couple of million Jews ! " , those who were n't brainwashed definitely did n't support it . <p> Again , for a person who has supposedly studied these things a lot and knows " quite a lot " , you do n't seem to know jackshit . <p> Somethign stirred in my mind , so I googled up and managed to find a poem on this . <p> Vultures by Chinua Achebe <p> In the greyness and drizzle of one despondent dawn unstirred by harbingers of sunbreak a vulture perching high on broken bone of a dead tree nestled close to his mate his smooth bashed-in head , a pebble on a stem rooted in a dump of gross feathers , inclined affectionately to hers . Yesterday they picked the eyes of a swollen corpse in a water-logged trench and ate the things in its bowel . Full gorged they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cold telescopic eyes ... Strange indeed how love in other ways so particular will pick a corner in that charnel-house tidy it and coil up there , perhaps even fall asleep - her face turned to the wall ! <p> ... Thus the Commandant at Belsen Camp going home for the day with fumes of human roast clinging rebelliously to his hairy nostrils will stop at the wayside sweet-shop and pick up a chocolate for his tender offspring waiting at home for Daddy 's return ... <p> Praise bounteous providence if you will that grants even an ogre a tiny glow-worm tenderness encapsulated in icy caverns of a cruel heart or else despair for in every germ of that kindred love is lodged the perpetuity of evil . <p> Jeez ! How random ! We did this poem for GCSE English ! It was in the big booklet of poems and stuff they give you to study ! ! ! Anyway , yeah , I think the Holocaust was hideous , but I have to say I do n't know that much about it ! We studied it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have n't done any history since then , so my knowledge is really patchy . Going to Auschwitz does sound interesting though . <p> Come on people , the guy has demonstrated multiple times in the past that he 's a borderline retard without the ability to reason . I do n't think you can get mad at him for posting Holocaust jokes in a thread about the anniversary of Auschwitz 's liberation any more than you should beat a puppy for shitting on the kitchen floor . Why y'all would allow one moron to derail this thread is beyond me . <p> That said , I 've been to the Holocaust museum in Washington D.C. and found it fascinating and horrifying , but not as deeply moving as so many people had portrayed it to be . I think that I 've heard about the atrocities committed there so often that hearing about them for the umpteenth time , even as well presented as it was , did n't shock or deeply move me , for I 'd already heard everything . <p> Still , actually seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , and hearing firsthand accounts of time spent there was powerful , but nothing that I was n't prepared to see . <p> " It is a strange paradox that todays central banks are generally staffed by economists , who by and large profess a belief in a theory which says that their jobs are , at the best , unnecessary , and more likely wealth-destroying . Needless to say , this is not a point widely discussed among respectable economists . Nevertheless , it is an issue worth pondering . " <p> It pains me when people are ignorant and stupid about this particular crime against humanity . Partly because it happened so close , both geographically and ... timely ( ? ) , 60 years is n't that long of a time . It 's just frustrating and makes my blood boil . <p> Also , it 's easier to rant at some motherfucker than start remembering every horrible detail you have heard about the death camps . It 's a really strange event , the way it has affected future generations so much . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how hard we might try . <p> I 'm surprised there was only one enfant-provocateur in this topic . Usually they form a wolfpack . It 's not a question of being mean or ignorant on their part but rather the search for attention . Happens all the time . Do n't waste your breath . <p> Moving on . <p> I bought a book today on the marking speaches of the 20th century . As I skimmed through it I saw Elie Wiesel 's name . I 'm a fan of his . Read his two books--L'aube and La Nuit . The latter about his personal experience in the Holocausat and more specifically- Auschwitz . Without any further dues : <p> I speak to you as a man , who 50 years and nine days ago had no name , no hope , no future and was known only by his number , A7713 . <p> I speak as a Jew who has seen what humanity has done to itself by trying to exterminate an entire people and inflict suffering and humiliation and death on so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can but stand in awe and remember its stateless , faceless and nameless victims . Close your eyes and look : endless nocturnal processions are converging here , and here it is always night . Here heaven and earth are on fire . <p> Close your eyes and listen . Listen to the silent screams of terrified mothers , the prayers of anguished old men and women . Listen to the tears of children , Jewish children , a beautiful little girl among them , with golden hair , whose vulnerable tenderness has never left me . Look and listen as they quietly walk towards dark flames so gigantic that the planet itself seemed in danger . <p> All these men and women and children came from everywhere , a gathering of exiles drawn by death . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba . <p> In this kingdom of darkness there were many people . People who came from all the occupied lands of Europe . And then there were the Gypsies and the Poles and the Czechs ... It is true that not all the victims were Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as then , we ask the question of all questions : what was the meaning of what was so routinely going on in this kingdom of eternal night . What kind of demented mind could have invented this system ? <p> And it worked . The killers killed , the victims died and the world was the world and everything else was going on , life as usual . In the towns nearby , what happened ? In the lands nearby , what happened ? Life was going on where God 's creation was condemned to blasphemy by their killers and their accomplices . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba . <p> Turning point or watershed , Birkenau produced a mutation on a cosmic scale , affecting man 's dreams and endeavours . After Auschwitz , the human condition is no longer the same . After Auschwitz , nothing will ever be the same . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba . <p> As we remember the solitude and the pain of its victims , let us declare this day marks our commitment to commemorate their death , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reflect upon the past , we must address ourselves to the present and the future . In the name of all that is sacred in memory , let us stop the bloodshed in Bosnia , Rwanda and Chechnia ; the vicious and ruthless terror attacks against Jews in the Holy Land . Let us reject and oppose more effectively religious fanaticism and racial hate . <p> Where else can we say to the world " Remember the morality of the human condition , " if not here ? <p> For the sake of our children , we must remember Birkenau , so that it does not become their future . <p> Yitgadal veyitkadash , Shmay Rabba : Weep for Thy children whose death was not mourned then : weep for them , our Father in heaven , for they were deprived of their right to be buried , for heaven itself became their cemetery .

@@44116111 @4116111/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> Mother Teresa was an evil cunt <p> Everybody remembers Mother Teresa as a living saint . Mother T was a Catholic nun who helped the destitute and homeless of Calcutta , and who became an international emissary of peace and charity after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 . But nobody seems to remember the crazy things M.T . said about abortion , contraception , and divorce . Or her endless self-aggrandizing through exaggeration and lies . Or the various brutal dictators and other sleazeballs she hung out with . Or especially what happened to all those financial donations ( hundreds of millions of dollars ) which never seemed to get spent on anything . At least they were n't spent on food , medicine , or housing for the poor . <p> Mother Teresa was born in Macedonia in 1910 . Her given name was Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu . As a girl she decided to become a missionary , and at age 18 left home to join a convent in Calcutta . She taught at St. Mary 's High School until 1948 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life 's mission of helping the poor . In 1950 , she founded The Missionaries of Charity , a religious order dedicated to caring for the indigent residents of Calcutta . In time , the little charity blossomed into a reasonably well-funded endeavor . So far , so good . <p> Then some guy from the BBC shows up in 1969 and points a movie camera at Mother T. The result is the documentary Something Beautiful for God . The hagiography instantly confers celebrity status on its unknown subject . And the film is followed by a book of the same name . Suddenly , Mother Teresa had become a household name . And then something happened . <p> In December 1971 , India and Pakistan fought a bloody 15-day war , resulting in the creation of Bangladesh . In the aftermath , horrific stories of war crimes abounded . The Pakistanis had perpetrated ruthless genocide against the local Hindu population . They had committed arson , looting , and wanton killing as part of an overall effort to exterminate the Hindus . And more than 450,000 women had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sex slaves and held captive in the barracks . They were often mutilated , and sometimes raped until they died . One account described an eight year old girl whose vagina was slit open because it could not accomodate the men 's genitalia . She too was raped until she died . <p> These stories prompted Mother Teresa to come forward . In the aftermath of the war , thousands of the rape victims were now pregnant . Mother Teresa made public appeals for the women to keep their unborn babies , and not abort them . She offered no condolences for the dead women , no sympathy for the surviving victims , and not a word about the soldiers . Her sole interest in the matter was preventing abortions . <p> Mother T had a lifelong obsession with abortion . It was her central issue . She was fundamentally opposed to it , regardless of circumstances . She was against abortion in all cases , even in the case of rape , incest , or risk to the woman 's health . In her acceptance speech for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear : " Abortion is the worst evil , and the greatest enemy of peace ... Because if a mother can kill her own child , what will prevent us from killing ourselves or one another ? Nothing . " In 1993 she was asked about a case in Ireland about a 14-year-old rape victim . Mother T remarked : " Abortion can never be necessary because it is pure killing . " Needless to say , M.T . was equally opposed to contraception in all forms . <p> But her ideals always seemed to take a back seat around her friends , the dictators . In 1975 , Indira Ghandi imposed martial law in India . During the two year " state of emergency " she suspended the constitution , imposed censorship on the news media , and arrested her political enemies . Indira 's son Sanjay spearheaded an effort in population control for the poor , wherein they were rounded up and forcibly sterilized . Despite her lifelong opposition to contraception and presumptive support for human rights , Mother Teresa chose to embrace the new order and issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The western press was shocked . Mother T drew wide criticism for her endorsement , even from the Catholic press . But she never withdrew her comments . And it did n't stop there . In 1981 , she flew to Haiti to accept the Legion d'Honneur from Jean-Claude " Baby Doc " Duvalier . In return , she declared that the Duvaliers loved their poor , and that their love was reciprocated . ( Shortly thereafter , the Duvaliers were forced to flee Haiti and live out their days in exile . ) In 1989 , Mother Teresa traveled back to Albania to pay respects to Enver Hoxha , one of the most repressive rulers of the 20th century . She laid a wreath at his grave and drew wide criticism for it . <p> She had other questionable supporters as well . Charles Keating , who stole in excess of $252 million in the Savings and Loan scandal of the 1980s , donated $1.25 million of his loot to Mother Teresa . When he was eventually caught , M.T . interceded on his behalf and wrote a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote back informing her that the money she had received was stolen money , she made no attempt to reply . She also accepted money from the embezzler Robert Maxwell , who stole 450 million from his employees ' pension funds ( and committed suicide rather than face Scotland Yard ) . <p> In fact , the Missionaries of Charity probably garner annual donations in excess of $100 million worldwide . ( It 's only " probably " because her organization patently refuses to release their financials . ) Where does all that money go ? <p> It certainly does n't go into health care for her wards . People get the misconception that her facilities operate as hospices or medical clinics . This is not so . Those facilities are devoted to giving people someplace to lay down and die . M.T . herself named them " Houses of the Dying . " Over the years , her organization has grown to support a worldwide network of schools and soup kitchens , but these are rather modest affairs and require very little cash to maintain . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there was more than $50 million sitting in the bank , the local subsidiary continued to appeal to the public for more donations . There is no telling how much money resides in all their other accounts around the world . <p> Of course , when she required her own medical care , only the best would do . In public , she declined a 1984 offer for free cataract surgery from the St Francis Medical Center , worth $5,000 . But the following year , she quietly received the same treatment at St. Vincent 's Hospital in New York . Not to mention visits to the Scripps Clinic and the Gemelli Hospital , and numerous visits for cardiac care at the Birla Heart Institute in Calcutta . At some point she got a pacemaker installed . <p> And let 's not forget that exorcism . During one of her hospitalizations in Calcutta , the local archbishop noticed that Mother T had a habit of fitfully pulling out her EKG sensors at night . He told her that she " might be under the attack of the evil one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After it was over , the archbishop says M.T . " slept like a baby . " From which one could reasonably conclude that Satan had indeed been working to possess her . <p> In the April 1996 issue of Ladies Home Journal M.T . disclosed that she wished to finish her life in one of her own Houses of the Dying , just like those poor people she attended to . But when she died the following year , she was in her private bedroom , surrounded by modern cardiac machinery . <p> I think you think too much into things . You read between the lines . As far as Mother Teresa is concerned , I think she was highly overrated . Shes a saint and blah blah blah . She may have done her part in saving the world but it does n't interest me . <p> There are selected dates for shows in Branson from April through December . Shows are at 9:30 AM and 3:00 PM .

@@44116121 @4116121/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> True Meaning of " Kill the President " <p> While early Offspring songs were pretty mystifying , this cut remains the most curious of them all , mainly because of the infamy it caused and its subsequent censorship . The most important thing in finding the meaning of this song is that it 's not to be taken literally ; as Dexter said before a live performance , " This song is not about assassination , it 's about taking control of our own lives . " While only figuratively used , the name " Kill the President " was provactive enough to get the band some attention , which was what they were looking to do at this point in their career ( just watch their segment on the Wally George show ) . <p> The first lines of the song seem almost sarcastic : " In a world without leaders , who 'd start all the wars ? " But if the world lacked leaders , there would be be more chaos and violence than before . Similar to how " Cool to Hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate are certainly not cool . <p> Though I think the most important line is : " A leader 's not the center of Democracy . " True to the Constitution , the President is NOT the leader in a Democracy , the people are . This makes me believe it 's criticizing people 's over-reliance on the government , empowering people to take action and not blame the government/the president for their faults and take responsibility themselves . <p> This is simply my interpretation , I encourage people to discuss . Was their anymore input from the band themselves ? 
@@44116122 @4116122/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> I saw this thread pop up and read when it was posted . I still have something to say about it . The people that say Dexter sucks at singing were probably only thinking about those times when he was either sick or fatigued from touring too much . He sings falsetto and at a very loud volume . It 's extremely difficult to maintain those pitches at that volume for long stretches of time , and it 's even harder to remain of key for any amount of time . The haters do n't realize that and have obviously never tried it themselves . Dexter is a smoker and his voice has n't suffered as much as other singers that smoke . So , he 's doing something right . That NME idiot clearly has n't heard the Offspring songs that have n't hit the radio . So much for an informed reporter or whatever he is . He should listen to " Fix You . " Not one of my faves , but he 'd have a new appreciation for Dexter 's voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... if you think he does , you clearly do n't know what falsetto actually is .

Dexter almost never sounds really " on " when singing live . <p> Third of all , Dexter 's voice sounds good on record when he 's yell-singing , but he sounds awful when he tries to sing low . He gets very nasally , does n't sing from his diaphragm at ALL , and it 's painful . I ca n't listen to songs like Kristy and Fix You , and that 's a big reason for it . He has to yell-sing to make up for the fact that he 's not a very good singer . PS : I 've heard every Offspring song made . <p> If we 're ONLY comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot despite their singing and choose to sing out of their range , then I guess he 's okay .

Talk about your opinion as though it 's your opinion , rather than as though everyone must agree or else they 're an uninformed idiot . <p> That NME guy is obviously acting jealous and wishes he can have dexters voice . He could n't back it up with saying something more original . So , I 'm guessing his not a fan just a music journalist . Like someone has said : " the dudes got a unique voice !

@@44116126 @4116126/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> Call-out sick policies of different jobs in different countries . <p> America certainly seems assbackwards in yet another way . I can only briefly touch on the subject , as I have , you guessed it ( or maybe not ) work in an hour . In jobs where you are dealing with the public and come into contact with many people throughout the day , such as cashiering ( that 's all I know of personally ) you are expected to come in to work , even if you are sick . It is your responsibility to find a replacement and you are not even provided with means to contact any co-workers and you have to see who 's available on the schedule . So you are expected to show up and chance getting your co-workers and customers sick by handling all their items . I was given a cold my one of two customers last year , one co-worker was forced to work with a stomach flu , one of my co-workers or a very sick customer got me sick now , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled due to severe laryngitis . Yes , we have to work when we can not even talk ! Whereas , with desk and other such office jobs , where you are largely separated from the public and do n't have quite as much contact with your co-workers , you can call out sick usually with no issue . There is no chance of infecting a large number of people . I know this because I 've been to my mom 's work a number of times over the years and I 've asked her questions about it . <p> Yes , I know that office jobs are typically full-time and so you are given sick days to use , but that is not my point . My point is that you are expected to show up sick to a job where there is a high risk on infecting others are you can call out of a job with a low risk of infecting others . <p> I 'm curious to know the policies of other jobs and jobs in other countries . <p> Last edited by " Melyssa K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My part-time jobs in college were Domino 's , Target , Perkins , two jobs at my university ( one in biological research , one in a call center ) , two garden centers ( cashiering and working with the plants/customers ) , teaching , and Perkins . At all these jobs , I called in when I was sick . At Target and Perkins , I was supposed to give a certain amount of notice ( I think 8 hours before the shift started ) , and if I failed to give enough notice more than once , I could 've been written up . I was sent home from Perkins and Domino 's for being sick more than once , but Target would n't let me leave if I was already there - I had to call in ahead of time . <p> I 've been working in Europe for the last 3.5 years , but I 've never held that kind of job here . I work as a freelancer and independent contractor , and if I cancel a lesson within 24 hours of the lesson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds like you work for a shitty company . I recommend finding a new job . <p> It 's called the Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company , which owns many popular stores in the States . The manager 's an insensitive prick . I really do need another job . <p> Those policies of your other jobs are all quite different . Interesting . 41145 @qwx451145 <p> I 've only had one job that had a stupid policy like that . And I never bothered with it . If I called in , they just had to deal with it themselves . <p> When I worked at steak'n'shake , their policy was that you have to bring a doctors note , no exceptions , or you lost your job . I once went to work with a throat that hurt so bad talking put me in tears . and you also were n't allowed to get a scheduled day off for a funeral unless it was an immediate family member . If your best friend died , your ability to go to the funeral was entirely dependant on the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have only had one job like that and that was at Walgreens . The manager was a real dickhead . The rest of the jobs I have had have n't made such a big deal in missing days . I have n't even had a job where I had to find a replacement ... I 've never heard of that concept till now . Should n't finding your replacement be the manager 's job ? I have to disagree on what you said about the office position . I work in a cubicle in a building that includes 500+ employees . I got sick because of work , if someone 's working they better call in sick if they come down with someone that is contagious . We do n't get paid sick days , either . . I called in sick for today and we get points taken off for each day we miss . We have a certain amount of points a month . They are basically preparing for us to be absent a few days . Who would want to be absent from my work though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect attendance record you are rewarded . They gave employees $50 gift cards for perfect attendance last week . That is if you are okay with old angry people yelling at you on the phone all day lol . <p> Actually , almost every job I 've worked at has been like that . Every restaurant job , anyway . I worked at one restaurant where , when I would call in sick , the manager would interrogate me as if she thought I was lying every single time ( I called in maybe two to four times a year , average ) . " What ? Why are you sick ? What do you have ? You looked fine yesterday . When will you be back ? " I got so irritated with it that I just started telling her every time she asked that I had explosive diarrhea . She would say , " I did n't need to know that , " and I 'd say , " well , you asked . " lol . <p> When I worked at a Waffle House in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since there are three shifts and it 's open round-the-clock . If you 're going to miss a shift , you need to call in during the previous shift ( not your shift , not the one before your shift , but the one TWO shifts away ) . Which keeps you from doing what I normally do , which is if I feel sick several hours before I have to work , I take some medicine and try to nap it off and see if I feel any better before I call in . So basically , if I had the slightest inkling that I might be getting sick , I would have to call in in advance just to be safe . And if you have to call in after that for some reason , then you 're personally tasked with finding a replacement for you , which is very difficult unless you 're well-connected with the other employees , so usually it 's not worth the effort . But at least WH had a policy and clear guidelines as to how you go about calling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that does . <p> And when I worked at a hospital cafeteria before that --- a HOSPITAL cafeteria --- they would write me up for calling in sick on weekends . They have a policy that you can NEVER call in on a weekend , ever . I called in one day because I had worked for 21 hours straight ( due to a scheduling " accident " on their part , I basically worked a triple shift ) , and they expected me to go home , sleep for 2 hours , and come back the next morning as well for another double shift , so I called in and said , " I need to sleep sometime . " They said , " Okay , but I 'm writing you up . " So I shrugged , hung up and went back to bed . <p> " I 'm sorry For all the things that I never did For all the places I never was For all the people I never stopped But there was nothing I could do ...

I got sick because of work , if someone 's working they better call in sick if they come down with someone that is contagious .

You ca n't disagree with what I said about it because how I described my mom 's work 's sick policy is just how I described it . She 's worked there all my life . <p> I wish my work gave rewards for perfect attendance .

I also showed another guitar I wanted to get but I lost interest in getting it . <p> So here 's what I have now . <p> Here 's the drum set , I got it probably a little bit after my old post : <p> Here 's my amp/effects set up for guitar : <p> Here 's my bass amp : <p> And here 's all my guitars/bass : <p> That 's a Squier Jaquar bass , an Ibanez RG 2EX2 , a Fender American Standard Strat , and an Ibanez AEL20E Acoustic-Electric guitar . <p> A long time ago I was n't even interested in strats and thought I 'd never get one , but that was when I first started playing guitar and based it solely on looks .

I originally wanted to have the same electronics/hardware as a Les Paul , but I do n't really have the money and I already had the Tele parts . Eventually when I save up some cash I 'll either upgrade to some better Tele Pickups and electronics , or the Les Paul stuff , but for now I just want it finally done : P <p> I did n't use any pore filler on the wood and did n't prime it before painting , I wanted to see the wood grain through the paint cause it 's oak and has really nice grain patterns .

I ended up creating this . Thennnn I got the crazy idea to actually refinish my RG like that . So after a couple weeks of sanding , painting , and rewiring , here 's what I ended up with ! <p> I 'm pretty happy with how it turned out , I only ended up with one or two small drips in the paint , and they 're in out of sight places so its no worry . Pretty good for a quick paint job at least <p> My RG and Strat , both repainted by me .

I 'd appreciate it if you 'd indulge me by reading through it and offering your opinions/insights . <p> Part 1 <p> First , what the hell is the Information Age , and why is it so important ? Some armchair ( or , more accurately , faux-leather couch ) posturing : historically , each " Age " has taken its namesake from the fundamental technology that has achieved temporary supremacy , usually the latest and most advanced material or method of conquering both nature and fellow man . The Stone Age , the Iron Age , the Bronze Age , the Industrial Age , the Steam Age , the Nuclear Age , the Space Age , the ... Information Age ? What of this , that this latest era of humanity is defined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm to conquer , but by an utterly abstract material such as information ? How has information suddenly vaulted to such great heights ? <p> The truth is , information has always played an immensely important role in human society . It was the very information concerning how to make iron into weapons , or atoms into bombs , that separated the more " primitive " societies from the ones more advanced along the continuum . However , information is tricky . The human brain is a goddamned unbelievable device for storing , processing and connecting a truly mind-boggling amount of information , from the linguistic taxonomy of the entire world , to assigning each of those names further value and knowledge of proper usage . However , it remains imprecise . Memory is notoriously faulty , subject to merely to the erosive forces of time , but also to subjective quirks that alter a piece of information to more comfortably fit an overall worldview , preventing pure objectivity in most cases . <p> This physical limitation on the accurate storage and transport of information , demonstrated for laughs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguards in the way the material is handled . Methods were devised to improve accurate memory and overall storage capacity , and the best-suited individuals were chosen to cultivate such a propensity . This technology , however , had the unfortunate side effect as to exclude many members of society . As the overall necessary amount of information became much larger in larger societies ( religion , philosophy , history , science , biology and botany , technology itself ... ) , an increased amount of dedication was required by each individual that needed to store this information so that it could be accurately passed on to the next generation , so much so that only an elite few who benefited from a crop surplus were able to dedicate their entire lives to memorizing reams of information before prior generations took it with them to the grave . This , of course , gave enormous power to those scholars - a mere farmer , whose worth depended on his hands , could be easily replaced , but a scholar , whose worth resided inside his head , was much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta go run and meet some people for lunch . Until again . <p> " It is a strange paradox that todays central banks are generally staffed by economists , who by and large profess a belief in a theory which says that their jobs are , at the best , unnecessary , and more likely wealth-destroying . Needless to say , this is not a point widely discussed among respectable economists . Nevertheless , it is an issue worth pondering . " <p> Maybe you 're overthinking it . It could be in terms simply of accesibility to information . While for the longest time farmers would go by traditions or the Almanac , now , lots can look in one of the databases you mentioned for documented facts about where and when to plant what . Aside from that , the internet has only become prominent in the past couple of decades , and has vastly increased the transfer of information . Instead of person A letting persons B and C know , and leaving poor person D on his own , now persons A through zzzzzzzzetc. have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote that during a bit of downtime on my last full day in town , before saying " goodbye " to a host of friends ( for lunch I had penne al fresco and insight into the environmental movement ) , then , the next day , hitting the road for my hometown . Also , lately I 've been alternately feasting on the steadily brilliant insights of Jared Diamond , the manic prose of Tom Robbins and the rich kick of coffee , which may invite a certain excitability to my own words . Anyway ... <p> The introduction of the technology of writing dramatically transformed this landscape . With writing , information could be outsourced , allowing much more of it to be stored and transported much more accurately . Like all new technology , however , writing required many successive generations before its potential could be fully realized , and the much slower pace of technological progress in that era meant that making writing pliable for a large variety of uses would take hundreds or even thousands of years , from simple tally marks nicked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy and religion preserved on scrolls . Still , however , the information was closely guarded - only an elite few could read ( less than one percent of people in Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt ) . <p> However , as the technology and innovation improved over the ensuing centuries ( languages where each character represented a sound rather than an entire idea , the printing press , a public school system ) , literacy became widespread , and words became of greater and greater importance in our life . At first , these inventions were largely used to disseminate information from the top down . As mass-production methods became cheaper , however , it became increasingly common for information to move in the opposite direction . Each private individual could , potentially , infect the rest of the population with his or her own peculiar perspectives , or bring to light previously unheralded events ( take , for instance , Rachel Carlson 's " Silent Spring " ) . <p> Likewise , as we entered the Computer Age , humanity acquired the ability to process immense amounts of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events in order to draw relations between events and a greater understanding of the world . With computers have come the internet , and with the internet , a quantum leap in information technology . Now , for the price of a computer and an internet connection ( which I 'm currently siphoning off from a local bakery ) I can shoot my ideas out to anyone in the world . <p> Concurrently , this flood of information has become immensely powerful to the consumer . Product reviews , restaurant reviews , competing prices , the latest styles , the average price of a house in my neighborhood ... all of this is within my grasp in a few clicks of a button , erasing in an instant the advantage long held by any seller . Likewise , any dirty secrets are up for air .

The world is awash in more information , more easily accessible than ever , and yet there is absolutely zero oversight of what goes into the machine . <p> One interesting side effect , to me at least , is that no idea ever seems to die . Once recorded , an idea will almost always remain , even if a bit marginalized , hoarded by some fringe element of society . Even the most extreme , ridiculous ideas , such as the Flat Earth Theory , remain popular among a small but vocal minority . Most philosophers still find adherents , religions divide and subdivide amidst a steady eruption of fault lines , and political ideology blinds all . One of the interesting effects of this is that we ca n't agree on anything . Despite the fact that we have the theoretical ability to access more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain firmly ensconced in our islands of ideology . <p> The Earth is round ! The Earth is flat !

You can find information out there to support all sides , to support anything you wish ! What to make of it all ? Who to sort it out ? <p> We are , I believe , in a crisis of confidence in information . Not only can people not agree on information , we ca n't even agree on an institution to verity it for us . The government ? Ha ! They 're the biggest bamboozlers of all ! The media ? Ha ! They 're in it too !

Even the Old Gray Lady has proven capable of conveying misinformation , culpable of joining in the false drumbeat that pushed us into war ( of course , certain parties had long ago given up it as a ringleader for the Left ) . <p> That 's one of the biggest issues today , as I see it , the deficit of trust . This deficit , which plays out most sharply along political lines in the United States , is leading us down a path , ultimately , of choosing two separate realities . Though they 're more complicated than that , I 'll just call ' em the Left and Right realities . The thing is , this happens on every position , and not everyone takes the same side , but there are always two sides . One side effect of the popular media is that the public seems to equivocate a lack of bias with the presentation of two sides : the Left and the Right .

However , due to the permanence of information in the public sphere , it 's easy to outsource all of it . For instance , in the latest health care debate intensified by Michael Moore and the Democratic primary , I can tell you that there are problems both with the US system and with government-run public health care . In fact , I think that the best solution is set up by Singapore . however , I do n't really know how it works . Something about $5,000 , I think . It 's a mixture of both , designed for ... something . I do n't really know . I do know , however , that when I did spend the time to research it , I was came to the conclusion that it was ideal . I do n't need to remember it , because I feel confident of the decision I reached , and I can look it up again ( which in this instance I probably will , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often in the past few weeks ) , but mostly I just sit secure with an opinion I ca n't really back up . <p> Likewise , we outsource many of our decisions to talking heads or experts ( for instance , I came to my decision based largely on reading " The Undercover Economist " which walked through a practical guide to efficiently distributing health care ) . Without all the time required to be knowledgeable on every issue , we must find our own individual or institution on which we can rely to guide us through the misinformation miasma . And so we remain privy to only a select channel of information , biased knowledge built upon biased knowledge , until , at some extremes , it becomes entirely impossible to communicate - we each , essentially , live in different realities , in different worlds built on completely separate assumptions , existing and running parallel to each other , sloshing over in increasingly-vitriolic debate . <p> So what 's the solution ? What institution can we trust ? Interestingly , some of the most trusted institutions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are essentially designed to filter through the sum total of all information out there , relying on the masses to produce the most accurate results . Google , by finding out what people link others to and wikipedia by running through many different personal views of the facts to ultimately weed out bias and arrive at some fundamental , neutral perspective ( though even then there is controversy ) . And yet , with the possible exception of the venerable snopes.com for sorting out urban legends , there are precious few authorities to whom a majority of people will defer . <p> Part of me is curious if such a fact-checking institution will arise in the future , and what it will look like . Part of me had more to say , but thinks that I 've already said way too much considering the format . So : thoughts ? What to make of this - a paradoxical era in which more is known than ever before , yet less is known for certain . Hell , I do n't even know if moderate drinking is healthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more specialized , we increasingly have to defer to authority figures ( it 's hard to replicate on your own experiments at the atomic level ) , yet the public remains highly skeptical of " so-called experts " . What is true ? How do you know it ? How will we ever ? <p> " It is a strange paradox that todays central banks are generally staffed by economists , who by and large profess a belief in a theory which says that their jobs are , at the best , unnecessary , and more likely wealth-destroying . Needless to say , this is not a point widely discussed among respectable economists . Nevertheless , it is an issue worth pondering . " <p> You 're all wrong ! It 's the Age of HAU . The funniest BBS member of all time . <p> It 's good to read . While reading it , I felt like I 'm watching some TV serial questioning the existence of the universe . It 's kinda philosophical and at times it goes slightly off-topic--AAE is right about overthinking but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good stuff . <p> Here is my simple point of view . Let me quote you , " historically , each " Age " has taken its namesake from the fundamental technology that has achieved temporary supremacy , usually the latest and most advanced material or method of conquering both nature and fellow man . The Stone Age , the Iron Age , the Bronze Age , the Industrial Age , the Steam Age , the Nuclear Age , the Space Age , the ... Information Age ? " <p> Well , you ca n't deny that computers accomplish that . They are comprised of many materials so it makes sense not to name them this way . I do n't know what 's the dominant material , silicon maybe ? Do you want the Silicon Age ? Computers are all about processing of informations . Input/processor/output , it 's all jizzed up with informations . So here 's the Information Age . <p> Do n't worry Mota , someone will try to reply with relevance ! To show that they read your piece ( and enjoyed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the point of your point . I found most interesting the part about two realities being created . And while it 's something I 've been aware of , you brought forth the idea of what would happen if this were allowed to continue . Where the democrats and republicans ( left and right , communists and fascists , liberal and conservative , toma(y)to and tom(ah)to ) . <p> What you could worry is that it would divide everyone into two irreconsilable camps both ignoring reality and constantly in contradiction while both party leaderships are probably closer than we actually think . Ironic but that 's probably not what would happen . What is most likely would be a continuation of what we have now . The political college students would subscribe more to the views being espoused by the parties , the staunch supporters would continue being staunch , and the rest of us would stop caring . If we have n't already . I mean the dawn of the spin doctor is what started this , the denial of reality in favor of your own more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilton denying drug use on Larry King ? Celebration , Florida ? <p> Fuck if I know , it 's just really annoying . <p> What would the fact checking institutes look like ? Anything worth it 's beans would be something like an ombudsman , would n't it ? A publicly run institution , and by public I do n't mean governmental , but by public people . An NGO I guess . Would it affect public opinion ? I hope so , but I doubt it . How many more people watch the Daily Show instead of CNN or Fox News ? Well more is the wrong word . How many watch the Daily Show instead of CNN ? And why ? Because it agrees with their own personal understanding of reality ? Or because they think it 's more honest . <p> And how is this any different than the Christians who drop out of the theological faculty because it questioned their faith ? Or the Marxists who dropped out of Political Science 101 for the same reason ?

@@44116171 @4116171/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> I love Dexter 's singing voice , not because I think he 's a great singer ( he 's better than me , but not that great ) , but just because I love the way his voice sounds for the songs they make . <p> I agree . Ozzy Ozzbourne fit Black Sabbath , James Hetfield fits Metallica , and Dexter fits the Offspring . Sometimes , the singer just needs the right band . Could you imagine Gavin Rossdale in another group ? It 'd suck . But Dex is just what the Offspring needs . Unlike the others I mentioned , though , Dexter would have a chance at winning a singing show . <p> I think it 's important to have a realistic understanding of the band members , and it 's important not to idolize them* . Dexter is definitely a better singer than your average untrained guy , but he 's not the best in the world . He 's one of my personal favorites , but very far from the best . It upsets fans of other talented singers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . I 'm sure we could upset some Social Distortion fans pretty quick if we told them that Dexter was the best singer in all of punk rock . <p> By " average untrained guy " do you mean only men who can attempt to carry a tune or do you mean all guys in general ? If we are talking about the first one , I would have to disagree . He might sing better than my husband , who can carry a tune well enough , but he definitely does n't sing better than randman21 , whom I would consider your average , untrained guy . If we are talking about all guys in general , whether or not the potential to sing on key is there or not , training or no training , then that is hardly a shocker and would include the aforementioned husband . <p> Beyond that , I would imagine that Dexter himself has had quite a bit of training in the 20 years since Smash went platinum . Even if the goal was n't to sing better , it would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doable and add a little longevity to his singing capabilities . <p> I have had quite a bit of formal vocal training , but I would never consider calling myself a ' trained ' singer .

I 'm serious . these ' kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . they might 've looked up to her , wondered what it would be like to shag her , to fuck someone experienced , they probably thought it was hot the way she handled her chalk &amp; talked about math ... <p> these are not the kind of things you want to build a relationship on in most cases . if she wanted to shag young boys , she could 've just gone to a club where teens hang out &amp; pick one up there . if she 's so hot &amp; attractive , they still would 've wanted to get laid by her , regardless of her job &amp; then she would n't be an authority . <p> then the underage-issue would still be left , though . <p> either way , think about it . you do n't send your kids to school- your precious darling little babies ( because that 's what kids are in parents ' eyes ) -to fuck their high school teacher . you want to learn from them , yes , but that does n't involve practical sex lessons . <p> RXP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some practical sex lessons in high school . it would ahve made me much happier . Don ' genrelise bella . I 'm entirely serious . <p> I could have used some practical sex lessons in high school . it would ahve made me much happier . Don ' genrelise bella . I 'm entirely serious . a teacher has to be taken seriously by - in this case - her students in order to be able to teach . when you shag your students , when you give them a reason to fantasise about you sexually , the attention wo n't exactly be drawn to your lessons . sex is n't something that should be taught . sex is an experience , you ca n't teach people experiences . they have to get out there &amp; experience it for themselves . you can teach them how it works in theory , which is trFs important , but anything else just goes too far . <p> I know how much this somehow manages to mean to you &amp; I know to which level you are serious , but sex is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some think it 's a big-ass huge deal . some have the condition that there 's love involved , other just want it to be good . either way , whatever your preferences are ; sex is quite a special , extremely intimate pleasure , which reflects in the fact that she fucked three students . if it was like giving chocolate , she would 've fucked them all . if it was like a lesson she thought they needed to learn , she would 've fucked them all . get my point ? <p> it 's like growing older . teachers can teach you how to &amp; all the things you need to know , but they ca n't actually -do- it for you . that 's something you 'll have to do for yourself , because it 's personal &amp; no one else can experience it the way you do but you . <p> so you want practical sex lessons in schools ? what would that teach a teenager , Dush ? that it 's not an experience , but just another class ? that it 's meaningless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that kind of takes the charm away now , does n't it ? &amp; every human being would be able to say later in their life ; " I lost my virginity fucking with my teacher . you know , practical sex class . " <p> as a teacher , you 're in a certain position towards your students . like your parents are in a certain position towards you . if that difference in positions becomes vague ... the world does n't end , no , but it 'd be pretty fucking fucked up . parents often have chats with their children about sex , the consequences &amp; the facts . would it be okay if they teached you all that practically in person , too ? <p> I would never ever let a high school teacher , regardless of his age , touch my private parts , nevermind fucking with him . a guy I see every day in front of my class , who teaches about math &amp; other boring stuff , who does n't mean a fucking thing to me. he might occur in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give a damn . jaysus Dush , would you let just about anyone in your pants ? because I sure as hell would n't . <p> JoY <p> 04-12-2005 , 04:08 AM <p> &amp; to add ; this is the person , who gives you homework . the one , who can send you away from class if you 've been annoying &amp; the reason you have to go to school . this is the person , who gives you your diploma . who checks your tests , gives your grades &amp; tells you if you did well , or not . it 's just ... not the person you should be having sex with . god . <p> you get practical classes in chemistry , right ? does that involve a teacher ? practically , no. the teacher explains how it 's done &amp; you have to figure it out on your own , or you 'll never learn what you 're actually doing . even something as simple &amp; unpersonal as that should show you how a teacher ca n't be involved in the actual non-theoretical learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like I ca n't explain it well enough . <p> RXP <p> 04-12-2005 , 04:19 AM <p> Yeah I get where your coming from . I was n't advocating practical sex lessons . I was merely saying getting off with students ai n't that bad . You have to look at if she did actually abuse her authority , her trust . If she did n't then it 's fine . <p> There 's a thing term in law ' fidiciary relationship ' basically meaning there is a higher degree of responsbility between certain relationships ( children/mother e.g. ) . But in this case unless she realy did abuse her power , no fidicuary relationship arose . <p> Of course I have no idea who the boys are . They could be the high school studs who obviously knew what they were doing or some lonely kids or something who got taken advantage of . But all I 'm saying is ask the guys . Let them be the ones who decide . <p> JoY <p> 04-12-2005 , 04:33 AM <p> They could be the high school studs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high school studs get laid again . find someone who is n't your teacher , if you 're such a stud. ( not to you personally ) as I said , a teacher or her lessons ca n't really be taken very seriously if she 's fucking her students . <p> some lonely kids or something who got taken advantage of . &amp; yeah , this is alright . using your authority to take advantage of insecure , acne-spotted , braces-wearing , friendless , lonely , pubertal teens . <p> there 's no way I can find this alright , unless the teacher , aswell as the student were both head over heels in love . you 're right , I ca n't judge that , I do n't know jack shit about the situation &amp; their feelings . but judging from the fact she fucked three students , I do n't think she loved the guys -that- much . <p> Endymion <p> 04-12-2005 , 08:30 AM <p> they probably thought it was hot the way she handled her chalk &amp; talked about math ... <p> I heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if it 's still in place . The Tennessee lottery was funding a sex ed course that at the end of it if you had a high enough gpa , a high enough grade in the class , and met certain other requirements , you would be able to have an intercourse section with someone . Your parents would of course have to give permission . <p> I do n't remember much about it , though , and I do n't live in Tennessee anyways so it does n't really matter to me .

@@44116181 @4116181/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> Surprisingly Psychological Strategies to Pick Up Chicks <p> As I 'd assume is the case with most guys , I 've noticed that there 's a fairly well established and agreed upon set of guidelines to picking up girls in public places . A lot of these guidelines or tips are based around simple psychology and mind games . <p> Since human psychology is so complicated , I can never quite decide how valid I think these strategies are , and I 'm quite curious to see what others think . <p> Whenever I hear someone explain these strategies , I always find myself thinking that they are exaggerated or unnecessary , and that one only needs to make a good first impression doing obvious , straightforward things . However , I 've noticed that everyone who adheres to these advanced strategies has more success than me . I will definitely say I 've noticed that the whole " just be yourself " strategy kind of puts you at a disadvantage , because it often does n't give you the chance to stand out . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without appearing to be trying too hard to stand out . <p> Recently , some drunk italian guy went over all these mind games he plays when trying to pick up girls at bars . I was amazed because he had thought out everything from body language , to things like walking away from the girl to do something else for a bit before she walks away from you in order to keep her more curious . Another common thing I 've heard is : make a good first impression , then be an asshole , because girls like that for some reason . Another , really smart and successful guy I know went out of his way to tell me that I do n't walk around bars with enough swagger . I 've always thought that I 'm above that , and it makes you look like a tool , but again , despite what I would tend to logically think , I observe that it seems to work . Lastly , yet another guy who is successful with girls explained that the way I ' make jokes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I need to be more subtle and more ' cool ' about it . It 's all really abstract stuff , and that 's why I 'm amazed that I 've been hearing things like this ALL my life . <p> Perhaps you 've heard some slightly different things , but I 'm assuming that most of you understand what I mean when I 'm describing these fairly psychological tactics that are often employed and stressed as necessary . So what do you think ? <p> Yeah , all that pre-planned manipulative bullshit works ... on drunk , stupid bar-sluts with daddy issues . And if that 's the type of woman you 're trying to pick up , you 'd find it easier , cheaper and safer to stick to mid-priced prostitutes . <p> If you want to make a connection with a woman with a shred of class , decency or personality , skip the peacocking faggotry . <p> Generally agreed . <p> Seriously , man . You 're talking about " picking up chicks . " And then you 're wondering why it does n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario for a second- would you rather have a girl be sincere to you , or would you rather spend time with some insecure girl who 's out on the prowl to " pick up guys " and does n't really care who she comes up with as long as he 's hawtt and socially acceptable ? <p> This is kind of similar to the happiness thread . You seem to be looking at women and happiness in the same way : as if they were PokTmon . Like they 're something that you have to hunt down and catch and collect via some impeccable strategy . <p> Finally , you should ask yourself : why are you even in a bar ? If your only answer is " to pick up chicks , " then that explains a lot . You should be going to bars to enjoy yourself with your friends , and secondarily to meet people . I 'm not pretending that I 'm above approaching and flirting with women who interest me , but you ca n't look desperate . Having a few drinks can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly relaxed if your primary concern is just picking up chicks . <p> I agree with some of the general points you made , but you kind of assigned your own connotation to " picking up chicks " . I just mean meeting girls in general . And I do n't really think it matters much what your mentality is when you go to a bar . I mean , you 're inevitably going to at least consider trying to talk to someone new regardless . <p> I will definitely say I 've noticed that the whole " just be yourself " strategy kind of puts you at a disadvantage , because it often does n't give you the chance to stand out . And a lot of picking up girls is about standing out without appearing to be trying too hard to stand out . <p> ... and bighead finally admits that his natural personality is about as interesting and desirable as a stick in the mud . <p> ... and bighead finally admits that his natural personality is about as interesting and desirable as a stick in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone in a public place like a bar .

@@44116182 @4116182/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> Has Dexter ever had any professional training or lessons of any kind ? He 's pretty good for a guy who just picked up a mic , if that 's the case . <p> Yes indeed . <p> Ok so here 's my opinion . Obviously the creator of the list is critisising ONLY singers style , than technique , and those things are different . When I saw M.J. on top of the list - I realised that list writer is not a reliable guy .. M.J. is the king of pop and one of the best voices in music history - weather he was kid or a grown man . The only singer who deserve to be on that list is : Duffy - I just hate that song of her , and that whiney disgusting nasal sound . And that 's it ! The rest of singers from list are - very distinctive , very good and very pleasable to listen to .. <p> So as for Dexter Holland - I think he is kinda talent . Because there are 2 intresting things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive , recognisable and UNIQUE sound , and - a very bad technique . I like thing about him that - he almost never used vibrato , unlike other singers , and I find that very original and cool . He has a very unique voice color when he sings high , and he sounds somehow - metallish . Not heavy metal kinda metallish , but a metal sounding voice is coming from his mouth . Very good . He has some kind of a small grid or distorsion in the voice , and that sounds great for that kinda style of music - punk rock . And because of that - I think he is the best voice of the punk rock because of his high range , no vibrato and distinctive voice quality . Ok he 's been using vibrato on RAFRAG , but we all now how Dexter 's voice sounds . Cons or flaws of his voice is - his technique . He 's been yelling , and pulling the shit out of his chest voice for 25 years , and that 's why - he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then they tune down guitars live for half step so he can pull it out . Ok it 's still hard to sing his songs even in that way , and he does them 80% of his career - good , but songs lose energy , edge , and sometimes sound - boring . Also I think - somehow he writes songs in some very difficult singing melodies , you know - It just has to have at least some amount of straining in throat .. But on the other side of that coin - He 's talented because he 's been screwing his vocal cord 's for that long time and have not had any problems such as nodules , or any other vocal chord problem , and have never gone under surgery table , which is good . Also I think he never had any voice lesson , just picked up the mic , and still running . That 's very impressive . But in the end - the only thing that gets screwed up here are - his songs , preformed live . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the best vocal coach in the world , but it 's just a matter of choice - do you want to be a better preformer and to give more passion to THE music ; and to make you sound more like you , or just to do gigs - on the same way that a middle class worker goes everyday on his average payed job . To me - I 'd be paying few lessons , because the main goal is not musician but - his songs , and his message to be interpreted live on the same way it has been done in the studio .. But it 's Dexter 's choice not mine Anyway - He 's a very good vocalist , but I think he can be even more better , and mind-blowing live ; on the same way he is in the studio . <p> i actually wrote an article about how Dexter Holland should be considered one of the greatest rock stars of all time . the jist of it being , he s got the highest selling indie record of all time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a hot sauce company , is a pilot and flies to his own shows , and he runs marathons . pretty sure no other rock star does that , and its pretty badass . <p> i actually wrote an article about how Dexter Holland should be considered one of the greatest rock stars of all time . the jist of it being , he s got the highest selling indie record of all time , brought punk to the mainstream , owns a record label , and a hot sauce company , is a pilot and flies to his own shows , and he runs marathons . pretty sure no other rock star does that , and its pretty badass . <p> This has got to be one of the most ridiculous threads I 've read on these forums . <p> The Offspring does n't make that kind of music .

I first want to say that I DO NOT talk about religion or politics in public , ESPECIALLY at work . EVER . It 's a personal policy because of situations exactly like this . So I want to make clear from the get-go that this is not a case of me going around and acting all superior or " smug atheist " and just getting backlash for it . <p> The whole thing started last weekend ( not this last weekend , but the one before that ) . I had gone to see one of my internet heroes , Mr. Hemant Mehta ( I made a topic here about it for anyone who still cares ) . I was really stoked about it , got him to sign my book and everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like normal . No problem . I 've mentioned to some of my friends at work ( in passing ) that I do n't really do religion , that I do n't believe in an afterlife , etc. , so it was my understanding that they basically knew this much about me , and were more or less " okay " with it --- even if they did n't *like* it , per se , we seemed to get along pretty well , and nobody ever tried to argue with me or convert me or anything . So it 's not like this came out of NOWHERE ; they knew that I was nonreligious . We just never talked about it because there was never a reason to . <p> Well , that Monday , this older lady I work with asked me how my weekend was . I figured if I kept light on the details , it would be no problem to tell her that " I met one of my internet heroes this weekend , and got him to sign me a copy of his book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name , and she had never heard of him . I said , " Well , he 's this atheist guy who basically promotes synergy between religious groups and atheist/secular charities and stuff . He has a blog , " etc. etc. , minor details . Well , she stuck on that word " atheist " and made it clear that she disapproved . <p> I did n't want to argue about it , so I kinda tried to defer the conversation in another direction . Instead of outright defending Mr. Mehta , I said something to the effect of , " well , at least he 's not like that pastor guy that was gon na burn all those Korans . I mean , it 's not like he 's going around ****ing on people 's faith , he 's just trying to help people out . " She said that yes , he WAS as bad as the koran-burning pastor , actually WORSE , because " at least that guy believed in some god . " That was when I realized it was a bad conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like , " well , anyway , it 's over now , so .... " <p> But she followed me into the other room and started trying to argue with me . " So you do n't believe in god ? Well how did all this get here , then ? Who created everything ? " I told her , " I do n't know . " She said , " that 's right , " and kind of mocked me , like " take that ! " I tried to walk away again , but she followed me and said , " What I do n't get is , you do n't believe in god because you ca n't see him , but can you see the wind ? Do you believe in the wind ? " I told her that this was a really gross simplification of even the most primitive atheist belief . It really seemed to be bothering her , though , so I said , " Look , it 's not like I 'm hostile to religion . My mom 's Baptist and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've grown up around Muslims and Christians and all kinds of weird stuff . It 's no problem to me . " I basically tried to assure her that I was n't going to try and convert her to Satanism or whatever . She interrupted me , though , and insisted that I " must 've had some tragic event happen in my childhood to drive me away from GAWD , " since my mom was so Baptist ( she 's actually not that religious , she considers herself " spiritual " ) and I was raised that way . <p> Well , I got pissed at that point and decided to bail out . I just said , " That 's entirely wrong , " and I walked out . She was busy with something by that time , so she could n't follow me . <p> Well , I thought it was all done with after that . In a completely unrelated story , I had just purchased this book ( the same day , as it were ) by Christopher Hitchens ( for research purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything . " It was sitting by the coat rack in the back of the store , and I tend to read it on break . Well , I have a feeling this lady went and said something to somebody , because *all of a sudden* people were taking a heavy interest in what I was reading at the time .

" And that other lady , who 's at the other end of the room listening , says , " That 's what *I* asked him . " And I told her the same thing I 'd said before , " I do n't know . " So my GM smugly says , " That 's what people who ' do n't believe ' can never answer .

I flunked Geometry with a 59.4 ( the teacher only rounded up for .5s or higher ) , I *barely* passed physics with a 60.1 ( and that 's only because the teacher was going easy on me for showing up to study hall sessions three times a week for the last two months of the semester ) , and I did hilariously poorly in English for someone who 's spoken English since birth . <p> All of this is not because I 'm particularly bad at any of these subjects ; when I sit down and actually focus and work on them , I 'm actually really good at them . I 'm working through The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Chemistry for a refresher course right now , and as I 'm reading it , all of the stuff I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school is kind of flooding back into my brain . I even remember specific examples my teacher used to explain things like electron configurations to us ( he used to compare electrons to people on a bus or an airplane --- " people on a bus or airplane always want to sit by themselves , so they fill the empty seats first . When there 's someone in every row , people will start reluctantly sitting next to other people , " so on and so forth ; the same way that electrons will move to empty orbitals before moving to occupied ones ) . It 's crazy how much information my brain actually retained , that I just never used and completely forgot <p> But anyway .... one of the things I always took for granted was that , in school , if you did n't understand something , you could ask the teacher to explain it to you , and if it still did n't make sense , they could try and phrase it differently or use creative examples to help convey the concept . When you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise enough , or something does n't *quite* make sense , you 're just kinda stuck . You might get lucky and find something online , but Wikipedia articles ( for example ) tend to be written in professorial language , so if you 're having trouble understanding a simpler concept , Wikipedia 's only going to make it worse --- you end up wiki-walking through like 11 pages trying to get up-to-date on all the little terms you need to understand in order to get the big picture ( and all the sub-terms you need to understand in order to grasp the little terms , and the sub-sub-terms you need to understand in order to grasp those .... ad nauseum ) . <p> In short : I really wish I had taken full advantage of the free education I got in high school .

Like I said , I had ( mostly ) good teachers , so at least I *did* retain most of it . I just let it collect dust instead of putting it to use straight out of high school .

I can only imagine what would 've happened if I had waited until I was like , 25 or 26 to get started on all of this .

I love ot play and learn Offspring songs but I can never get the right sound i need , what effects or combination of guitar effect or what effect pedals do they use for a majority of there songs . If you could tell me this i would very much be in great thanks to you . <p> On almost every song they use a distortion pedal . Usually they use the distortion built into there amps , but unless you are rich you wo n't be able to afford them . But on there record gear list they say they use an Ibanez Tubescreamer Overdrive pedal , which is basicly the exact same thing as distortion . That would be this LONG ... .

I do n't think they use a distortion pedal . Honestly most people who can spend more than 50 bucks on an amp wont use any overdrive pedal or dist. pedal . Example . Zack Wylde endorses a Zack Wylde overdrive pedal . MDX are you kidding ? He uses Active EMG pickups , the hottest pick ups ever and a JCM 800 . Some great sounding amps if you arel looking for this tone Marshall JCM 800 , JCM 2000 , Bogner Ubershall , Bogner Ecstasy Classic , VHT Pittbull , Bogner Shiva , Mesa Boogie Road King , single , dual , or tripple rectifier , Marshall Plexi ( Weezer ) If you want to hear the Bogner Ubershall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in these bands endorse pedals pedals and more pedals . They get paid to advertise products that average people can afford . I spent the first 4 years of playing guitar buying all this pedal junk to get there sound , bottom line , You may get the sound in your bedroom , but try being on stage and turning it up past 3 . It will sound like crap . If you want a good amp tone , get a Paul Reed Smith 3 grand , a Bogner Ecstasy 4 grand , and a Fulltone Choraflange 4 hundred bucks and a nice 4 twelve vintage 30 cabinet . These guys will actually put the stuff they endorse on stage and have the real stuff mentioned above behing the scenes . Best advice , learn to play really really good . Spend the money on lessons instead of gear for now . Get into a band and start making about 500 bucks a week in spening cash and get some kick but gear . I wish I had all the money I spent on stupid gear . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band and have all the cool gear . The biggest thing you 'll notice with crappy gear especially solid state digital stuff is that it sound compressed and loses it 's tone at high volumes .

I have Fender american strats , Shecter Classic Antique amber , Fulltone overdrive , Fulltone wahh , Fulltone Choraflange Boss DD6 , Fender Telecaster and George L cables . That will give you all the tone you will ever need .

Their amp settings probably have a lot of gain , bass , and treble . <p> Noodles uses DiMarzio Tonezones and Dexter uses DiMarzio Super Distortions . They also use Mesa Boogie Double Recitifers . Most of their palm-muted rhythm is on position 2 ( neck humbucker and middle single-coil ) , and their lead riffs and solos are on positions 4 and 5 ( respectively , middle single-coil and bridge humbucker and bridge humbucker only ) . <p> This is what mine is right now and its pretty close ( crate halfstack settings ) ( Treble ) HIgh-10 ( Middle ) med-9 ( Bass ) low-2 Seems to sound good on all songs , perfect for original prankster and lightningrod and conspiracy of one !

He initiated the Prague Spring , which was the best thing to happen to Soviet style socialism , and actually managed to maintain a socialist state where people are allowed to voice their concerns and say a say in what goes on in their government . Dubcek completely ended state censorship of literature and released thousands of political prisoners . He called it " socialism with a human face . " Unfortunately , the Soviet bureaucrats could n't deal with any sort of democracy and sent in their tanks to crush the Prague Spring and revert the country back to an oppressive dictatorship . Dubcek later became a democratic socialist and was the elected president of Slovakia . <p> I also like Tito alot , he managed to be independent of the soviet union and allow to reletive amount of freedom to his people .

However I do think he is a good leader , and hardly comparable to Robert Mugabe . Who did claim to be a socialist leader at one point ( or at least his party did . ) <p> Allende was a leader in a system in which he had to convince his people that socialism is the way to go because they had the option of voting right wing capitalists into office if he did n't meet their needs . This is inherently anti Communist , since leaders of communist revolutions ruled one party dictatorships and barred the people from having any way to challenge them .

There was no realistic chance of me beating this phobia when I was 14 or 15 . Only my parents could have helped me with that . There was no way for me to turn out ok in such conditions except for a miracle - a girl who would be highly aggressive and take all the initiative . This miracle happened once . However , once I made a mistake it resulted in a great tragedy that scarred me for life . We are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such stress and tragedy . I experienced it due to my love-shyness and this is the fault of my parents . Like I said , chances of me turning out ok were extremely slim . <p> You can hardly turn out ok with LS . You mentioned you have a brother . I have a brother too who is LS to this day . He turned out different than I did alright , but not in a better way at all- he 's never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl , he is a loner stuck to his computer , he 's unable to properly communicate with people and has unrealistic expectations of a virginal girlfriend . He turned out differently , but he did n't turn out better than I did . <p> You talk about your choices and actions bringing you to where you are today . I never made a choice to have that phobia . I ca n't blame myself for having it . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> What exactly do you think liberalism is , and how do you define a " decent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals makes you sound quite insane . That 's not an insult and I have zero interest in offending you . I say it only because it 's true . Here 's what wikipedia says liberalism is : <p> " Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality . Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles , but generally they support ideas such as free and fair elections , civil rights , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , free trade , and private property . " <p> I consider myself a liberal because I believe in these kinds of concepts to a lesser or greater extent . <p> Theoretical declarations of something are irrelevant . North Korea calls itself a Democratic Republic . East Germany had Democratic in its name too . What matters is the reality of 21st century liberalism . Anybody knowing the today 's liberals understands that they 're in fact actively opposed to many aspects of civil rights , freedom of religion , free trade and even private property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dictionary . This is n't an issue regarding definitions but an issue regarding what characteristics one sees and decent and whether or not somebody can read the true characteristics of another . Of course that feminists and liberals wo n't see me or people like me as decent . We are in a war where each side thinks they 're right . Practically every group of history considered itself decent . But there 's the objective truth and the objective truth is on our side . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> The only things I want to see eliminated from the world are poverty , inequality , violence and hate . <p> If you want to eliminate things like poverty or inequality you 're just being unrealistic . It is impossible to eliminate those while there are people with unequal skills , mental abilities and inherited wealth . If you want to eliminate violence and hate that is also very unrealistic and why would you want to eliminate this by being a part of a hateful , violent group like liberals ? 41139 @qwx451139 <p> I want these things because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings . <p> Thousands of liberals have told me that myself and incels are human garbage that deserves to be alone and should eliminate itself from the world . Or that we should just suck it up because without a relationship and sex for your entire life is n't anything bad . Nice group you belong to . Full of empathy for its fellow human beings . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> I want everyone to live happy lives , including you . <p> Maybe you do but that 's irrelevant . What 's relevant is that you think I will live a happy life by accepting lies your group spreads- that my incel is not a problem , that sitting in a shrink 's office will somehow not make me incel ( it wo n't ) or make me at peace with incel ( it ca n't do that for any person with a healthy body and mind ) . The same group that is not just a lair of psychopathic lunatics but told me many times that it does n't care about me at all and that people like must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , again , extremely irrelevant . Imagine if I truly wanted you to be happy but thought you could only be happy by cutting your toes off and corroborated all this with buzzwords and ideological nonsense . Would you consider me a positive factor in your life or what you think of me as a danger to you ? Bear in mind , in this hypothetical situation I just described I truly want you to be happy . It 's just that I have an insane idea of how you can become happy . <p> My point is that while I can believe that you want me to be happy you want me to be happy under your own terms , which are idiotic and unrealistic . So I do n't consider your existence a positive thing but a danger . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> Yet you equate me to the Nazis ? <p> That quote is n't mine but from a certain commentator on my blog but that 's less relevant as I agree with it 100 percent . <p> Anyway , you missed the point . Neither me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nazis and make a conclusion that you worse for you while Nazis wanted to eliminate certain races and political beliefs your actual goal , even if you do n't understand it , is to eliminate all decent people . <p> Imagine a tree called society - Nazis wanted to eliminate certain branches . You want to eliminate the root . Which is more dangerous for the tree ? 41139 @qwx451139 <p> How does feminism genetically eliminate anybody at all ? Feminism seeks equality for women . Do you not believe that women are equal ? <p> Feminism genetically eliminates decent people by several intertwined mechanisms 1 . Government transfers of money to women , which makes them less likely to seek a provider and more likely to go for the " sexy " man , a " bad boy " 2 . Since bad boys are mostly unable to have long term relationships and provide for women become sluts , single mothers and eventually spinsters . Their children are raised in inadequate conditions and have many problems in the future . 3 . This makes decent , hardworking men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these mechanisms are a result of feminism , which is essentially a movement for the empowerment of sluts . <p> Sluts are bad for men because they only have sex with the " top " men . Most men have much less sex in a slut culture than in a monogamous culture where every man gets a woman . <p> In a slut culture , men are trained to behave in whatever way attracts women . Sluts are attracted to jerks , so men are trained to be jerks . So the quality of men declines in a slut culture . <p> In a slut culture , men constantly hit on women . This causes women to become hostile , rude , and obnoxious . Because men are desperate and will take anything , women lose any motivation to care about their appearance . So sluts become ugly hostile creatures . <p> As sluts age , they lose their ability to attract the " top " men , but still reject all other men . So they become spinsters . So now , not only are they ugly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slut culture , illegitimacy rates go way up . Children are raised without fathers . This usually makes for a less happy childhood . So children are less happy in a slut culture . <p> In the book " Sex and Culture " , Unwin showed that civilization depends on female chastity and that a civilized culture can not survive more than three generations of sluts without collapsing . We can see this process before our eyes . <p> As for your question about equality , I support women being equal but I do n't support women being the same as men , for that is impossible . That 's a huge difference . I do n't support women being governed by men . Female suffrage is a disaster because it made women decide on the lives of men . In my ideal society men would be governed by men and women would be governed by women . <p> Are you the sort of person who thinks women should essentially be the property of men ? <p> Like all liberals , you have a non-existent understanding of history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die to protect your property like many men did . You do n't put your property ahead of you on lifeboats . You do n't work all day to support property . The lie that women were ever a property of men is one of the most common lies told by feminists . It has nothing to do with history . <p> Women were never oppressed . Being treated differently is n't oppression . 500 years ago , keep in mind there were n't any computers , cars , air conditioning , street lights , office jobs , ipads , phones , and so on . The paying jobs were stonemason , carpenter , farmer and so forth and tools were passed down from generation to generation . Paying jobs were always piece work , a ton of cut granite might get you a piece of silver and women simply could n't begin to compete on the level of men in the field of manual labor . Women gravitated to what they were capable of performing in the way of tasks . They stayed home and tended after the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and wife to ensure their family was healthy , cared for and prospered . Inheritance , what little there was amongst the average common folk would normally go mostly to the sons for very pragmatic purposes , to start families of their own . A woman 's ability to perform physical labor and support a family was no more than a tenth of a man 's ability due to biological differences . Also pregnancy , another biological limitation . Five hundred years ago , physical labor was the only labor available amongst the average person . What sense would it make to having all the women , pregnant or not , hauling stone , building houses with no nails by the way , and all the other physical labor while the men cared for the children and kept house ? Had men tossed women out to be stonemasons while breastfeeding the infants until they were old enough for the men to care for them in a house built by the women . That would 've been oppression . Do n't equate the ease and simplicity of modern day society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never oppressed in the past . Everything was done for very pragmatic reasons to ensure that the families of men and women survived , were content and cared for . <p> Property ... haha . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> But it would still be a terribly wrong conclusion . A conclusion brought about solely by your mental illness . <p> Well , I obviously do n't make that conclusion . <p> On the other hand , what you 're doing here is validating my hate of liberalism . Even if I were to believe that women should be a property of men ( which I do n't nor does was this a case historically ) this does n't automatically make me mentally i 'll . The idea that you think that therapists or psychiatrists are supposed to treat such attitudes is deeply , deeply disturbing . <p> What 's even more disturbing is that you see no problem with this at all . <p> Therapy was never meant to control human attitudes about such things at all . It was meant to try and change some attitudes but never convictions . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and I hope no one here will dismiss you as such . You are very i 'll and I hope you are seeking help for that beyond the internet . While everyone needs to take responsibility for themselves I think you are probably beyond the point of being able to fix yourself . In your case you can take responsibility by seeking professional help and engaging in the process . <p> I 've seen many therapists . They could never ever help me , for many reasons . The main one being that they could have never made me noncel and treating anger and depression without making somebody noncel is like treating nothing but a fever in a cancer patient and then wondering why he is not cured . Anger and depression are normal , healthy reactions to an abnormal , unhealthy situation like incel . They can never be stopped in a healthy incel person unless one becomes noncel. 41139 @qwx451139 <p> I truly wish you all the best and I swear I really do relate to the pain and the anger you exhibit .

Many people from the audience have come forward saying they just went with the flow ; they just wanted to be on TV . It was all mob mentality .

So I was wondering , does anyone know if any specific albums sound significantly better on vinyl ?

Additionally , are there any specific pressings you guys can recommend ?

@@44116229 @4116229/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> DUI laws/penalties are unfair <p> I whole heartedly agree with the reforms presented here . I think DUI laws and penalties are designed so that the courts can steal more money from people . It is my opinion that almost everyone whose faced the harsh DUI penalties for having a BAC between 0.08 and 0.12 has basically been robbed . Also , fuck the judges and cops who enforce these laws but do the exact same fucking thing . <p> " Here are four issues that must be addressed to correct the abuses fostered by revenge and prohibition-driven DUI policies : <p> Current law says that any person with a BAC of .08 , or higher is automatically a drunk driver , no exceptions and no defenses to the contrary . This is an absolute standard that is also absolutely arbitrary . The vast majority of people who drink are not effectively impaired with a BAC of .08 and they are perfectly capable of driving in a safe and responsible fashion . If we are to have an absolute BAC standard that automatically classifies a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least high enough to encompass drivers that are actually impaired . A BAC standard of .12 percent would be a more fair and legitimate legal threshold . This does not mean that a person who is obviously impaired , but who has a BAC below .12 , can not be arrested and charged with DUI . It simply means that their BAC level does not automatically make them a " drunk driver . " <p> Using absurdly low BAC standards , like .08 make it easy for the police to arrest alleged " drunk drivers " and easier yet to convict them in court . " Easy " does n't mean fair or reasonable . <p> 2 . Reform the system of fines and penalties for technical violations of BAC standards to reflect the actual harm done by the defendant . <p> If an impaired driver ( or any driver , impaired or not ) causes property damage and personal harm they should be punished accordingly , preferably providing full compensation for the losses suffered by others . However , a person who is stopped because of a minor traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAC standard should not have to endure huge fines , loss of license , unfair insurance charges , and jail time because they had three drinks instead of two . A person distracted by a cell phone conversation or kids in the back seat can cause just as much damage and mayhem as an impaired driver . There should be more balance in how they are treated by the police and the courts . <p> 3 . Prohibit the use of Breathalyzer results as a determinate of impairment or blood alcohol content . <p> Breathalyzers do not accurately reflect blood alcohol content . The margin of error can be as much as 50 percent ! Furthermore , even if accurately measured , blood alcohol content is not an accurate determinate of impairment . Even a breathalyzer that very accurately measures breath alcohol content tells the operator very little about real blood alcohol content and less yet about impairment . What other industry , agency , business , or school would accept a measurement device that can err up to 50 percent ? Yet , we are destroying peoples lives based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliminate the use of roadblocks ( sobriety checkpoints ) for DUI enforcement . <p> The purpose of DUI roadblocks is to instill a sense of fear and intimidation . DUI roadblocks catch very few drunk drivers . The same officers , if deployed to find actual impaired drivers , would generate far more arrests for DUI than they can operating roadblocks . Roadblocks , for any reason other than absolute emergencies , are contrary to the values of a free society . Free people should be able to go about their business without being confronted with armed , uniformed government agents who demand that we stop and " show our papers . " <p> Only when average , everyday Americans start speaking out on these issues will change occur . Right now legislators are only hearing from those who are misguided by a campaign of revenge or who use drunk driving as an excuse to promote a prohibitionist agenda . Results to date are enforcement abuses , perverted courts , draconian penalties for victimless crimes , and 1.5 million people annually who have had their lives turned upside down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it time we all speak out in opposition to this miscarriage of justice ?

If the laws are relaxed , it 'll be worse . I know enough people who did n't realize they had a serious drinking problem to the point of going to AA meetings until they got a few DUIs .

The penalties you can face for driving with even a 0.08 BAC are ridiculous . It ruins your life , and for no good reason . I really think the legal BAC should be no lower than 0.12 . If you look at the statistics , most of the fatal alcohol related crashes involve people with BAC WAY higher than 0.08 . <p> Some Eastern European countries have zero tolerance on drink drive . ie anything over 0% alcohol in the bloodstream ( not including naturally occuring alcohols of course ) can be pulled , so think yourself lucky to have some tolerance . <p> If I 'm driving then I do n't drink , simple as that .

Little do they know , they 're going to have their ENTIRE LIFE RUINED for having a 0.09 BAC . <p> If I 'm driving then I do n't drink , simple as that .

I mostly agree with Bazza on this one . If I 'm going to do any drinking , I wo n't be driving , period . Or mostly , if I 'm driving , I do n't drink .

And the fact of the matter is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive with a BAC less than 0.12 . This is what you fail to understand . If you would ever sit down and drive a car about 2 miles with say a 0.10 BAC , you 'd be in disbelief at the penalties your state wants you to face for it . It 's not that big of a fucking deal like they make it out to be . <p> The thing is , .08 is not a " huge deal " for everyone . However , since drunk driving is enough of a problem , they set the limit pretty low . Most people ca n't tell what their BAC is , so it makes more sense to set the limit to something that stops people from getting to the point of danger . <p> I do n't picture people with a .08 getting into their car slobbering and backing into things , no . I picture someone right around there missing a stop sign , though , and T-boning someone . Driving is fucking dangerous enough as it is . We do n't need people adding more danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a " not one drop " rule for all drinking and driving situations . Why add more danger to an already very dangerous situation ? <p> Do n't be such a black and white thinker .

If you know what the law is then you know not to break it . Over in England our BAC level is 0.08 , and so we know not to go over it . <p> I actually despise drink drivers , the sort of people who come out with crap and brag about how much they 've had to drink and still driven . I feel that zero tolerance is the best policy since you will not drink if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are arguing the point that someone should n't be penalised for going slightly over the legal limit . You should see the legal drink drive limit as being the tolerance factor over not drinking at all , not that there should be a tolerance factor added on top of the limit . <p> Also a BAC of 0.08 is roughly equivalent to one pint of 4.0% beer , and I know many people who start to feel light headed after just that much , the sort of people I would not want behind the wheel of a one ton machine capable of doing 100mph . <p> Edit : basically what Brianna said again . <p> Edit 2 : bighead384 can I just ask how old are you ? And do you drive/how long have you driven for ? I only ask because you appear to have quite an immature attitude towards drink driving . <p> I do n't picture people with a .08 getting into their car slobbering and backing into things , no . I picture someone right around there missing a stop sign , though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . We do n't need people adding more danger to the situation . I personally would n't mind if we had a " not one drop " rule for all drinking and driving situations . Why add more danger to an already very dangerous situation ? <p> Completely agree . If I 'm driving , the most I will drink is 1 drink , if that . I take people 's keys , I 'll make multiple trips to drive carloads of people home from a party if someone that was going to DD ends up drinking a bit much . You not only put yourself in danger when you drink and drive , but you put EVERYONE ELSE on the road in danger . I do not want to die because you decided to have 1 more drink than you should have . It 's not that hard to get someone to drive or to call a cab . Hell , it 's not that hard to just not drink . And if it 's that difficult for you , maybe you should seek treatment .

So while the music industry was utterly failing to recognise the shift on the horizon and react accordingly , systems like Naptser , and later Limewire and then Torrents were making music incredibly easy to obtain .

Also , I do n't care about being offensive so if that bothers you there 's nothing I can do . <p> Well , I do admit that my post mostly focused on women , though I did mention bad boys too . <p> I will explain a bit more now . <p> You asked me how feminism eradicated decent people - it eradicates them by making women choose immoral men . When it comes to men that 's the subject of how feminism came about . <p> You see , feminism is nothing new . It 's a standard symptom of a declining culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rome . The only main difference between that feminism and this one was that these societies collapsed before they had democracy . <p> In order for feminism to gain a foothold men have to first go bad . It is men who have created women 's suffrage or decriminalized adultery . <p> I am not against equality but equality can not be achieved as long as women have the right to control the lives of men via female suffrage . Women are n't designed to govern men because they lack empathy for them . Men are better designed to govern over men , women and children because they were historically the rulers and had to be empathetic to all members of society . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> You start with a complete generalization about liberals again .

Please , try to understand that I deal with so many dumb people who think this was absolutely the case on a daily basis and that after a while you just start to assume that everybody is like that . You did n't say that and I apologize . <p> As for liberals and history , I probably should have used a word - understanding . I do n't see how anybody understanding history could be a liberal in today 's terms . Understanding of how humans lived and what cultural processes happened is much more important than knowledge of when certain battle took place or when was some person born . There are some liberals who do know historical facts but they do n't seem to interpret them correctly . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> Now , what I will say here is that of course people die to protect their property . It 's not uncommon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . And of course people work all day to support their property . They work all day to pay off the mortgage on the huge house they do n't need or the payments on the flashy car they should never have bought .

But I had to point out that people do die for property . <p> Alright , I could have worded that better too . My point was that it was never expected for men to die for any piece of their property the way it was expected of them to die in protection of women and children . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> Yes . But not necessarily in the way you described . This idea that women should stay home while the men go to work is mostly a product of the Industrial Age and the advent of manufactories . Before that most people lived a subsistence lifestyle in which gender roles really made little practical impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusing each other of being ignorant of real history and honestly I 'd rather be playing video games so maybe we should n't pursue this any further . We only got on this subject because you made false assumptions about me and put words in my mouth . <p> Ok , that is correct but I was n't even arguing against that . My point was that the idea of any historical subjugation of women is utter nonsense that has nothing to do with actual reality . If you do n't want the debate it that 's probably better , it 's a complicated subject and I do n't feel like discussing it either . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> That sounds reasonable .

I had a friend with benefits during sometime in 2013 and I still felt pretty bad . I want a relationship . Sure , since I do n't have that getting laid would n't hurt either but I assure you that companionship and romantic love are much more important to me . <p> Also , you do n't understand something I will reply to later , regarding another post I made - that having sex or even relationships with my level of experience and in my age is quite dangerous and different from how most " normal " people see it . <p> Wait , you thank me and then threaten me all in the same paragraph ?

I was still a damaged virgin . <p> It took more than an year after beating it to finally lose my virginity with a woman who insulted the shit out of me for being a lousy lay after we had sex twice for 30 seconds . I 'll talk about other experiences with women I 've slept with in another post but none were positive.THERE IS A VAST , HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STARTING AS LATE AS I DID AND STARTING AT , SAY 14-15 . <p> There was little chance for permanent success after starting so late . And guess what ? It never happened . My experiences with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cold approaching women irl ? Sure , I can do it now that I do n't have a phobia but I 've never done it in my life because I know it would be a disaster and I 'm not skilled enough to even just not look bizzare by doing that . <p> What 's worse is that I know I 'll be scarred for life even in the unlikely case of me ever finding a partner . <p> So , no , eventually beating it happened at least 7-8 years too late . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> I do n't know who you 're referring to when you make these generalizations . I am a liberal and so are many of my friends but we are not actively opposed to these things . You exhibit signs of extreme paranoia and a persecution complex . <p> Well , maybe you guys really are n't like that or maybe you just think you are n't but I just do n't think it 's a generalization . <p> Classical liberalism has nothing to do with modern liberalism .

Liberalism today means opposition to traditional values , particularly monogamy and female chastity .

That includes thinking that prostitution should probably be legalized , and freedom for anyone - man or woman - to choose their relationships in life , whether it 's gay or straight or polyamorous or monogamous or whatever . I personally am monogamous and gay , but that 's just me . I support letting people choose what they want . This does not mean I want woman to be promiscuous - I am not promiscuous myself . Why do you keep talking about female chastity , but never male chastity ? If you want one , you should want both . I also personally do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believe in a strong social system to support those who are not as well-off as I am . I do n't see how that 's selfish , that I willingly pay taxes into a system that helps others . <p> I 'm not unrealistic . I know I 'm not going to change the world . I only said I would want to eliminate these things . I did not say I could do it . As for liberals being violent and hateful , again , I do not know who you 're referring to here . None that I know . <p> Yes , you are unrealistic . People usually do n't think about things they ca n't change . I 'd like love-shyness to be recognized as a specific phobia under a different name ( dammit , phobias of specific numbers are named , why is n't this one ? ? ) . I 'd like incel to be seen as problem as dangerous as homelessness or extreme poverty ( in fact , there are cases where it has worse effects , for both of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a wife or children ) . <p> Yet , I know that people are too dumb to do that , that incels are too big pussies to demand anything from society , that psychiatry , especially in America , is a bastion of liberalism which does n't want to talk about this and that there are some very powerful groups working to deny the problem so it will never happen . It 's like expecting that everybody 's IQ will be 190. 41139 @qwx451139 <p> I do not belong to any group . I define myself as a liberal because I fit all the commonly used definitions . Just like you and I are both men because we fit the definitions of what it is to be a man . But we are still individuals . I would ask you to treat me as such and not view me as a representative of any group because I do not declare allegiance to any . <p> Yes , I can understand that and I 've misjudged you . But please keep in mind that I do n't call somebody a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( how could they when it 's a new , invented word ? ) and you did show some characteristics they have , like diagnosing and calls for therapy . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> I am deeply sorry that you have been subjected to such hate and abuse from anyone . It must be horrible beyond imagining . I really wish you could see that whether or not these people claimed to be liberals is irrelevant though . Sometimes people do horrible things to other people . Often they do not even realize what effect they are having . I assume you have primarily received this abuse on the internet ? The internet seems to bring out the worst in people . We are not a perfect species I 'm afraid . Again , I 'm really very sorry for your suffering . <p> You know who were the 99.9 percent of people who subjected me to online abuse ? <p> " Progressive " liberal feminists ! ! ! <p> I 've talked to many people since I started the blog . I 've never ever been attacked by a conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I did propose a yet unheard of government program . The only people who were n't liberals and said anything bad about me was a certain PUA forum ( they do n't like incels much either ) . Everyone else except for liberals was polite to me . <p> But liberals ... Wow . I got thousands of angry messages from them , messages full of insults and lies . They called my proposed program , to which women would apply voluntarily and would only be paid for dates , regardless of whether they reject the guy or not , and which did n't even include sex , government run prostitution . Hundreds of them failed to read it at all and virtually believed it was about snatching women off the streets and giving them to random males for sex . <p> A very small number actually read it but even in those cases the reactions were just hilariously hypocritical . Those big statheists were suddenly all about personal responsibility and small government . Those bleeding hearts that cry whenever a woman breaks her nail or a black person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . <p> There is a horrific hate and obfuscation campaign led against incels all over the Internet - Wikipedia articles on our problems are being deleted to make people less aware of them , there are lunatics denying that this problem even exists ( which is as crazy as denying that not drinking water does n't exist ) , there are hateful ideologues all over the place trying to harm us. 41139 @qwx451139 <p> Again , I 'm not affiliated with any group . I 'm just me . I label myself as a liberal only because I fit the general definition and it 's easier to say " I 'm liberal " than to list my core beliefs . Please , do not automatically lump me in with others . You do not know me yet . I deserve the respect of being treated like an individual just like I am doing for you . I could make assumptions and snap judgements about you but instead if you step back for a moment you might see that you are in fact the one doing that to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see what place that is coming from . But I 'm just a guy chatting to another guy here . Can we do that ? Just have a chat ? I 'm not looking to judge you or hurt you . I 'm just trying to get to know you a little . <p> Yeah , I can see that . You seem like a good guy . Please try to understand that I deal with so many stupid and evil people that I 've become very easy on the trigger . <p> Now , let me go on record as saying I do not belittle your problems . I believe they are real and serious . I do not believe sitting in a shrink 's office will magically make your problems go away . Neither would medication , though both might ( only saying might ) help . I offer no terms under which you should find happiness . If I knew the secret to some kind of objective , universal happiness why would I be fucking miserable most of the time ? No , I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone should have the right to pursue happiness in their own way as long as it 's not hurting anyone else . That 's what I believe and what I consider , honestly , to be a liberal belief . I hope by the end of this post you will no longer see me as a danger to you . I have no desire to force anything upon you , either physically or ideologically . I 'm just having a polite , civilized conversation , one human being to another . I ca n't believe you find that entirely irrelevant or you would n't still be responding . <p> Well , thank you . That 's good to hear . I no longer consider you a danger , of course . <p> In any case , therapy can alleviate some of the pain but unless incel itself is defeated I doubt it will do much . <p> The problem with therapy and incel is twofold : 1 . in order to not be incel you need much more than therapy - you need to know how to create and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychiatrists chair ... <p> 2. it 's practically impossible to treat depression caused by incel because depression is a normal reaction to a highly abnormal situation like incel . One should never be taught how to live with incel or make peace with it . That 's like making peace with a nail in your leg . 41139 @qwx451139 <p> A goal is something someone aspires to . It needs to be understood and actively worked towards to be a goal . As for me , I have no goal beyond overcoming my own crippling social anxiety and depression . I can assure you I have no intention of eliminating anyone . But the important part here is that I still need you to explain who you mean when you talk about " decent people " . I expect you include yourself , but who else ? What is the criteria ? I do not ask this to mock you or even necessarily to argue . I am honestly interested in what you have to say and I will respond in a respectful manner even if I disagree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the word " goal " was n't probably the best one as I do accept that TAC/liberals are n't doing that on purpose but my point was that the final result will be ba . <p> As for decent people , told you - I never made my own definition . People who are kind , empathetic , polite , honest and things like that , I guess . Almost all liberals I 've met were the exact opposite .

Also if you get rear-ended and the rear-ender tries to shift the blame onto you when it 's clearly their fault , that 's one of the most frustrating things I can think of . People at music festivals who go to get drunk and be obnoxious and annoying , they are also fair game , and so are people who put their rubbish in your bins . <p> Oh but I suppose beastiality is okay ? Not everyone is fighting for the wrong reasons , some of us are smart enough to know better but honest enough to realise that a toe-to-toe showdown from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other pent up emotions that would otherwise remain bottled up and erupt at an inopportune moment instead .

I really can not stand bullies . Now do n't get me wrong , I think a person should try to talk their way out of and defuse every confrontation . But some people are out determined to start a fight - usually with people who look weak(er) . More often than not , this tends to be someone pretty drunk and unreasonable . No one should have to run away from someone , or be in fear of going out and having a good time because of people like this who think they 're entitled to do and say whatever they want to whoever they want with no fear or consideration for consequences . <p> I 'm by no means a violent person . I 've gotten into one fistfight in my entire life , and it was when I was maybe ten years old . But scum people like that are not going to learn a lesson unless someone teaches it to them . <p> And yeah , I could see being upset if you have a normal sized trashcan and someone else fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just take it out and put it on their lawn if it was too much . But starting a fistfight ? That 's the kind of behavior I was just talking about . Who the fuck does that ? <p> One time , I got into a fight with some drunk people . They were upset that I asked them to stop singing their native country 's national anthem in a crowded Chinese restaurant because it was bothering everyone else . Apparently , them was fightin ' words , because they waited in their car for me and my friend to leave the restaurant , then started pushing us around and telling us that we were pussies because we would n't fight them . <p> One dude pulled his pants down and started pissing on my friend 's shoes . No joke . It was , like , fucking February and this dude is standing their with his cock out . <p> I 've gotten into one fight in my whole life . It was during a soccer game and some dude decided to punch me in the nuts when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even really a proper fight as much as it was me punching him back . <p> There are a few situations I can think of where I 'd physically hurt someone . If someone were to hurt my girlfriend physically I 'd probably hurt them back as much as possible . <p> A few months ago I was driving with my girlfriend and saw some kid kick his dog for no reason . I almost pulled over the car and beat the shit out of him but my girlfriend stopped me . So I guess seeing someone abuse an animal is enough to send me into a violent rage .

When I say that , people always respond with , " But there is sociology in psychology and vice versa .

My intro to sociology class had units on race , gender , age , religion , education , sexuality , etc . <p> But sunny , she 's not even getting into the thick of it . Its like we talk about , say , gender inequality , and she always , inevitably ends the discussion with yet another " white society " lecture ... everything is " white society " to her . Yes i realize they are connected , and all of that sociological hooplah ... But I 'm sick of talking about the same thing day in and day out . We ca n't look at the other issues that play into all of this . <p> And i guess its a " you 're gon na prefer one over the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but i do n't think i could sit through another semester of this . Maybe there are sociology professors that do a much better job , but I really do think she 's ruined it for me . <p> It does n't help matters that she just gave us a 6 to 10 page midterm assignment . Its supposed to cover all areas that we 've studied so far , but in EVERY question , it ends with , " how do you think race plays into this ? " <p> I do n't know much about sociology except how it relates to my topic of interest ( cultural anthropology ) and the differences between the two ( cultural anthro can study basically any society , industrial , non-industrial , becoming-industrial , whereas sociology tends to focus on complex industrial societies = " Western " societies ) . Our approach is more hermeneutic ie. we go out there and observe how people live , talk to them on what they believe , and focus on smaller groups of people . Sociology is more interested in scientific ways of measuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same turf , we just approach it completely differently . <p> ( My biased view is that while the anthropological method is more dependant on the researcher doing the fieldwork , in some ways it 's more accurate as you actually go among people to see what they do and how they do it , instead of sending out a questionnaire to make them *tell* you what they do . My favourite example is that one American guy who tried to study gang life via traditional sociological methods but ended up living with gang members to see how their section of society was *actually* organized . Then again this is probably done more often nowadays in sociology , not just anthro . ) <p> The theories and the way sociology looks at society is what I would probably be interested in if I were to study it . <p> I personally see psychology as an overly complex , though necessary field of study to figure out something that is ultimately pretty damn unreachable . I took two courses in high school and never looked back , but I did think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very interesting . I felt like if I could remember that stuff when/if I have kids of my own , it 'll be beneficial . <p> Edit : Oh , I want to add ... What made me interested in Anthropology is the realization that the fields of research I already know about ( no matter how little ) do n't provide absolutely all-encompassing knowledge about the world around us . You can boil certain things to biological facts , chemical reactions , genetic make-up or behavioral psychology , but at the end of the day it 's Sociology and Anthropology that tell us about some of the most significant differences and the similarities between groups of people . For example , it 's a fact most people have sexual desires , but how people hook up to have sex , how people form marriages and partnerships , sexual relations outside marriages , etc etc those are dependent on the customs and the ways of the society and culture they live in . <p> This kind of realization helped me really sink my teeth into this field of study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the answers provided by this field ( Sociology/Cultural Anthropology ) reflect a very interesting ( and above all important ) side of human behavior . The aspect is somewhat overlooked by other fields of study . <p> So , it 's a white society . How does that affect you and your view of things ? How do certain non-white groups ( or non-hetero groups , or non-middle class groups ) view things differently ? I 'm not sure of Sociology would answer these sorts of question , but it 's an interesting thing for me to think about anyway . <p> Sociology can be interesting , it 's a very broad subject . But the study as an idea is fascinating . Race , ethnicity and identity are just one aspect of sociology . The fact that your course keeps returning to it is a shame but that 's probably the focus of the professor .

No stupid quizzes attached to this and you do n't have to name your favorite color . <p> The question is simple - do you consider yourself to be a smart person ? Or rather , smarter than most of the people around you ? Do you see the majority of the people around you as intellectual chaff ? <p> I 'll admit that I do occasionally view myself in this light . I believe I 'm a smart person , or at least smarter than most of the people around me . I would n't say that I 'm the only brilliant person in the room , or that other people are too dumb to keep up with me , but I definitely have a fair amount of confidence in my own intelligence . <p> And if it sounds like I 'm overly into myself , well then I 'm sorry . I 'm absent-minded to a fault and I have occasional flares of temper , so there are a few faults that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good question - one I suppose in which the answer could prove or disprove itself . <p> I do consider myself to be intelligent , yes . Somewhat more so than alot of the people around me . But at the same time , I hardly consider myself a genius , and there are people who would dwarf me intellectually , and I do n't just mean geniuses by that either . But honestly , yes , I consider myself more intellegent than ... hmm ... I do n't know if I want to say most people ... maybe the average person . <p> But there are alot of different forms of intelligence , or ways to judge how intellegent somebody is . For example , vocabulary , I think I have an excellent vocabulary , and often find myself toning it down when I talk to people . However , hand me some reasonable basic maths and I 'll sit there puzzled . There 's musical intellegence , situational intellegence , alot of this sort of thing . So I ca n't be bothered going into them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this anymore , though many on this forum might think otherwise . As I 've grown up some . back in the day . I even use myself as an example . reflected on things that happened in the past . I have a better understanding of things now . At least I can admit it now . I have somehow caused this situation by mentioning how I used to act on here . how I 've changed . I 'm a relatively normal poster now <p> Serious answer - yes i do . And to be honest I think most people would say yes . Statistically my grades have always been in the top 5-10% of my class which is my only real indication to be honset but I think its legitimate enough . <p> When it comes to common sense I have have practically none though . I ca n't cook to save my life and I always ask pretty obvious questions . <p> I do pride myself on a great vocabulary though <p> **28;7707;TOOLONG <p> When the rain comes I sit home and pray , Make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never really considered myself to really be that smart , just good at multiple choice tests .

I never really excelled in any of these programs , but I survived with just about a 3.0 GPA throughout . <p> Now that I 'm in college , though , I do feel a lot smarter than a lot of people around me . I 'm taking REALLY easy classes this semester ( college algebra , spanish 202 , english 101 , etc ) and I really do n't have to study or anything and I 'm doing pretty well so far . Or rather , at least better than the people around me in those classes . <p> I do tend to surround myself with people a lot smarter than me , though . Almost all of my friends are in , like , Calc 2 or 3 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be able to handle . <p> Most everyone I know considers me a genius , but I honestly just think of myself as average , despite my academic success and shockingly high IQ ( shocking to me , at least ) . There 's just so much I ca n't wrap my head around , and I 'm prone to brainfarts and stupid/slow comments . Sometimes common sense and practical shit just goes right over my head . <p> I think it all depends on how you measure intelligence of course . <p> Though I will admit that , though I try to stay humble about it , I ca n't help but think that maybe I 'm smarter than I 'm willing to admit when I meet certain people . You know what I 'm talkin ' about . <p> Like I imagine most people would say , I 'm smart in some things and not so smart in others . I was often considered a genius by my peers , but I can explain it away by being a great learner , excellent test taker , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually listen in class . So I never had to study or apply myself , but still got damn good grades . For things that would actually help me out in the real world , though , I find myself to be utterly useless . <p> Yes . First of all , I was lucky enough to be brought up by two very nurturing intellectual parents that challenged me from the get-go . I also worked hard to acquire a lot of the book smarts I have now . But I 'm an American . I think in a lot of other countries school 's I 'd be average , especially in Europe and east Asia . I think I 'm above average . <p> I will admit that I think I am fairly intelligent . Generally however I would n't say that I 'm the smartest over the majority . Just that there may be fields in which I would have the advantage , and other fields in which I would not have the advantage . <p> Short Answer : I do believe I am a reasonably intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic success ( or lack of ) would not tell you this , at all . I have had very few A 's throughout High School , I would be surprised if I have anything above a 2.0 GPA , and I am on the verge of not graduating . On the other hand I have been in ( and passed ) several honors classes . I 'm also kind of arrogant , and do/say some really absent minded things without thinking sometimes . <p> I think it depends . On the BBS I feel pretty average , although there are individuals that make me feel like a genius . In my real life I 'm not afraid to admit I am much more intelligent than those around me.

Wow , it sounds a lot worse than it was , she said all these things , but over the course of weeks and not in an upset tone or anything . Anyway , it 's nothing like that , I just simply do not enjoy hanging out with couples . I told her if they were going to be with even just one or two other people I 'd totally be done , but just the two of the was I enjoyable and a little awkward . Still , she thinks it 's a out of spite or jealousy or something . <p> Shortly after they started hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomly brought them up and how he does n't like hanging out with them . He and his girlfriend* went on some kind of double date with them and apparently they really did n't like it . He also told her that he did n't want to hangout with just the two of them , albeit in a much more rude way . <p> So I guess what I want to know is , am I being unreasonable and selfish ? Should I have tried avoiding them as much as possible and keeping my mouth shut ? Should I have just taken one for the team , continued to hangout with them , and not mention it ? I do n't know , I figured honesty was the best option , maybe not . At no point was I ever upset about them , but she 's certainly upset now , and her boyfriend thinks I hate him . <p> I do n't think its unreasonable . My good friend has a new boyfriend . I almost never accept an invitation to chill with her anymore because she almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention he 'll be there . I like her , but she always acts so ' coupley ' with her boyfriends ... like i 'm not even around . There is nothing worse than being the third wheel on what feels like a date for them . <p> I think what some couples do n't understand is that it has nothing to do with jealousy or hating couple or whatever . It creates a weird dynamic that I 'm not interested in or particularly comfortable with . I do n't enjoy hanging with two people who are best friends if it 's going to make me feel like an outsider either . I also have good friends whose friends I loathe , I 've told them this and that I have no intention of hanging out with them when they are with those friends . Obviously I do n't dislike them , I just do n't enjoy being in that position with other people . <p> I think it all depends on the people 's personalities and the way that they 're altered once they 're in relationships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less often they invite you to hang out with them , the more comfortable it should be . My best female friend has had a couple of boyfriends . Her old boyfriend was a guy that I liked personally , but she would always text me to come hang out with them . Always . And it was because she did n't actually have that much of a connection with the guy and needed me to prevent her from boredom . In contrast , her newer boyfriend is kind of a dumbass and I ca n't say I care for him that much . He 's tolerable in person , but he 's kind of a screw-up and he always makes really inflammatory and offensive facebook posts . That being said , something has managed to keep them together for a long time and they seem able to function on their own . I still keep in touch with her , but I 've only hung out with them a few times and none have been awkward at all . <p> I guess it really depends on couple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one my really good friends from work whenever me her and her boyfriend ( I am friends with her boyfriend too , but just alot better friends with her ) all go out I have such a good time . They never make me feel like the 3rd wheel . <p> But with my best friend she really ca n't understand why if I 'm over at her house and he boyfriend comes home why I leave . It is because I feel so uncomfortable and it is so awkward . I do feel like that 3rd wheel with them and he kinda makes it known . If we are in back room talking he will be in and out/making noises/calling for her and she has to go be by him . That 's not fun for me . What I do n't really do n't like is when they both are all over eachother/making out right in front of me . <p> Like I said it all depends on the couple . Some are a blast to hangout with and some are just uncomfortable . <p> I understand where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find hanging out with a couple uncomfortable . It 's that awkward third wheel feeling . Part of me wants to hang out with my two friends , but the other parts wants to leave and give them their space . <p> Maybe I 'm misinterpreting it , but it sounds to me like you just do n't like hanging out with THIS particular couple , rather than all couples . Some people are hopelessly obnoxious in a relationship , and they make it uncomfortable for anyone to hang out with them . I 've always made a point of acting platonic with my partner when around friends , no matter how new or exciting a relationship is . I do n't act any differently whether single or not ( and my friends confirm this without a doubt ) . But I totally know couples like the one you 've described , and they 're insufferable and you just wish they 'd break up so you could hang out with either or each of them like normal again . <p> If I 'm misinterpreting it and you really just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that 's super weird and it sounds very pessimistic and jealous . <p> Also , pet peeve - " hangout " is a noun , as in a place you go to hang out . " hang out " is a phrasal verb , as in what you do with friends . " hungout " is not a word . " hung out " is the past tense of " hang out " . Okay , I feel better now . <p> I have a girlfriend , and I absolutely HATE when my friends runaway from me just because she 's nearby . I 'm , or we 're , not the kind of couple who makes anyone feel like the third wheel , we do n't keep kissing or hugging all the time or anything when my friends are nearby , and we do that on purpose so that our friends do n't feel akward . Yet , they still runaway from us as if we make everyone uncomfortable . <p> I hate that . <p> " Noodles , the man who put the O in Obrigado. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience !

The new song they just released , " Evil Twin " , is actually pretty good , which also makes me want to check out the new album . * Bad Religion - The new Bad Religion album may not be as good as their older stuff like " Suffer " , " No Control " or " The Empire Strikes First " , but I 'm still going to check it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good is because of the absence of Greg Hetson , to me either him or Brett Gurewitz ( or both ) was the real reason Bad Religion got popular over 25 years ago . I did , however , like the Christmas album from 2013 , which Hetson did n't play on , so I will still check out the new album ( with Mike Dimkich as his replacement ) just in case . * Descendents - 11 years has passed since the Descendents last had album . I actually liked their last album " Cool to Be You " and I 'm definitely looking forward to their new record . * Dream Theater - I really liked their post-Mike Portnoy albums ( " A Dramatic Turn of Events " and the self-titled album ) and look forward to the next album . Dream Theater always deliver some awesome music . * Face to Face - Their last two albums ( " Laugh Now , Laugh Later " and " Three Chords and a Half Truth " ) were actually pretty good , so I 'm definitely looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kreator 's last four albums ( " Violent Revolution " , " Enemy of God " , " Hordes of Chaos " and " Phantom Antichrist " ) and ca n't wait to check out their new album . The new Kreator album , along with new albums from Anthrax and Testament , is among my anticipated thrash metal albums of 2016. * NOFX - Since the release of " So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes " back in 1997 , NOFX had put out an album every three years , but it looks like those gaps are no more , as El Hefe recently announced that they would be recording new music after the 25th anniversary of Fat Wreck Chords tour . In 2016 , it will be four years since they last had a proper album . Their last couple albums , including " Self-Entitled " , were awesome and I 'm definitely expecting the new one to be that awesome too . * Pennywise - I liked their latest album " Yesterdays " , and describe it as something of a comeback for Pennywise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band since he returned in 2012 . I 'm hoping their next album will do well too . * Social Distortion - It 's been four years since they released their last album " Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes " . My thoughts on a new Social D album are kinda the same as the next Offspring album . Like The Offspring , first they promise a new album and then they make us wait at least more than three or four years for it to be released . * Ten Foot Pole - Last year , I heard they were going to put out a new album this year , but since it 's now October , it looks like it wo n't be released until next year as they 're probably still writing/recording it . I 'm anticipating Ten Foot Pole 's first album since 2004 as much as the new albums/releases from nearly all the other bands I listed . * Testament - I loved their last album " The Dark Roots of Earth " , to me it 's a thrash metal masterpiece of the 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next album , especially with Steve DiGiorgio on bass . * The Vandals - They have n't had a proper studio album of new songs since 2004 's " Hollywood Potato Chip " . Since then , they released a remix album in 2005 ( " Shingo Japanese Remix Album " ) and a compilation of rare music in 2008 ( " BBC Sessions and Other Polished Turds " ) . During those 10 years , The Vandals have continued touring or playing shows here and there , and been promising some new music , but keep making us wait , just like Axl did with " Chinese Democracy " . Last year , they released a new-ish song , which is a cover of The Specials ' " It 's Got to Be Ska " , and they said they were going to release a new EP with new material , which to this day still has n't been released . I pray to God we will finally see a new Vandals album , EP , whatever they 're going to put out . <p> Since I 'm writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought The Offspring should be mentioned .

" thread then you should know why I 'm making this post- but in short , i need a new guitar and I need help choosing . I want something retro , different but not too perculiar . I do n't want a big scary BC Rich slipknot guitar , just something nice and new that 'll fit in a punk band . Here 's some of the guitars that I was thinking about : <p> I say go for the Stratocaster or RG . I 'd suggest the Les Paul , but given you 're only 13 the weight will probably be too much to play easily ( and that 's with a copy , the originals are made of far heavier materials ) . Though if you do get one get a Black Beauty . <p> What exactly is your price range ? Are there any particular features that you need ? Do you need a floyd rose bridge ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 fret guitar or 24 fret guitars ? Do you like your necks thin , thick , or whatever ? What amp do you have at the moment ? All those guitars you mentioned are extremely different so I 'm not exactly sure what you 're looking for in a guitar . I 'm a giant Ibanez whore so i 'd get the rg . I have a similar one but in black . <p> The rg2550 hands down is the best one . The rg350 is made in Korea while the rg2550 is made in japan . The quality control in japan is much better than in korea . The Edge Pro floating tremolo on the rg2550 stay in tune better than the rg350 's Edge III after heavy tremolo bar use . You 'll also wo n't be able to play any other neck after you try the rg2550 's Wizard neck . It 's extremely thin and smooth . It pratically plays itself . The wizard neck is a 5 piece maple neck with two bubinga stripes in the middle which helps prevent neck warpage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go wrong with them while the rg350 has mediocre stock ibanez pickups which are n't that terrible but ca n't compare to the dimarzios . The rg2550 also has directly mounted pickups which enhance the sustain . Do n't get me wrong about the rg350 though . The rg350 is still a great guitar but it is n't as good as the rg2550 . Infact , I own the very same rg350ex in that link you posted If you have the money , you could try buying some dimarzio pickups of your choice and putting them in the cheaper rg350 which could make it sound just as good or even better than the rg2550 . The trem the rg2550 would still be better than the rg350 's though . Even though the rg2550 's trem will stay in tune better than the rg350 after whammy bar use , the rg350 will stay in perfect tune forever if you do n't  use the bar . You could read my review of the rg350ex at LONG ... <p> My price range is within zero to 250 . I 'm looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium sized neck . I used to have a copy of a les paul but the neck ( strange enough as it sounds ) has warped . Unusual I know . <p> I own both a Stratocaster and Les Paul , and you know , the best of all my guitars is actually a nameless 170 one I bought from Argos . My Les Paul has a dull sound in comparison . Oh , and the necks of Les Pauls ( for me ) are difficult to play ... too wide generally . Go with the Strat .

@@44116281 @4116281/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> I want to share this so I can have your insight about the situation , well , here goes the whole story ( it 's gon na be quite long , I 'm affraid ... so If you want to skip the background you can go directly to the ***6th paragraph*** of this post ) <p> A month or so ago , I was walking on the street at Condesa when I saw this bar which was looking for personnel , I walked in and they hired me as a bartender ( I never signed any contract , btw ) . The bosses were a father and a son ( 50 something and 30 something respectively ) , who I believe were business associates with other people , but they were there all the time , the father as the cashier , and the son as the manager of the place . <p> Sometimes the father had to help me out with the bartending endeavors because it got too crowded and I was alone at the 2 feet long bar , serving for 100-120 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude all the time and twice he pushed me and kicked some cans I was picking up the floor , but all those times I stood up in front of his face and politely ( but directly ) told him not to ever touch me again or kick stuff on the floor . That was my situation but I learned how not to piss him up and eventually he gave me a rest . <p> In this bar I met two argentinian kids who were working there as waiters without FM3 , so they were hired illegally , but the owners were " helping them out " giving those kids jobs because nobody else would hire them and they plan to stay here in Mexico and make a living out of music and blablehbleh ... so , I befriended this kids because I have a band and they are really neat and nice guys ( they smoke dope , but everyone does it except me ... ) . <p> A week ago , I got fucking tired of working tuesday-saturday from 4:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m , I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could n't work anymore with a horrible boss and with no assistant , earning decent money but still , not worth the sacrifice , so I quit the job and left in good terms with the son . Now , yesterday the son called me , begging me to go just for that day to help them out because they were going to have a lot of people and the new bartender left the day before because he could n't stand the father , who I believe is bipolar or is mentally i 'll , he gets very very mad , even dangerously mad . So , I went to the bar , set my stuff up , everything went good , I had very little assistance from the father , and it was fine , until suddenly , the father , one of the argentinians and other fat dude went up the stairs and pushed the kid rudely and trash talked him , so I stood up to see what was happening and the fat dude started calling me names and threatening me , I commited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar and told me to come out and play ( hehe ... a lil ' humour : P ) , and the owners did n't move a finger or said anything , so things started to smell fishy to me , why would n't my bosses say or do anything ? Anyways , he kept trash talking , I told him to calm down , I had nothing on him so I would n't respond to his threats , then another guy joined the threatening ( they were clearly drunk and maybe under the influence of drugs ) , so I had 2 guys in front of the bar wanting to beat the shit out of me , but eventually they left . Now , the son who was 2 feet away told me not to laugh at those guys , not to provoke them , then he asked the kid what had happened , and he said that he approached the father , who was downstairs whith the two threatening guys to ask something about the door and without any reason , the father grabbed him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the son doing his math , me closing the bar , the other argentinian kid and other people ( like 7 or 8 , women included ) , who were friends and family of the owners drinking the last beers or whatever , and then the son told him to go to the corner and said no more . The kids were shocked and did n't understand what had happened , neither did I , so I told them to obey and wait for me to go and talk abput it and figure out what we would do . Later , the father and the two guys ( the fat one was his other son , I figured later ) went upstairs again just to close the bar and go home , and the kid told the father that he owed him an apology ... <p> ***6th Paragraph*** Now it turns ugly , the father stood still for 4 or 5 seconds , and suddenly he went berserk and hit the kid on the face and started yelling he didi n't owe anything to him , so , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood on the middle of them to keep ' em separated ( more jokes , sorry , I need to take it with a little humour ... it was pretty dense ) but the other kid hitting the father made the son ( who wa supposedly a cool guy ) enter the conflict , so it was me on the middle of two grown ups and two kids , preventing and pushing the father who was literally insane and trying to hit the kids with his bare fists , and the son who was trying to get me out of the middle , so , I tried to talk sone sense to the son , but he said " walk away ... " ... I mean , he was telling me to leave the place and let them beat the kids up ... errr ... no , I was not going to let that happen . All this time I was sepparating the furious father from the kids and surprisingly , neither the father or the son tried to punch me or anything , but then , the threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started hitting me , but they were drunk and it did n't hurt so much , so I tried to stand up , and I did , but they grabbed me again , and started yelling me not to mess with them and to leave ... man , I did n't know what to do , I was not going to leave the kids alone , not in this life , what if they killed them ? I swear it was very very intense and frigthtening , so I started thinking fast , what Am I going to do in this fucked up situation ? But I could n't do shit , they took one of the kids to a private room , and the two guys , who were drunk , but bigger than me threw me through the stairs and the other kid too , then one of the guys returned to the bar , and the other one tried to hit me hard , but again , he was drunk and I blocked his punches and pushed him away . Then , I was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , because there were 4 guys beating the shit out of our friend inside the bar , and we could n't do shit because the drunk guy would n't let us in , so I started looking for help , police , other club 's security wards , but no one would help ... a few minutes later they threw the beaten up kid to the street so I stopped a taxi which was luckily on the street and grabbed the kids and took them inside the car , and left ... the kid was pretty injured and he started crying ... <p> Never before in my life I was ever involved in a situation like this before , and I ca n't proceed legally because my friends would go to jail or get deported for working ilegally and this country is fucked up , I do n't have enough resources to keep my family ( my mother and my sister ) safe from people who want to hurt me ... maybe they wo n't try to mess with me , I just defended the kids , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father do all that shit ? What were they doing , that they felt threatened ? ? Anyways , after that situation I went to the police but did n't file anything because I have to think and get advice on how will I proceed to protect me and my family without pressing charges , because if I sue them now I they will have something to hate me for ... <p> Well , that 's my story , hope you can read the whole post , I would really appreciate the feedback . <p> -Chuck Berry is actually a blackberry ... <p> Originally Posted by steinberg <p> Off spring show is the most source of entertainment in the new generation . <p> I read this this morning .

@@44116284 @4116284/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> Is hatred ever justified ? <p> I understand it depends on how you define " hate " , but I guess what I 'm really asking is : is there an extreme level of contempt that you can hold towards a person ( to the point that you see them as below consideration ) that is justifiable depending on that person 's crimes/wrongdoings ? Do you personally hate anyone ? <p> This debate often pops into my mind when I hear someone say something like " I do n't hate her . I do n't I hate anyone . I just strongly dislike her " . <p> With my definition of hatred it is always justified . Disliking means not having any warm feeling towards someone and it 's not the same as having neutral feelings because when you dislike someone you know that there is nothing to like about him .

As the police prepare to storm the muslim position , the surviving terrorist staggers out with a white flag tied to his empty rifle . After a brief discussion on whether or not to honour his request to surrender , the police decide not to , and the entire area is riddled with bullets , hitting him seventeen times and carving him into unrecognisable chunks of meaty flesh . The police secretly bury both bodies face-down in unmarked graves in the desert . A lynching mob descends on the Muslim community , although they are stopped by the police and agree not to slaughter all the Muslims because experienced camel-driving teams are needed to bring water to the town . Instead they burn down the German Club , and cut the hoses of firefighters attempting to stop the blaze . All Germans , Austrians and Turks in the town have their property confiscated and are ordered to walk out of town , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version at the time <p> Two Turkish muslims carrying the Ottoman flag open fire on a trainload of unarmed civilians off for a picnic outside the mining town of Broken Hill . They kill four and wound six . The constabulatory arrives and in the ensuing battle a policeman is twice wounded , and both Turks killed in a fair fight . It is discovered that German spies were behind the attack , and these spies were later arrested and handed over to the authorities . <p> Official Turkish version at the time <p> Turks attack a massive Australian deployment in the middle of the Australian desert . Forty armed Australian servicemen are killed , and seventy are wounded . The Turks suffer two casualties in this battle . Broken Hill is now firmly under Ottoman control , with their troops marching on Sydney . <p> I do n't know much about history , but the Turkish version of events made me laugh .

@@44116289 @4116289/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> My personal theory ( based on experience and some guessing ) is that people do n't want to admit they 're wrong because they invest so much emotion and social standing into what they say --- they see being " right " as a means of gaining standing or credibility within a community , and so when they 're called out on something ( especially in a confrontational way ) , they do n't want to back down because they feel it makes them look weak . So in the moment , they 'll argue to the death , but then when the dust settles , they 'll silently correct their opinions , come back later and pretend that their opinion was the new " correct " one all along . <p> " I 'm sorry For all the things that I never did For all the places I never was For all the people I never stopped But there was nothing I could do ...

It can be a tricky thing to negotiate . <p> " The Offspring was a thing where I had to develop both my chops and my adaptability , " he says . " It was the fastest stuff I 'd ever played , and I had to learn to play faster while maintaining my volume level . It just made me stronger . " <p> It also made him more flexible artistically but let 's call it a hard-earned pragmatism . Until his first meeting with the bands head honcho Dexter Holland , Willard had figured that The Offsprings music contained a lot of room for individual interpretation , drum-wise . <p> " I went into the audition and did my own thing , and really kind of went off , " he says a bit ruefully .

" <p> Holland liked to say , " Stick to the script . " While Willard and Holland did discuss putting more of himself into Offspring drum parts , it was n't meant to be . Which , he s quick to point out , is not as bad as it sounds . <p> " I was eager to do the right thing , wanted to do right by them , and realized that these are huge songs thatve sold millions of records .

If the Angels &amp; Airwaves opportunity had n't  come up , who knows , I might still be there with Offspring . I did n't  have a lot of creative input , but I was n't a bandmember , I was an employee , so when I had the opportunity to be part of a band and have 25 percent creative input , and 25 percent financial output , that was very attractive . " <p> That was a nifty read . I like that he talks about how these songs are ones that millions of people know and he realized that it was n't his place to change it .

Even after the fallout , he still praises his time with The Offspring for making him a better player . Though the real focus of this is why he left as well ; the lack of input . I can see where he 's coming from , but the band just came off of having the same drummer for 15 years - he was n't going to be given full creative freedom immediately . Great player though , he just was n't meant for The Offspring . <p> Cool , cool . It 's interesting . I 've always known Dexter could be a control freak , but it would be nice to have other input by the rest of the band members .

But Pete 's way better with the Offspring . You could tell that Atom was struggling with the speed . there are a lot of videos where songs look slowed down . Pete instead is really fast and fits perfectly . <p> Speaking of not doing your research I would like to point out he joined the band in 2003 not 2002 <p> Also in the article it says he had a hard time playing the same songs every night . I wonder if we can thank him for the awesome setlist on the 2005 tour ? I remember that year they played Pay The Man , Mota , The Meaning of Life , Smash plus songs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pay The Man , Mota , The Meaning of Life , Smash plus songs from the first two albums <p> I 've heard all of those songs several times ( minus songs from the first album ) at regular shows , and s/t songs at many a club show . I think the 2005 " vault songs " were pure common sense , they had thousands of kids out every night who knew the offspring 's first 2 albums , who knew punk-o-rama songs etc . It 's common sense . I bet you half of the warped tour crowd either knows or pretends to know the Offspring earlier works and probably cites the age old bullshit " they were better before they hit it big " and " I really liked them back in the day " stupid non sense . At regular non-warped shows the ratio of people that know their earlier work and want to hear it is in the single digits precentage wise . It makes no sense to bum out a couple of thousand people to do a few dozen a favor . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one obscure song at every show . I just think they should <p> With that said I think every band should play at least one obscure song at every show . I just think they should <p> totally true . i think it plays a good part the fact that they should rehearse or re-learn some songs of course . it would n't be so easy to make a good performance of a song they barely play . ignition was awesome but I bet they practiced really a lot to make that set . If for example tonight they would rehearse " come out swinging " I think it would n't be as good as staring at the sun . On the other side lately they are always putting into the setlist some deep cut . 
@@44116310 @4116310/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> Hahahahahaha , oh man . As soon as I saw the title of this thread , the two names that came to mind were " brandon boyd " and " maynard james keenan " . In reality , though , Bono is the most pretentious frontman I can think of . <p> However , this clip does n't seem pretentious . Maynard is fucking weird , and has clearly done plenty of drugs in his time ... he 's a weirdo artistic dude . Sometimes I definitely think he can seem pretentious , but here he seems to be giving a lot of credit to his bandmates , etc , etc . I do n't know . He honestly just seems kinda weird and off ... but not pretentious . What specifically did he say that seemed so pretentious ? <p> Actually , you 've got a point ( Hehe maybe I could 've picked a better interview ) . In the beginning of the interview he 's crediting the rest of the band and all , but later on , he tries to get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ca n't stand his general demeanor . It just seems like he goes out of his way to have this look on his face that suggests " I 'm such a deep thinker " . And if you notice , the interviewer asks him questions on the purpose of life and whatnot , which is something you 'd ask a philosopher , not a rock group frontman . And I 'll bet you the reason she asked him questions like that has something to do with the way he presents himself . <p> Actually , you 're right about that ( Hehe maybe I could 've picked a better interview ) . In the beginning of the interview he 's crediting the rest of the band and all , but later on , he tries to get all " deep " and it annoys me . Also I just ca n't stand his general demeanor . It just seems like he goes out of his way to have this look on his face that suggests " I 'm such a deep thinker " . And if you notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whatnot , which is something you 'd ask a philosopher , not a rock group frontman . And I 'll bet you the reason she asked him questions like that has something to do with the way he presents himself . <p> Honestly , I think the fanbase is most responsible for Maynard 's pseudo-philosopher status . I do n't think he 's a truly pretentious guy at all . His fans , on the other hand , truly believe that Tool writes the deepest , most intricate music EVER in the entire world , and that if you do n't like Tool , it 's because Maynard 's lyrics are too deep and amazing for you to comprehend . Maynard downplays his lyrics by basically saying their songs are " angry " , whereas fans would say , " Oh but there 's SO MUCH to them that you just could n't understand ! " <p> There is one Tool album that 's called " Lateralus " , and the title is fairly deep in regards to the storyline of the album ... but fans have gotten so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the songs in different lateralus patterns , you get a different story . Tool has never , ever said anything about this ... but the fans seem to glorify Maynard and the band , and embellish so much . Perhaps the interviewers who ask him stupid philosophical questions are such fans ... or they 're reading off fan questions . <p> I think Maynard 's disposition and demeanor is the result of drugs , honestly . <p> I do hate that Maynard does n't denounce the bullshit his fans spew , but rather just let 's people think he 's really that deep . <p> haha , he was kind of a dick to her , but she annoyed the fuck out of me . I know Maynard has never enjoyed doing MTV interviews and the like , so I 'm not really surprised . They 've never been much of an MTV band in my opinion . <p> Man , he looks like a fucking teacher or something in that video . Maynard interviews are always pretty entertaining . BTW , even though I kinda think Maynard is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the albums before it . <p> Maynard is great ... but he does weird stuff ! One thing that I kind of find annoying with him ... with Tool and APC he 's very ... he does n't like to appear anywhere ! Very press shy . Like they never do cd signings in stores when the albums come out , etc . But , with his fucking wine , this fucker is on every place that sells wine giving autographs ! ! <p> Axl Rose has to win the most pretentious frontman title though ! Hate that fucker ! <p> A ghost is all that 's left , of everything we swore we never would forget . Tried to bleed the sickness , but we drained our hearts instead . We are ... we are the dead . 
@@44116311 @4116311/ 41167 @qwx451167 <h> 25 Movies that will destroy your faith in humanity <p> Has anyone ever seen any of these that they would recommend ? For some reason , I am really intrigued . <p> One fucked up movie that I can name that is n't on this list is " The Box " . That movie where you can push a button for a million dollars but someone somewhere in the world dies . That ending is messed up , simply because it shows a family being devastated in a way that most movies do n't . <p> Srpski Film/A Serbian Film . I have n't actually watched it and I never will . I have quite a few friends who have , and they have said it 's awful and disgusting - not only the content , but how this guy inherited dirty money from his parents , went abroad for years , and then came back to make a film depicting his fellow countrymen as the lowest slime possible . <p> I might also add Monster to this list . <p> Oh , and The Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who kidnapped his pregnant daughter and locked her in his basement for years ... she gave birth and did n't escape for like 16 years . <p> I agree with what Llamas friends have to say about Serbian Movie . It 's in that list for obvious reasons . There was a thread on here somewhere dedicated to that movie , that 's the only reason I watched it back then I think . <p> If I would recommend any of these movies , it 's got ta be Requiem for a Dream . From the movies I 've seen in that list , this one probably hold the right balance between being a good movie and sickness . <p> A Serbian Film was probably the most gruesome . Funny Games was really good . Antichrist was beautifully made . I Spit on Your Grave is a favourite of mine ( girl power fuck yeah ) . Requiem for a Dream was quite depressing , but very good . Cannibal Holocaust was quite gruesome , but I was mostly upset at the animal killings in it ( which were real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up also . <p> Sal= annoys me to no end as well ; it 's just a shitty exploitation film from the 70s that people attempt to give legitimacy to by claiming its a social commentary on consumer culture and fascism . Its not : a pervy director wanted to simulate teens eating fecies ; that 's as deep as it gets . <p> A few of those movies I do n't really feel belong on there : Old Boy , I Saw the Devil and House of Sound and Fog in particular are all really well made dramas/thrillers - i 'd recommend anybody see them . The subject matter is certainly very tough , but its not handled in an exploitative manner . <p> Originally Posted by Tom Gabel <p> Adrenaline carried one last thought to fruition .

Its not : a pervy director wanted to simulate teens eating fecies ; that 's as deep as it gets . <p> This is basically what the creators of A Serbian Film said - it 's commentary on how the Serbian government is fucking everyone . If that 's really what it 's about , there are certainly better ways to tell that . I ca n't approve of children acting in a movie in which their characters are raped in the film . <p> I just went to imdb to see what the discussions are like ... someone actually posted to ask if she could show this film to her 9-and-10-year-old sons ... they 've seen Scream and The Shining , so it should be okay , right ? Fucking idiot . <p> For some reason I 'll never watch Se7en again . Great movie , but I 've only seen it twice and it just makes me grumpy and down . It 's not even close to the most sickening movie around , it 's just about my limit . <p> One fucked up movie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Box " . That movie where you can push a button for a million dollars but someone somewhere in the world dies . That ending is messed up , simply because it shows a family being devastated in a way that most movies do n't . <p> I love the premise , though the movie basically sucked as I recall . Still , it 's a great thought experiment and I enjoy discussing with people whether they 'd do it or not . I generally find people say they would n't do it and then I crack their confidence to varying degrees . Because under the right circumstances we 'd all press it . Hell , I 'd barely hesitate and I 'm a good person ( not my opinion , I simply fit society 's general concept of what a good person is ) . 41128 @qwx451128 <p> Out of the those that I 've seen , they either are n't particularly disturbing , or they 're so clearly aiming for shock value that it hardens your stomach and ruins the impact . A few of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some ' squick ' value , but it 's too hilarious to be truly disturbing . Deliverance and The Mist are just straight-up good movies , and not disturbing in the least . <p> Now , to recommend some movies as bad or worse than anything on that list ( at least , out of the ones I 've seen ) <p> - " Bad Boy Bubby " opens with a retarded man being raped by his grossly obese mother . It 's the least disturbing movie out of the ones I list , because it 's genuinely funny and heartwarming at times . Let that serve as a benchmark for the following . <p> - " Snowtown " is an excellently made movie , and it 's the only excellent movie I warn my friends to never , ever watch . It 's possibly the only movie I 've ever seen to negatively affect my life . You will honestly live a happier life if you 've never seen it . Snowtown should be on that list . <p> - " The Boys " is a slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go you watch it , you 'll find it boring and drawn-out , although you 'll probably appreciate David Wenham 's performance as a sociopathic " regular guy " . If you watch it knowing the details of the murder it was based on ( as many Australians do ) , it will fucking horrify you , and it will make you fear your neighbours . <p> - " Savior " is worth a mention . The hero is a spree-shooting terrorist mercenary who snipes children for the Serbs . It can only get worse from there . <p> - " The Divide " is a fairly entertaining movie , although it becomes pretty grueling to watch . If they think ' The Mist ' was a harsh indictment of human nature and mob culture , ' The Divide ' is a billion times worse . <p> - " Come And See " is a movie I 've only heard of in hushed whispers and rumours . It 's supposedly the most disturbing movie ever made . It supposedly makes ' Serbian Film ' and ' Salo ' look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on the internet . I ca n't personally vouch for whether or not it lives up to its reputation , but I seriously would n't recommend trying to find this movie . 
@@44116312 @4116312/ 41167 @qwx451167 <p> The same happened to me , I was looking into it and found that the Crackle is only available in certain countries . It 's not available in the UK so I assume it 's the same for most of Europe . <p> However , I found what I think is the audio version of the interview . Can someone from the US confirm that it is the same interview ? Here 's the audio version available in the UK . Also It 's from 2015 so do n't expect anything about new album ..
