This is no coincidence . Microwave ovens heat food through a process of creating molecular friction , but this same molecular friction quickly destroys the delicate molecules of vitamins and phytonutrients ( plant medicines ) naturally found in foods . One study showed that microwaving vegetables destroys up to 97% of the nutritional content ( vitamins and other plant-based nutrients that prevent disease , boost immune function and enhance health ) . <p> In other words , eating raw broccoli provides you with natural anti-cancer medicine that 's extremely effective at halting the growth of cancer tumors . But microwaving that broccoli destroys the anti-cancer nutrients , rendering the food " dead " and nutritionally depleted . There 's even some evidence to suggest that microwaving destroys the natural harmony in water molecules , creating an energetic pattern of chaos in the water found in all foods . In fact , the common term of " nuking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bit like dropping a nuclear bomb on your food , then eating the fallout . ( You do n't  actually get radiation from eating microwaved foods , however . But you do n't  get much nutrition , either . ) <h> Why microwave users are so unhealthy <p> Consumers are dying today in part because they continue to eat dead foods that are killed in the microwave . They take a perfectly healthy piece of raw food , loaded with vitamins and natural medicines , then nuke it in the microwave and destroy most of its nutrition . Humans are the only animals on the planet who destroy the nutritional value of their food before eating it . All other animals consume food in its natural , unprocessed state , but humans actually go out of their way to render food nutritionally worthless before eating it . No wonder humans are the least healthy mammals on the planet . <p> The invention of the microwave and its mass adoption by the population coincides with the onset of obesity in developed nations around the world . Not only did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it also destroyed much of the nutritional content of those foods , leaving consumers in an ongoing state of malnourished overfeeding . In other words , people eat too many calories but not enough real nutrition .

These diseases are all caused by a combination of malnutrition and exposure to toxic chemicals ( plus other factors such as emotional trauma , lack of exercise , etc . ) . Microwaves make malnutrition virtually automatic , and being exposed to toxic chemicals is easy to accomplish by simply eating processed foods ( which are universally manufactured with the addition of toxic chemicals that act as preservatives , colorings , flavor enhancers and so on ) . <p> Microwaving is , technically , a form of food irradiation . I find it interesting that people who say that would never eat " irradiated " food have no hesitation about microwaving their food . Its the same thing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , microwaves were originally called " radar ranges . " Sounds strange today , does n't  it ?

This was seen as some sort of space-age miracle in the 1970s . Perhaps someday an inventor will create a food heating device that does not radically alter the nutritional value of the foods in the process , but I 'm not holding my breath on this one . Probably the best way to heat foods right now is to simply use a countertop toaster oven , and keep the heat as low as possible . <p> The microwave does work as advertised , by the way . It makes your food hot . But the mechanism by which heat is produced causes internal damage to the delicate molecular structures of vitamins and phytonutrients .

That 's what the pharmaceutical industry and the pink ribbon folks would like you to think . But this is far from the truth . <p> One of the least known well-documented cures for cancer was created by a German biochemist and physicist named Johanna Budwig in the 1950s . Dr. Budwig was a leading authority on fats , oils and nutrition . She believed that cancer , as well as the vast majority of illnesses , was primarily caused by the improper processing of foods and oils , particularly the overheating or boiling of oils . Her patients were those so terminally i 'll that traditional medical practitioners had given up on them , with many having been given only days or hours to live . She treated these patients with a simple diet based on a combination of flaxseed oil and sulphurated protein . <p> While studying the blood samples of cancer patients and healthy persons , Dr. Budwig concluded that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while those without cancer did not . This deficiency resulted in a reduced oxygen level in the cells . It is well known that cancer cells can thrive only in an anaerobic environment . Her task was then to create a method by which cells could be re-oxygenated . Noting that saturated fats lacked the necessary pi-electron shells necessary to provide the high energy levels needed to effect oxygen transport , she discovered that unsaturated fats were the key in obtaining these pi-electrons . Flaxseed oil provides linoleic and linolenic fatty acids , both rich in high energy producing pi-electron . These fatty acids render the body able to assimilate and transfer immense amounts of oxygen into the cells , allowing for oxidation and detoxification of cellular waste . They also enable the restoration of the lipid membrane of cells so essential to intra and extra cellular balances . <p> Another significant aspect of Dr. Budwigs work is her acknowledgement of the connection between the human body and the sun . She demonstrated that when the body is nourished with health giving oils and proteins , the pi-electrons serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see , the Budwig diet is not really a method of curing cancer in and of itself . It simply helps correct an omega 3 deficiency that , when corrected , allows the body to heal itself . The benefits of this diet are not confined to those battling cancer , but extend to the healing of those with liver dysfunction , diabetes , arthritis , heart disease , stomach ulcers , eczema , immune deficiencies , MS , IBS and other diseases . Its value as a preventative can not be overstated . <p> There are thousands of documented cases of recovery from cancer with the Budwig diet . For her research and practice , Dr. Budwig was nominated for six Nobel Prizes . She was also subjected to endless vilification and harassment by the orthodox medical establishment , and the German pharmaceutical industry . Publication of her clinical studies and research papers was refused . However , her books are now widely available and can be purchased from Amazon.com and other book sellers . Johanna Budwig lived to be 95 years old . <p> Ironically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conducting that suggested that flaxseed oil and a low fat diet can help those with cancer . <p> The Budwig Diet consists of a flaxseed spread ; and a mayonnaise made from flaxseed oil , low fat cottage cheese or yogurt with perhaps the addition of honey , fruit , garlic , cayenne , herbs , fresh squeezed fruit juice , ground flaxseeds , or a little water . One of these mixtures is taken 2 or 3 times daily . Meals consist of nutritionally dense whole foods . <p> Sugar is forbidden on the diet . This is because the cell takes up glucose ( sugar ) and gives off lactic acid which creates an acidic environment in the body . Cancer needs an acidic environment to flourish and can not survive in an alkaline environment . Also forbidden are animal fats , all salad oils including commercial mayonnaise , meats containing chemicals and hormones , margarine , and anything containing preservative ( preservative blocks the metabolism of flaxseed oil ) . Sweetening may be accomplished through the use of fruit juice or honey . Warm tea made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be taken in the form of one cup per day . <p> The specifics of the complete Budwig diet may be easily researched online . For people wishing to fit the Budwig approach into todays lifestyle , particularly as a preventative , it may be easily done by blending -+ to -+ cup of low fat organic cottage cheese with 2 to 3 tablespoons of high quality flaxseed oil . Stir this mixture quickly until the oil and cheese are well blended and no pools of oil can be seen . Blending is accomplished when you can hold a spoonful upside down for a few moments and the mixture does not fall out . Eat it once or twice a day . Although this may sound unappetizing , it is really easy to get used to . Addition of cumin or dillweed with cayenne pepper makes is yummy . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

@@42977776 @2977776/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> Grapeseed Extract Kills 76% of Leukemia Cancer Cells in 24 Hours <p> A new study conducted at the University of Kentucky in the United States , and published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research , found that leukemia cancer cells exposed to grapeseed extract ( GSE ) were rapidly killed through a process of cell suicide known as " apoptosis . " <p> In these laboratory studies , an astonishing 76% of leukemia cells committed suicide within 24 hours thanks to the ability of GSE to activate a protein called JNK , which regulates apoptosis . <p> In a healthy person , cancer cell apoptosis is a normal , healthy part of biology . Every living system creates cancerous cells . There are hundreds or thousands of " microtumors " in every human being living today , but cancerous cells in healthy people destroy themselves once they realize they 're flawed . This cellular " realization , " however , requires healthy cell communication , and that 's dependent on the correct nutrients , minerals and proteins being available in the body . <p> Grapeseed extract appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly assess their own flawed state so they can engage in apoptosis ( cell suicide ) , thus protecting the larger organism ( the body ) . <p> Its important to note that this recent study was conducted in a lab , not in human beings , so its conclusions can not necessarily be directly translated into saying something like " grapeseed extract cures cancer , " for example . However , it does indicate quite convincingly that if the unique phytochemical molecules found in grapeseed extract can be delivered to leukemia cells with sufficient potency , they may play an important role in cancer cells destroying themselves , thereby protecting the whole organism from runaway cancer . <p> If the results demonstrated in the labs at the University of Kentucky can be replicated in humans , it could potentially position grapeseed extract as one of the most powerful natural chemotherapeutic agents yet discovered . <p> Grapeseed extract has been studied and demonstrated to be remarkably effective at killing cancer cells for many different types of cancer , by the way , including cancers of the breast , prostate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes ? <p> The conventional cancer community , of course , is quick to warn people not to simply eat more grapes in the hopes that grapeseed extract will help prevent their cancer . But I ask , " Why not ? " Unlike toxic chemotherapy , eating grapes has zero negative side effects . At the same time , grapes offer numerous other health benefits , since they are a source of resveratrol and various protective phytonutrients . <p> Of course , you have to eat grapes with seeds in them , and since the global food supply has become so distorted over the past few years , its difficult to find grapes with seeds in them . My advice ? Buy your grapes from a health food store : Look for organic , seeded grapes . And when you eat them , do n't  spit out the seeds ( obviously ) . Chew them up , and you 'll digest the grapeseed extract that 's naturally present in those seeds . <p> I 've talked with conspiracy theorists who believe the seeds were purposely taken out of the grapes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-cancer nutrients from food , thus keeping people sick ) . I disagree with that explanation , however : Seedless grapes are simply a product of consumer demand , in much the same way that consumers prefer seedless watermelon . If consumers actually knew about the health benefits of grape seeds , they might think differently , but thanks to efforts by the FDA and USDA , the mainstream public has remained virtually illiterate on nutrition for several decades , and you 'll rarely meet an individual who is aware that eating grape seeds is actually good for you . <p> Do n't  be fooled by the cereal Grape Nuts , by the way . That 's just a clever name . The cereal contains no grape seeds whatsoever . ( Its made from roasted barley and other grains . ) <h> Protecting healthy cells <p> Another important finding in the University of Kentucky study is that the grapeseed extract was not toxic to normal , healthy cells even as it helped cancer cells commit suicide . <p> This is hugely important because it shows , yet again , that Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conventional chemotherapy chemicals are extremely toxic to healthy cells , which is why chemotherapy causes permanent brain damage ( " chemo brain " ) , kidney damage and heart damage . Grapeseed extract , however , causes no such damage , and there has never been a person who died from eating grapes . ( There have been millions , probably , who were killed by chemotherapy . ) <p> As Professor Xianglin Shi , the lead researcher of the study , said in a BBC article : " These results could have implications for the incorporation of agents such as grapeseed extract into prevention or treatment of haematological ( blood ) malignancies and possibly other cancers . What everyone seeks is an agent that has an effect on cancer cells but leaves normal cells alone , and this shows that grapeseed extract fits into this category . " <p> In other words , grapeseed extract is now a candidate for a natural chemotherapeutic agent . <h> Grapeseed extract and endurance <p> The benefits of grapeseed extract do n't  stop with its anti-cancer potential , by the way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing oxidative stress during exercise . <p> I posted another article today about the results of a fascinating preliminary clinical trial using grapeseed extract , the antioxidant used in Moxxor ( which is a premium marine omega-3 oil supplement that contains grapeseed extract as one of its three ingredients ) . <p> The results of that clinical trial are extremely promising in showing that the grapeseed extract used in Moxxor may help reduce the level of oxidative stress experienced during exercise . This trial was conducted by Dr. Glenn Vile in conjunction with HortResearch , a New Zealand research institution . <p> This preliminary trial was conducted on competitive boat rowers who were given GSE one hour before engaging in vigorous exercise . ( The trial was structured as a double-blind , randomized cross-over trial using placebo . ) Results indicate that the rowers given GSE experienced a significant reduction of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , a chemical marker for exercise-induced oxidative stress . The reduction level was 34% + / 6% <p> In all , this is fantastic news about grapeseed extract , as it demonstrates the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab . Given that grapes are a safe and customary part of the food supply , and that grapes are naturally intended to contain seeds , it seems quite sensible to conclude that human beings were intended to eat grape seeds and derive health benefits from them . Buy more ( seeded ) grapes ! <p> Grapeseed extract is also available as a nutritional supplement from numerous sources , but one thing you 'll notice about GSE in supplement form is that the actual nutrient is so tiny that most of the GSE supplements contain a lot of filler ( silica , stearic acid , silicon dioxide , etc . ) . I 've recently become more concerned about the cumulative levels of consumption of supplement fillers by people who take a lot of nutritional supplements , and I 'm personally reducing my consumption of supplement pills while increasing my consumption of superfood-based powders and fresh product . <p> The best way to get grapeseed extract is by eating grape seeds . The second best way is to get it mixed in with a superfood powder or supplement that contains no filler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a GSE capsule made with a lot of filler , so keep that in mind . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

Zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of tea leaves dose and tea concentration . The cerebrum is the portion of the brain ( frontal lobes ) where thought and higher function reside . <p> Tea Exempt From Contaminant Levels Defined by Government <p> Fluoride in tea is much higher than the Maximum Contaminant Level ( MCL ) set for fluoride in drinking water which is 4 parts per million ( ppm ) . About 50 percent of fluoride ( from any source ) is deposited in the bone and teeth ; the other half is excreted . <p> The MCL is set so as to only avoid the third and crippling stage of this disease . It is set at 4ppm =&gt; 4mg/liter , assuming that people will retain half of this amount ( 2mg ) , and therefore be at a " safe " level . The EPA scientists , whose job and legal duty it is to set the MCL , declared that this level was set fraudulently by outside forces , and that 90% of the data showing the mutagenic properties of fluoride were omitted . Chemical toxicologist and former EPA consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sources that were not disclosed to the public , fluoride studies and safety limits took a back seat to other interests . " Webert believes the United States Government was fully aware of these foreign interests and did nothing to protect Americans from current levels of fluoride poisoning in drinking water . <p> How Does Fluoride Affect The Body ? <p> Tea leaves accumulate more fluoride ( from pollution of soil and air ) than any other edible plant . Coincidently , fluoride content in tea has risen conconcurrently and dramatically with global tea consumption over the last 20 years . <p> Drinking high levels of fluoride can cause bone-forming cells to lay down extra skeletal tissue , which increases bone density . At the same time , it also increases bone brittleness that can result in a disease known as skeletal fluorosis . So while bones are more dense , they are also more brittle . Skeletal fluorosis can produce : <p> Bone , muscle and joint pain <p> Calcification of ligaments <p> Bone spurs <p> Fused vertebrae <p> Difficulty moving joints <p> Says Dr. Whyte , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , and there is no established treatment for skeletal fluorosis , No one knows if you can fully recover from it . " In other words , fluoride accumulates in your body . <p> According to one estimate , the first phase of skeletal fluorosis could easily develop in as few as five years if a person were to consume the amount of fluoride found in three or four cups of green tea every day . <p> While in 1976 a Belgian analysis showed content of between 50 and 125 ppm fluoride in 15 varieties of tea , a Polish study in 1995 found fluoride content of up to 340 ppm in 16 varieties of black tea . A major Canadian study published in 1995 reports average fluoride content in tea to be 4.57 mg/l in the 1980s . <p> Babycenter.com , a pro-fluoridation infant medical group lists a cup of black tea to contain 7.8 mgs of fluoride , which is roughly the same amount as if one were to drink 7.8 litres of water in an area fluoridated at 1ppm . <p> Virtually every company selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in preventing cavities , promulgating the misleading and false data supplied for the last 50 years by the ADA/CDA and other dental health trade organizations , as well as various public health agencies . There are NO double-blind studies anywhere proving the efficacy of fluoride as a caries preventative . There ARE double-blind studies proving adverse health effects , at the level of 1ppm ( 1mg/l ) in water . There are no studies documenting safety at any intake level . <p> Drinking a cup of tea with fluoride content as mentioned above ( 7.8mg ) would mean a fluoride intake much higher than amounts which were actually given as medication to treat hyperthyroidism ( over-functioning thyroid ) for numerous decades in several countries specifically to reduce thyroid activity . <p> To make matters much worse for human health , fluorides in teas are found together with aluminum . The combination of aluminum and fluorides in tea is of urgent concern , due to the increased damage done by fluorides when in the presence of aluminum , especially neurological and renal damage . It also increases the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been linked to Alzheimers disease . <p> Aluminum by itself is not readily absorbed by the body , however in the presence of fluoride ions , the fluoride ions combine with the aluminum to form aluminum fluoride , which is absorbed by the body .

What Can You Do ? <p> Stick to white tea which has the least amount of fluoride by ratio . Favour purchasing organic tea over conventional . It does n't  mean all organic teas will be absent of fluoride , but the methods for cultivation are typically superior to conventional growers and some may even use purified water for the soil to grow their teas and , environmental toxins and health policy . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

" But little do they know that many common household products contain deadly chemicals that are known to cause cancer , reproductive harm , birth defects and other health damage . Heres six of the most popular categories to avoid for the safety of you and your family : <p> Credits : Boris Kaulin/iStock/Thinkstock <p> 1 ) Air fresheners . They 're a staple in many American households , but conventional air fresheners are a hotbed of poisonous substances that could leave you and your loved ones infertile , brain-damaged or chronically i 'll . Tests conducted by the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) found that most air fresheners contain phthalates , which among other things interfere with male hormone production . <p> Most air fresheners are also loaded with other cancer-causing volatile organic compounds as well , which interfere with reproduction , respiration and cellular regeneration . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington found that all air fresheners tested emitted chemicals known to be carcinogenic , meaning they cause cancer . <p> Instead of toxic commercial air fresheners , stick with all-natural essential oils , which can be applied to the skin or released into the air from a diffuser . <p> 2 ) Candles . Similar to commercial air fresheners , many scented candles are also toxic . A study pioneered by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) found that nearly half of all scented candles on the market contain lead wiring in their wicks , which is released into the air upon burning . This lead might make the wicks more stable , but it also leads to hormone disruption , behavioral disorders and various other health problems . <p> Many candles are also made of paraffin wax which , when burned , generates two highly- toxic- compounds , benzene and toluene , both of which are carcinogenic . Artificial fragrances and dyes are also present in many scented candles , which when burned end up in your lungs . <p> 3 ) Art supplies .

Millions of people use them daily to cover up foul body odor and reduce armpit perspiration . But antiperspirant deodorants are a no-go if you want to avoid chemicals like aluminum chlorohydrate , which can absorb directly into the skin and promote the formation of breast cancer . Aluminum from antiperspirants is also believed to contribute to brain diseases like Alzheimers . <p> Other toxic additives in antiperspirant deodorants include parabens , a class of artificial preservatives that mimics estrogen in the body and promotes the growth of cancer cells .

In cases where some ( or all ) of the symptoms associated with cardiac arrest are present , those at the scene should perform CPR and begin the use of the defibrillator as soon as possible . At the same time , someone should call the emergency operator at 911 to request that immediate medical help be sent to the location . Ideally , someone on site will be qualified to perform CPR and to operate the defibrillation system ; however , if no trained individual is at the location , the emergency operator can usually provide detailed instructions on CPR and on the proper use of the AED . <p> Procedures for Implementation <p> In many areas of the country , a prescription is required for the purchase and implementation of an AED system in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Association , recommend that local emergency medical services providers be informed of the presence and location of the AED once it has been put into place .

But they also know and admit that there is no way whatsoever to predict whether the case will be mild or severe even deadly . With this much uncertainty in dealing with the very lives of people , it is very unscientific and extremely dangerous to use such a questionable procedure as vaccination . <p> Many vaccines also cause other diseases besides the one for which they are given . For instance , smallpox vaccine often causes syphilis , paralysis , leprosy , and cancer . Polio shots , diphtheria toxin-antitoxin , typhoid vaccine , as well as measles , tetanus and all other shots often cause various other stages of disease such as post-vaccinal encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain , ) paralysis , spinal meningitis , blindness , cancer ( sometimes within two years , ) tuberculosis , ( two to twenty years after the shot , ) arthritis , kidney disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot and sometimes several hours later . ) Nerve damage and many other serious conditions also follow the injections . <p> When several shots are given ( different vaccines ) within a few days or a few weeks apart , they often trigger intensified cases of all the diseases at once , because the body can not handle such a large amount of deadly poison being injected directly into the bloodstream . The doctors call it a new disease and proceed to suppress the symptoms . <p> When poison is taken by the mouth , the internal defense system has a chance to quickly eject some of it by vomiting , but when the poisons are shot directly into the body , bypassing all the natural safeguards , these dangerous poisons circulate immediately throughout the entire body in a matter of seconds and keep on circulating until all the cells are poisoned . <p> I heard that seven men dropped dead in a doctor 's office after being vaccinated . This was in an army camp , so I wrote to the Government for verification . They sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stimson . The report not only verified the report of the seven who dropped dead from the vaccines , but it stated that there had been 63 deaths and 28,585 cases of hepatitis as a direct result of the yellow fever vaccine during only 6 months of the war . That was only one of the 14 to 25 shots given the soldiers . We can imagine the damage that all these shots did to the men . ( See the chapter on What Vaccinations Did to Our Soldiers . ) <p> The first World War was of a short duration , so the vaccine makers were unable to use up all their vaccines . As they were ( and still are ) in business for profit , they decided to sell it to the rest of the population . So they drummed up the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history . There were no epidemics to justify it so they used other tricks . Their propaganda claimed the soldiers were coming home from foreign countries with all kinds of diseases and that everyone must have all the shots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all , they wanted to believe their doctors , and second , the returning soldiers certainly had been sick . They did n't know it was from doctor-made vaccine diseases , as the army doctors do n't tell them things like that . Many of the returned soldiers were disabled for life by these drug-induced diseases . Many were insane from postvaccinal encephalitis , but the doctors called it shell shock , even though many had never left American soil . <p> The conglomerate disease brought on by the many poison vaccines baffled the doctors , as they never had a vaccination spree before which used so many different vaccines . The new disease they had created had symptoms of all the diseases they had injected into the man . There was the high fever , extreme weakness , abdominal rash and intestinal disturbance characteristic of typhoid . The diphtheria vaccine caused lung congestion , chills and fever , swollen , sore throat clogged with the false membrane , and the choking suffocation because of difficulty in breathing followed by gasping and death , after which the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen in the suffocation stages . In early days they called it Black Death . The other vaccines cause their own reactions " paralysis , brain damage , lockjaw , etc . <p> When doctors had tried to suppress the symptoms of the typhoid with a stronger vaccine , it caused a worse form of typhoid which they named paratyphoid . But when they concocted a stronger and more dangerous vaccine to suppress that one , they created an even worse disease which they did n't have a name for . What should they call it ? They did n't want to tell the people what it really was " their own Frankenstein monster which they had created with their vaccines and suppressive medicines . They wanted to direct the blame away from themselves , so they called it Spanish Influenza . It was certainly not of Spanish origin , and the Spanish people resented the implication that the world-wide scourge of that day should be blamed on them .

When their own vaccines ( required for travel ) cause vaccine diseases abroad they use this as grounds for a scare campaign to stampede people into the vaccination centers .

These were all medically-made epidemics mixed with the usual common colds which people have every year . <p> Now ( 1976 ) we are being worked on again by the vaccine -epidemic makers in their effort to force another multi million dollar vaccine sale caper . Their con men have already talked President Ford into handing over $135 million dollars to start their vaccine racket . Even the insurance companies refused to become involved with such an obviously dangerous and crooked scheme . So , again the medical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance against the , possible billions of dollars in law suits which could be brought against the vaccine promoters if the vaccine campaign is carried out as planned . It 's a good thing Ford was voted out of office . It 's too bad he was n't " dumped " before he paid the poison squad the MONEY ' to poison the whole population . However , we do n't yet know if President Carter will be any better . Will he be held in the grip of the medical and drug dictatorship ? Or will he investigate " learn the truth " reverse the decisions and make the vaccine makers return the money taken from the taxpayers under false pretenses ? <p> The statement of the swine flu vaccine promoters to the effect that the vaccine is harmless , is false , and the statement that it will protect against flu is false . Fifty-six people died after the shots , some within 48 hours . There is confusion and disagreement among the doctors about all aspects of the vaccine , from the safety and effectiveness to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be warned against it . <p> Their scare-head campaign cry is that the swine flu is like the 1918 flu which killed 20,000,000 people . They do n't have any usable and provable blood samples from the 1918 flu epidemic to prove it . That was 58 years ago , and the doctors were just as confused and inefficient then as now . However , one thing is certain " the 1918 Spanish Influenza was a vaccine-induced disease caused by extreme body poisoning from the conglomeration of many different vaccines . The soldiers at Fort Dix who were said to have had Swine Flu had been injected with a large variety of vaccines like the vaccines which caused the 1918 flu epidemic . The flu epidemic at Fort Dix was in no way related to swine . There were no swine at camp ( unless we want to sarcastically call the vaccine promoters who caused the diseases - " swine . " ) <p> To add to the confusion , the doctors tell the people that there are a lot of various kinds of flu ; the one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are other strains of flu virus , and also , that the swine flu vaccine which so many people have taken already will not protect them against the many other types of flu . This will be used as an " out " in case of law suits later on when more casualties begin to show up . The doctors will say that the vaccine failed because it was the wrong kind of flu for the vaccine . Of course , no one can prove it one way or the other because viruses are illusive , invisible organisms which are unstable and unpredictable . One dictionary definition of virus is " a morbid poison . " The vaccines injected into the body are poison and cause the typical poison reactions . Virus ( poison ) does not fly around and attack people . <p> Therefore , there will be no swine flu epidemic unless the vaccine promoters make one like they did in the 1918 flu epidemic . It will not kill 20,000,000 people unless the people submit to the disease-producing shots . There are also , other causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been devitalized and contaminated with poison preservatives and artificial drug concoctions . There are many more causes of disease but no diseases are contagious . <p> Vaccine drives come and go as often as the vaccine promoters can cook up the slightest pretense of a reason.n Back in1957 they were trying to stir up a vaccination campaign for what they decided to call Asiatic flu . An editorial in the Herald and Express for August 29 , 1957 was captioned , " Fear of Flu Propaganda . " Part of the piece is as follows : <p> " What a tempest in a teapot has been blown up over the probability that this country will experience an epidemic of the Asiatic flu in the fall and winter months ahead . <p> " Even the United States Department of Health is stooge for the panic " and has issued statements which are frightening the public , rather than reassuring them by pointing out that this epidemic , while widespread , gives no indication of being any more dangerous than our usual flood of influenza-like colds when winter comes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder whether the whole thing might not be a bit of super salesmanship on the part of those who are making and selling the vaccines which are being prepared .. . . " <p> - I WAS AN ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVER OF THE 1918 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC <p> All the doctors and people who were living at the time of the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic say it was the most terrible disease the world has ever had . Strong men , hale and hearty , one day would be dead the next . The disease had the characteristics of the black death added to typhoid , diphtheria , pneumonia , smallpox , paralysis and all the diseases the people had been vaccinated with immediately following World War 1 . Practically the entire population had been injected " seeded " with a dozen or more diseases " or toxic serums . When all those doctor-made diseases started breaking out all at once it was tragic . <p> That pandemic dragged on for two years , kept alive with the addition of more poison drugs administered by the doctors who tried to suppress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flu hit only the vaccinated . Those who had refused the shots escaped the flu . My family had refused all the vaccinations so we remained well all the time . We knew from the health teachings of Graham , Trail , Tilden and others , that people can not contaminate the body with poisons without causing disease . <p> When the flu was at its peak , all the stores were closed as well as the schools , businesses " even the hospital , as the doctors and nurses had been vaccinated too and were down with the flu . No one was on the streets . It was like a ghost town . We seemed to be the only family which did n't get the flu ; so my parents went from house to house doing what they could to look after the sick , as it was impossible to get a doctor then . If it were possible for germs , bacteria , virus , or bacilli to cause disease , they had plenty of opportunity to attack my parents when they were spending many hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get the flu and they did n't bring any germs home to attack us children and cause anything . None of our family had the flu " not even a sniffle " and it was in the winter with deep snow on the ground . <p> When I see people cringe when someone near them sneezes or coughs , I wonder how long it will take them to find out that they ca n't catch it " whatever it is . The only way they can get a disease is to develop it themselves by wrong eating , drinking , smoking or doing some other things which cause internal poisoning and lowered vitality . All diseases are preventable and most of them are cureable with the right methods , not known to medical doctors , and not all drugless doctors know them either . <p> It has been said that the 1918 flu epidemic killed 20,000,000 people throughout the world . But , actually , the doctors killed them with their crude and deadly treatments and drugs . This is a harsh accusation but it is nevertheless true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of the medical doctors . <p> While the medical men and medical hospitals were losing 33% of their flu cases , the non-medical hospitals such as BATTLE CREEK , KELLOGG and MACFADDEN 'S HEALTH-RESTORIUM were getting almost 100% healings with their water cure , baths , enemas , etc. , fasting and certain other simple healing methods , followed by carefully worked out diets of natural foods . One health doctor did n't lose a patient in eight years . The very successful health treatment of one of those drugless doctors who did n't lose any patients will be given in the other part of this book , titled VACCINATION CONDEMNED , to be published a little later . <p> If the medical doctors had been as advanced as the drugless doctors , there would not have been those 20 million deaths from the medical flu treatment . <p> There was seven times more disease among the vaccinated soldiers than among the unvaccinated civilians , and the diseases were those they had been vaccinated against . One soldier who had returned from overseas in 1912 told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wondered why grown men should have an infant disease . Now , we know that paralysis is a common after-effect of vaccine poisoning . Those at home did n't get the paralysis until after the world-wide vaccination campaign in 1918 . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

It has been proven that those who live less stressful lifestyles are over 20% less likely to have a stroke and , of course , relaxation is a way to reduce stress . It is thought that stress may be the cause of approximately 10% of strokes so take time to relax and rest assured you 're reducing the risk . <p> 4 . Relaxing Helps Keep You Away From DepressionAnother one which possibly is n't the most noted fact but it is the case that relaxing can help to keep you out of depression . Stress is a major cause of depression amongst adults , especially work related stress ; and by taking time to relax , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reduce the risk of depression .

By keeping yourself calm and relaxed ; you 'll feel more like reaching for an apple or a glass of water than you are a chocolate bar or a beer ! <p> All in all ; relaxing is an important part of keeping ourselves healthy and we absolutely must dedicate time to relaxation .

Researchers ascertained the initial levels of mercury mothers were exposed to prenatally through the use of hair samples . Researchers then used a series of questionnaires- one given to the kid 's teachers the other to the parents- to determine if a child exhibited signs of behavior that fit into the autism spectrum .

@@42977828 @2977828/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> Health Hazards of Oil Spills <p> While major oil spills happen infrequently , they can cause serious environmental and economic damage to an entire region . Depending on the type of spill , thousands of square miles can be affected . However , many people see oil spills as happening " out there " in the ocean , far away from home . Even if we cant see firsthand the devastation , what happens out there actually does carry serious implications for all of us . <p> Economic Effects - The good news is that in the event of a major catastrophe , such as the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 , the U.S. government closes off any fisheries that might have been contaminated by oil . Ignoring the fact that closing down all of a regions fisheries can destroy local economies , none of us have to worry about ingesting contaminated fish or other seafood from the region . - However , most oil spills are n't  nearly as large as Deepwater Horizon . For smaller spills , nearby fisheries are often left open for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fishing activities can lead to food contamination and sickness . - Food contamination is n't just caused by the oil itself . Many cleanup efforts include the use of highly toxic chemicals to break down and disperse the oil , an unfortunate but sometimes necessary step when large amounts of oil are located beneath the surface of the water . Surface oil is far easier to clean up since its easily accessible , and that 's when environmental friendly products and machines like oil skimmers can be used . Any of these food products that do manage to reach us will cause long lasting damage . The oil and chemicals are highly carcinogenic , which raises the risk of developing certain cancers . Besides cancer , the toxins can wreak havoc on our livers and kidneys. - Dead Zones - Most organisms are sensitive to environmental changes . As a species , we deal with sickness caused by smog , UV radiation , and intense heat . If anything , marine life tends to be even more vulnerable . Any fish ingesting a large amount of oil will die . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through contaminated waters . - Marine life that does n't  die off from an oil spill still faces complications . Even two years after the Deepwater Horizon spill ended , there are an alarmingly high number of mutations in the Gulf of Mexico . Thankfully , this food will probably never reach our grocery stores and restaurants , but the fact that shrimp are being born blind and fish develop lesions at a frantic pace should give us pause once we consider that that particular spill may still be seeping oil into the Gulf . Its not just marine life that suffers either . Who among us havent seen pictures of oil coated birds or turtles or other land animals that dwell along the shore ? Oily beaches do n't  exactly encourage tourism either , which can further devastate coastal towns and cities that rely on outside visitors for much of their business in a good year , not to mention the physical and mental toll these spills exact on those volunteers who spend months or years cleaning up . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

Unless you are a 6 year old kid , you love going to sleep and you probably hit the snooze button a few times before waking up . Its what reenergizes you for the next day . Everyone loves to sleep there 's no doubt about it . And yet no one really knows what actually happens when you are asleep . Do you just lay there with your mouth open drooling on the pillow ? Or is your brain actually doing something productive while you sleep . Well of course we dream , but that cant happen the entire time , our dreams seem way too short for that to be the case . Well , the body actually goes through 5 stages of sleep in the course of the night . In a cycle actually meaning it will go through 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 1 , 2 , etc Let 's take a look at the stages of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and usually lasts for 5 to 10 minutes after falling asleep . You are able to be awakened without difficulty and you will feel as if you have n't slept at all if you are awakened . The brain has slowed in activity at this point from a wakeful state and your muscles start to relax . This is also the stage of sleep where you may feel a falling sensation while lying in your bed . <h> Stage 2 <p> This is another period of light sleeping . Your brain gives off larger positive and negative waves of activity which indicate your muscles relaxing and tensing up . You 're heart rate slows down in this stage and your body temperature decreases . Your body is getting ready to enter the deeper stages of sleep . <h> Stage 3 <p> This is the first stage of deep sleep . Your brain starts sending out slow delta waves ; however there may still be short releases of beta waves from faster brain activity . If you are woken up at this stage of sleep you will likely feel very confused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on your kitchen floor with a tub of ice cream laying right next to you . <h> Stage 4 <p> At this point in your sleep your brain has slowed down to its slowest point and you are in the deepest part of your sleep . Your brain only gives off delta waves and it is extremely difficult to wake someone up at this stage of their sleep . In stage 4 people are susceptible to bedwetting , sleep terrors and most notably sleep walking . Stage 3 and 4 can last anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes but the first deep sleep of the cycle usually lasts about one hour . During this stage of sleep is when your body does the most recovery . <h> REM Sleep <p> REM sleep , also stage 5 , is the last stage of the sleep cycle . REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement . During REM sleep your brain activity and breathing rate increase . This stage is also known as the active sleep stage , your brain activity is most similar to when you are awake at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your muscles in your legs and arms will go through paralysis ; this is thought to happen because nature does n't  want us to act out our dreams . The first REM stage of the night occurs roughly 90 minutes after falling asleep and lasts about 10 minutes . As the night goes on , the time that REM sleep lasts grows longer with the last cycle of REM sleep lasting about an hour . <h> Conclusion <p> Not much is actually know about what happens specifically to our bodies during each stage of sleep . Studies and tests are being conducted , but it can be hard data to gather . As you can see , our brain is a very complex animal when it comes to sleeping . So the next time you wake up in the morning wondering what happened to the last 8 hours of your life , you will appreciate it a bit more than before . <p> Todays guest post was provided by Brian S. from the www.PersonalTrainer.org blogging team .

@@42977833 @2977833/ 24417 @qwx434417 <p> Eczema is a catch-all term for a variety of ailments that cause the inflammation and irritation of the skin . It now affects more than 20% of infants and about 5% of adults and children although those numbers appear to be increasing due to dietary triggers and environmental pollutants . The standard treatment for the medical community for eczema is corticosteroid creams which only suppress symptoms without addressing underlying causes . Chemical creams such as topical immunomodulators are also associated with cancer risks . Here are some effective natural remedies which can tackle even severe cases of skin inflammation . <p> Most doctors will tell you they do n't  know the exact cause of eczema and they 're right because the exact causes are many ( most of which they are not aware of ) . These include fragrances in consumer products , soaps , laundry detergent , dust , cosmetics , environmental pollutants and of course diet and processed foods . <p> The biggest reason to stay away from corticosteroids and immunosupressants is that they do n't  resolve the problem .

The traditional manufacture of cod liver oil , on the other hand , produces a more nutritious and medicinal oil .

By contributing to the reduction of inflammation in tissues , omega-3 fatty acids can relieve certain symptoms of eczema such as blistering and red , inflamed skin .

This ensures that foreign substances including pathogens and toxins that trigger inflammatory reactions never get into the bloodstream . <p> 6 ) TRANSDERMAL MAGNESIUM <p> Transdermal magnesium is a powerful tool in the battle against magnesium deficiency and very effective against inflammatory conditions of the skin . Benefits reported by those who use transdermal applications of magnesium relate specifically to its therapeutic application on the skin and its direct absorption into the cells. - <p> Though it is commonly prescribed as a treatment by holistic health practitioners , transdermal magnesium is applied easily and quickly in one 's own home , either by simply spraying directly on the skin , applying as a lotion or a gel , or even more effortlessly through the simple ritual of taking a bath . <p> 7 ) GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID ( GLA ) <p> This unusual fatty acid is found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is very hard to come by in the diet . Beware of genetically modified safflower oils now promoting themselves as healthy due to their high GLA content .

Chronically weak bones with low density is a disease called osteoporosis by physicians . This treacherous condition puts sufferers at constant risk of broken bones in the most trivial accidents . While we exercise our muscles , we are also improving our bone density . But , exercise alone is not enough to prevent osteoporosis . <p> We tend to understand our muscle composition much better than our skeletal structure . Bone is living tissue that is constantly broken down and rebuilt behind every day of our lives . When we are young , our bones are reconstructed at a very rapid pace . Even without any external influences , our bone density naturally begins to weaken after our 20 's as bones begin to take longer to rebuild . By age 40 , most of us are a risk of osteoporosis . <p> What are the Risk Factors <p> Several factors contribute to that increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estrogen levels in women . Women who are post-menopause are at a high risk of low bone density .

Weak bones are low on calcium . Poor calcium intake can expedite chronic osteoporosis . Persons who suffer eating disorders or who do not eat sufficiently are at great risk of lack of bone density .

Likewise , high steroid intake and certain other drugs can expedite bone weakness . <p> As with many other diseases , osteoporosis can be prevented by a healthy , smoke-free , lifestyle that features a balanced diet and a low amount of alcohol intake . Being active is also a solid preventive therapy . Sedentary persons are more prone to osteoporosis than are active people .

Most farmed fish are no longer safe to consume due to genetic modification and practices which have transformed many species into swimming poison . Here are 7 varieties of fish you should avoid without exception . <p> Many species are so high in contaminants like mercury that their health benefits are outweighed by their health risks . Others are flown in from halfway around the world , but given labels that make you think they were caught fresh earlier that morning . And still others are raised in filthy , overcrowded pools and loaded up with chemicals to keep them alive . <p> Two years ago , scientists had for the first time discovered Bluefin tuna that were contaminated by the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan last year swimming off the coast of California . Radioactive cesium ten times above the normal level was found in the fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other isotopes currently being released in the sea and air around Fukushima bio-concentrate at each step of various food chains ( for example into algae , crustaceans , small fish , bigger fish , then humans ; or soil , grass , cows meat and milk , then humans ) . <p> Credit : NOAA <p> Mercury contamination of all seafood is a widespread public health concern . In fact , pregnant women , children and women who might become pregnant should avoid the consumption of swordfish , tuna and orange roughy due to their high methyl-mercury content . The EUs food safety authority ( EFSA ) " EFSA recommends that women of childbearing ageselect fish from a wide range of species , without giving undue preference to large predatory fish such as swordfish and tuna , " it said in a statement . <p> In addition to being toxic for humans , swordfish and many other species of fish are being caught in ways that are devastating ocean habitats and fisheries . Longline fishing , the fishing method used to catch swordfish , kills thousands of sea turtles per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it is likely to be healthy to eat too , " said Leah Gerber , an associate professor and senior sustainability scientist at Arizona State University . <p> " In general , larger longer-lived fish are more likely to have exposure to toxins due to the length of their lives and their place on the food chain , " Gerber explained . " So you might be best served to stay away from them like Bluefin Tuna or Swordfish . Besides they already are over fished . " <p> Around 95 percent of all salmon in existence are now farmed , and domestication has made them very different to wild populations , each of which is locally adapted to its own river system . Just two years ago a Purdue University scientist urged federal officials to decide favorably on allowing genetically engineered salmon into the food supply arguing that not doing so may set back scientific efforts to increase food production . The argument came in direct contradiction to statements made by the same scientist who found that releasing a transgenic fish to the wild could damage native populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 report from the Earth Policy Institute noted that worldwide production of farmed fish now not only exceeds the production of beef , but that consumption of farmed fish is soon expected to exceed consumption of wild-caught fish . <p> There are dozens of species unworthy of consumption , however due to their popularity and accessibility , here are 7 you should stay away from . <p> #1 : SWORDFISH <p> Why Its Bad : At .976 ppm ( parts per million ) , it has the highest mercury content of any fish out there . The bio accumulation of methyl mercury is worse the higher up the food chain that you go hence swordfish is fairly bad because its higher up the food chain . The same argument can be justified for shark and marlin . Mercury pollutants have to be made into bio-available methyl mercury by anaerobic sulfur based bacteria . These only exist in certain regions so if you can get swordfish that 's from an area without the deep water sulfur based bacteria then you can avoid the high contamination levels . Problem is that these anoxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry less oxygen thereby favouring anaerobic organisms over aerobic . <p> #2 : TUNA <p> Why Its Bad : At .639 ppm , its a close second to swordfish , especially big eye and blue fin tuna . The New York Times found that Atlantic bluefin tuna has the highest levels of mercury of any type of tuna . To top it off , bluefin tuna are severely overharvested , to the point of reaching near-extinction levels , and are considered " critically endangered " by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Rather than trying to navigate the ever-changing recommendations for which tuna is best , consider giving it up altogether . <p> #3 : ORANGE ROUGHY <p> Why Its Bad : At .554 ppm , orange roughy is still very high in mercury toxicity . Like most deep sea dwelling fish , orange roughy take a long time to grow to maturity , and are easy to threaten with overfishing . Extensive deep sea fishing for over two decades resulted in severe depletion of adult stocks . Orange roughy do not generally breed until they reach 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for orange roughy populations to recover from heavy fishing which have decimated the species . The Environmental Defense Fund has issued a health advisory . <p> #4 : TILAPIA <p> Why Its Bad : One of the reasons for the popularity of tilapia is that they are short-lived and primarily vegetarian and therefore do not accumulate substantial amounts of mercury by consuming other fish , as other common predatory food fish ( such as tuna ) do . This factor also means , as reported in a June 2013 National Geographic article , that tilapia are more efficient to farm because they eat lower on the food chain . This causes a world of problems to the detriment of human health . <p> Dibutylin levels , a chemical used in PVC plastics is said to be 2 times higher in farm-raised tilapia compared to wild ones . Dibutylin is toxic and can impair immune system function while also contributing to inflammation . Dibutylin may be the reason as to why there is a rise in asthma , obesity , allergies and other metabolic disorders in recent years . <p> Dioxins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dioxins is that once it enters our system , it can take a very long time until it is removed from the body . The half life of dioxin is about 7 to 11 years . <p> #5 : SALMON ( Both Wild-caught and Farmed ) <p> Why Its Bad : Although salmon is typically lower in mercury concentrations , the recent devasting events in Fukushima , Japan , have many scientists questioning whether any Pacific salmon should ever be consumed again due to high radioactive isotope levels . Its actually illegal to capture wild Atlantic salmon because the fish stocks are so low , and they 're low , in part , because of farmed salmon . Salmon farming is very polluting : Thousands of fish are crammed into pens , which leads to the growth of diseases and parasites that require antibiotics and pesticides . Often , the fish escape and compete with native fish for food , leading to declines in native populations . <p> A study with mice proved that a diet high in farmed salmon contaminated by persistent organic pollutants POPs contributes to weight gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our salmon woes , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is moving forward with approving genetically engineered salmon to be sold , unlabeled , to unsuspecting seafood lovers . That salmon would be farmed off the coast of Panama , and its unclear how it would be labeled . Currently , all fish labeled " Atlantic salmon " come from fish farms . They 're also fed pellets that contain pink dyethats how they get their color . <p> #6 : FLATFISH ( Flounder , Sole and Halibut ) <p> Why Its Bad : This group of fish includes flounder , sole , and halibut that are caught off the Atlantic coast . Although flounder and sole have relatively low levels of mercury , halibut still remains on the higher end at .252 ppm . Flatfish have found their way onto the list because of heavy contamination and overfishing that dates back to the 1800s . According to Food and Water Watch , populations of these fish are as low as 1 percent of what 's necessary to be considered sustainable for long-term fishing . <p> #7 : MACKEREL <p> Why Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high mineral magnesium , mackerel is just as bad as the top five when it comes to mercury . Most of the world eats Spanish Gulf mackerel which is quite high in mercury toxicity at 0.454 ppm .

However , outdoor activities also provide a great solution to the problem of childhood obesity affecting so many Western countries . In the United States , for example , one-third of all children could be classified as either overweight or obese in 2008 according to the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) . The UK predicts a quarter of its children will be obese by 2050 if the trend continues . <p> The Main Cause of Childhood Obesity <p> - According to the CDC , the culprit is caloric imbalance .

By 2004 , those kids who were the most active and spent the most time outdoors in 2001 were also the most physically fit and least likely to be overweight in 2004 .

@@42977860 @2977860/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> A new study validates a controversial cancer theory , namely , that yeast in our body can contribute to not just feeding , but actually causing cancer . Can the ancient healing spice turmeric come to the rescue ? <p> A recent study published in- Critical Reviews in Microbiology- lends support to the concept that opportunistic Candida albicans ( yeast ) infection may not just be a consequence of cancer , but is an actively contributing cause as well . <p> There is currently increasing concern about the relation between microbial infections and cancer . More and more studies support the view that there is an association , above all , when the causal agents are bacteria or viruses . This review adds to this , summarizing evidence that the opportunistic fungus Candida albicans increases the risk of carcinogenesis and metastasis . Until recent years , Candida spp. had fundamentally been linked to cancerous processes as it is an opportunist pathogen that takes advantage of the immunosuppressed state of patients particularly due to chemotherapy . In contrast , the most recent findings demonstrate that C. albicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in the review : production of carcinogenic byproducts , triggering of inflammation , induction of Th17 response and molecular mimicry . We underline the need not only to control this type of infection during cancer treatment , especially given the major role of this yeast species in nosocomial infections , but also to find new therapeutic approaches to avoid the pro-tumor effect of this fungal species . <p> The four distinct ways by which Candida albicans may contribute to cancer are explained in more detail below : <p> Production of carcinogenic byproducts : First , Candida Albicans produces nitrosamines , which are carcinogens that activate specific proto-oncogenes that could trigger cancerous lesions . Second , Candida albicans produce acetaldehyde , which is produced as the first metabolite of ethanol ( the yeast fermentation byproduct ) , and which is a DNA-damaging ( mutagenic ) and carcinogenic chemical with a wide range of downstream cancer promoting properties . <p> Triggering of inflammation : Prolonged , unresolved inflammation can promote cancer , both by causing damage to tissue , and through the secretion of proliferative chemicals intended to stimulate regeneration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inflammation is chronic and misdirected . Candida albicans is well known to promote a cascade of inflammatory responses within the body when growing beyond their normal population density due to immunosuppression , an inappropriate diet , and/or chemical exposure . - These misguided inflammatory responses have been found to promote increases in tumor cell adhesion , which is believed to promote the formation of secondary tumors and/or metastasis . <p> Induction of Th17 response : The set of CD4 T-cells that are dominant in response to Candida albicans , namely , TH17 cells , also secrete factors that may promote angiogenesis ( the formation of new blood vessels ) and increased tumor incidence and growth . <p> Molecular mimicry : Antibodies produced against a protein on the surface of Candida Albicans ( CR3-RP ) has structural and antigenic similarities with a receptor on certain of our white blood cells ( leukocytes ) . This " molecular mimicry " may cause antibodies to be formed against our immune cells that then disturb the anti-tumor and anti-Candida defenses of the host . <p> This newly identified research not only substantiates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , but it also , indirectly , raises a red flag to both sugar and alcohol consumption . Clearly , if sugar and its conversion to ethanol produce acetaldehyde , reducing excessive consumption of either is a good chemopreventive step , and likely a completely necessary intervention when actively treating already established cancers that is , if the goal is full remission . <p> Moreover , sugar has also recently been found to not just feed cancer , but actively contributes to the transformation of normal cells into cancerous ones ; i.e.- sugar is potentially carcinogenic . Read my recent article , " Research Reveals How Sugar CAUSES Cancer , " to learn more . <p> The implications of this research are profound since sugar- also- promotes yeast growth , which means that sugar is both directly and indirectly carcinogenic ; a fact that is all the more concerning considering cancer treatment wards in major hospitals still give sugar-containing foods and beverages to their patients while being treated , or recovering from treatment . <h> Turmeric : A One-Two PUNCH <p> A new study published in the- European Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as- curcumin- may be the perfect way to fight cancers that have a fungal component . <p> Curcumin , a natural component that is isolated from the rhizome of Curcuma longa plants , has attracted great interest among many scientists studying solid cancers over the last half century . Interestingly , curcumin provides an ideal alternative to current therapies because of its relatively safe profile , even at high doses . To date , curcumins potent antifungal activity against different strains of Candida , Cryptococcus , Aspergillus , Trichosporon and Paracoccidioides have been reported , indicating that curcumin anticancer drugs may also possess an antifungal role , helping cancer patients to resist invasive fungal infection related complications . The aim of this review is to discuss curcumins dual pharmacological activities regarding its applications as a natural anticancer and antifungal agent . These dual pharmacological activities are expected to lead to clinical trials and to improve infection survival among cancer patients . " <p> The study went on to explain that conventional therapies often result in collateral damage to the patients immune system , which contributes to fungal overgrowth . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the liver and kidneys of patients , along with leading to the development of even more aggressive , treatment-resistant fungal infections . <p> Moreover , conventional cancer treatments only target one aspect of cancer , focusing on a single pathway or molecule on a cancer cell . This is why curcumin holds so much more promise as a " next generation multipurpose drug . " Not only does it combat fungal infections , but it has the ability to address a multitude of cancer targets , including being able to- destroy the cancer stem cell subpopulation- which is at the- root of cancer malignancy and recurrence . <p> The study concluded : <p> Curcumin is an up-and-coming drug of natural origin with multi-target properties , and it has exhibited efficient anticancer and antifungal activities alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy drugs and antifungal agents . The dual pharmacological activities of curcumin may make it a good candidate for the prevention and treatment of cancer and its cancer-related invasive fungal infection related complications . Further investigation is necessary to clarify curcumins anticancer and antifungal mechanisms for better understanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its poor water solubility and low bioavailability hinders its clinical applications . Various nano-sized curcumin delivery systems , such as nanoparticles , nanospheres , solid lipid nanoparticles , micelles , and liposomes have been shown to overcome these shortcomings and significantly improve the anticancer and antifungal activities of curcumin . Many studies on curcumin and its nanoformulations are still in the preclinical stage at present . A clinical trials stage is necessary to unlock the potential of curcumin nanoformulations as a therapeutic strategy for treating cancer and its IFI complications .

After you make sure that there is no immediate danger like broken bones or sprains , the victim can be helped to a more comfortable position till medical help arrives . In the case of a child or baby , the assessment should be done from toe to head . <p> Other tips to keep in mind <p> In the case of a conscious adult victim , obtain consent after introducing yourself .

The virus can enter the body via broken skin or inside the mouth , and often is spread through saliva while kissing , sharing utensils , etc . <p> Some people have the virus and are asymptomatic , but others find that symptoms are triggered by stress , poor eating habits , illness and more .

Conversely , the healthy cells in our body need more of the amino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . If the virus prefers arginine , and our cells prefer lysine , we should ensure that we eat more lysine than arginine " in other words , have a higher lysine-to-arginine ratio in our diet .

Lysine <p> As we know , our bodies prefer lysine as opposed to arginine which is preferred by the virus . If we supplement with lysine on a daily basis , we may prevent cold sores from arising .

While our growing dependence on processed food is partly responsible for this alarming statistic , the real reason for it is that ongoing soil erosion has significantly depleted the mineral content of our soil within the last century . Consequently , many fruits and vegetables that were once rich in magnesium no longer contain it in adequate amounts , resulting in widespread deficiencies . <p> For this reason , an increasing number of people are turning to magnesium supplements to boost their intake of this vital nutrient .

Moreover , chloride ( not to be confused with chlorine , the toxic gas ) aids kidney function and can boost a sluggish metabolism . <p> Magnesium carbonate- Magnesium carbonate is another popular , bioavailable form of magnesium that actually turns into magnesium chloride when it mixes with the hydrochloric acid in our stomachs .

A list of strange things that have been found in emergency room patients in recent years would run the length of a football field . In most of these cases , the offender has been coaxed back to optimal health by medical technicians on the scene .

She swallowed several pieces of gravel , which caused digestive duress and eventually sent her to the hospital . Though grinding stones are often swallowed by birds to help with digestion , rocks are universally harmful to human beings , who do not have the internal organs to correctly process them .

@@42977949 @2977949/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> A Look at the Stages of Labor <p> If you 're pregnant and approaching your due date " especially if this is your first pregnancy " then it 's only natural that you may have some questions and concerns as to what you can expect the labor process to be like . Every pregnancy is different from every other , even if we 're talking about two pregnancies for the same mother , but labor still follows a typical , four-stage sequence of events that you can prepare for . <p> Stage One : Early Labor <p> Early labor is the very beginning of the process during which your cervix first begins to dilate and efface ( thin out to facilitate the labor process ) . You will feel some regular contractions at this point , but it will still most likely be a while before they are terribly strong or close together . In fact , some women can be in early labor for a matter of hours or even days without actually realizing it . Some women also notice the passing of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> During this stage of labor , you can continue going about your daily activities for the most part . Some women like to do some light chores , take a nap , have a light snack , or watch a movie . <p> Stage Two : Active Labor <p> Active labor is the stage of labor during which things become more work . Your cervix will continue to dilate until it reaches 10 centimeters . Your contractions will also continue to increase in intensity and grow closer together . Many women also begin to feel a sense of pressure in their lower back area or pelvis . Once you 're in active labor , it 's time to head to the hospital , call your midwife , or travel to your alternative birthing facility . Make sure you have your hospital bag packed and ready to go with important items like baby 's clothes , a change of clothes for you and a maternity hospital gown , if you like . <p> Active labor typically lasts around 8 hours or so for first time mothers . Women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before may find that it 's much shorter . You may decide you need pain meds at this point or " at the very least " the support of your labor coach . The end of active labor is known as transition and can be quite intense . <p> Stage Three : The Pushing Stage <p> Once you 're fully dilated and effaced , your baby will begin to move out of the uterus and into the birth canal . It ends with the actually birth of your baby into the world , so you wo n't have much longer to go once you reach this stage . Your doctor or midwife may encourage you to push with each contraction in order to help speed the process up . Sometimes things are allowed to simply take their natural course , with the mother pushing once she begins to feel the urge . <p> At the point where your baby 's head is delivered , your health care provider will clear his or her airway and check to see that the umbilical cord is free . Then the baby 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily than the head does . <p> Stage Four : Delivery of the Placenta <p> The last stage of labor involves the delivery of the placenta and other afterbirth tissue . It 's definitely the easiest stage of labor and is often painless ( or nearly so ) . The placenta will typically detach and exit the body by itself within 5-15 minutes . However , sometimes the placenta can take up to 30 minutes . Your health care provider may gently massage your uterus in order to encourage it to contract and expel this tissue . You will also be checked to make sure your bleeding is within normal , health levels . <p> While it 's understandable that you may be nervous about going through labor and childbirth , the process will be easier to approach now that you know what to expect . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419 
@@42977951 @2977951/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> The Real Dangers of Non-Stick Cookware <p> People have a tendency to forget security and safety issues whenever a new technology provides a great convenience . This is especially true regarding health and diet products . There are consequences to that carelessness , and people tend to forget about potential consequences until the consequences actually manifest themselves . A good example of this phenomena is the broad acceptance of non-stick cookware . It is quite convenient , but it is far from safe . <p> If a bird inhales the toxic PFOA fumes that are produced by heated non-stick pans , its lungs will ulcerate , and it will suffocate in its own body fluids . This is due to it having inhaled either polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) or perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) . Birds were used for centuries as an early warning system in mines , because they rapidly die whenever they are exposed to even small amounts of poison gas . Polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) are both fluoride compounds . Fluoride is a poison that depresses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure . It accumulates in the bones , teeth , and pineal gland . It has been linked to brittle bone disease , and it causes cognitive problems . Fluoride is the main ingredient in some rat poisons . <p> We discovered studies that vastly contradict the marketing of the companies who sell non-stick pans . The E.P.A . reported that PFOA accumulates inside humans for years , and it has been verified to produce cancers in laboratory tests . It noted that the chemical particularly damaged the livers of rats , and it furthermore had a tendency to raise the triglyceride levels in humans . PFOA has been registered with the E.P.A . as a potential human carcinogen . <p> Dupont , the inventor of Teflon , was sued for withholding safety information about the use of perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) in non-stick cookware . The Environmental Protection Agency filed the suit , claiming that " DuPont concealed its own 1981 research " . Dupont records demonstrated that traces of this chemical were detected in a pregnant employees unborn child , which proved that the company knew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in its own employees before anybody supposedly knew of the danger . In 1991 , the company likewise omitted reporting its evidence that PFOA had contaminated the water supply of around 12,000 people . It was again sued by eight of the effected families . One of the plaintiffs was a DuPont factory worker who bore a son with only one nostril and other facial defects . His son has since had about 30 surgeries . He and his spouse have opted not to have further children , lest they risk passing on the condition . <p> It is impossible to determine exactly what the fumes of the non-stick pans are doing to our bodies , because the research is so sparse . Although , Gary Craig ran into some obvious problems with the pans . <p> " About three or four years ago , I began having to urinate too often , including getting up five or six times at night . Gradually it got worse until it reached a peak a few months ago when I was urinating two or three times an hour all day long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away when I left home to go on a trip . Within 24 to 48 hours of walking out my front door , my system returned to normal Although I never used high heat ( nothing above medium heat ) I recalled that three or four years ago ( about the time all this started ) my mother gave me a Teflon frying pan which I began using regularly . I stopped using the Teflon frying pan and BINGO ! About 24 to 48 hours later the problem vanished . " <p> This is far from the " flu-like symptoms " that many of the producing companies admit will occur when the pans are " overheated " . They have defined " overheated " as reaching 500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 200 degrees Celsius ) . It is important to remember that 500 degrees Fahrenheit can be reached with merely the medium temperature setting on some stoves , and some pans will emit the poison gases at much lower temperatures than is admitted by the manufacturers . <p> What does PFOA do to the body ? <p> Perhaps the hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide some enlightenment . Studies which used animals as test subjects revealed that non-stick cookware produces health issues in the following categories : <p> Childrens health and development <p> Risks of liver , pancreatic , testicular , and mammary gland tumors <p> Altered thyroid hormone regulation <p> Generalized damage to the immune system <p> Reproductive problems and birth defects <p> We additionally recommend that people avoid aluminum cookware . Aluminum is a soft metal that will flake toxic metallic particles into foods being cooked with it ; especially if metal utensils are being used . Stainless steel is always a better option ; both for its low reactivity ( low toxicity ) , and because this hardened steel will practically never output particles into food . Aluminum is an accumulative heavy metal that is known to lead to many degenerative diseases . Old fashioned cast iron pans are an even better alternative , and cast iron is naturally non-stick . Its inherent non-stick property means that cast iron is often easier to cook with than stainless steel , and it has the best heat distribution . Men who regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink grape juice on a routine basis , to prevent excess iron build-up in the body . High quality cookware is essential for baking healthy food , so special care should be taken when purchasing cookware to ensure that none of it came from China . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

It has been found however , that a large number of patients with heart failure have lower than average levels of Coenzyme Q10 in the myocardial tissue . Some researchers have suggested that its role in energy production provides extra energy and strength to the heart , and can reduce many symptoms that relate to heart failure , but there is no ratified scientific evidence to support this as of yet .

Produced from the seed of the poppy plant , this illegal narcotic is unbelievably addictive and highly dangerous . Seriously . Heroine is like marijuana , in that it 's a gateway drug , but only if you 're talking about the Pearly Gates . In case that reference did n't hit home with you , allow us to be more direct : heroin will kill you . Heroin overdose has caused more deaths than traffic accidents . Heroin can be injected , smoked , snorted , or even ingested , and some of the better-known side effects include dry mouth , constipation , shortness of breath , and unexpected behavioral changes . And , while any of these symptoms could be annoying on their own , heroin users get to experience all of them , along with a side of bigger problems that you might not be aware of . Just for kicks , let 's look at a few of the lesser known , long-term effects of heroin use . <h> 1 . Shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a seizure , then you probably have some idea just how dangerous they can be . Hey , even at the best of times a seizure is awkward and disconcerting . Well , the heroin user needs to get comfortable with the idea of shaking and foaming , because there 's a decent chance that they 'll be doing it themselves at some point . You see , heroin acts as an antagonist to the GABA receptors located in your brain and spinal column . This can be problematic , because the GABA receptors help prevent the neurons in your brain from firing too rapidly . And when neurons begin to overdo it , that 's when the convulsions start . Suffice it to say that heroin stops the things in your brain that stop the things in your brain that cause seizures . Yeah , heroin 's kind of a jerk . <h> 2 . Give Me Some Skin <p> Regrettably , all that convulsing is only going to make your dandruff more noticeable . Heroin makes your skin lose its moisture , resulting in dryness and itchiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite , which means that you wo n't be hydrating often enough to do any good . Not eating much also means that you miss out on the vitamins that are necessary to retaining your skins elasticity . At the same time , increased bruising and scarring ( from continued intravenous use ) will make your dry , rashy , saggy hide even less pleasant to look at . But do n't worry about that ; many users have found that eventually their skin literally starts to rot off from infection . You see , heavily damaged skin can develop abscesses and boils . So if you make it far enough , your skin will just sort of die , and then it wo n't trouble you any farther . <h> 3 . Rhoid Rage <p> At least you wo n't have to worry about soiling yourself while you 're shaking your skin loose . Remember how we mentioned earlier that heroin causes constipation ? Well when you combine that with an inadequate diet and overall poor health ( again , thanks to the heroin ) , it results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prolonged straining from not being able to , um , well , poop , has caused vascular structures in your anal canal to become swollen and inflamed . External hemorrhoids actually cause the anal wall to push itself out of the anus . Go ahead and think about that for a while . So while you 're flopping around like a droopy , puss covered fish , try to keep from rolling over onto your backside , because that thing 's going to be sore . <p> But then , heroin has also been suspected of causing leukoencephalopathy , which is a disease that attacks the white matter of your brain . That is to say , it destroys the areas associated with consciousness .

But as a vegetarian 's body converts just a little amount of DHA , he should consume a fish oil supplement so that he can have more omega-3 fatty acids . <p> As vegetarians can still get enough amounts of nutrients from the kinds of foods that they consume , their diet is considered healthy .

While some teens will try these types of substances a few times before giving them up entirely , other kids find themselves unable to control their impulse to use . When a teen becomes unable to stop using , experimenting with drugs and alcohol can transform into substance abuse . <p> Why Do Teens Experiment ? <p> When it comes to experimentation , teens can try a variety of substances , including alcohol , cigarettes , household chemicals , over-the-counter medications , prescription drugs , and illegal drugs . The most common legal substance teens experiment with is alcohol , while marijuana is the most frequently used illegal drug by teens . <p> Teens experiment with these substances for a variety of reasons that include : <p> They try to fit in with certain groups of people or with friends <p> They enjoy how the substance makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using <p> Teens are also drawn to taking risks and trying new things .

In many cases , a sufferers personality can change beyond all recognition , but only after a long and drawn-out period of deterioration , fear and confusion . People who are caring for relatives and friends with dementia should take solace from the fact that many thousands of people are facing same immense struggle . The best way to cope is often to take advice and guidance from those who have experienced dementia first-hand . <p> The Effects of Dementia <p> Different forms of dementia have slightly different symptoms and tell-tale signs , but the most common are anxiety , confusion and frustration . According to the NHS website such traits are often signified by constant pacing , asking questions repeatedly , paranoia and sudden mood swings . In some cases , dementia sufferers can become angry , and it is not uncommon for people to suddenly lash out before showing almost immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete lack of awareness with regard to surroundings and an inability to recognise close family members . It is also common for sufferers to confuse relatives and regress back to an earlier time in their life . <p> Most dementia sufferers experience a gradual deterioration over a prolonged period , and the care provided will change accordingly . A sudden mood swing , outburst or anxiety attack is a side-effect of confusion and fear ; it should never be taken personally . Remaining calm in the midst of such an outburst could put the sufferer at ease , and trying to associate their behaviour with the underlying cause could allow a carer to solve a particular issue . <p> People react differently to dementia , and being able to spot the early signs of a mood swing or an outburst could allow carers to manipulate specific circumstances . A sufferer may become scared and anxious in crowded environments , for example , so a trip to the local shopping mall may be best enjoyed first thing in the morning before throngs of shoppers arrive . Some sufferers may become aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but scheduling regular walks , gardening activities or even a trip to the local high street could be enough to fend off a serious mood swing before it happens . <p> A good way to care for dementia sufferers is by controlling their environment closely . Planning a trip to local stores should include speaking with the staff first in order to alert them of the persons particular condition . The general public are , in the majority of cases , ignorant to dementia , and they often mistake the effects of the condition as rudeness or outright aggression . And in some cases , the reaction of a stranger can exacerbate the sufferers condition . Developing a relationship with local shopkeepers and other members of the community will also mean help is at hand if the dementia sufferer ever becomes lost . <p> Perhaps the most important advice a carer can be given is not to take anything personally . Dementia sufferers have been known to say some very hurtful and seemingly vindictive things , but they never mean them . The carer should always remember that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many cases , the sufferer will forget the outburst in a matter of minutes . Staying calm and talking to the person will defuse the situation in the majority of cases . After an episode of aggression , the carer should act like nothing has happened . There may be occasions where aggression turns to violence ; these situations are often best dealt with by leaving the room . Under no circumstances should the carer ever confront the person or adopt an aggressive and confrontational stance . <p> A Case Study <p> An 86-year-old man was recently admitted to a private care facility at Aranlaw House in Bournemouth . The man had suffered a bad fall in another facility during one of his regular episodes of walking around at night in search of his wife .

Dementia sufferers become scared and confused when their reality is questioned , so the staff at Aranlaw House made sure that this never happened . <p> Seeing a loved-one become increasingly confused , scared and disorientated can be a very painful process . However , by staying calm and being prepared for the effects of dementia , carers and relatives can ensure that a sufferer does not have to endure unnecessary distress . <p> Nicola is the care manager and nursing professional at- Ashton Grange EMI home- - with more than 21 years experience in psychiatric nursing and is Registered Mental Nurse ( RMN ) qualified . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

From mental decline to social isolation , letting hearing troubles linger and progress over years can have dire consequences .

If you add untreated hearing loss to the aging mix , you get an even stronger likelihood of isolation due to the frustrations and difficulties that come with trying and failing to effectively communicate with others . <p> The resulting lack of human contact leads to loneliness , a sense of meaninglessness , boredom , and an overall lower quality of life . <h> 3 .

People rarely try a drug for the first time and suddenly become addicted . Rather , it is a process and if people are unaware of that process , they will be more susceptible to addictions damaging effects . <p> Luckily many treatment and rehabilitation centers agree on four major phases that lead to drug addiction . They are experimentation , regular use , risky use or abuse and dependency or addiction . The following four sections will provide an explanation of the stage followed by an example of someone who is going through this phase . Understanding these stage is an essential part of avoiding drug addiction . <h> 1 . Experimentation <p> During this stage the person uses drugs because they are curious . They are able to do so without experiencing any social or legal consequences . Often time 's people will try a drug in attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression . <p> Example : Brian is a teenager whose parents recently went through a divorce .

Brian decides to try it out of curiosity and because he heard it helps you take your mind off problems . After he tries it for the first time he realizes that the pain he felt over his parent 's divorce completely went away . <h> 2 . Regular Use <p> During this stage people will start using the substance on a regular basis to cope with their problems . They may be able to use the drug without developing any addiction to it . This phase greatly increases the chances of substance abuse and risky use . <p> Example : Brian starts smoking marijuana on a regular basis . Some weeks however , he decides not to because of a family event or a soccer game . He has control over when he wants to use the drug but tries to do it as much as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and the regular use stage is that the user will start using the substance regardless of the consequences . While before the person had complete control over their use , now the first signs of addiction start appearing . They start participating in dangerous activities such as driving under the influence of the substance . <p> Example : Brian wants to start using the drug more and more to deal with the problems in his home . He starts smoking every week regardless of what is going on that week . His performance on the soccer team changes and his family starts to notice something is wrong . He even starts smoking during the week sometimes and is unable to do his homework very well . <h> 4 . Addiction/Dependency <p> A physiological change takes place in the person and all they can think about is using the drug . The person uses the substance regardless of the consequences . <p> Example : Brian 's coach realizes that he is n't trying very hard and cuts him from the team .

They are one of our eliminative organs , without which we would n't be able to filter waste , like purines , produced naturally in our bodies . <h> What Are Purines ? <p> Purines are an essential part of the structure of both plant and animal ( including human ) genes , and are found in many foods at a varying degrees .

In some instances this link can seem fairly obvious . An ice cream sundae and candy bar diet will not only help to expand your waistline , it will also negatively contribute to your oral health . In both instances , the sugars these types of deserts contain contribute to your decreased overall health when consumed too frequently . <p> While most people understand that diets high in sugar contain a lot of additional calories , which contributes to weight gain , many may also fail to understand how that sugar can negatively affect their oral health . <p> When you consumer sugar , the sticky bacteria that lives in the mouth known as plaque begins to produce acids that eat away at tooth enamel . Over time , and these plaque acids can cause small pits to develop in your teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacterial growth eventually leads to tooth decay and gum disease , the leading cause of tooth loss . <p> Even though you might naturally assume that cutting back on the amount of deserts you consume will improve your health , sugar is a lot harder to avoid than you might initially suspect , especially if you drink alcohol . <p> Hidden Calories <p> A recent study has found that alcohol contributes to roughly an additional 100 calories a day to the average American adult 's diet . However , the study also concluded that alcoholic beverages such as beer , liquor , and wine might actually contribute even more daily calories to the diets of younger adults , especially young men . <p> The study , which was part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , found that individuals who drink alcohol receive approximately 16 percent of their daily calorie intake from those beverages . What makes alcoholic drinks so heavy in calories is the sugar they contain . <p> Dietary guidelines recommend by the U.S. Department of Agriculture state that no more than 15 percent of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or solid fats . However , since alcohol ranks as an added sugar source , the study 's finding of 16 percent place alcohol consumption alone as exceeding the recommended levels of daily sugar intake . When added to normal sugar intake , frequent alcohol consumption can lead to 20 to 25 percent of your daily calories intake coming from sugar . <p> The Unhealthy Consequences <p> According to the study , men receive roughly 150 extra calories a day from drinking , while women receive an additional 50 calories a day . Men between the ages of 20 to 30 actually receive the most additional calories a day from drinking , at 174 . With up to 25 percent of an individual 's daily calories coming from the consumption of sugar , it 's easy to understand what affect this can have on a person 's diet .

When you drink alcohol , not only does your mouth not produce additional saliva to wash away these acids , it actually produces less . <p> Drinking alcohol dehydrates the body , causing you to experience dry mouth and less saliva production . You do n't notice the fact that your mouth has started to produce less saliva because you 're constantly wetting the mouth while drinking . However , this dehydrating effect is why you often feel the need to drink water after consuming a few glass of wine or beer . <p> So with little saliva to help neutralize plaque acids , each time you drink alcohol , you wash your teeth in sugary liquids that directly contribute to tooth decay and gum disease . It 's little wonder then that moderate to heavy drinks have a higher risk of developing periodontal disease and tooth loss when compared to light or nondrinkers , according to the American Dental Association . <p> Fortunately , you can help prevent alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do n't have the time or opportunity to brush after drinking , make a point to sip some water after every few sips of alcohol you take . This will help to neutralize harmful acids , while also preventing dry mouth . <p> As for additional weight gain , moderation is the key . If you have plans to drink later in the day , make a point to avoid eating anything sweet that day in order to save your daily allotted sugar consumption . Not only does this mean less candy , it also means cutting back on sodas , sweetened fruit juices , lattes , and any other beverage high in sugar . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

That said , a large number of muscle strain and tears happen during normal every day activities . Heavy lifting when performing work tasks is seen to be one of the main culprits in this area . <p> In the event of tearing a muscle you will experience a degree of pain . The acuteness of this pain will of course be determined by the extent of the injury . Normally an element of bruising followed by swelling are the next things to be noticed . Until such a point as the injured area has an opportunity to repair itself it will be noticeably weaker than before , very often this will lead to limitations around mobility . <p> This blog post will take a closer look at some things that should and should n't be done when trying to recover from a muscle tear . <p> Pain Relief <p> Due to their natures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding often occurs . The evidence of this is demonstrated when bruising first appears . <p> It is very likely that you will want to take something to help take the edge off of the pain . This can be in the form of an anti-inflammatory non-steroid product . Something like either Aspirin or Ibuprofen will be effective here . Aside from the element of pain relief that these products provide they will also help to reduce the swelling . <p> Cold Applications <p> To further help with reducing the swelling it is highly recommended to apply ice to the injured area . Ideally place the ice inside a plastic bag or towel , rather than applying it directly to the skin . This helps to prevent damage to the skin . <p> As early as 10-15 minutes after the injury has occurred you can start applying the ice . To achieve the best results it is recommended that the cold pack is applied for periods of up to 20 minutes each hour . This can and should be continued for the first 72 hours of any muscle tear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in the shape of promoting tissue regeneration . <p> Rest and Elevation <p> Having introduced a couple of pain relief methods to the affected area , things will be starting to feel a whole lot better . There is a danger here that the injured person will attempt to use the area . It is essential that any muscle tear is given adequate resting time . Failing to observe this will almost certainly lead to extended damage and longer recover times . <p> Generally speaking it is best to try to rest the affected area for between 1 and 5 days . This is one of the most important elements to recovering from any kind of muscle strain . <p> Combined with this period of rest , it is recommended that the affected area be elevated . Ideally this should be done above the level of the heart . In doing so it will help to reduce blood flow to the affected area which will serve to limit the pain and swelling . <p> Rehabilitation <p> Even after the injury has shown signs of healing it will still probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put too much strain on this area for a while . Avoid replicating the actions that caused the strain in the first place will be a good place to start . <p> Some people find that their injury will react well to massage and again it is important not to apply too much pressure to the tear during its recovery stage . Another highly effective method to help speed up recovery can come in the form of a magnetic pulser . These devices work on very specific areas , increasing oxygen to the damaged cells . This in turn helps to improve blood circulation levels . <p> Ian Appleton is a blogger who has a keen interest in sport and keeping fit . The combination of rest and using a magnetic pulser is something that he can not recommend highly enough if you experience a muscle strain or tear . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

If each and every item of refuse was turned into something else new products , raw materials , gas or at least heat ? <p> Sweden is almost there . More than 99 per cent of all household waste is recycled in one way or another . This means that the country has gone through something of a recycling revolution in the last decades , considering that only 38 per cent of household waste was recycled in 1975 . <p> Today , recycling stations are no more than 300 metres from any residential area so Swedes can make their own drop-offs . <p> In addition to environmental benefits , recycling also has plenty of fiscal incentives , says Swedish Waste Management communications director Anna-Carin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garbage has already become a commodity , and it may someday be common practice to purchase waste as fuel for power generation plants and vehicles . <p> Weine Wiqvist , CEO of the Swedish Waste Management and Recycling Association still thinks Swedes can do more , considering that about half of all household waste is burnt , that is , turned into energy . He explains that reusing materials or products means using less energy to create a product , than burning one and making another from scratch . <p> We are trying to " move up the refuse ladder " , as we say , from burning to material recycling , by promoting recycling and working with authorities ' , he says . <p> Newspapers are turned into paper mass , bottles are reused or melted into new items , plastic containers become plastic raw material ; food is composted and becomes soil or biogas through a complex chemical process .

Pharmacists accept leftover medicine . Swedes take their larger waste , such as a used TV or broken furniture , to recycling centres on the outskirts of the cities . <p> Corporations are also held accountable to encourage and enable recycling for the public . Producers are required by Swedish law to handle all costs relevant to the collection , recycling , or appropriate disposal of their products . So if a beverage is sold in bottles , the financial responsibility is on the producer of the product to pay for all costs related to recycling or bottle disposal . <p> Each of us can promote sustainability and justice at multiple levels : as an individual , as a teacher or parent , a community member , a national citizen , and as a global citizen .

But everyone can make a difference , but the bigger your action the bigger the difference you 'll make . Here are some ideas : <p> Power down ! A great deal of the resources we use and the waste we create is in the energy we consume . Look for opportunities in your life to significantly reduce energy use : drive less , fly less , turn off lights , buy local seasonal food ( food takes energy to grow , package , store and transport ) , wear a sweater instead of turning up the heat , use a clothesline instead of a dryer , vacation closer to home , buy used or borrow things before buying new , recycle . All these things save energy and save you money . And , if you can switch to alternative energy by supporting a company that sells green energy to the grid or by installing solar panels on your home , bravo ! <p> Waste less . Per capita waste production in the U.S. just keeps growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Zero Waste culture in your home , school , workplace , church , community . This takes developing new habits which soon become second nature . Use both sides of the paper , carry your own mugs and shopping bags , get printer cartridges refilled instead of replaced , compost food scraps , avoid bottled water and other over packaged products , upgrade computers rather than buying new ones , repair and mend rather than replace.the list is endless ! The more we visibly engage in re-use over wasting , the more we cultivate a new cultural norm , or actually , reclaim an old one ! <p> Talk to everyone about these issues . At school , your neighbors , in line at the supermarket , on the busA student once asked Cesar Chavez how he organized . He said , " First , I talk to one person . Then I talk to another person . " " No , " said the student , " how do you organize ? " Chavez answered , " First I talk to one person . Then I talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these issues raises awareness , builds community and can inspire others to action . <p> Make Your Voice Heard . Write letters to the editor and submit articles to local press . In the last two years , and especially with Al Gore winning the Nobel Peace Prize , the media has been forced to write about Climate Change . As individuals , we can influence the media to better represent other important issues as well . Letters to the editor are a great way to help newspaper readers make connections they might not make without your help . Also local papers are often willing to print book and film reviews , interviews and articles by community members . Let 's get the issues we care about in the news . <p> DeTox your body , DeTox your home , and DeTox the Economy . Many of today 's consumer products from children 's pajamas to lipstick contain toxic chemical additives that simply are n't necessary . Research online ( for example , http : **28;236;TOOLONG ) before you buy to be sure you 're not inadvertently introducing toxics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about toxics in consumer products . Together , ask the businesses why they 're using toxic chemicals without any warning labels . And ask your elected officials why they are permitting this practice . The European Union has adopted strong policies that require toxics to be removed from many products . So , while our electronic gadgets and cosmetics have toxics in them , people in Europe can buy the same things toxics-free . Let 's demand the same thing here . Getting the toxics out of production at the source is the best way to ensure they do n't get into any home and body . <p> Unplug ( the TV and internet ) and Plug In ( the community ) . The average person in the U.S. watches T.V. over 4 hours a day . Four hours per day filled with messages about stuff we should buy . That is four hours a day that could be spent with family , friends and in our community . On-line activism is a good start , but spending time in face-to-face civic or community activities strengthens the community and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and logistical support , greater security and happiness . A strong community is also critical to having a strong , active democracy . <p> Park your car and walkand when necessary MARCH ! Car-centric land use policies and life styles lead to more greenhouse gas emissions , fossil fuel extraction , conversion of agricultural and wildlands to roads and parking lots . Driving less and walking more is good for the climate , the planet , your health , and your wallet . But sometimes we do n't have an option to leave the car home because of inadequate bike lanes or public transportation options . Then , we may need to march , to join with others to demand sustainable transportation options . Throughout U.S. history , peaceful non-violent marches have played a powerful role in raising awareness about issues , mobilizing people , and sending messages to decision makers . <p> Change your lightbulbsand then , change your paradigm . Changing lightbulbs is quick and easy . Energy efficient lightbulbs use 75% less energy and last 10 times longer than conventional ones . That 's a no-brainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fundamentally flawed system unless we also change our paradigm . A paradigm is a collection of assumptions , concepts , believes and values that together make up a community 's way of viewing reality . Our current paradigm dictates that more stuff is better , that infinite economic growth is desirable and possible , and that pollution is the price of progress . To really turn things around , we need to nurture a different paradigm based on the values of sustainability , justice , health , and community . <p> Recycle your trashand , recycle your elected officials . Recycling saves energy and reduces both waste and the pressure to harvest and mine new stuff . Unfortunately , many cities still do n't have adequate recycling systems in place . In that case you can usually find some recycling options in the phone book to start recycling while you 're pressuring your local government to support recycling city-wide . Also , many products for example , most electronics are designed not to be recycled or contain toxics so recycling is hazardous . In these cases , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to enact Extended Producer Responsibility ( EPR ) laws , as is happening in Europe . EPR is a policy which holds producers responsible for the entire lifecycle of their products , so that electronics company who use toxics in their products , have to take them back . That is a great incentive for them to get the toxics out ! <p> Buy Green , Buy Fair , Buy Local , Buy Used , and most importantly , Buy Less . Shopping is not the solution to the environmental problems we currently face because the real changes we need just are n't for sale in even the greenest shop . But , when we do shop , we should ensure our dollars support businesses that protect the environment and worker rights . Look beyond vague claims on packages like " all natural " to find hard facts . Is it organic ? Is it free of super-toxic PVC plastic ? When you can , buy local products from local stores , which keeps more of our hard earned money in the community . Buying used items keeps them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during extraction and production . But , buying less may be the best option of all . Less pollution . Less Waste .

Whether you subscribed to the eyes as being the windows of the soul or the beholder of beauty , they still serve a very practical and necessary function- the eyes allow you to see . <p> Like every other part of the body , your eyes go through a remarkable transition as you age from infancy into adulthood . To help you gain a better appreciation of how your eyes work and what you can expect to change as you grow older , here 's how your vision changes over the years . <p> Infancy <p> At birth , the eyes of newborns are incredibly sensitive to light but can not register colors very well or focus on objects . While during the first few weeks of life the world may appear as a blurry realm of grays and whites , after four weeks a child can start to focus on objects less than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of age , he can start to see across the room and a full spectrum of colors begin to manifest . <p> A child should undergo her first eye exam at some point between six months and a year , and many eye doctors recommend a child undergo a comprehensive eye exam by the time she turns three . By this age , the early signs of vision problems such as lazy eye or nearsightedness should become apparent . A early eye exam should include tests that determine overall eye health and visual sharpness . <p> Adolescence <p> Roughly one out of every four school-age children has some type of vision problem , usually nearsightedness . Unfortunately , despite the need for corrective lenses , only a third of all children undergo an eye exam prior to string school . Most experts recommend that a child receive an eye exam prior to starting the first grade , and then undergo subsequent exams every two years after . Because a child 's eyes continue to develop as they grow older , children who are nearsighted will often have their vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the only eye problem that can afflict young children , as roughly three percent of all kids suffer from amblyopia , more commonly known as lazy eye . The condition occurs when nerve signals traveling between one eye and the brain fail to properly work . Fortunately , the majority of children who suffer from lazy eye can have the condition corrected by wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye . <p> Adulthood <p> One of the first signs that a person has reached middle age is the need for reading glasses . By the time most people reach their mid-40s , they 'll need some kind of assistance performing up-close tasks , such as reading . This change in vision is referred to as presbyopia , and is a completely normal part of aging . To correct this condition , you can try wearing special contacts , bifocals , or reading glasses . In some instances , undergoing laser surgery can provide some assistance . <p> Presbyopia occurs due to a loss of flexibility in the lenses of the eye . Prior to turning 40 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flexibility wanes the older a person becomes . Over time , this reduction in flexibility reduce a person 's ability to view objects clearly up-close .

Chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes can have a negative effect of the health of your eyes and vision . Diabetes , for example , ranks as the leading cause of blindness among adults , while high blood pressure can damage nerves and blood vessels in the eye , leading to permanent vision loss . <p> For seniors over 60 , one of the most common and serious eye conditions they must contend with is glaucoma .

Where large piles of organic matter decay , flies follow and maggots result . Maggots certainly feed off carrion and they do spread disease , so its not a good idea to let an infestation carry on particularly since , if allowed to mature , you 'll have a fly problem soon enough . <p> But despite their reputation as disease-carriers , maggots are actively used in a range of fields including medicine and forensic science . <p> Maggot Debridement Therapy <p> Most notably , maggots have been used for years in the debridement of wounds . Known as maggot debridement therapy , larval therapy or biodebridement , it is a process by which live , disinfected maggots are introduced into a wound site . The maggots consume the necrotic flesh , leaving the live flesh largely unharmed . <p> Popular in Renaissance times , the use of maggots to clean wounds first came about when the neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that the soldiers with infested wounds had a higher survival rate and that their wounds were cleaned effectively and efficiently . <p> Modern usage came about after Dr William S Baer , an orthopaedic surgeon , conducted a study at Johns Hopkins University in which he concluded that maggot therapy resulted in rapid debridement , a reduction in pathogenic organisms at wound sites , reduced odour levels and optimum rates of healing . Since then , the commercial production of surgical maggots has begun and maggot therapy has been successfully used to treat modern bacteria including MRSA , a highly evolved strain of staphylococcus with resistance to multiple antibiotics that causes necrotising fasciitis . <p> Maggots are particularly favoured for treating wounds and ulcers in diabetic patients , who are prone to developing lower-extremity ulcers due to poor circulation . Diabetics also have poor healing capacity , which makes them mostly unresponsive to conventional treatments . Maggot therapy is useful because the maggots produce an enzyme that stimulates the production of granulation tissue . <p> The Use of Maggots in Forensic Science <p> Youve seen it on CSI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the time of death . Since flies feast and lay their eggs directly on corpses , the presence of maggots can be used by forensic entomologists to calculate the approximate time of death . Entomologists also take into consideration the species of the fly and the conditions surrounding the corpse . <p> Because they feed on the flesh of the victim , maggots also ingest whatever toxins might be present in the system of the corpse . This information can then be used by investigators , which is particularly helpful if the body is badly decomposed . <p> Angling with the Aid of Maggots <p> An extremely popular bait when trying to catch non-predatory fish , maggots are particularly favoured by European and North American anglers , who throw handfuls of them into the water to attract fish to the area . They will generally use the larvae of the housefly or green bottle fly as these are smaller and hard to hook . They will then use larger maggots , generally from the blue bottle fly , on the hook as bait . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

The low-level electronic pulses that are sent to the muscles are meant to halt atrophy or reduce spasms . The process is mainly used in hospitals and physical therapy clinics , but has now found favour among commercial fitness enthusiasts . The history of EMS and how it grew and gained the popularity it now enjoys is quite interesting . <p> History of Electronic Muscle Stimulation <p> The journey from a simple discovery through to a well established theory on electrical impulses and their effects on the bodys process is a very interesting one .

The legs of the frog moved as if it was still alive and that caught the attention of Luigi . The year was 1791 and the physiologist provided the first scientific proof that the muscle can be activated by current . <p> Later Developments <p> Following Galvanis discovery , Carlo Matteucci went on to demonstrate that applying voltage to cell membranes caused them to produce current .

One hundred years after Galvanis discovery , scientists found that there were permanent changes in muscles that were treated with electronic muscle stimulation . Confirmation that the human body functions better after undergoing an electrical stimulation came after World War II . This signaled the coming together of the all the experiments and the forward thrust of EMS as a recognized method of muscle treatment . The treatment were first used on athletes in the 1960s when the Soviet Union used it on their top athletes while in training .

Electronic muscle stimulator devices became so widely used in the homes and later they were adopted for everyday wear . These wearable units made a big hit in the 1990s . They were worn as belts , shirts and even shorts . The belts were fitted with electrodes that lay against the skin ( using adhesive pads ) while the shorts were made of neoprene . <p> Benefits of Electronic Muscle Stimulation <p> Electrotherapy is now mainly used in areas that relate to physical and sports activities where muscle injuries are common and rehabilitation is necessary .

The largest portion of the U.S. harvest by weight is Pink salmon , followed by Sockeye , Chum , Coho and Chinook . <p> Yet , not all salmon types are the same , and its life may influence its taste , fattiness , and healthy benefits . This article will reveal the ways in which you can recognize healthy salmon and how to properly cook it , in order to enjoy all its potential . <p> First of all , let us review the ways the color of salmon can indicate its quality . If we compare Wild Alaskan Sockeye and farmed salmon in color , we can notice a huge difference . <p> Namely , the wild-caught Alaskan sockeye is satisfying red in color . On the other hand , its farmed alternative is much paler , indicating that it has been grown in unnatural and unhealthy conditions . <p> This difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is included in krill , algae , and plankton , and possesses potent properties : <p> it improves blood flow <p> it strengthens the mitochondria 's cell membranes by preventing damaging oxygen species and thus protects it <p> it is a strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant <p> it improves mitochondrial energy production <p> According to a study , when used as a supplement , it boosts the strength endurance by over 50% . <p> Wild salmon eat great amounts of astaxanthin , particularly sockeye salmon , as they consume it while eating astaxanthin-rich plankton . On the other hand , farmed salmon consume food pellets which do not include natural astaxanthin , but farmers add its synthetic version . <p> Yet , the majority of commercial astaxanthin is produced from petrochemicals such as coal , so it is not chemically the same as the natural astaxanthin. - The fish feed also contains fish oil and fish meal which are threatened to be contaminated with- dioxin and mercury . <p> Farmers lately try to reduce the contamination with heavy metal b y substituting fish meal/oil with soy , vegetable oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in their nature to consume corn and soy , the quality of their meat declines . <p> Therefore , farmers commonly administer antibiotics in order to maintain their health , and trace quantities of them are now included in the salmon we consume . Moreover , the vegetable oils may also contain mold toxins and reduce the important omega-3 fat content in the fish . <p> Regarding the mercury content found in salmon , the FDA and EPA have examined it and confirmed that wild-caught salmon has constantly been at extremely low risk of contamination with mercury . They even suggest that its consumption is absolutely safe and may be practiced numerous times a week . <p> If you want to know which type of salmon is best to be eaten , you should review what do you demand from its consumption . Sockeye , Chinook , and coho salmon are all great salmon varieties if they are wild-caught . They have distinct flavors but are all very healthy . So , it is up to you which salmon species to consume . <p> Namely , Sockeye salmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It contains the highest amount of vitamin D , cholesterol , and astaxanthin , as they usually eat exclusively plankton . <p> Due to this property , they are extremely difficult to farm , so this kind of salmon is generally always wild .

They live in cold , deep water . Yet , they are kept warm by the omega-3s they contain , as the fat remains liquid in their system and protects them from freezing . Yet , this kind of salmon can be farmed , so you must always be cautious in order not to buy the farmed version . <p> Another strong version of salmon is the Pacific coho salmon , which contains the third-highest content of fat , just behind sockeye and Chinook .

@@42978097 @2978097/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> How To Cure Autism and The Time Bomb Of Mercury Poisoning <p> Autism strikes 2% of all U.S. children , and this rate is rapidly rising . Members of the medical establishment maintain that they can not ascertain the cure , and claim to not know the cause . The only thing they claim to know with certainty is that vaccinations can not be the culprit . Vaccines are categorically exempt from all institutional criticisms , and they are paraded as an unquestionable " miracle of modern science " . Although the Centers For Disease Control found that approximately half of the physicians refuse to take routine vaccinations themselves , due to safety and efficacy reasons . <p> Nevertheless , they preach in unison that vaccines are safe for us and our children . After all , vaccines are said to have ended the polio and smallpox epidemics . Not exactly . The vaccines were conveniently put into usage just after the epidemics had begun their natural dying-off process that all epidemics undergo . This dying-off process is why the epidemic of the Black Plague and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has historically happened without the assistance of vaccines . The end of modern epidemics that were fought against with vaccines had successes that were mirrored in countries which did not use any vaccines , and frequently had faster rates of die-off . These statistics are institutionally ignored for the sake of vaccine political correctness in the Western world . Not only has medical history been rewritten to categorically favor vaccines , but evidence of their side-effects is routinely suppressed . <p> The Cover-Up <p> The vaccine industry will make over 34 billion dollars in profits this year , with no foreseeable end in its profit growth . People who have never researched the pharmaceutical industry can not grasp the corruption of this lucrative industry , its cozy relations with regulatory agents , or its virtual ownership of the media industry . It pays more for media advertising than any other industry ; making it the most influential paying client for media organizations ; and moreover , the pharmaceutical industry has the biggest political lobby in the United States . In other words , nobody with a voice ever gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasping the breadth of the industrys influence , one needs to first grasp its history . The international pharmaceutical conglomerates originate from the former petrochemical empire that was once exclusively owned by the Rockefeller family . It was so powerful that the U.S. Government considered it to be a threat to U.S. national security , and thus anti-trust actions were commenced to cripple the empire . However , this dragon was never slain . It is bigger and stronger than ever , to the degree that governments now answer to them , and any reporter who wants to keep his job knows to fear it . <p> Despite studies showing an unquestionable link between ethyl mercury and autism , the mainstream media favors studies which have shown the opposite . What is interesting is that all of the studies used to deny the autism link to mercury poisoning were funded by pharmaceutical ( vaccine ) companies , doctors who own vaccine patents , or the F.D.A. , which gets most of its funding ( 97% ) from the pharmaceutical industry . <p> The Explosive Growth of Autism <p> The cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no talk about promising studies concerning treatments for autism . In fact , some claim that autism is an incurable genetic condition . Some scientists have noted that the percentage of autistic children is growing so exponentially fast that autism can not possibly be explained by genetic causes . Others argue that only the diagnoses of it have increased , whilst the actual percentage of autistic children has not actually changed . <p> People who work with children have easily contradicted these gratuitous speculations . Child care workers have made it increasingly clear that autistic children portray some unmistakable symptoms , which have become so common in recent years , that the genetics and misdiagnoses arguments explaining its growth are fundamentally flawed . The presiding theories are more a matter of political damage control by the medical establishment than science . <p> What The Parents Need to Know <p> The truth is that autism can sometimes be cured , but only if it is caught in time . There is not enough data to make a statement about what percentage of cases are curable ; even for those who begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent because vaccine-injected mercury does tremendous damage to the brain over time , and to the central nervous system . If the mercury is not removed in a timely manner , then recovery might not be possible . Mercury poisoning for autistic children is a ticking time-bomb , and its eventual payload is permanent brain damage . Young children are the most receptive to a full recovery . <p> Thousands of families are currently using DMSA , a substance that was F.D.A. approved for the removal of lead . Studies are now beginning to show that it is likewise effective for mercury removal , which explains why this therapy helps autistic children . <p> Skeptics deny the effectiveness of this protocol , based only on the fact that they religiously believe that no vaccine-autism link could exist . Their bias stems from the fact that successful treatments further prove that autism was indeed caused by mercury poisoning , and therefore by vaccines . Accepting this link would mean committing a career-ending sacrilege for anyone involved with the medical industry . So instead , they ignore data showing the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unscientific " . We have repeatedly witnessed that the whole vaccine debate is much more about business , power , and politics than science . <p> When the DMSA cure began becoming popular , James Adams , Ph.D , Professor in the Division of Clinical Sciences at the Southwest Clinic of Natural Medicine , began a study of DMSA , largely because his teenage daughter had autism . N.B.C . News actually covered the story . <p> Parts 1 &amp; 2 <p> The conclusion of the study done by Jim Adams was that autism can be reversed safely and effectively in some children . His study was intended to be the starting point for further research , and was conducted on children aged 3 to 8 years . Most people would assume that positive results in one study would lead the way to further investigations by different groups , but this has not been the case . Scientific progress is being thwarted by politics and business agendas at university medical schools . However , at least one other study , published in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology did reveal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , but that it is effectively removed with DMSA . <p> Alternative medicine offers several different forms of chelation ( heavy metal removal ) . These can be used in conjunction with DMSA , and we advise parents to utilize all methods to get the maximum results as fast as possible . The longer the process of removing heavy metal toxins takes , the more brain damage and side effects there will be . Parents should accept that the onset of autistic symptoms indicates a mercury-based time bomb that they are racing against to save their child from a life-long handicap . <p> Chelation Regimen <p> A.L.A. ( alpha lipoic acid 300 mg. per 100 lbs . ) <p> Cilantro ( supplement 100 mg. per 50 lbs . of weight ) <p> NAC ( N-Acetyl-Cysteine 400 mg. per 50 lbs . ) <p> Selenium <p> B complex vitamins <p> 5-HTP ( Never exceed 100 mg. , and do not take alongside anti-depressants . ) <p> DMSA can only be found in select herbal stores , and of course , the Internet . We warn readers to not confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most parents continue their program for about eight months . While this is an extended period of time , and perhaps longer than necessary ; it is nonetheless essential that the maximum amount of mercury be removed at the earliest time . This may not be a process that can be finished later . Exercise is the only way that lymph nodes expel toxins . <p> Current research shows that DMSA has difficulty crossing into the brain , so it mostly removes the mercury that is built-up in other tissues . Therefore , for maximum efficacy , alpha lipoic acid ( A.L.A. ) should also be employed . It is readily available at health food stores . A Hungarian study titled , Effect of Lipoic Acid on Biliary Excretion of Glutathione and Metals , showed that A.L.A. supplementation can increase the excretion of mercury by 12 to 37 times . We furthermore know from other studies that A.L.A. crosses the blood-brain barrier . Studies demonstrating its removal of metals from the brain are intentionally sparse , because the establishment does not want more proof that autism is caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is caused by aluminum ( vaccines too ) . Researchers , especially those in the U.S. , avoid such controversies in lieu of maintaining their research grants and avoiding career suicides with what would be considered institutional blasphemy . <p> Repairing The Damage <p> It is wise to stimulate nerve regeneration when treating autism . Vitamin B-12 , in the form of methylcobalamin , is known to be helpful for creating and repairing nerves , along with MSM ( methylsulfonylmethane ) . The intake of saturated fats is essential , since nerve repair can not take place without them . Saturated fats ( e.g. dairy products ) like real butter are ideal . The patient should supplement daily with omega-3 in the form of flax seed oil ; in independent , light-resistant capsules . Never use fish oil or other supplementary sources for the omega-3 . Baked fish is the ideal source of omega-3 , but it will be impossible to get the needed amount from diet alone . Include a source of dietary sulfur proteins , such as goat cheese or eggs , for best results with omega supplementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as healthy , because it is made from homogenized milk . If yogurt is used , then also supplement with folate ( or the inferior folic acid ) and vitamin C to prevent inflammation and arterial damage . <p> Mainstream physicians and psychiatrists are likely to tell you that it is impossible to heal nerve damage , especially damage to the brain neurons . Do not assume this to be true , because it is only true for some cases . Young people , in particular , have excellent chances of nervous system regeneration . Just remember that those same experts told you that vaccines are harmless , and that there is no cure for autism . <p> The autism epidemic is sweeping our society , and the medical establishment has remained silent about chelation-based options , which help an unknown percentage of autistic children . It is worth noting that thimerosal is still present in some vaccines . It was withdrawn for a brief period , so that manufacturers could claim that it was " removed " . Then they put it back into the vaccines and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it technically was removed ( at one time ) . These are the sort of manipulations and word games that one uncovers when studying the pharmaceutical industry . <p> We strongly recommend that parents consider using a chelation protocol on their autistic children immediately , and avoid all future vaccines . All states , except for West Virginia and Mississippi have religious or philosophical exemptions to protect those who are in-the-know from " mandatory " vaccinations . Parents from those two states must home school their children in order to avoid vaccinating them or legally challenge the local school system . If you are beginning to treat your autistic child , then we wish you the best of luck and God-speed . A prayer for help and guidance would probably be the best first step . <p> The Independent Studies <p> Here is a sampling of the independent studies that are institutionally ignored . They show an unmistakable correlation between mercury poisoning and autism : <p> Cell Biology and Toxicology , April 2010 : Induction of metallothionein in mouse cerebellum and cerebrum with low-dose thimerosal injection . <p> " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain pathology observed in patients diagnosed with autism , the present study helps to support the possible biological plausibility for how low-dose exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines may be associated with autism . " <p> Toxicological &amp; Environmental Chemistry , Volume 91 , 2009 : Mitochondrial dysfunction , impaired oxidative-reduction activity , degeneration , and death in human neuronal and fetal cells induced by low-level exposure to thimerosal and other metal compounds . This study showed the effects of exposure to ethyl mercury on cells , a component that vaccine advocates claim is harmless ( unlike methyl mercury which is found in dental fillings , etc ) . <p> " Holmes et al . examined first baby haircuts and determined that autistics had significantly higher body burdens of mercury in comparison to nonautistic matched controls , by demonstrating that the mercury level in hair , and thus the ability to excrete mercury , was inversely proportional to the severity of autism and overall much lower in the autistic group .

The majority doctors do n't inform you on the correct food to eat to stay free of cancer and what to eat to cause the body to remove it naturally . <p> The Foods we eat in today 's time contain both acid and alkalinizing forming elements . A diet of mainly acid-forming food can contribute to cancer . Unfortunately , that is a- common diet here in the western culture. - American 's diet today is mostly acidic . If you are fighting cancer , you need to balance the body 's pH level because cancer will thrive in an acidic environment whereas an alkaline environment will remove cancer . <p> We see more people with cancer today more than ever before , and it 's because the typical western diet is far too high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The foods we used to eat like freshly grown fruit and vegetables were much better for us , so the best solution is to make some dietary changes . - The alkaline-acid ratio is measured on the pH scale which ranges from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral . The lower end of the scale which is from 0 to 7 is acidic , and anything between 7 to 14 is alkaline . <p> The easiest way to find out what foods are either alkaline or acidic is to- research which foods are alkaline or acidic more so than others , also test your alkaline level often . - While a diagnosis of cancer may have other contributing factors , the food we eat now is the main cause . <p> Many years ago before we had supermarkets we were eating a healthier diet , now because of processed foods and the popularity of fast food outlets our diets have changed . A diet of food from an acidic range is causing many health problems now , and cancer is just one of them . - For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of our bread and other baked foods are made from refined white flour . <p> Some other examples of acid forming foods are ; pasta , cheese , ice cream and butter , jams and jellies , alcohol and soft drinks . All acid forming foods are not necessarily bad ; it 's just our diet is out of balance , and if you are dealing with any serious health problem it 's essential to look carefully at what you are eating . <p> Some of the alkaline foods are fresh fruit and nearly all freshly grown vegetables . Also consuming , nuts , seeds , grains and legumes are all alkaline foods . It 's important to remember that the changes you make to a more alkaline diet have many health benefits including removing cancer naturally . <p> While cancer has some other contributing factors , the most important cause is what we eat , because our health is directly related to our dietary choices . Our diet has changed over the last 40 to 70 years , and most of what we eat now is available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now buy . <p> Much of what 's available in supermarkets is processed , and because of it , this food is low in nutritional value , and that is without question the reason why there is so much cancer now . - It makes a lot of sense if you are dealing with cancer that the first and the most important change you make is with your diet and that you select from a more alkaline range .

Based on the results of this study , the link between bras and breast cancer is about three times greater than the link between cigarette smoking and cancer . <p> Although this study did not control for other risk factors , which could have skewed their results , other studies have found similar compelling links .

It is a critical component of curry powders , giving them their yellow color . <p> That yellow color itself comes from a trio of chemicals known as " curcuminoids , " the most commonly known being curcumin .

Keep telling yourself that they are just stairs ; they are inanimate objects and , on their own , can not hurt you . <p> Watch trusted friends or family members use the stairs Taking the time and forcing yourself to watch those you love going up and down the stairs can help greatly reduce the amount of fear that you associate with a staircase .

Choose stairs that have a wide bannister or balustrade and hold on to it and whoever you are with . <p> Ask another trusted supporter to stand a few steps up from you and that 's your target point .

Keep your eyes and mind wide open <p> A lot of people make the mistake of closing their eyes when they are scared . This only allows the mind to wander and makes it easier for your fear to take over , which prevents the body from moving . If you keep your eyes open , your mind will be open and your body will be more willing to go up each step that is in front of them .

Number one , 40 percent or more of- cancer patients actually die of malnutrition . And you just mentioned one of- the reasons is- chemotherapy . First of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . Maybe things are n't  looking too good .

In my book , Beating Cancer With Nutrition , I talk about , - among other things , this dragon slayer shake and I have found many patients- have given me feedback . They said its very helpful . Basically , taking some- fruit and vegetable , puree it in a high speed blender , add a tablespoon or- two of whey protein , or something like that , and then add a half of a- frozen banana , and it has the consistency of a milkshake , and yet its got- good nourishment , vital chemicals , some protein , and even when patients are- feeling nauseated , tired , depressed and cant eat a meal , they can still- drink this and it will keep their bodies nutritional status at an adequate- level . So nutrition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important because its going to help protect the- body against the damaging effects of chemo and radiation . These are non-- selective poisons . They kill everything in their pathway . But a well- nourished patient will find that those cytotoxic therapies are going to be- more toxic to the cancer and not to the healthy tissue . We also find that- the immune system is built from and repaired by nutrients in the diet . And- that 's another important reason for nutrition . We also find sugar . We- mentioned cancer is a not a good glucose metabolizer . Not just the amount- of sugar you eat , but nutrients that help you metabolize it and lower your- blood glucose levels . Herbs , like cinnamon . Nutrients , like fish oil. - Magnesium . Chromium . These are all part of the bodys regulation ofblood- glucose . <p> And then the fifth thing is that nutrients become biological response modifiers .

So high is- sugars toxicity- that it should now be considered a potentially toxic substance like alcohol and tobacco . Its link with the onset of diabetes is such that punitive regulations , such as a tax on all foods and drinks that contain " added " sugar , are now warranted , the researchers concluded . They also recommend banning sales in or near schools , as well as placing age limits on the sale of such products . <p> Sugars harmful effects do not stop at diabetes , metabolic syndrome , hyper- and hypoglycemia , GERD and heart disease. - Sugar and cancer- are locked in a death grip , yet oncologists often fail to do what 's necessary to stop their patients from feeding their cancers with sweets . <p> Whereas many within the mainstream medical community insist on promoting the belief that the link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer is " weak " or only " nominally significant . " They believe that research " linking foodstuffs to cancer reveals no valid medical patterns . " We also find such superficial attitudes promoted in the medical press-all of which lack any kind of medical depth . <p> An increasing number of medical scientists and many alternative practitioners know that the most logical , effective , safe , necessary and inexpensive way to treat cancer is to cut off the supply of food to tumors and cancer cells , - starving them with a lack of glucose . The therapeutic strategy for selective starvation of tumors by dietary modification ( ketogenic diet ) is one of the principle forms of therapy that is necessary for cancer patients to win their war on cancer . <p> Researchers- at Huntsman Cancer Institute in Utah were one of the first to discover that sugar " feeds " tumors . The research published in the journal- Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences- said , " Its been known since 1923 that tumor cells use a lot more glucose than normal cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how it might be stopped to control tumor growth , " says Don Ayer , Ph.D. , a professor in the Department of Oncological Sciences at the University of Utah . <p> Dr. Thomas Graeber , a professor of molecular and medical pharmacology , has investigated how the metabolism of glucose affects the biochemical signals present in cancer cells . In research published June 26 , 2012 in the journal- Molecular Systems Biology , Graeber and his colleagues demonstrate that- glucose starvation " that is , depriving cancer cells of glucose " activates a metabolic and signaling amplification loop that- leads to cancer cell death- as a result of the toxic accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . 1 <p> Refined sugars are strongly linked to cancer , not only as a cause of it but also as something that feeds the cancer cells once a person has the disease " Nothing could be more important to consider in the attempt to improve the outcome of cancer treatments . The kinds of sugar so prevalent in todays standard American diet lead to cancer directly by causing inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the individual and their constitution . Listen to this- video- and hear how simple this all really is . Once cancer cells are established in the body , they depend on steady glucose availability in the blood for their energy ; they are not able to metabolize significant amounts of fatty acids or ketone bodies , 2. so they need sugar . <h> Suppress/ Delay/ Slow/ Kill Cancer <p> Carbohydrates of one of the three macronutrients " the other two being fats and protein . There are simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates . Simple carbohydrates include sugars found naturally in foods such a fruits and fruit juices , sodas , some vegetables , white bread , white rice , pasta , milk and milk products , most snack foods , sweets , etc . But let us not forget the simple sugars added to foods during processing and refining that we may have no awareness of . Its the simple sugars that get most of the credit for causing the insulin response and glycation-associated inflammation that can lead to cancer . <p> Thus by reducing the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be suppressed or delayed , or the proliferation of already existing tumor cells can be slowed down , stopped and reversed by depriving the cancer cells of the food they need for survival . <p> Drs . Rainer Klement and Ulrike Kammerer conducted a comprehensive review of the literature involving dietary carbohydrates and their direct and indirect effect on cancer cells , which was published in October 2011 in the journal- Nutrition and Metabolism , concluding that cancers are so sensitive to the sugar supply that cutting that supply will suppress cancer. 3- " Increased glucose flux and metabolism promotes several hallmarks of cancer such as excessive proliferation , anti-apoptotic signaling , cell cycle progression and angiogenesis . " <p> Also , eating white sugar ( or white anything ) causes- magnesium mineral deficiencies- because the magnesium has been removed in the processing , - making sugar a ripe target as a major cause of cancer because deficiencies in magnesium are not only pro-inflammatory but also pro-cancer . <h> More Ways to Cause Cancer with Sugar <p> High fructose corn syrup- ( HFCS ) causes cancer in a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the complex way it is made . High fructose corn syrup causes selenium deficiencies because the mercury in it binds with selenium , driving selenium levels downward . Selenium is crucial for glutathione production and its deficiency in soils tracks mathematically with cancer rates . Selenium and mercury are also eternal lovers having a strong affinity to bond with each other . <p> Already touched on briefly , excess sugar spikes insulin levels and insulins eventual depletion . High insulin and- insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) - are needed for the control of blood sugar levels that result from chronic ingestion of high-carbohydrate meals ( like the typical American diet , that is full of grains and sugars ) . - Increased insulin levels are pro-inflammatory and pro-cancer- and can directly promote tumor cell proliferation via the insulin/ IGF-1 signaling pathway . <p> When it comes to breast cancer , insulin is no friend . One of the biggest reasons is due to the fact that both normal breast cells and cancer cells have insulin receptors on them. - When insulin attaches to its receptor , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it causes cells to start dividing. - The higher your insulin levels are , the faster your breast cells will divide ; the faster they divide , the higher your risk of breast cancer is and the faster any existing cancer cells will grow . <p> There 's also another detriment that- high insulin levels- can inflict . It makes more estrogen available to attach to the estrogen receptors in breast tissue . Insulin regulates how much of the estrogen in your blood is available to attach to estrogen receptors in your breast tissue . When estrogen travels in the blood , it either travels alone seeking an estrogen receptor , or it travels with a partner , a protein binder , that prevents it from attaching to an estrogen receptor . Insulin regulates the number of protein binders in the blood . So , the higher your insulin levels are , the fewer the number of protein binders there will be and therefore the more free estrogen that will be available to attach to estrogen receptors . <p> In other words , when your insulin levels are up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up cell division . That 's why high insulin levels increase your risk of breast cancer so much . Eating sugar increases your risk of breast cancer in another way. - It delivers a major blow to your immune system with the force of a prizefighter . <p> Dr. Horner talks about a study conducted by Harvard Medical School ( 2004 ) that found that women who , as teenagers , ate high-glycemic foods that increased their blood glucose levels had a higher incidence of breast cancer later in life . " So , encouraging your teenage daughter to cut back on sugar will help her to lower her risk of breast cancer for the rest of her life , " she said . <h> Sugar , Inflammation , Angiogenesis &amp; Cancer <p> Sugars and the inflammation and acidic environments they create are important constituents of the local environment of tumors . In most types of cancer inflammatory conditions are present before malignancy changes occur . " Smoldering inflammation in tumor microenvironments has many tumor-promoting effects . Inflammation aids in the proliferation and survival of malignant cells , - promotes angiogenesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses to hormones and chemotherapeutic agents . " 4 <p> The entire subject of inflammation , angiogenesis , sugar and cancer is crucial to understanding the links between cancer and the foods we eat . When we begin to zero in on inflammation and the acid conditions caused by excessive consumption of simple sugars , including fructose and high-fructose corn syrup , we begin to see more clearly how food and cancer are intimately connected . <p> In July 2012 a leading U.S. cancer lobby group urged the surgeon general to conduct a sweeping study of the impact of sugar-sweetened beverages on consumer health , saying such drinks play amajor role in the nations obesity crisis- and require a U.S. action plan . In a letter to U.S. Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , the American Cancer Societys advocacy affiliate called for a comprehensive review along the lines of the U.S. top doctors landmark report on the- dangers of smoking- in 1964 . <p> The ruckus is about the growing connection between high sugar intake , mineral depletion , dehydration , diabetes , heart disease and cancer . Sugar causes cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is pro-inflammatory and thus pro-cancer. 5 <p> Pancreatic cancer cells use the sugar fructose to help tumors grow more quickly. 6 Tumor cells fed both glucose and fructose used the two sugars in two different ways , a team at the University of California Los Angeles found . Their findings , published in the journal- Cancer Research , helps explain other studies that have linked fructose intake with pancreatic cancer , one of the deadliest cancer types . Researchers concluded that- anyone wishing to curb their cancer risk shouldstart- by reducing the amount of sugar they eat . <p> This is the first time a link has been shown between fructose and cancer proliferation . " In this study we show that cancers can use fructose just as readily as glucose to fuel their growth , " saidDr . Anthony Heaney- of UCLAs Jonsson Cancer Center , the studys lead author . " The modern diet contains a lot of refined sugar including fructose and its a hidden danger implicated in a lot of modern diseases , such as obesity , diabetes and fatty liver . " While this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be unique to that cancer type , Heaney said . " These findings show that cancer cells can readily metabolize fructose to increase proliferation . " <p> It has been known for decades that cancer cells thrive on glucose. - Moreover , foods that cause a sharp rise in blood glucose ( i.e. foods with a- high-glycemic index- ranking ) trigger the secretion of insulin and insulin growth factor ( IGF-1 ) , two hormones that also promote cancer growth . <p> Researchers- using rats have found that a low-carbohydrate high-protein diet reduces blood glucose , insulin , and glycolysis , slows tumor growth , reduces tumor incidence , and works additively with existing therapies without weight loss or kidney failure. 7 Such a diet , therefore , has the- potential of being both a novel cancer prophylactic and treatment . <p> Dr. Otto Warburgs 1924 paper , " On metabolism of tumors , " stated , " Summarized in a few words , the prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen in normal body cells by a- fermentation of sugar . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . The metabolism of cancer is approximately eight times greater than the metabolism of normal cells . Doctors have known for a long time that cancer metabolizes much differently than normal cells . Normal cells need oxygen . Cancer cells disregard oxygen when adequate glucose is present . <p> Warburgs hypothesis- was of course that cancer growth was caused when cancer cells converted glucose into energy without using oxygen . Healthy cells make energy by converting pyruvate and oxygen . The pyruvate is oxidized within a healthy cells mitochondria , and Warburg theorized that since cancer cells do n't  oxidize pyruvate , cancer must be considered a mitochondrial dysfunction . <p> Most , if not all , tumor cells have a high demand on glucose compared to benign cells of the same tissue and conduct glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen ( the Warburg effect ) . In addition , many cancer cells express insulin receptors ( IRs ) and show hyperactivation of the IGF1R-IR ( IGF-1 receptor/ insulin receptor ) pathway . Evidence exists that chronically elevated blood glucose , insulin and IGF-1 levels facilitate tumor genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetic patients , A. Braunstein observed in 1921 that in those who developed cancer , glucose secretion in the urine disappeared . One year later , R. Bierich described the remarkable accumulation of lactate in the micromilieu of tumor tissues and demonstrated lactate to be essential for invasion of melanoma cells into the surrounding tissue . One year after that Warburg began his experiments that eventually ended for him with a Nobel Prize . <p> Sugar turns the body into a suitable breeding ground for viruses , bacteria , fungi and cancer by devastating the immune system . <p> Knowing that ones cancer needs sugar , does it make sense to feed it sugar ? Does it make sense to have a high-carbohydrate diet ? <p> Of the four million cancer patients being treated in America today , hardly any are offered any scientifically guided nutrition therapy beyond being told to " just eat good foods . " Oncologists have no shame about this , insisting that diet has little to do with cancer . <p> Cancer patients should not be feeding their cancers like they would feed cotton candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get a regular supply of sugar " or glucose " it lives and thrives longer than it should . Now imagine oncologists getting enlightened and they start to advise their patients to starve the cancer instead of bombing it to smithereens with chemotherapy and radiation treatments all the while feeding the cancer with sugar ! <p> 2 Ketone bodies , also called acetone bodies or simply ketones , are any of three compounds produced when the liver metabolizes fatty acids . The three types of ketone bodies " acetoacetic acid , beta-hydroxybutyric acid , and acetone " are released into the bloodstream after metabolism occurs . Acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid are used for fuel by the brain and muscles , but the body cant break down acetone and therefore excretes it in the urine . Excess acetone or ketone bodies in the blood and urine can be a sign of a serious metabolic disease , and doctors often use the measurement of ketone bodies as a tool in the diagnosis of such diseases . <p> In healthy individuals , the body uses mostly carbohydrate metabolism to fuel its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as during starvation , the body begins metabolizing fats into ketone bodies to provide the necessary fuel . High levels of ketones in the urine , a condition called ketonuria , indicates that the body is using mostly fat for its energy . <p> A condition that will produce dangerously high levels of ketone bodies is Type I diabetes . Individuals with diabetes mellitus are unable to efficiently metabolize glucose , due to insufficient insulin production or insulin resistance . Their bodies will begin metabolizing fats and proteins to make up for the lack of available glucose for energy . Without treatment , extremely high levels of ketones in the blood and urine can lower the bloods pH and cause a condition called ketoacidosis . It occurs most often in people with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and is exacerbated when high blood glucose levels , caused by lack of available insulin , further acidify the blood . Ketoacidosis can lead to ketoacidic coma or death . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

Interestingly , a large percentage of colon related diseases could have been prevented . According to a 2013 study conducted by Harvard School of Public Health ( HSPH ) , regular screening could prevent around 40 percent of colorectal cancers . To put it another way , many people are not careful about keeping the colon healthy . Some are even unaware of the devastating consequences of a clogged colon . <h> How to Restore Your Colon Health <p> The good news is that even hardened fecal matter stuck in the colon for years can be removed with natural treatment . You simply need to undergo a colon hydrotherapy treatment from an acclaimed wellness center like NewJerseyColonic.com . However , prevention is better than cure . You can simply start by taking some simple steps , such as , increasing your fluid intake , including fiber in your everyday diet , consuming more vegetables and fruits , exercising , having deep breaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing foods thoroughly . <h> How the Colon Works <p> The last five feet of large intestine , known as a colon , plays an important role in the digestive system . After we consume a meal , the food particle moves through our stomach to the small intestine , where most of the nutrients are absorbed . The remaining fiber moves to the large intestine , and finally to the colon . Once the waste materials reach the colon , the muscles of the colon expand and contract to release the materials through bowl movement . In the process , some remains of the food particle get stuck on the walls of small and large intestines . Over time , the accumulated wastes can cause health problems . One way to clean the wastes is by visiting a colon hydrotherapy spa . <h> How an Unhealthy Colon Affects Your Overall Health <p> Without regular colon cleansing , your colon could be a breeding ground of harmful toxins and bacteria . This may affect the nutrient absorption ability of your digestive track , thereby causing infections , and even cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoimmune diseases , and leaky gut syndrome . Overpopulation of harmful bacteria could result in a number of chronic medical conditions , such as , fibromyalgia , Crohn syndrome , chemical sensitivity , and difficulty in bowl movement . <h> Some Common Symptoms <p> Medical experts say that the stool could be a good indicator of your colon health . Watch out whether you have irregular bowl movement , constipation , horrid smell of the stool , and prints of the stool . The size and shapes of the stool and whether the waste floats on water could also indicate the current status of your colonic health . Consider taking advice of your doctor for a proper diagnosis . <p> It is always a good idea to get colonic hydrotherapy regularly from a reliable wellness center . Be sure to check the reputation and background of the spa before seeking treatment . The method works by hydrating the colon . Top spas usually use high-tech colonic equipment to flush the colon and remove waste under the instruction of a professional hydro-therapist .

@@42978206 @2978206/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> Harry Hoxsey : Guilty of Curing Cancer With Herbs <p> Of all the episodes of alternative cancer treatment suppression by the medical establishment , none is more dramatic and long lasting than Harry Hoxseys . Harrys constant conflicts covered almost 50 years of the 20th Century . Hoxsey was flamboyant and put himself into the public eye and ear energetically and often . <p> The medical establishment , cancer industries , and cooperating government agencies responded viciously . His USA operations were closed down in 1960 , but his legacy continues as the Bio-Medical Center in Tiajuana , Mexico . His clinic was the first alternative cancer clinic to flee into a less politically medical hostile environment . Others have since followed . <p> There are two herbal formulas used in the Hoxsey treatment . One is external , and it consists of a red paste made with bloodroot , the active anti tumor ingredient , mixed with zinc chloride and antimony sulfide . This paste is applied directly onto skin cancer tumors . <p> An almost identical version of the Hoxsey external paste has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1850 in England , by a Dr. Fell , who evidently got the bloodroot ingredient from Lake Superior Native Americans by way of European doctors traveling in America . In 1949 and again in the 1960s , there were other American doctors who used the same paste successfully in the States . <p> The internal tonic consists of Red Clover blossom , Licorice root , Buckthorn bark , Burdock root , Stillingia root , Poke root , Barberry root , Oregon Grape root , Cascara Sagrada bark , Prickly Ash bark , Wild Indigo root and Sea Kelp . The Sea Kelp may have been added more recently to the original formula . A supplement of potassium iodide , was included along with the tonic . <p> Richard Walters wrote in his Options : The Alternative Cancer Therapy Book , " According to eminent botanist James Duke , Ph.D. , of the United States Department of Agriculture , all of the Hoxsey herbs have known anticancer properties . . . Furthermore , Duke noted , the Hoxsey herbs have long been used by Native American healers to treat cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it home with them to treat patients . " <p> A diet is included that excludes pork , bleached white flour products , alcohol , sugar , sodas , and excess salt . In the clinic , patients eat together and mingle freely among themselves . The atmosphere is cordial and friendly , the type of positive attitude that encourages healing , sometimes in and of itself . <p> Communication among staff and patients is open . Humor and positive attitudes are encouraged . When Hoxsey was in charge , he would personally greet and encourage patients to instill a positive attitude . So a good diet and the right energy for healing is part of the treatment , in addition to the herbal remedies . <p> There was , and still is a one time fee , which enables patients to return as often as needed and receive the tonics . In 2005 at the Mexico Bio-Medical Center , renamed by Hoxseys request , it was around $3500 to $5000 . Compare that to chemotherapy , surgery , radiation , doctor bills , and hospital stays for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before inflation , the one time Hoxsey fee was much less . <p> Hoxsey himself never turned anyone down for lack of funds . He had become successful as an oil man in Texas . He did n't  need the money . Yet claims that Hoxsey was a con man out to exploit people anxious for a cure was a chronic AMA tactic . One of Hoxseys cured patients commented that her allopathic doctor had warned , " He s gon na just take all your money ! " She replied , " But that 's impossible . You already have ! " <p> Journalist James Burke observed Hoxsey take people who had traveled to his clinic in Dallas and personally handle all their travel and living expenses while charging nothing if they were broke . Burke was originally sent by Esquire magazine in 1939 to expose Harry Hoxsey as a quack and a fraud . <p> After witnessing so many patients recover , the manner in which they were treated , and the generosity Hoxsey displayed for cancer victims low on cash , Burke submitted an article titled " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  get printed . After the WW II , James Burke volunteered his journalistic services to Hoxsey as a press agent . <p> All the medicalinstitutional queries into Hoxseys treatments were and still are negative and dismissive . And these reports are the ones that get published and circulated among the medical journals and press releases to the mass media . <p> What does n't  get circulated in journals or mass media , however , is that several independent doctors , free of association or institutional restraints , conducted their own investigations and concluded that the Hoxsey therapy was more effective at curing cancer than the " conventional methods , " and without side effects . Additionally , there are many Hoxsey cured patient testimonials . <p> The Hoxsey History <p> Harry Hoxsey was not a medical practitioner . But he was the young son of a rural Illinois veterinarian who used an herbal tonic and salve on animals , mostly horses , then secretly on humans with cancer . He found the formulas very successful . Though young Harry never got past the 8th grade , he assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to use and apply it to others . <p> This was all during the time that herbal medicine and homeopathy were even more popular and widely used than allopathy . A cynical joke around that time was with eclectic medicine ( todays alternative medicine ) you died of the disease ; with allopathic medicine , you died of the cure ! The formula had been in the family since the mid nineteenth century . But there is evidence that the herbs have other sources that date back longer . <p> As Hoxseys father lay dying in bed , he told his son to use the family name for the formula , and to ensure its integrity . He also told Harry not to use the family formula primarily for monetary gain , but to allow its use for as many cancer victims as possible . In 1922 , Harry Hoxsey started his first clinic in Taylorville , Illinois . He was hounded and arrested often for practicing medicine without a license . <p> He went to Chicago around 1924 to meet with the head of the AMA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to prove the efficacy of his treatment . He was given access to a Chicago policeman , Sgt. Thomas Manix , whose cancer prognosis was terminal . Using both the ointment and tonic , the policeman was completely cured . This is a documented medical fact . Manix lived another 10 years . <p> Fishbein and associates were impressed , and they offered to buy the formulas from Hoxsey . But Hoxsey disagreed with the terms . There was no guarantee that everyone would be able to have access to the formula , and Hoxsey would be completely out of the loop with no control . Hoxsey refused to hand over the formulas . That was the beginning of their war , as the medical establishment began their campaign to destroy Hoxsey . The AMA claimed no such offer was ever made . <p> But a similar offer was disclosed to have been made in 1951 to Doctor Andrew C. Ivy , who had done research on curing cancer with a drug developed by a Dr. Durovic called Krebiozen . Dr. Ivy was not of the same personality mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit crude yet very outgoing . <p> Instead , Dr. Ivy was a highly regarded quiet medical researcher who headed the Illinois University School of Medicine and was also the universitys vice president . He and Dr. Durovic refused to sell the rights to a couple of business men , one of whom was a friend of the AMA Treasurer , J.J. Moore . For that refusal , Dr. Ivy was dismissed from his chair at the university medical school . <p> Krebiozen itself was smeared and no one really ever followed up on Dr. Ivys promising research . The point is that even though Hoxseys crude sales persona was used to easily portray him as a con artist , the real issue was over power and control to obtain workable cancer cures for monetary gain , or perhaps to hide them away in order to maintain the status quo , also for monetary gain . <p> In 1936 , Hoxsey established the largest independent clinic in the country in Dallas , Texas . There he was confronted with yet another enemy , the Assistant District Attorney , Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each time he bailed himself out with the large amount of cash he carried just for those occasions . But charges were always dropped as no one would testify against Hoxsey . Too many patients were happy with the treatment . <p> Al Templeton continued harassing Hoxsey until his brother , Mike Templeton , whose cancer was considered incurable by conventional allopathy , sneaked to the clinic to receive Hoxseys treatments . He was cured . Al properly credited his brothers cure to Hoxseys treatment , and he had a change of heart . The Assistant DA then became Hoxseys lawyer , and soon he was elected as a district judge . Now Hoxsey had friends in high places , locally . <p> But his biggest problems came on a national level , since he had the large clinic in Dallas and several other smaller ones in different states . In 1949 , Morris Fishbein wrote a hit piece on Hoxsey that was featured in the Hearst papers Sunday Magazine , available to 20 million readers . The title was " Blood Money , " and it was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in JAMA ( Journal of American Medical Association ) over the previous years . <p> Prior to this , Hoxsey relied on appealing to the public by radio , film , and with public demonstrations . He had also written a book , You Do n't  Have to Die . He was a bit crass , and his manner and direct sales approach made him an easy target of ridicule from official authority types . But he was widely accepted by the general public , and he had some supporters in government and in the medical profession as well . <p> But this time Hoxsey attacked directly and named names . He sued the Hearst Newspaper empire and Morris Fishbein and the AMA Journal for slander and libel , and surprisingly , he won ! The award was only $2.00 ( two dollars ) . Supposedly , the judge declared there was no monetary damage , since Hoxsey had successfully used the AMA persecution to promote his treatments and products . But the ruling was that Hearst and Fishbein were guilty of libel and slander . Hoxsey had paraded over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony from other supporters . <p> More important than the award was Fishbeins embarrassment . The trail revealed that Fishbein had flunked anatomy in college , and he had never practiced medicine ! Fishbein also admitted that the external salve Hoxsey used was actually effective . This after years of propagandizing the salve as worthless and dangerous . So despite the measly two dollar award , it was a stunning victory for Hoxsey . And it got even better . <p> The Supreme Court upheld the decision , ruling that the AMA had used restrictive trade techniques . The ensuing publicity aroused a public outcry against the AMA in the early 1950s . The AMA was considered by many as nothing better than a trade union that would not tolerate competition . Seems like the more things change the more they remain the same ! <p> Even Congress upheld that viewpoint in 1953 , when the Fitzgerald report determined that the Hoxsey treatment and twelve other alternative treatments , including the aforementioned Krebiozen , were actively conspired against by organized medicine . Morris Fishbein was forced to resign from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victories were not enough for Hoxsey . <p> He stubbornly lobbied for congressional hearings on the efficacy of his treatments , and insisted that the medical authorities investigate and do their own research . Even after a panel of physicians with more of a nutritional and herbal focus asserted the validity of Hoxseys treatment , a panel of surgeons and radiologists dismissed their verdict . The reason the AMA gave for declining further investigation was they did n't  want to raise false hopes and give the public any false hope or hint of the treatments credibility . Interesting logic ! <p> So as usual , whenever Hoxsey raised the stakes on the medical establishment , a backlash was sure to come . This time , the AMA got another alphabet soup to do their bidding , the FDA . The FDA pursued a long campaign of harassing not only Hoxsey , but also his patients . Finally , the FDA closed and padlocked all 17 of Hoxseys clinics on the same day in 1960 . Hoxsey was beaten and retreated . <p> But he recovered and came up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RN , who was once skeptical of Hoxsey before becoming his assistant , to relocate to a facility being prepared in Tiajuana , MX . He insisted that she change the name because the Hoxsey name was too much of a target , and that she head the facility while he remained in Dallas for his oil business . <p> The Legacy Lives <p> She reluctantly changed the name to Bio-Medical Center , and started running the new facility in 1963 . It remains there to this day , but the treatment is still considered as Hoxseys by many who have been cured or whose lives have been prolonged . The fee structure is the same as before , with a one time lifetime fee , requiring 30 percent down . <p> Ironically , Hoxsey came down with prostate cancer , and his treatment did n't  work for him . So he succumbed to the surgeons scalpel and lived another 7 years . When Hoxsey died , his personal physician insisted it was from heart failure induced by a weakened liver . But his physician was not available to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death as the result of prostate melanoma . <p> The story of Harry Hoxsey and his cancer treatments could be made into a Hollywood screen epic . There are even more fascinating details , dramatic events , and anecdotal testimonies . Of course , these days Hollywood would n't release or distribute an accurate fictional account of Hoxseys successes , nor could it focus on the cancer industrys unfair and vicious attacks in order to protect their vast , assorted revenue sources . <p> Largely because of his character and personality , Hoxseys story is probably the most dramatic in the annals of the cancer industrys efforts to suppress any alternative or real cure for cancer . In lieu of a drama based on real life events , there is an excellent documentary , How Healing Becomes a Crime , which was produced in 1987 and is now available for viewing free on line . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

@@42978211 @2978211/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> What Exactly is The Phantom Effect of DNA ? <p> Let 's go back to 1984 , because this is the year when worshiping to DNA faced a serious breakthrough . It was discovered by doctor named Peter Gariaev . This discovery of Gariaev gives us strong reasons to believe that the mythical emission " Energy Field of the Universe " may act in our DNA . Furthermore this leads us to the idea that the full genetic code of an organism may not completely consist in the molecule of DNA or at least not the only location . <p> When Gariaev puts one sample of DNA into miniature quartz container equipped with laser , observing it with sensitive equipment which can even catch single photons of light , he discovers that DNA acts like a sponge to the light . In some strange way the molecule of DNA absorbs all photons of light in the area and literally stores them in the form of a curved spiral . This is more than strange and it 's obvious that DNA creates something like a turbulence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of a black hole , but at a much smaller scale . <p> Only a handful of scientists would be willing to admit that light may enter into pineal gland " however Gariaev proves that the molecule of DNA sucks photons from somewhere by some process unknown to us . Because of the enormous difficulties , connected with studying of living human brain , such experiments with pineal gland have n't been made " or at least not to the public . The only technology we have and which could keep the light into a spiral , like the one Gariaev discovered in the molecule of DNA , is the fiber-optic cable but even fiber-optic cables ca n't absorb such quantities of light in such manner . We 're not used to think about light as something , which can be stored " we only know that it travels through space at amazing speeds . If we do manage to capture it at one place , usually we expect from it to be drained and loose its energy . Even in the case of photosynthesis , the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforms light 's energy into green chlorophyll . But now we understand , even the light itself may be used as a food supply of DNA , almost like the squirrels collecting acorns for winter . This discovery gives rise to a whole new wave of questions . What exactly is that , which stores the light ? How exactly it stores it ? And why it stores it ? <p> The real true magic happens after the end of Gariaev 's experiment . He grabs the quartz container with DNA and just puts it away from its place . Hereinafter nothing more should happen . Nonetheless , despite the fact that he removed all " DNA , container and the whole equipment " the light continued to twist into a spiral at the same place . Whatever it 's that , which held the light in the same place , it definitely did n't need the DNA molecule . Because it was something else , something invisible , something which is strong enough to store and control the visible light , maintaining it in a form like DNA molecule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of energy field exists , which goes along with the DNA molecule " something like an energy duplicate of DNA . And this duplicate has the same form as the physical molecule , and even if we put away the molecule , the duplicate continues to flow at the place it was before . It does n't need presence of DNA to continue doing its job " storing visible light . There is no doubt that some sort of force exists , similar to gravity , which can hold photons in one place . <p> The implications of this discovery are staggering . As we know , we deal with not only one molecule of DNA " there are trillions of such molecules , which are in very precise structural arrangement . We have bone DNA , blood DNA , muscle DNA , skin DNA , brain DNA and etc . Anyway , having in mind doctor Gariaev 's experiment , we can suppose that our whole body should also have its own energy duplicate . This fits perfectly with the observations and theories of some scientists " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tells our cells how and where to act . Adding this to Gariaev 's discovery , we find that probably the main function of DNA is to store light " both in our physical body and energy duplicate . It becomes clear that conventional science needs serious rethinking . There is a lot of information about biological life , which traditional science does n't know or refuses to acknowledge . <h> - The Phantom effect of DNA is undoubtedly one of the most significant breakthroughs in recent history <p> Gariaev proves that molecule of DNA has some sort of strange connection with quantum mechanics , which traditional scientists have n't discovered yet . There is already evidence that DNA reacts with some sort of invisible and yet undiscovered energy field , which has electromagnetic properties and obviously controls electromagnetic energy " in this case , by storing photons , even when there is no close physical molecule , which can hold them . <p> And that is not all . When Gariaev sprayed this phantom with liquid nitrogen , the light spiral disappeared " but after 5 minutes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of its own destruction , is stranger than its creation . Even if we destroy the integrity of the area , where the phantom of DNA was , by a sudden rush of cold it appears again and restores completely its integrity . The ambient light was again organized in a unique spiral model of DNA , which existed before . The traditional science could not offer us anything , which can explain this phenomenon and despite that fact " it happens ! <p> How long do you think this Phantom held ? As much as it 's unbelievable , the phantom DNA stayed visible for 30 days after its first appearance . During that time , Gariaev shot it with liquid nitrogen , but it kept coming back again . As you have probably guessed , this contradicts to all modern biology and physics " but is fact ! This information exists for more than twenty seven years . <p> Our DNA somehow interacts with the energy field , which is unknown at this very moment to western and eastern scientists , and which leaves behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that our duplicate continues doing its job of capturing light , even when we are n't there already . If at this time you sit on the chair reading this article , and then get up and move to another location , your energy duplicate will continue swirling light into tiny spirals right at the place where you were before . Every single molecule of DNA will stay for at least thirty days , after the time that you got off your chair . Since the dimensions mentioned , are microscopic , this effect could not be seen with naked eyes ; however Gariaev was able to measure it in its lab . It appears that our energy duplicate is like a hologram of our physical bodies , and exactly the same as every cell ! <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

In this type , an auto immune reaction of the body 's own defense system attacks the insulin secreting Beta cells of the pancreas .

Acid reflux , indigestion and GERD come to mind and while those are legitimate conditions caused by a acid reaching places it shouldnt , stomach acid itself is n't inherently bad . <p> Stomach acid has an unfairly bad reputation and is often thought of as something that needs to be lowered however its essential to digestion and our overall wellbeing. - Without it , we 'd have a tough time breaking down and digesting the food we eat . Heres 5 reasons why stomach acid is a friend and not a foe . <p> 1 . Stomach acid is essential for breaking down food . <p> Its a basic but an essential point to make . After chewing and swallowing , food passes down the esophagus to the stomach- in rather large chunks . The low PH of stomach acid ( around PH2 ) allows for the food to be broken down into tiny pieces , the result is a soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the effective surface area available for digestive enzymes has been dramatically increased . - Think 1000s of micro chunks vs 2-3 large chunks . Impaired stomach acid would leave digestion sluggish and inefficient . <p> 2 . Stomach acid aids protein digestion . <p> Aside from stomach acid leading to an overall acidic environment that allows food to be broken into smaller pieces , - stomach acid is required to activate the protein digesting enzyme pepsin. - When the stomach releases acid , it also co-releases the enzyme precursor pepsinogen where its then converted to the active enzyme pepsin ( and the magic of protein digestion begins ) . Pepsinogen is only converted to pepsin if the stomach is acidic enough and so low or insufficient stomach acid would leave protein digestion at risk . <p> 3 . It protects us from harmful bacteria <p> A normal healthy functioning stomach has a PH of around 2 , which is highly acidic . This acidic environment helps to destroy harmful bacteria and inactivate viruses that may be in the food we have eaten . While certain viruses and bacteria have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently are destroyed in the stomach . Without stomach acid wed be left at an increased risk of infection . <p> 4 . Stomach acid is essential for Vitamin B12 absorption <p> The acidic and protein digesting environment of the stomach helps to release vitamin B12 from the food we eat . Vitamin B12 in food is tightly bound to proteins and will only be released if food is effectively broken down and digested in the stomach. - Vitamin B12 is essential for proper functioning of the nervous system and the formation of red blood cells . <p> 5 . It signals the rest of digestion to go ahead <p> When chyme leaves the stomach it enters the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum . The highly acidic chyme signals the pancreas to release bicarbonate ions and digestive enzymes which are essential for digestion in the small intestine. - In essence correct stomach acid secretion allows for the further stages of digestion to go ahead properly . <p> Spotting low stomach acid <p> Low stomach acid is known as hypochlorhydria , the complete absence of stomach acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by doctors and physicians , particularly due to the unnecessarily negative attitude that surrounds stomach acid . Symptoms for low stomach acid include bloating , excessive burping , excessive fullness and nausea after meals. - Low stomach acid can be restored with betaine HCL which is a natural way to increase stomach acidity and restore digestion . <p> Conclusion <p> Stomach acid is essential for breaking down food , digesting protein and protecting us from foreign invaders. - It signals the rest of digestion to go ahead and even helps us release a crucial vitamin from food. - Without proper gastric acid , we 'd have a pretty tough time digesting and assimilating the food we eat . <p> John Stewart is a keen health and fitness enthusiast that writes on many health topics including digestion , anxiety and sleep issues .

@@42978239 @2978239/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> The Importance Of Ubiquinol Supplements <h> Ubiquinol Supplements <p> Statin drugs are usually prescribed to reduce or lower cholesterol levels in the body and consequently lessen the risk of getting a heart attack . These drugs work by inhibiting the internal cholesterol production in the body . Statin drugs are sold under different names including Pravachol ( pravastatin ) , Mevacor ( lovastatin ) , Zocor ( simvastatin ) and Lipitor ( atorvastatin ) among others <h> Definition of Ubiquinol <p> Ubiquinol is the biological active form of Coenzyme Q10 , a naturally occurring enzyme in the body cells . Aging , health conditions and drugs can reduce Ubiquinol levels in the body . This , however , can be countered by taking Ubiquinol supplements . Research has shown that Ubiquinol has better absorption rates than conventional CoQ10 and can effectively replenish the standard concentration of CoQ10 in the plasma . For example , several studies have shown a four times increase in Ubiquinol levels in people taking an average of 150-300mg of Ubiquinol per day . <h> The Importance of Ubiquinol in the Body <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining overall good cardiovascular health . When there is a decrease in the amount of CoQ10 and Ubiquinol in the body , it compromises the ability of the body to generate energy while disrupting other major body functions . For instance , some people who have taken stating drugs for a long time have low levels of CoQ10 in their blood and , as such , experience weakening of their heart muscle as well as pain in their muscles ( cardiomyalgia ) . Ubiquinol is also in most times the number one antioxidant defense against oxidation of LDL ( low density lipoprotein ) cholesterol . By neutralizing LDL cholesterol oxidation , Ubiquinol reduces the risk of getting atherosclerosis . This means that people who have reduced levels of Ubiquinol in their bodies due to the use of statin drugs are susceptible to LDL cholesterol oxidation . <h> How Statin Drugs Compromise the Production of Ubiquinol/CoQ10 <p> Statin drugs compromise CoQ10 production in the body since the biological passage that is used to manufacture the enzyme is the same one that the drug uses to lower cholesterol levels . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a steady supply of Ubiquinol , thus diminishing statins negative side effects .

Additionally , there are no negative side effects that Ubiquinol supplements have on the efficacy of statin drugs . For this reason , they can both be taken together , which is in fact advisable since you will benefit from reduced cholesterol levels from statin drugs while maintaining your bodys CoQ10 levels with Ubiquinol supplements . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

The positive side is that there are no surgical or medication costs involved . <p> Precautions <p> Cold laser treatment requires care when it comes to protecting the eyes . Treatments need to be carried out with the proper safety glasses worn by both the practitioner and the patient to prevent possible damage . It is also crucial that no treatment takes place on physical areas with any suspected cancer cells or tumors present . Pregnant women should not use this treatment .

Proponents of alternative treatments argue that medical research has validated many of these types of treatments ( a 2004 examination of the research showed that one-third of all alternative treatments have some type of published support ) , while opponents say much of this research is flawed , and that alternative treatments offer desperate patients false hope . <p> Typifying this concern is the number of cancer patients who turn to alternative therapies in search of a cure .

Here 's what you need to know about cupping therapy . <p> What is Cupping Therapy ? <p> Cupping therapy involves the placement of cups on the skin with the goal of creating suction . The cups used during treatment are usually made from such materials as glass , bamboo , or earthenware . <p> Proponents of cupping therapy argue that the suction the cups create helps to mobilize blood flow throughout the treated areas , which promotes healing . The practice of cupping therapy dates back to ancient cultures located in the Middle East , China , and Egypt .

The effect of the suction is to raise the skin , which begins to redden due to an expansion of blood vessels . Once the cup has been moved into position , it is generally left in place for 10 minutes . <p> In wet cupping , the cup is left in position for only about three minutes prior to removal . Once the cup has been removed , the practitioner will make several small cuts to the treated area . The practitioner will then repeat the suction process to remove small amounts of blood .

They exist in CD players , DVD players , fiber optics , and amplifiers and loudspeakers and are used prominently in medicine " LASIK surgery and laser fat removal , for instance " but there was a lot of work that went into the development of lasers to make them such a ubiquitous element of everyday life . Let 's take a brief look at the history of lasers . <p> Max Planckx <p> While he did n't come up with lasers himself , Max Planck developed the backbone of quantum theory that would eventually lead to the creation of the first laser . Planck worked in thermodynamics and was particularly interested in radiation that absorbed all wavelengths of light . <p> In 1900 , Planck published a work that described the relationship between radiation frequency and energy . He deduced that energy could only be absorbed or emitted in separate chunks , which he dubbed quanta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einstein <p> Based on Planck 's work , Einstein released his paper about the photoelectric effect in 1905 . The photoelectric effect proposed that light also delivers its energy in chunks or clusters . He called these discrete particles photons . <p> In 1917 , Einstein proposed stimulated emission , the process that would eventually make the laser and cold laser possible . Stimulated emission basically proposed that electrons could emit light of a particular wavelength . <p> Charles Townes and the Maser <p> In 1951 , Charles Townes conceived the idea of the maser ( microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) . Three years later , with help from Arthur Schawlow , Charles Townes invented a functioning maser that used ammonia gas and microwave radiation . The maser radiated at a wavelength of 1 cm and generated about 10 nanowatts of power . <p> In 1959 , Townes and Schawlow received a patent for the maser . Eventually , the maser was used as an ultrasensitive detector in space research and to amplify radio signals . <p> The maser was the first device that , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplify electromagnetic waves .

Even the mummified ancients were discovered to have crude metal bands wrapped around individual teeth . But many of us do not have ideal teeth to give that smile . Thanks to the great history , presence and future of Orthodontics that has been a hope of millions with crooked teeth . <p> Today , people can choose from common metal orthodontics to less observable braces or the ceramic braces that are transparent . But from where the journey of orthodontia started ? Let 's understand with the help of a remarkable Timeline created by Mint Dental in Anchorage , Alaska . <p> Here is the summary in time line : <h> Early 1700 <h> Discoveries in Dental Braces through the years <p> This will show the history of Orthodontics braces starting from around 1700 along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orthodontics truly began developing in the 17th , 18th , and 19th centuries . In 1728 , French dentist Pierre Fauchard , who took modernized orthodontics , published a book entitled " The Surgeon Dentist " on methods of straightening teeth . <h> 1789 <h> George Washingtons Teeth <p> In 1789 , when George Washington was inaugurated as President of the US , he had only one original tooth remaining , and the rest were made up of dentures . He was plagued by infections , abscesses and gum disease . The simplest things like eating and talking caused him a lot of discomfort and pain . He had a complete set of dentures made in 1798 , the year before he died . <h> 1800 <h> Orthodontics in 19th Century <p> In 1819 , Delabarre introduced the wire crib , which marked the birth of contemporary orthodontics , and gum elastics were first employed by Maynard in 1843 . Tucker was the first to cut rubber bands from rubber tubing in 1850 . And in the late 1800s , Eugene Solomon Talbot was the first person to use X-rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century <p> The very first set of braces in the early 1900 's was actually made out of gold pieces wrapped completely around each tooth , and the adjustments made with a 14 to 18 karat gold wire . <h> 1950 <h> The First Metal Mouths <p> Around this time , stainless steel became widely available , but using it for braces was considered somewhat controversial . It was n't generally accepted as a material for orthodontic treatment until the late 1950s/early 1960s ! <h> 1970 <h> Advancements in the 1970s <p> Around this time , the self-ligating bracket also appeared on the scene . Self-ligating brackets do n't  need tie wires or elastic ligatures to hold the arch wire onto the bracket they are held on by a " trap door " built into each bracket . <h> 2000 <h> Modern Dental Braces <p> Modern dental braces are manufactured from a wide variety of materials , and many , in additional to serving the functional reasons for wearing them , are quite pleasing in appearance <h> 2010 <h> Parts of Braces <p> Braces have four basic parts : Brackets made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each tooth . Bonding material ( glue ) or a metal band . This is what attaches the bracket to the tooth . An Arch Wire , which is a thin metal wire that runs from bracket to bracket and puts pressure on the teeth . The Ligature Elastic ( also called an " o-ring " ) . This is a small colored elastic that holds the bracket onto the arch wire . <h> 2011 <h> How do Braces Work ? <p> The braces need to stay on teeth for about 24 months , during which , they apply continuous force on the teeth which makes the teeth move . For this , teeth need to be temporarily loosened , so that the tissues surrounding the particular teeth are stretched into the loosened socket . Once the tooth starts moving into the loosened socket and falls in place eventually , the bone of the tooth will fill around it in the new position and solidify it in that position . <h> 2012 <h> Dental Braces Fitting Procedure <p> Dental braces are fitted by a dentist or orthodontist .

After it is finalized that braces are the best option , treatment can be started as soon as there are enough permanent or adult teeth available .

A gummy smile occurs when the gums occupy a larger area of the teeth than desired . The result is the visible presence of the gums while a person smiles . There is no medical danger posed by a gummy smile although it does cause self-esteem issues in some people .

These procedures are purely cosmetic and sometimes have to be repeated if the periodontal tissue starts to grow back . There are three primary ways to change the gum line . <h> Surgery <p> The simplest way to change the shape and appearance of the gum line is through surgery .

The process is usually painless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gums do not require sutures after the procedure .

The laser is used to vaporize the periodontal tissue in progressive layers . The process can take some time . Certain lasers actually prevent any bleeding during the procedure . The tooth that is revealed when the gum tissue is removed is frequently sculpted by the laser in order to create a consistent texture and color across the entire tooth . Recovery time is anywhere from one week to two weeks . <h> Radiosurgery <p> The use of radiosurgery for gum reduction stems from older procedures where radio waves were used to eliminate pockets of bacteria that caused gum disease .

This is to ensure that it is alright to tamper with the mole , and to prevent any problems from occurring . <p> How It Works <p> The idea is to kill the living cells inside the mole by using slightly corrosive chemicals , which will then cause the mole to peel off in due time .

Do this once a day on a daily basis . <p> Safety Measures <p> Get a doctor to examine the mole first before you do anything , because the mole may be dangerous to tamper with . <p> Always have some petroleum jelly or Vaseline ready to prevent the corrosive chemicals from damaging the unaffected skin .

Have you ever felt bad for a friend or relative who needed glasses on a daily basis to function normally ? Well , imagine that you two switched bodies . How much of a pain would it be to go from perfect vision to not being able to see straight every second of your life ? Its a huge hassle . Unfortunately , we cant always prevent our vision from deteriorating . What we can do is arm ourselves with the knowledge to combat worsening vision . If you 're curious about what variables affect eyesight , the following are some of the biggest ones . <p> &gt; Genetics <p> Our genes play a role in every aspect of our physical being . From height and hair color to muscular development potential and eyesight , the genes we inherited from our parents will always make a difference . Sadly , some of us receive " bad " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase our likelihood of developing physical or mental problems such as poor vision . When it comes to genetics , there is n't really anything that we can do about them . You cant change your genes because you were born with them . The unlucky ones are in real danger of developing eye disorders such as glaucoma , cataracts , diabetic retinopathy , and macular degeneration sometime in their lifetimes . The only way to predict your chances of getting eye problems is to have your familys medical history checked . The diseases that you have had or currently have may also increase your risk of losing eyesight partially or completely . <p> &gt; Age <p> Age is another factor that affects many different aspects of the body . In general , everything worsens as we age after hitting adulthood . After reaching our mid-twenties , our organs begin to deteriorate over time causing disease and dysfunction . Declining eyesight is considered to be a normal process that occurs as time passes .

Other age-related problems may arise including loss of focus-ability , nearsightedness , and farsightedness . <p> &gt; Stress <p> They say that stress causes all kinds of health problems in the body , and eyesight is no exception . There are a few major stressors that can cause temporary declines in vision : tiredness , muscular tension , and boosts in adrenaline . Fatigue causes a decline in all bodily functions . Being too tired can make your eyes blurry . Tired eye muscles can cause a similar effect . Increases in adrenaline can create multiple types of vision distortions from simple blurriness to tunnel vision and even visual hallucinations . <p> &gt; Diet <p> The things we eat are considered to be the number one determinant of overall health . Nothing has as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain good health , we must obtain all of the necessary nutrients from our food .

Diabetes is one of the diseases that can have completely destructive consequences on eyesight , and its usually linked to obesity .

Some of the worst techniques have gone out of style for their heinousness , but others , it is suspected , continue to be used , especially by secret government agencies . The five most effective techniques for inflicting terror on a weakened mind are mentioned below , along with a brief description of the ways in which they were or are effectively employed . <p> Sleep Deprivation <p> Depriving someone of sleep for long periods of time is one of the worst offenders . This can be done in a number of ways . Particularly twisted minds may wish to play loud music so that individuals cant fall into a state of full repose .

Though the water itself is not injurious , the repetition of the drops becomes a relentless force , which causes the mind to wander and fall in on itself . <p> Shaming <p> Public shaming is a special kind of manipulation . Individuals might , for example , be photographed naked without their knowledge . These photographs are then passed around to other members of the community , who can gaze upon the private areas of the victims .

Lack of human contact , in fact , has been shown time and time again to bring on depression and anxiety in previously well-adjusted individuals . <p> Specific Phobias <p> When torturers know their victims , they might be able to devise specific horrific experiments that are designed to play on certain phobias .

@@42978319 @2978319/ 24417 @qwx434417 <h> Common Diet Pill Side Effects and How to Handle Them <h> Common diet pill side effects and How to Handle Them <p> One of the things that keeps many people from trying a diet pill is fear of dangerous side effects . There are a great variety of diet pills that work without causing adverse reactions , but the fear is well-founded as many do not . <p> The following is a list of a few diet pill side effects that are commonly observed , and suggestions on how to avoid them . <h> 1 . Tremors , Jitters , and General Anxiousness <p> One of the most well-known side effects of diet pills is a general feeling of anxiousness , accompanied by tremors or the jitters . This is often due to the inclusion of ingredients like caffeine or synephrine , which stimulate the central nervous system and speed up natural processes in the body . <p> When this occurs , it can lead to increased fat burning and a higher metabolic rate , but it also causes your pulse to race and your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a stimulant can eventually lead to serious complications . <p> What to Do : Caffeine and other stimulants like green tea can be an important part of an effective diet pill , but should be included in moderation . While 400mg of caffeine is needed to be effective , avoid diet pills that include more than 500 or 600mg of caffeine , as these can trigger muscle tremors and headache beyond the normal consequences . <h> 2 . Nausea and Upset Stomach <p> Abdominal pain and nausea are also linked to stimulants in diet pills , though it is more difficult to trace their origin . They too can be triggered by excess caffeine , but are also caused by fat blockers that stop the absorption of fat into the body . <p> Caffeine leads to tremors and headaches , which can trigger stomach pains , while fat blockers actually work in the intestinal tract . Fat blockers are effective at stopping up to one quarter of fat content from being stored as adipose tissue by flushing it as waste , but this can also cause bloating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are prone to nausea , avoid products that contain strong stimulants like synephrine or bitter orange . Also avoid fat blockers like huar gum and chitosan . Do look for ingredients like ginger root , which has been shown to mitigate some of the adverse side effects of nausea-inducing stimulants and fat blockers . Or you can try a fat burner like African mango , which does n't rely on stimulating the central nervous system and has been used successfully without side effects . <h> 3 . Loss of Bowel Control <p> While we 're on the topic of fat blockers , let 's discuss some of their more well-known side effects . You may recall the weight loss supplement Alli , which is a diluted form of the fat blocker orlistat . This diet pill was all the rage when it first debuted because of its approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , but it was soon discovered to cause embarrassing side effects like anal leakage , flatulence , and diarrhea . <p> This is because as fat blockers flush fat as waste , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intestinal tract to produce more waste , which results in runny bowel movements that move quickly through the digestive system . <p> What to Do : If you 're concerned about rectal side effects , avoid products that work only as a fat blocker . Look for more well-rounded diet pills that contain ingredients like fiber , which regulates the digestive system , and ginger root , which has been known to soothe upset stomach and diminish the gastric effects of other ingredients . <h> 4 . Restlessness and Insomnia <p> Finally , some diet pills are known to interfere with your sleep cycle , which can actually lead to weight gain in the long run . Again , stimulants are the culprit . By triggering faster reactions in the body , your system is in overdrive and it can be difficult to settle yourself back down again . <p> This leads to sleepless nights , which can activate hunger-controlling hormones that stimulate your appetite . Over time , this sets the stage for overeating and increased weight gain . <p> What to Do : If you are extremely stimulant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't include ingredients like caffeine , green tea , or bitter orange . Or , if you do , look for one that directs you to take it in the mornings or afternoons . Never take a stimulant-reliant pill before bedtime . <h> How to Pick the Right Pill <p> The best way to find the right diet pill for you is to assess your needs and personal constitution . If you react strongly to other medications , you may want to find a gentler diet pill that focuses on things like appetite suppression or includes non-stimulating ingredients . <p> You also want to be cautious of popular supplements whose credit relies on heavy marketing . Alli , as you now know , is associated with a wide array of side effects . Hydroxycut is another weight loss lineup that has been linked to quite a few side effects . Make sure to read more about Hydroxycut Advanced , their latest product , before assuming it is safe . <p> In general , research will be your greatest ally in the search for a good diet pill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of work to find the right one for you . <h> Navigation 24418 @qwx434418 24416 @qwx434416 24419 @qwx434419

Highly accurate and easy to use , these meters are ideally suited to the needs of patients with mild to moderate diabetes symptoms and blood sugar fluctuations .

@@42978321 @2978321/ 24417 @qwx434417 <p> Every year in America , there are millions of automobile accidents that occur in the streets of every city across the country . Many of these are minor fender benders , and even those that are n't  are usually easily handled outside of the court system . Unfortunately , drinking and driving increases the likelihood of being involved in a car accident , and when an intoxicated driver causes a collision , there 's no doubt that they 're scared . This leads some to leave the scene of the accident that they were involved in , but its important to know that this action could result in much harsher consequences than those that wouldve been faced by simply staying at the scene . <p> Statistics Related to DUI Hit-and-Run <p> Alcohol related accidents are a huge problem in American society . It turns out that about one-third of all motor vehicle related deaths are directly attributable to alcohol use . Its hard to say , however , exactly how many occurrences of hit-and-run are alcohol related . This is because not all hit-and-run cases are solved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're even less likely to know whether the offender was drunk or not . <p> Its important to note , however , that around 11 percent of all crashes reported to the police involve a hit-and-run . Even more disheartening is the fact that these accidents result in around 1,500 deaths every year . The mindset of those who run is often focused on staying out of trouble . This could include those who have never been in trouble before or those who face serious consequences due to prior records . Regardless of the situation , leaving the scene is guaranteed to only make things worse . <p> Consequences of Leaving <p> There are an abundance of consequences related to hit-and-run accidents . These consequences can vary considerably dependent on the accident itself . A Pennsylvanian woman , for instance , was just recently charged with eight counts of reckless endangerment , failing to stop and render aid , five counts of DUI aggravated assault with a vehicle and many other charges . This was in relation to her sideswiping five men on a highway and fleeing . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the DUI charge have exacerbated her charges . <p> Drunk driving is usually only punished as a misdemeanor . This is true even in many cases where a minor accident occurs . In several areas of the country , however , hit-and-runs in and of themselves are considered felonies . This means that by leaving the scene of an accident , a person can change a misdemeanor into a felony which is punishable by over a year in prison . The consequences of hit-and-run become even worse , of course , if someone is seriously injured or killed during the accident . <p> Staying out of Jail <p> As can be seen by the varying possible consequences of leaving the scene of an accident , there are numerous punishments that may be handed down by the court . This is also true for those who await the arrival of police officers , but these consequences will be much less severe . In fact , there are some instances where a person may receive no jail time whatsoever and just have a mark on their record with probation and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the window when a person is found guilty of a hit-and-run . The most important thing a person can do to stay out of jail after being involved in an alcohol related accident is wait for the police and then hire an attorney . <p> Even without a death involved , some people may believe that they have nothing to lose by leaving if an accident is severe enough , but this simply is n't true . As related by Steven Kellis a Philadelphia DUI lawyer , " Laws require judges to sentence those convicted of DUI Manslaughter to harsh sentences . " A lawyer can potentially provide several defenses to prevent a conviction , even of the most detrimental of charges ( ie. vehicular manslaughter ) . These defenses could include showing that the other driver was at fault for the accident or that improper testing methods were used to obtain a blood alcohol content reading . When a person leaves the scene of an accident , the jury automatically thinks worse of them . The important thing to remember is that an attorneys job becomes much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when under the influence of alcohol will likely bring some negative consequences , but for those who choose to flee the scene of the accident , their life can be permanently , irreparably changed . The simple truth is that the consequences of a hit-and-run , even for those who are n't  intoxicated , are going to be far worse than the initial repercussions the person wouldve faced . Since attorneys can fight alcohol related charges much easier than those related to fleeing the scene of an accident , waiting for law enforcement to arrive will probably be the smartest thing an intoxicated driver has done all day . <p> A former news writer , Ann Bailey shares these consequential facts for DUI drivers involved in vehicle accidents .
