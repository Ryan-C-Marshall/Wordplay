Our goal was a premium spinner with an innovative design . In yo-yos , we invented a new type of axle system called Side Effects which allows for easy modification . We wanted to bring the same thing to a spinner . <p> We started with a tri-spinner ( three legs ) . The Trillium consists of two titanium body parts that " capture " the bearing which is retained axially rather than radially like most spinners ( either by a press fit or glue ) , and every Trillium ships with the famous One Drop 10Ball Stainless Steel Bearing that we have used in our yo-yos for over ten years . The benefit of the captured-bearing system is that the bearing is easy to remove and suffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , this design results in a very smooth spinner performance no matter how many times it is taken apart and reassembled.Since the body consists of two pieces , they need to be fastened together and we decided to make the fasteners do double duty as the weights . This is cool because they are really easy to change out and this is where we achieved our goal of easy modification . When you purchase a Trillium , it will come with titanium 610 size weights installed , plus an additional set of brass 720 size weights . Right out of the box , you will be able to swap between these two weight sets and the difference in feel is so significant , it 's like getting two different spinners . In the future , we will be releasing weights sets in different sizes , shapes , and materials . <p> The final piece is the buttons for gripping the spinner . The Trillium ships with titanium buttons engraved with the One Drop logo . The buttons feature a recess which allows for improved finger grip , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which provide dampening and a soft grippy feel . The extra grip provided by the silicone pads makes it perfect for table spins , as the Trillium will stay put . If you prefer to leave the silicone pads out , the recess is the perfect size to take in some of the pad of your fingers and the engraved logo also provides extra grip . It 's personal preference which you will like better and the choice is yours to make . In the future , we will also offer buttons in different materials .

" <p> We have been so blessed to make yo-yos for the last ten years . A big part of that blessing is the friends we have made and continue to make everyday . The story of the Parlay started ten years ago at the US National Yo-Yo Contest when we stumbled upon a bunch of rad yo-yoers from Utah after a night of frolicking in the streets . This was a different time when yo-yos were smaller , had more vibe , were just starting to be unresponsive out of the box , and we ( all of us in the community ) were all in the process of creating the craft of modern yo-yo design , building and playing . Much has been learned and the amazing yo-yos available today reflect this journey . <p> We met Aaron Day of Static Co. back then and have remained good friends . Aaron was visiting us recently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it did because this is all about friends and yo-yoing . <p> There is a certain nostalgia that yo-yoers who played in the mid-2000s have for those " imperfect " yo-yos of the time . The idea that Static brought to the table was to create a yo-yo that seems and feels like it was released in that era but to add the modern touches and luxuries . The Parlay is smooth as you would expect these days . It has Side Effects if you ever feel the urge to add some freshness to it . It has everything we have learned about making yo-yos in it . But you 'll feel like you just got it at the 2007 US National Yo-Yo Contest . <p> Here is how Static describes their journey as a yo-yo company that has led to this release . Hopefully they will be able to parlay this collaboration into bringing more of their vision to our community . <p> " When we decided to make yoyos , we really did n't  know what we were doing . We mentally mashed some yoyo designs together during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shop in China . They did their thing , and a few weeks later , we had a box full of yoyos . <p> We found that this method of manufacturing did n't  really suit us . The story of the SGNL , from the time that we signed off on the third prototype of it , to the moment that it was delivered , is a blank to us . This experience made us realize that we very much wanted to be involved in every step of the production of our yoyos going forward . We wanted a process that would allow for more input from us , more thought on our part , more effort . Something that required us to be present . In other words , we wanted to feel like we had actually given of ourselves in order to add to something that we care about . <p> We had planned to move production to One Drop for a few reasons : 1 . They 're our homies. 2 . They make the best yoyos in the world . 3 . These dudes live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level . <p> So , last summer when I visited them , I approached them about producing our next model . They countered with the proposal to collaborate on a design . We did n't  think twice about accepting . <p> Meet the Parlay . <p> Designed over a decade , executed in a day . <p> You might recognize some strategically placed elements from some legendary One Drop yoyos from the past ( and maybe the present , for that matter ) in its design . That 's probably not a mistake . The Parlay features the now signature One Drop response bump , though the area around the bump is sunken into the yoyo , effectively creating the Response Moat . This gives you the classic high wall feeling that will whip your ass into shape , but also gives you increased spin time by reducing string friction . Some players may balk at the weight of the Parlay , shipping at less than 62g with Flat Caps . Do n't  go by the numbers though , man , go by the feeling . Despite its light weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It even has quite a bit of heft , thanks to the masterful touch of the most talented machinist in the industry . <p> The Parlay is a collaboration in the sincerest sense of that term . Much thought and much love , among other things , went into its design . We had such a great time teaming up with One Drop to create this yo-yo . The result is unlike anything out right now and we truly hope you will enjoy it . "

The result was a small city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is $85 for solid colors making this the first Side Effect yoyo at this price .

Unlike the Vanguard , it is big , wide and organic . Early feedback at contests has been really positive . <p> The Gauntlet features a full-bodied organic catch zone that starts with a nice bump coming out of the guts . The rims taper off elegantly giving it a satisfying feel in the hand . It is stable and long spinning with plenty of speed . <p> We are constantly pushing ourselves to achieve our mission for the better of the players . The Gauntlet has been thrown . 
@@45256761 @5256761/ <h> Citizen 58519 @qwx468519 <p> In 2010 we released our first titanium yo-yo , the Sovereign . Five years later we have tackled this amazing metal and produced a yo-yo that we feel is our best work to date : The Citizen . <p> A lot has changed in these 5 years . Yo-yos tend to be bigger than they used to be and high walls have gone by the wayside . As an industry and as a community we have all figured out what shapes , weights and weight distributions work better . As a yo-yo manufacturer we have improved our knowledge , skills and equipment an immense amount . All of these improvements played a role in the creation of the Citizen . <p> Titanium allowed us to take this shape and create a weight distribution simply not possible in aluminum ; moving material to the rim while reducing overall weight . This gives it a light airy feel with incredibly long spin times . <p> Each Citizen was made with many hours of labor , love , and attention right here in-house in Eugene , Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , measured and scrutinized . Every half was hand polished . They have been checked , and re-checked . We could not have put more effort into assuring these were the most amazing yo-yos we could possibly make . There are one hundred and seventeen numbered Citizens in this run ( there will not be another run )
