It requires that each shipment of rough diamonds - before stones are cut and polished - be in a tamper-resistant container and accompanied by a government-validated certificate . Each certificate is uniquely numbered and contains data describing the shipment 's contents . <p> Participating countries have pledged to turn back or impound shipments of rough diamonds from any nation that fails to subscribe to the KPCS standards .

All diamonds and diamond jewelry merchandise that we buy that is derived from rough diamonds must be accompanied by a warranty from the supplier .
