@@45271527 @5271527/ <h> Going to the Beach Like a Local <p> As spring settles in and the temperature starts to rise , our minds begin to daydream about going to the beach . One great thing about Miami is , we have some of the most beautiful beaches in the world , and its not just me who thinks so . In 2012 , the travel website , TripAdvisor , ranked Miami Beach " 2nd Best Beach Destination in the United States " . However , going to the beach in Miami is a little different than other places . Allow me to answer some frequently asked questions to help make your vacation planning easier . <p> 13 Questions and Answers About Going To The Beach <p> 1 . What is the best time to visit ? The best time to visit Miami is June and July , when the wintertime crowds have gone home and the summer storms have yet to arrive . If your motivation to visit is going to the beach , April and May are beautiful months to visit , but you 'll need to begin your hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when most of the big festivals take place . <p> 2 . Is the water warm enough to swim all year ? This is a subjective question . I grew up in Southern California and the coldest water temps in Miami are still warmer than the hottest days on the West Coast . I 'm comfortable getting in the water all year , but I wear a light wetsuit top in the winter . Generally , I 've found visitors from cold climates are comfortable to swim all year round . Locals and visitors from warmer climate countries do n't  go in the water until late April . If you own a wetsuit top , bring it in the winter and spring . <p> 3 . What is the best time of day to go ? The best time to go to the beach is between 10am and 12pm . The later you go , the more crowded it gets and the harder it is to park your car . If you visit in the summer and fall , keep in mind , afternoon rain storms are fairly common in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to go to the beach early , and leave the afternoon free to relax and explore the neighborhood . For me , 2 hours is plenty of time to spend at the beach . Any longer and you run the risk of burning out and spoiling the night . If you 're staying nearby , I do suggest , however , going back to the beach around 6pm for a swim to refresh your senses . <p> 4 . What beach should I go to ? This depends on where you are staying . If you are in Miami Beach , just walk east to the beach and look for a good spot on the sand . The least crowded area is between 3rd and 4th Street . The area between 13th and 15th Street is another less crowded section of the beach , and a good spot to lay out . <p> Haulover : At 10800 Collins Avenue is the only clothing-optional beach in the area . This is also a good beach in Miami for surfing as it gets bigger waves during hurricane season . Another plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has coarser grain sand . <p> Key Biscayne : Crandon Park and Bill Baggs Recreation Area have beautiful beaches . The picnic areas are popular with local families on the weekends , but the beaches themselves feel less crowded than Miami Beach . <p> 5 . Where should I park my car ? Parking in Miami Beach can be difficult , depending on the time of day and the day of the week . It is easiest to find parking on weekdays , with free parking available on the residential streets , west of Washington Avenue . On the weekends , your best option is to find a parking lot , or a parking meter near the beach . 4th Street is a good area to find metered parking , and a good street to access the beach . Parking Map <p> Haulover Beach and Key Biscayne have plenty of parking . <p> 6 . What should I bring to the beach ? Most likely , you 'll be walking 5 or 6 blocks to get to the beach . Therefore , packing lightly is recommend . Bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring is up to you . Do n't  forget a towel , sunglasses , water , good sunscreen , something to read , and a change of clothes . It can also be fun to bring a large bed sheet with you to lay on in the sand . <p> 7 . What should I wear ? Your clothes should be lightweight and functional . Wear comfortable shoes for walking in the sand . Bring a change of clothes . As far as a bathing suit fashion goes , its your decision what to wear . <p> 8 . Is topless sunbathing permitted ? In South Beach , its fairly common to see women sunbathing topless . Nude sunbathing is allowed on the north end of Haulover Beach . <p> 9 . Are beach chairs available for rent ? Beach chairs and umbrellas are available for rent in Miami Beach .

I was wondering , do any of the beaches in North County close at night ? I remember most of the ones around San Diego were 24-7 . Miami is a little different compared to the west coast in that department , since you 're not supposed to be on the beach between 12 and 5 am in South Beach . The police used to turn a blind eye to it , but no more . Especially if you 're not there with a girlfriend . <p> Thanks , Doug . This was a fun article to write . In North County , the larger beach parking lots close at sundown , but I think you can walk on the beach all night . <p> Posted on 04/07/2012 at 12:57 PM <p> Priscila says : <p> I always enjoy reading this article an Im also slightly bias of the photos hehe .

These vibrantly colored buildings represent an era when Miami was heavily promoted and developed as a " tropical playground . " The Art Deco District was one of the earliest National Register listings to recognize the importance of the architecture of this period <p> Vernacular Style : 1900-1930 's Vernacular is not a style , but rather a common method of early construction in South Florida . The materials and forms encompassed wood frame and masonry construction . These materials and methods were transferred from abroad with the Beach 's early settlers . Through time , many of these structures were replaced . <p> Wood Frame construction was most evident in the earliest days of Ocean Beach and reflected a secluded resort-like character . <p> Noted for stark simplicity , vernacular structures are usually rectilinear in form with little or no elaboration . Functional elements supply the only elaboration or decoration except that occasionally modest Classical elements were referenced such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel at 112 Ocean Drive , built in 1915 . Most are one and two stories in height with flat , gable or hipped roof and a single story porch extending across the front . <p> Bungalow Style : 1910 's - 1930 's Bungalows were a popular in Ocean Beach from the earliest development years through the 1930s . Many of these simple structures may have been constructed from mail order house plans gotten from catalogues , but others were designed by local architects as distinguished as V. H. Nellenbogen . <p> Typically , bungalows were of wood frame construction , one to one and a half stories in height , with gable roofs , overhanging eaves , front porches , and large wood sash windows . They afforded good cross ventilation , a shaded outdoor area , and adapted well to South Florida coastal conditions , generally being elevated two to three feet above grade on foundation walls or masonry piers . <p> Mediterranean Revival Style : 1910 's - 1930 's Mediterranean Revival architecture was the " style of choice " for the first major boom period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture , combining expressions of Italian , Moorish , North African and Southern Spanish themes , was found to be an appropriate and commercially appealing image for the new Floridian seaside resort . <p> Mediterranean Revival - Art Deco Transitional : 1920 's - 1930 's " Med-Deco " in Ocean Beach was a synthesis of Mediterranean Revival form and A Art Deco decorative detail . This unique hybrid style became a fascinating bridge between the " familiar " and the " new " as the allure of Art Deco found its way into the Beach 's architectural vocabulary . Clean ziggurat roof lines and crisp geometric detailing replaced scrolled parapets , bracketed cornices and Classical features on structures of clear Mediterranean Revival form . Likewise , sloped barrel tile roofs rested gracefully on edifices with spectacular Art Deco entrances and facade treatments . <p> Some of the most celebrated architects in Miami Beach designed structures in this brief-lived style , including V. H. Nellenbogen , Henry Hohauser and T. Hunter Henderson . The predominant exterior material of Med-Deco was smooth stucco with raised o r incised details . Featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either natural or filled and colored , was frequently used to define special elements . Windows ranged from wood and steel casement to wood double hung . <p> Art Deco Style : late 1920 's - 1930 's Art Deco is considered one of the first twentieth century architectural styles in America to break with traditional revival forms . It emanated largely from the impact of the 1925 Paris Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes , a design fair celebrating the reconciliation between the decorative arts and advancements in technology and industry . <p> In Ocean Beach a unique form of Art Deco employed nautical themes as well as tropical floral and fauna motifs . Ocean liners , palm trees , and flamingos graced the exteriors and interiors of the new local architecture . The favored materials for executing this distinctive " art " decor included bas-relief stucco , keystone , etched glass , a variety of metals , cast concrete , patterned terrazzo , and others .

The " streamlined " character of automobiles , airplanes , trains , buses , liners and even home appliances inspired powerful horizontal design compositions , accentuated by striking vertical features and punctuated by icons of the technological era . Continuous " eyebrows " , racing stripe banding , radio tower-like spires , portholes , and deck railings like those found on grand ocean liners , were among the unique features to set this architecture apart from anything before it . The creative incorporation of nautical themes showed this form of Art Deco to be true to its origins in Miami Beach . <p> Smooth , rounded corners often replaced sharp ones on Moderne buildings , especially on corner lots . " Eyebrows " swept around them as did other details . Street corners became inviting architectural focal points , whether the special treatment employed was based upon curves or angles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 Post War Deco drew significantly from the form and decorative vocabulary of both early Art Deco in Miami Beach and Moderne . Although single block massing was predominant the emphasis could be placed on either horizontal or vertical composition , dependent upon the size of the structure , the character of the site , and the will of the architect . Frequently , continuous us of eyebrows would be extended to form side or front canopies , either cantilevered or supported on their furthest edge by columns . New decorative materials were introduced which reflected changing tastes nationally , including brick , permastone , and cast architectural block in a variety of " open " patterns . Many of these delightful structures in Ocean Beach paid wonderful tribute to their architectural origins while effectively addressing changing times . <p> Post World War II Modern Style - Post War Modern : 1965 The Post War Modern style in Miami Beach exhibited many elements of its companion style of the period , Post War Deco , but clearly established a path of its own in terms of modern functional simplicity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridors to " open air " verandas on one side or more . Overhanging roof plates and projecting floor slabs became typical of the new " style " along with paired or clustered pipe columns to support them . Symmetrical staircases became significant exterior design features . <p> Eclectic : 1920 's - 1950'sEclectic architecture in Miami Beach includes buildings which adopt the style(s) of another time and/or another place selected by the architect , at will , for a purpose . Henry Hohauser 's fanciful English Tudor style cottage located at 321 Collins Avenue is an amazing example of Eclectic architecture in Miami Beach . Its sharp gable roofs , half-frame ( exposed ) timbers , and Gothic window lintel details are clearly not a part of the natural architectural progression on the Beach , but yet they command the desired attention and assure a special place . <p> Garden Style : 1940 's - 1960'sThe primary defining characteristic of the Garden Style in Miami Beach is that the entryway and public walkways are placed on the exterior , where they are open to the natural elements and surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to an open symmetrical staircase , ascending to the upper level(s) , and behind it the courtyard . The plan is " U " shape and basically consists of two identical two to three story buildings facing onto a shared central garden/courtyard , often with a fountain in the center , and joined at the rear . Visually and structurally the buildings are united by a grand low pitched gable roof ( typically ) extending like gull wings across the front and over the open central entryway . The roof plate usually overhangs open walkways below and may be conclude in a rounded eave characteristic of late 1950s modern architecture in Miami Beach . <p> Architectural ornamentation is generally modest and minimal in the Garden Style , normally consisting of cantilevered balconies with ornamental pierced block railings , and sometimes exuberantly detailed wrought iron rails on stairs and along open walkways . In providing a large central open entry and situating the apartment units facing inward on a common garden area , this important modern building style in Ocean Beach provides a sense of community facilitating greater social interaction and security or its occupants . 
@@45271547 @5271547/ <h> How to Sneak Alcohol onto a Cruise Ship <p> Cruises are the ultimate American vacation : Eat grotesque amounts of food , watch overdone entertainment , and drink ungodly amounts of alcohol for no reason other than you 're out on the water . And while those first two are generally included in that $199 you threw down for an inside cabin , triple occupancy , that last one most certainly is not . So if you drink with the same voraciousness you eat , your liquor bill will end up being more than your cruise fare . <p> What does a cash-strapped , alcohol starved American do ? Much like you would in an overpriced club , sneak your own stuff in . But it 's not as simple as just throwing a bottle of Skol in your suitcase . The cruise lines are on to you , so here well show you some methods for getting booze on the boat and how effective they really are . <p> The Mouthwash BottleWhat you do : Buy a bottle of Listerine and a bottle of Scope . Empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown liquor and the Scope with clear , then add a couple drops of green food coloring . Or mix whiskey with a splash of Blue Gatorade . Re-seal the plastic with a warm lighter , then make sure to CHECK YOUR BAGS . This avoids X-ray machines and is worth the $5 tip to the bellman.Downside : Your drinks will all have a VERY distinct mint/antiseptic mouthwash flavor . Though a true liquor connoisseur probably is n't smuggling Blue Label on a cruise anyway . Effectiveness : Pretty Effective . Just makes for some nasty drinks . <p> The Wine BottlesWhat you do : The cruise allows you to carry on one bottle of wine per person . If you were n't hung up on having a nice Cabernet with your Flat Iron steak , you can buy a screw cap wine ( recorking is about as easy as trying to dribble a football ) , empty it , then fill it with clear booze and add the appropriate ( purple or yellow , or pink if you 're a freshmen girl ) food coloring . Security will pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you through.Downside : You 'll have to buy wine onboard if you want it . You 'll also have to buy wine bottles.Effectiveness : Very effective . This tip was actually given to me BY a security agent at PortMiami . <p> The CamelbackWhat you do : If you own one , take the rubber water pouch out of your Cambelback and fill it with alcohol . Again , make sure you check your bag.Downside : You may ruin your Camelback , or at the very least have rum-flavored water the next time you go on a hike . Also , it 's pretty easily openable so if security DOES decide to check you 're done.Effectiveness : Not Very Effective <p> The Water BottlesWhat you do : But liter-sized bottles of water . Empty them out and fill with your choice of select clear liquors . Then glue the caps back on to renew the seal . ( Alternately : Boil the tops of the bottles and slide the caps off , seal intact , then replace ) . The Downside : Security is on to this one , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . If it foams at all , they take it , since bottled water wo n't foam.Effectiveness : Not effective <p> The Case of WaterWhat you do : Take an unopened , plastic sealed case of bottled water , slide the bottles out WITHOUT OPENING THE PLASTIC , and fill all the interior bottles with clear liquor . This way if a bottle is grabbed from the outside , they 'll grab water and your case of Don Q gets on no problem.The Downside : They might slice open your case and check the middle bottles . In which case you 're done.Effectiveness : Not very effective . <p> The Rum Runner Flasks What you do : Hit a liquor store and buy these **31;44;TOOLONG plastic baggie flasks and fill them up , put them in your suitcase , and CHECK YOUR BAGS . Downside : If that box of #2 pencils you packed for Trivia night opens and hits one of these , all your clothes will smell like Jose Cuervo for the entire cruise AND you 'll be outta alcohol . Also , if your bag is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left your .22 in your suitcase , they 'll see these and take them.Effectiveness : Pretty Effective <p> The Secret CompartmentWhat you do : Fill up some water bottles with liquor and put them in a compartment under your main compartment . This can be done in any suitcase that has a cardboard liner at the bottom . Then put real water bottles on top of them as decoys.The downside : If you lack a secret compartment , this is a LOT of work . Also , there is a slim chance they see ALL the bottles and wonder why only 3 of the 6 are visible.Effectiveness : Fairly Effective <p> BACKUPS : <p> The Foreign Liquor Store PickupWhat you Do : While you 'll be stuck paying $7 a beer until you hit a port , once you do run to the first liquor store and pick up pint flasks in plastic bottles . Make sure they have plastic tops so as not to set off the metal detectors at re-entry to your cruise ship . They do n't pat you down , so wear a baggy shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking back on . The Smirnoff pint sized bottles work well for this . An added bonus : Often you can buy at a duty free store which is even cheaper than Walgreen 's back home.Downside : You ca n't get back a whole lot at once , so if you 're trying to stock up for a long cruise you may spend your entire day in Nassau smuggling . Not that that 's unusual.Effectiveness : Very effective . <p> The Onboard Duty-Free ( LAST NIGHT ONLY ) What you do : Typically you 'll be out of your smuggled Charcoal filtered deliciousness by the last night anyway , and a little known fact is that whatever you purchase at the onboard duty free can be claimed after about 6:30 p.m. on your last night of the cruise . So hit up the duty free , pick up a $15 bottle of Finalandia ( or 3 ) and save a ton of cash on your last night . And if you think you 'll blow through all your money playing Pai Gow before your cruise curtain-call , you can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end.Downside : It 's only good one night of the whole trip.Effectiveness : 100% effective .

Stalls sell pumpkin juice and delicious butterbeer and The Three Broomsticks pub is now a restaurant in case you are hungry enough to stop and eat . But for us , it was straight to the castle . <p> The Rides at Harry Potter <p> There are three major rides at Harry Potter all themed around the books . The first is the Dragon Challenge , a terrifying double rollercoaster that spins and curves , giving the effect that the two trains will crash into each other . Next is the Flight of the Hippogriff , a runaway train that weaves through pumpkin patches and around Hagrid 's house . But the most impressive is the Forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogwarts castle and the most popular of the three attractions . Even waiting in line is entertaining as you walk through the student greenhouse complete with mandrakes growing , Dumbledore 's office , and the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom where Harry , Ron and Hermione are practicing spells . The ride includes so many details from the books to the notable delight of all the people discovering them . My particular favorite is the portraits on the wall where the people really do talk and seeing the house point hour glasses . <p> The ride itself is a journey through the different stories of Harry Potter . Expect to be chased by a dragon , escape the Dementors , narrowly miss being hit by the whomping willow tree and lead your house to victory in the Quidditch Cup . At the end of the ride you feel exhilarated and in our case , thoroughly satisfied to have made the journey from Miami for that ride alone . <p> Is one day at Universal enough time to see everything ? <p> Most of you booking the round trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of vacation , so we understand time is precious . The bus does not come to collect you until 6:30pm so you have a full 7 hours to explore the park . The key is to plan ahead with a map and have an idea of where you are going and what you want to see . I managed to visit both Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios , even stopping for lunch in City Walk . I went on more rides than just at Harry Potter World , getting soaked on the Jurassic Park water ride , wearing 3D glasses on the Adventures of Shrek and was nearly swept away by the Twister . As we left to catch the bus home , you can only feel that it was a great day spent on a day trip from Miami . <p> It is easy to go as you are driven to and from Orlando on a fun day out .

@@45271558 @5271558/ <h> Where to Watch 4th of July Fireworks in Miami and Miami Beach <p> If you 're coming to Miami for the fourth of July , there are some things you ought a know . Like it 's gon na be uncomfortably hot . And it might rain . And those loud bangs you hear might not be fireworks , so watch your back . You might also want to know the best spots to watch our glorious fireworks displays , whether they 're over downtown , Miami Beach , or a residential lake in Kendall where the neighbors compete to see who can detonate the most illegal explosives . <p> Sadly , we can only help you with the first two . So here we present the top 5 places to catch the show this 4th of July . <p> This downtown public park is gon na be mobbed if you try and get there near sundown . And forget about parking . Your best bet is to park somewhere in Brickell or downtown and take the Metromover to the Bayside station and eat dinner somewhere there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spot to wait for the show . <p> The usually-exclusive bayside luxury hotel in South Beach opens its pool to the public on 4th of July , allowing for the best view of the bay 's fireworks over downtown along West Ave . It 's the only pool on the west side of the island open to the public , and has no cover plus a full menu of specially-grilled food for the Fourth and plenty of cold drinks . Definitely worth checking out if you want an awesome pool party before the big display . <p> The cool thing about Miami is that we have several large fireworks displays , giving you the opportunity to watch multiple shows at once . And to catch both the Beach and City fireworks , there 's no better place to watch than this locals bar on the 9th floor of the Venetia . You might find a comparable view in some luxury highrise , but at Mike 's you can relax outside on the expansive back patio , and the drink and food prices are extremely reasonable . <p> While most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good views of the Beach 's show , the only way to get a front row , over-the-water view is from Lummus Park between 5th and 14th on Ocean Drive . The park itself is behind some dunes from the actual beach , and while technically the beach is closed after dusk , on the 4th it 's not really enforced . Remember : Parking and traffic will be unbearable in the evening , so if you 're going to catch the fireworks here head out to the beach early and make a day out of it . And by early , I mean before noon . Those garages fill up quick . <p> Unless you want to drop a few hundred on dinner at Smith and Wollensky , South Pointe Park is the best place in Miami to catch all the fireworks . The high mound in the park 's center allows early-arrivers to get a skybox view of both the City and Beach fireworks shows .

No more cell phone pics for you . You 're finally going to get serious about taking better pictures . <p> Well , I 've got some good news and some bad news for you . <p> The good news is that the new digital cameras are greatly improved over the models from just a few years ago . <p> The bad news is that no matter how good or expensive the camera , it wo n't make you a good photographer . <p> But if you follow a few simple rules , you can take great vacation pictures that you 'll be proud to show your friends . <p> As I wander around South Beach , I have no trouble picking out the amateurs . <p> They usually walk along Ocean Drive and when they see something they want a picture of , theyll stop and point the camera at it , click once and then move on . <p> If you want your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro <p> When a pro sees a picture he wants to shoot hell take many pictures of the scene , shooting both horizontal and vertical pictures . He might move around the scene , composing the image carefully in the viewfinder , eliminating distracting background elements . If the camera has a zoom lens , hell use the zoom feature to compose and isolate elements of the picture . <p> For instance , using a zoom lens in the wide-angle mode will let you shoot a picture of an entire art deco landmark building on Ocean Drive . <p> Using the same lens in the telephoto mode let 's you isolate some of the more interesting features of the building such as a neon sign or etched glass door . <p> Another way to make your pictures look professional is to carefully choose the time of day you shoot <p> Many pros shoot early in the morning or late in the afternoon .

Waiting 15 or 20 minutes after sunset to shoot yields the best results . <p> Shoot earlier and the lights will be overpowered by the sunlight . If you wait until after dark you 'll get the lights but the sky will be too dark . Its still possible to get good pictures later at night , but a tripod is a must . Experiment for best results . <p> Some of my favorite places to shoot on South Beach are Ocean Drive , South Pointe Park and Lincoln Road <p> What follows are some of my favorite shots that Ive taken recently at these spots .

Here are shots of the detail I liked on two cars . <p> here 's a shot of one of my favorite hotels on Ocean Drive , the Breakwater . The day I shot this the hotel was in the midst of renovation so I focused on the distinctive signunchanged since the hotel was built . The Breakwater is famous for being used as the location for a Calvin Klein perfume ad in the mid-80s . <p> South Pointe Park offers great shots of the Port of Miami and the Miami skyline as well as a great shot of Miami Beach looking north .

With only one line running north and south through the city of Miami , the train runs from 5am " midnight 7 days a week servicing all 22 stops . The rail system does not go to many of the tourist hotspots and it does not run to the airport or South Beach . The trains offer free wifi and is used mainly by residents at the cost of $2 for a single journey . The Metrorail system does not accept cash . You must purchase an Easy Card to pay your fare before you travel . Metrorail route and schedule <p> Metromover The Metromover is a people mover system that runs above the streets of downtown Miami and Brickell . It is completely free to everyone and connects to some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arena , Bayside Marketplace , Miami-Dade College , and the James L. Knight Center . <p> The Metromover has no driver as it is an electric automatic system . As it is free , do not be surprised to be in a busy car with one or two homeless people amongst you . It is a great system to get around downtown quickly , but be sure to take your hand sanitizer with you in your bag . More Metromover info <p> Tri Rail The Tri Rail is a commuter rail service , servicing Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach . Like the Metrorail , it is only one line running north and south . You can reach it in Miami from the Tri Rail Metrorail station or by an express bus from Miami airport . <p> The Tri Rail stations are not easy or convenient to get to if you are here on vacation . They are not near the coast line so if you are trying to reach your beach hotel , it will not be the best option to use . A one way fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between $5 and $11.50 , depending on your final destination . Tri Rail information <p> The Easy Card and Easy Ticket Miami buses still accept cash as a form of payment but the Metrorail does not . An Easy Card looks like a credit card and is a pay as you go form of paying for your public transport . Buses and train stations all have fare boxes that you press the card up against and your fare is deducted from the value on your Easy Card . The cards are reloadable . <p> Tourists and visitors to Miami who will only be here for a short time can purchase the Easy Ticket . It works like the Easy Card but is made of paper and expires after 60 days . These cards can be purchased at any train station and in sales outlets throughout Miami , including LeAnn drugs on 9th and Washington in South Beach .

The Miami Dade Public Transport system is cheap and easy to use and is a great alternative to renting a car or taking cabs .

She can be found moderating the forum Miami Beach 411. <h> 45 Comments on <h> " How To Use Public Transport in Miami " <p> Jess , great review . I have been using a lot of public transport lately due to some car issues . One thing to keep in mind : you may end up adding a lot more time to your trip if you use buses and rail . It took me two hours to get to Broward from South Miami via Metrorail and Tri-Rail as opposed to the usual 40 minutes without traffic . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it all the time now on my iPhone . You can actually track the train in real time and schedules are published . Ditto for buses . This is a great bonus if you have a smart phone ! <p> I have found Miami-Dade Public transportation customer service folks to be really helpful in planning itineraries . When I have had to use a train/bus combo , I usually call ahead , even though Google publishes itineraries as well . But I like talking to a real person who can give me direct instructions . <p> The Easy Pass is also great , too . You can load different cash values and it saves so much time . <p> Thanks again , Jess ! <p> Posted on 02/18/2012 at 6:43 PM <p> martineaimee says : <p> Extremely useful ! Thank you ! <p> Posted on 02/19/2012 at 7:21 AM <p> Mario says : <p> Very useful info Jess ! But also remember that buses are effective mainly in the Beach/ Downtown areas , or if you have to take 1 bus on a straight route , like Flagler Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if you have to go to West Kendall or Hialeah , itll take a long while . Than again , that 's not so much the bus services fault , but more due to excessive suburban sprawl . <p> Posted on 02/20/2012 at 3:20 PM <p> Natalia says : <p> Very useful information indeed , I found answers for many questions . I am coming to Miami beach the first time and still thinking - what is the best way to get Coral Beach from Ocean Drive using public transport ? Thank you ! <p> If so , you can either use the metrorail from a stop near where you are staying to Government Center and then get the C bus to South Beach . Or you can get the 24 bus from Coral Gables and catch the C again , depending on whether you are near a metrorail stop or not . <p> Mario , that is true even with relatively short distances . I took Metrorail from South Miami to Government Center , then took a bus to mid Beach to 41st street . It took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been 16 miles . If I actually had to use bus/metro in Miami for all my needs , it would be an incredible time suckmore so than moving around by car . And the bus/metro service can be rather unsavory late at night if you are alone . I still think that having a car is best here if you plan on moving around in very long distances frequently . <p> Posted on 02/21/2012 at 5:06 PM <p> Natalia says : <p> Hi Jess , thanks for the respond , I am terribly sorry , the place I have to get - it is Coral Springs , not Coral Beach ! Both are coral though .. <p> Natalia , Coral Springs is a good 50 -60 miles away from South Beach . It is possible to get there but would take at least 2 hours on a few buses . You should use google maps and click on the public transport icon to find the best route for your destination address . <p> Posted on 02/22/2012 at 1:01 PM <p> Mario says : <p> @ Natalia , Coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have to switch several times and it will take easily more than 2-3 hours . <p> @ Maria , yeah , if it had been only Metrorail to Downtown , it would have been quick . <p> The bus crosses Julia Tuttle Causeway , turns south on Collins , and passes right in from of the Perry . <p> Posted on 02/22/2013 at 3:35 PM <p> Cathrine says : <p> We forgot a big bag of clothes on the S route from Aventura mall today .

@@45271589 @5271589/ <h> Fun Places To Walk In Miami Beach <p> Think of South Beach and some of the first things that come to mind are tropical colors , Art Deco , and a vibrant nightlife . But did you know that it is also a walker 's paradise ? In fact , in 2011 , walkscore.com , the web 's leading resource for determining a community 's degree of pedestrian-friendliness , rated Miami Beach as the country 's 8th most walkable city ! South Beach 's compact , villagey layout is just the right size for getting just about everywhere on foot . Unfortunately , its compactness can also be a detriment : tens of thousands of people from all over the world descend upon this billion dollar sandbar every day , and , at times , the traffic and density can get a little overwhelming for the casual stroll . Fortunately , we 've scoped out some of the choice walking spacesplaces where you can experience the appeal of the cityand still enjoy a little tranquility ! <p> Lincoln Road and Espa+ola Way South Beach is home to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular is Lincoln Road , where you 'll find an interesting melange of sidewalk cafes , bars , galleries , and upscale retail . The outdoor pedestrian mall , which runs between Washington and Alton along Lincoln Road , is completely car free . Since the east-west streets on the island are practically all numbered , Lincoln Road , were it to have a numerical assignation , would be 16 -+ Street . It 's always lively along this thoroughfare , 24-hours a day . During peak hours , it can be so crowded with the dance of waiters , dog walkers , rollerbladers , street performers , and window shoppers that it 's sometimes a wonder that they do n't all get tangled up in one big , convoluted ball . <p> At moments such as those , head south a couple of blocks to Espa+ola Way , Lincoln Road 's less bustling baby sister , but closed to traffic only on Saturday mornings during its weekly street fair . Starting your journey at the corner of Washington and Espa+ola Way and heading west , you 'll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this street 's abundant assortment of quaint galleries , bistros , and shops . Stop off for a coffee or rum drink at an outside table while you enjoy a little people watching . There is always a stream of young , international backpackers coming and going from the nearby Clay Hotel , as well as an endless array of savory smells of exotic origin . You can enjoy Italian on one side at the Hosteria Romana ( 429 Espa+ola Way ) , or French on the other at A La Folie ( 412 Espa+ola Way ) . <p> Beach Boardwalk If you 're a hardcore walker , you can actually strut your stuff all the way to 46th Street along the beachfront promenade and boardwalk . On one side , there 's a steady collection of high-rise hotels and condo-plexes ; to the other , the protected dunes and sea beyond . Many of your fellow walkers will be Orthodox Jews , dressed in their traditional garb . Throw in a few stray cats and sea gulls , and you have the prime ingredients of a Miami Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is South Beach at its South Beachiest . The deco buildings of Ocean Drive rise in pastel hues like birthday cakes beyond the coconut groves of Lummus Park as you find yourself in the heart of the most photographedand the most iconicpart of the island . Here you 'll see a cacophony of humanity on parade : bodybuilders , models , rollerbladers , homeless people and international tourists all converging to celebrate the pleasure of doing nothing . <p> South Pointe Park After passing the steakhouse , the next stop on your journey is South Pointe Park , a 17-acre space that was renovated to the sum of $22.5 million in 2009 . Its open meadows and gentle rolling hills make it a perfect place to stop and take in the fresh sea air . Take a spot under a palm tree or stretch out on the open grass while you savor the waft of warm tropical breezes and the peaceful vibe . <p> Continuing along your walk , you 'll find yourself square on the beach , the glowing , bubble gum green Atlantic just beyond . Continue north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flamingo Park is a restful green oasis amid a buzzing periphery . You 'll find basketball , tennis and handball courts , a baseball field , a public pool , a dog park , and grassy , wide-open spaces perfect for walking Rover , practicing your tai chi , playing an impromptu soccer gameor just enjoying a little leisurely contemplation . Toward the west end of the park is an outdoor football stadium , encompassing a jogging track that 's open to the public . If you want to keep a steady pace , it may be your best option . However , for some reason , city workers frequently use the track as a shortcut from the street to their field house , located on the far side of the stadium , so you often have to negotiate your way around their trucks , as they come and go . Still , it 's a great place to she 'd the pounds without having to join a gym ! <p> After experiencing South Beach 's residential core , you may find yourself wanting to connect with the turquoise waters along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sometimes get a little chaotic , between the sun-worshiping crowds and the numerous special events that take place on the sand . Crews are always busy setting up or taking down tents for one spectacle or another . For this reason , the west side of the island makes a much more peaceful alternative . <p> Meridian Avenue Most visitors to South Beach tend to stick to the three major streets on the east side of the islandWashington , Collins , and Ocean . As a result , those tend to be the most congested . But locals know that when they need to go north or south , there 's one beautiful street to take that 's slightly off the beaten path : Meridian Avenue . Meridian Avenue is the garden street of South Beach . It 's shaded by a canopy of mature trees , and is lush with exotic flowers and tropical greenery every month of the year . Starting at Fifth Street , head north past the colorful deco apartment buildings . It is here that you can best glean what life is like for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your left , you 'll notice a park . That 's the next item on our list ! <p> The Marina Starting at Fifth Street at the entrance to the MacArthur Causeway , if you look to the south , you 'll spot a picturesque promenade overlooking the spectacular collection of yachts and sailing vessels that call the South Beach Marina home . Follow this walkway south , and it will take you on a journey around the bottom of the island . After you pass the marina , you can often see the cruise ships in the distance , docked at the Port of Miami . Miami 's city skyline beckons to the west across Biscayne Bay , while to your left is the posh So-Fi ( South of Fifth ) neighborhood of Miami Beach , its luxury condos rising high into the azure skies . If your taste buds want to take part in the sensory experience , stop off for some inspiration at Monty 's South Beach ( 300 Alton Rd at Fourth Street ) , a raw bar where locals in the know come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full menu of food and drinks . <p> Later , as you continue along the walkway , traversing the south side of the island , you 'll spy exclusive Fisher Island in the distance , a private community of the jet set , accessible only by ferry . Also along this stretch you 'll find the Smith and Wollensky Steakhouse ( 119 Washington Avenue ) , which , with its views of passing cruise ships and Government Cut , Miami 's shipping channel , boasts perhaps the most scenic and romantic location of any restaurant in South Beach . And , wiith all those extra calories you 're shedding , you may be able to give into temptation here without too many regrets ! <p> Places to Avoid While there is plenty to see and experience , there are also a few places you will want to avoid on your pedestrian odysseys . There are no ghettos in South Beach , per se , but there are some areas where the street theater can get a little too dramatic . One such area is located on Washington Avenue around 15th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract a lot of panhandlers and other transients , and it can at times get a little aggressive . Another rough spot is in front of Meridian Market at Meridian and Sixth , another popular panhandling site . Still , with its wide variety of hispanic foods and fine , home-cooked hot meals , it is probably one of the best markets you 'll find on South Beach . While the crowd is by and large harmless , it can get a little dodgy , especially after dark . In fact , after dark , it 's probably best to stick to the well-lit , touristy areas to the east , where the crowds and good lighting will make you less likely to be singled out . Miami Beach is no more dangerous than any large city , though . Save the parks and the residential areas for the day , and you 'll be fine . The beach at night can also be a little risky . While many couples feel safe enough to enjoy some uninhibited moments of passion by the shore while silhouetted against the neon glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular spot for petty thieves , who frequently sneak up on those distracted couples and steal their belongings in the heat of the moment . <p> Do n't let that hinder you , though ! By taking a few common sense precautions , you will discover exactly how much of a walking heaven Miami Beach can be . Suffice it to say , this is one destination where you can plan on leaving the car at home !

@@45271600 @5271600/ <h> Review and Photos of Art Deco Weekend 2012 <p> Last weekend saw the 35th annual Art Deco weekend here in Miami Beach , presented by the Miami Design Preservation League . The weekend celebration was originally created to generate interest in the area and have the Art Deco buildings placed on the National Register of Historical Places . The idea worked , and the one square mile has nearly one thousand buildings on the list . It is now protected by some of the best preservation laws in the country . <p> THE HISTORY OF OCEAN DRIVE <p> In 1912 , the Lummus brothers recognized the potential of Miami Beach . Back then the area was home only to alligators and mosquitoes . The brothers bought land from South Pointe up to Lincoln Road and developed it as a destination for tourists to come and enjoy the beach . They brought ferry boats of day visitors over and sold land to build modest hotels . Most importantly they made one side of Ocean Drive a public park , giving the street its beginning as a beach neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone to enjoy and so in 1915 , when the area was declared an official city , they sold their park back to the city for the same price they had paid for it . The city kept the park and did not build on it , which is why we do not have high rise hotels along that stretch of Ocean Drive and enjoy direct beach access . The Lummus brothers helped preserve the area as it still exists today : a thriving neighborhood of small boutique hotels , apartments and restaurants . <p> ART DECO WEEKEND <p> The weekend event is held over three days and Ocean Drive is closed to traffic , allowing the visitors to walk along the street . The aim of the weekend is to draw visitors into the area to focus on the gorgeous architecture that the district preserves . The street is filled with street performers , vendors selling art work , jewelry and antiques and the restaurants put their tables out onto the street with special Art Deco menus . <p> A street performer entertains the crowds <p> The weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a film series , fashion shows , classic car shows , live music and a parade with the Miami Beach High marching band . Many of the local businesses and hotels support the events , and the area benefits greatly from the recognition the weekend brings . <p> Some vendors offer jewelry making classes for kids <p> Girl Scouts selling their cookies to the crowds <p> With all the fun things to see and do , Art Deco weekend is fun for everyone to attend . But if you missed it , you can always visit the Art Deco Welcome Center which is open daily at its new location on Ocean Drive . They offer the guided walking tour throughout the year and it is the information center for people visiting Miami Beach . <p> So on your next trip to Miami , make sure you visit the Art Deco area to gaze at the wonderfully preserved buildings .

@@45271604 @5271604/ <h> 10 Things To Do In Downtown Miami : A Self-Guided Tour <p> The mouth of the Miami river , where Brickell and Downtown meet , as seen from a boat . Tucked away at street level among these concrete and glass behemoths is a history worth exploring . Bayside Marketplace and Marina , an open-air shopping mall , is where most tourists flock to when they visit Downtown Miami . Most locals think it 's too kitschyfood on display in front of restaurants and parrots ready to pose with you for a Polaroid . <p> Bayside is nice enough , if you 're a tourist , or a local who loves being a tourist , like me . I had a passable dinner there not long ago with a friend , facing the marina . But if you 're stuck there for an hour or longer , you can explore the rest of Downtown Miami without having to venture too far . <p> While standing at the mouth of the river , gaze upon the formidable concrete jungle of Brickell Key and think of the Brickell family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They traded with Indians who paddled up from the Everglades in their dugout canoes . <p> Continue your stroll toward Biscayne Boulevard . At the path 's end , look straight directly south across the river at Philippe Starck 's massive Icon development . Well , actually , look at the empty patch of grass by the river 's edge . You wo n't be able to see it from above , but the Miami Circle is an ancient archeological site where Tequesta Indians lived over 2,000 years ago . Currently , plans are underway for construction of a beautiful city park at this location . <p> 2 . SEE IT LIKE A BIRD <p> Miamis Metromover crosses high above the river for a spectacular view .

You really ca n't get lost though ; the loops are finite and each rail car always returns to square one . <p> From Bayside , walk a couple of blocks west to College/Bayside station , where you 'll catch the Brickell loop and continue on to Brickell via Government Center . There 's no better way to get a bird 's eye view of Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods . You 'll pass by many historic buildings and high over the river . Once at Brickell , simply return to Bayside or the stop of your choice . To learn more about Metromover stations , routes and hours of operation , visit Miami-Dade Public Transportation . <p> 3 .

Photo courtesy of DCVision on Flickr . <p> At College/Bayside station , take the Metromover Brickell loop heading south to Riverwalk station . Stop at the high platform and enjoy the view . Then head down the elevator and see the big red M for Miami sculpture designed by local architectural artists Roberto Behar and Rosario Marquardt . While there , think of the many words that start with M that could represent Miami . <p> Cross the street to Bijan 's restaurant , where you 'll spot Henry Flagler 's historic yellow clapboard cottage . The structure was moved from a different location further inland where it originally housed railroad workers circa 1896 . <p> This site is also called Fort Dallas Park , Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Miami .

The palm is planted exactly where new Miamians gathered to incorporate the city in 1896 . It 's not much to look at , but the site 's historical importance is quite tremendous . <p> From Bijan 's " where you may be inclined to stop for a cold beer and a sandwich , if it 's openstroll east on the river walk to the Hyatt Regency hotel .

Make your your way to the water 's edge , where you 'll also enjoy a view of Brickell Key . You 'll encounter the Brickell family mini-crypt on your walk , but do n't worrythere are no ghosts in there . The Brickells are actually buried in Woodlawn Park .

Standing on the driveway by the valet station , you 'll see an empty construction site , future home of the Met 3 .

Gesu was founded in 1896 and before Miami started sprawling west to the suburbs , much of the citys religious life centered on this venerable institution . <p> Inside , on the wall by the main entrance , you 'll find a pictorial history .

Take the Metromover from the College/Bayside station on the Brickell loop to 5th street station and walk west to South Miami Avenue . Tobacco Road will be on your left across the street , just after the bridge . <p> Want something fancier ?

@@45271612 @5271612/ <h> Miami Beach HistoryMorris Lapidus Biography <p> If a prophet is without honor in his own country , Morris Lapidus was a prophet who lived to see his dream fulfilled on a limited basis . <p> His self-described architecture of the American Dream , flamboyant in the extreme and expressive of the heights of 50s and 60s exuberance , was reviled in its day . Critics called his Miami Beach hotels boarding house baroque , the epitome of the apogee , emblems of tail-fin chic , and the nation 's grossest national product . The New York Times called it superschlock . Pornography of architecture , sniffed Art in America . The Miami Herald joked that it was probably not too disturbing to people who have lost their eyesight . <p> As of 1962 , Lapidus said , The critics still hated my work , whether curved or bent , but clients wanted more and more of the sweeping forms . Lapidus 's luxurious high-rise hotels came to define the leading American resorts , especially those of Florida and Las Vegas . By 1985 , when critics still did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said to hell with it . It took two large trucks to consign all the materials to the flames , he wrote in his autobiography Too Much is Never Enough . He had billed $50 million during his career , and should have realized that this sum was the surest mark of appreciation in the land of the American Dream . <p> Just as Lapidus was burning his life 's work , postmodernism was taking hold in architecture , and the buildings he had designed three decades earlier became prophetic . In the years before he died at age 98 , Lapidus resumed his design work and received accolades . He could write , plausibly , if perhaps wrongly , that his ideals would be the model for twenty-first century architecture . <p> Lapidus ' first architectural commission was the Fontainbleau in Miami Beach . Built in 1954 , it had more than 500 rooms arranged in a quarter-circle curve . There was a terrarium in the lobby with live alligators . There was a stairway to nowhere so that glamorous guests could deposit their coats at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bellboys ' uniforms , done in purple with gold braid . The critic Anna Louise Huxtable memorably described them as looking " like an exploding eggplant " . <p> Nearly all his buildings featured famous devices that would be come the cliches of a certain brand of kitschy buildings : woggles , shaped like an artist 's palette or a boomerang that showed up in cutouts in ceilings or in the shape of tables ; cheese holes , amoeboid cutouts in walls ; and beanpoles , metal rods supporting nothing . His work was the height of excess . <p> Of course the critics went crazy . The architectural hero of the day was the dean of the Bauhaus , Ludwig Mies van der Rohe , whose austere glass and steel Seagram Building in New York was erected to critical huzzahs four years after the Fontainbleau . Lapidus hated Bauhaus boxes . I thought van der Rohe was an idiot . Less is more . How stupid can you be . Less is not more . Less is nothing , he wrote in Too Much is Never Enough He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a man whose mother had dragged her Jewish family from anti-Semitic Russia to the United States in the first years of the twentieth century . Raised on New York 's lower east side , Lapidus lived a script of the American Dream : ghetto boyhood , scholarships to higher education , and professional training in architecture at Columbia . The first two decades of his career were spent creating revolutionary store designs . Curved exteriors with innovative art deco motifs drew shoppers inside . Lapidus was one of the first to create storefronts with wide glass facades through which customers could view the actual store . His designs eliminated the system where clerks stood behind counters guarding the merchandise , instead allowing customers to wander and handle the goods . After WWII he designed stores for Levittown . <p> By the early 50s he had developed a bunch of principles that he called theories : <p> Get rid of corners <p> Use sweeping lines <p> Use light to create unusual effects <p> Use plenty of color <p> Try to get drama <p> Keep changing the floor levels <p> People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lapidus liked to say that he was designing fantasy buildings . When people went on vacation , they wanted to be treated to their fantasies of luxury . The hotels were like be like movie sets , and the Fontainebleau was featured in the film Goldfinger - Agent 007 caught the eponymous villain cheating at cards there . The designer of stores now sought to sell people a good time . <p> Before the Fontainebleau 's 27 colors of paint had dried , Lapidus had his second big commission , the Eden Rock , a luxury hotel to be located right next door . I do n't care if it 's Baroque or Brooklyn said the developer of the Eden Rock . Just get me plenty of glamour and make sure it screams luxury . Elizabeth Taylor had her birthday party at the Eden Rock . Jayne Mansfield honeymooned there . <p> Commissions started pouring in - damn the critics , there was money to be made . Soon Lapidus was doing hotels in every fantasy zone of the country : in Las Vegas , Los Angeles , the Catskills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he designed The Americana , the first hotel to be built in Manhattan in 30 years . Erected at a prominent location on Seventh Avenue , it was a major statement as well as an engineering feat : the tallest concrete building in the world at 550 feet . Critics in his home town were livid . The Americana was a beaux art building doing the twist . Lewis Mumford , critic of purposeless materialism , said it looked like an open paperback . <p> Even as Lapidus found greater success and raised his fees , his anger at his profession festered . Professional architectural publications were as dismissive of his art as critics in the popular press . Time has made their critiques seem at least overstated . Lapidus 's announced goal was that his buildings ' exterior should express what went on inside . They just happened to be about fun and luxury and fantasy . This was a goal worthy of the International Style . What , after all , could be more Bauhaus ? Form follows function . Lapidus was putting the fun back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them a lift , He told the New York Times . It 's the crazy hat for a woman , the bright tie for men . And he was designing resort hotels , not glorified prisons and formicaries for office-workering city dwellers . From this perspective the critics look even snootier . They did n't want people to have fun . Lapidus certainly felt that way : The critics were not going to be guests at the Fontainebleau . <p> Still , even today when exuberant buildings dot skylines across the nation , Lapidus 's hotels seem gauche . It comes as no shock that he was for many years an architect for the Trumps . A former collaborator , working on a commission for the H.J. Heinz company , once told Lapidus , That 's where you and I differ , Morris . I will not put a pickle on top of my building . Lapidus would have made the pickle bigger . <p> The man without a school - postmodernism was far in the future when Lapidus was in his prime - called himself a Neoplasticist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle has . The profession that he hated when he burned his papers embraced him at the end . " That 's the one thing I 'm eternally grateful for " , he said in 1997 . That I 've lived to see my work accepted . Lapidus said that his life was indelibly changed when he saw Coney Island 's gleaming Luna Park as a child . It was his American Dream come true .

I do n't smoke , but seeing people light up inside a bar , in 2012 , is so effing hilarious it makes me love the city that much more .

The more I like it , the more visible are the shortfalls . My two cents . 58782 @qwx468782 <p> THE BEST CITY IN AMERICA ? ? ! ! ! ! ! <p> Oh man , that 's hilarious . <p> Read any city rankings . We 're awash in foreclosures . Our government is corrupt . We have ZERO public parks worth a damn . No support for sports or the arts ( Wynwood is appealing , but miles from what SF , LA , Seattle , NYC , Chicago or a ton of other cities have ) . We have like NO educated people here . <p> Best city in America ? Please . I love this place because of its flaws , but its far , FAR from the best city in America . We ca n't even figure out how to vote correctly . 58782 @qwx468782 <p> I would venture to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , for all the reasons Matt just mentioned . The most popularity in relation to just how absolutely depressing the underlying issues are . Having said that , I find it to be a place I love/loved to live in . Go figure . 58782 @qwx468782 <p> really , u do n't  have a sports base ? that 's funny . i remember miami heat winning . no education ? ! buddy , people choose that life , do you blame them ? why would they pay thousands and be in debt with tuition just to get 30 bucks an hour when they can make thousands on tips working in a fun enviornment ( clubs , bars etc ... ) IN ONE NIGHT . sex sells buddy so that environment is perfect . schools a cash grab and its bullshit , you do n't  need it , you need money and hookups , that 's how society runs now a days . your government seems fine to me , you have freedom , you club , you party , you walk , talk , dress how you want ... maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really appreciate it and stop putting it down , that 's ridiculous . wow . you do n't  even deserve residence there . but i guess when people have already what others are dying for , they do n't  appreciate it . how sad 58782 @qwx468782 <p> Matt 's not a resident . He 's a born and bred citizen . 100% American , as am I. We say how we view Miami cos we live here . I started this thread as pros and cons of Miami . How about focusing on all the good things I said ? 58782 @qwx468782 <p> Oh man it pains me to read all your pro 's , cause I am not living in Miami anymore and those are the things I miss SOOO much ! Maybe it 's cause I grew up in the cold northeast , but " winter " days poolside with some friends and beers is the best thing on earth ! I would also add to the pro 's , clothing .

Since i 've never been ) , I do n't know of any other American Cities that can challenge Miami , especially Miami Beach . No where in Florida , that 's for sure . No where in the Southeast either . I love San Francisco and would relocate there if I could afford it or had an amazing job opportunity . <p> I 'm sure Chicago &amp; D.C. is nice but you can have the freezing temperatures , murder rates/gangs , and snowed-in airports . I 'll lay on the beach in December : - ) 58782 @qwx468782 <p> I think Miami is very unique in the sense that some things that might be a con for some people might be a pro for others . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out that these pros and cons will definitely vary by location . Lack of a Rock Station , and Traffic must be cons for almost everyone though . But again on a regular day to day basis i manage to avoid both of these cons between CDs and a nice work schedule/commute. 58782 @qwx468782 <p> The irony of someone telling me education is useless while using abhorrent grammar and no punctuation or capitalization is almost too much for even me . <p> I 've been on both sides of that , " buddy . " I 've bartended and made a ton of cash . I 've also gotten an advanced degree . Uneducated people lead to a trashy culture , poor customer service , poor government , and an overall poor quality of life . <p> The heat won ? ! That 's your example for a fan base ? I went to a game the year before Lebron got here and bought an $11 ticket outside in the power bowl . The arena was half empty . Look at the Marlins stadium . I 'm not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People without education really are n't worth my time . However I 'm paid for this , so I 'll do it anyway . <p> Sobespace , Miami Beach is a small town of 135,000 people . If you wan na start saying which cities that size rate we can start talking about Kona and La Jolla and Newport Beach and Sausalito . As a Metro area ? ? ! ! COME . ON . Name one innovation that 's come out of this city ( that does not involve creative smuggling techniques ) that had affected society ? It 's a good place to live for SOME . To say it 's at all an important city past anything but Latin American trade is a real stretch . 58782 @qwx468782 <p> Kind of favor the way of Matt 's logic . <p> After you weigh out the good and bad , you really have to assign an exponentially weighted variable towards . beaches , weather and nightlife to favor Miami . If for that , might as well go all inclusive at Hedonism for a week . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledger carries more weight . The tropics are quite inviting ... but when it lacks a culture lacking of personal legitimate industry , it drags the city down as a whole and becomes paralized to graft , corruption and submission . <p> It leaves the city dweller with the only reprieve in saying ; Only in Miami .

Storage space is generous . Cabins feature a TV , phone , safe and toiletries . Enchantment has just added hair dryers to every cabin though robes are only available to those who have booked categoryA suites . Nearly 40% of the outside cabins have balconies . Cabin service was exceptional , unobtrusive and thorough . <p> Dining <p> Service and cuisine exceeded my expectations . Having said that let me add a note : Royal Caribbean is not a " foodie " line like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order a burger or duck you are rarely offered an option in how it 's prepared .

Twenty-four hour room service from a limited menu and selections from the dining room menu during mealtimes are available through room service . <p> There 's a hot dog and hamburger grill in the Solarium . <p> Royal Caribbean has introduced a somewhat complex drinks-package on board .

Views from either the main floor or balcony are excellent . Seating is on fixed banquettes , which guarantees adequate space to enter and exit rows , and space is maximized by eliminating tables in favor of drink holders on armrests . On a one-week cruise expect one show featuring a name entertainer , two production shows , three evenings of variety acts , and a farewell show . <p> The Casino has slots , dice and card tables . We found the casino staff unusually friendly and helpful .

It feels far from the action ( except , perhaps , for the late night crowd ) and on my visits there I found it sparsely attended -- though a great place to watch the ship come in to port .

It 's easy to email ; computers are outfitted with software from the best known ISPs , from AOL to Hotmail to Yahoo , among others .

@@45271645 @5271645/ <p> In 1868 Pennsylvania farmer , Henry B. Lum , sailed up the coast from Key West to Miami to explore the beach wilderness area on the east side of Biscayne Bay . He saw three palm trees growing on the beach and they gave him the idea to try his hand at Coconut farming . <p> With the help of his son , Charles , the Lum 's convinced a group of investors to purchase 165 acres on South Beach for 75 cents and acre for the purpose of harvesting coconuts . <p> In 1870 the Beach was little more than a collection of small islands with sand beaches on the ocean side , dense Palmetto growth in the middle , and mangrove swamps on the bay side . <p> In 1886 , Charles Lum built the first home on Miami Beach ; a two-story house at the site of the present Tides Hotel at 12th Street and Ocean Drive . <p> The dense mangroves made farming difficult . The mosquitos they attracted were too much for the laborers to bear and the men were driven away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lums , so they left the Beach , leaving their plantation in the control of John Stiles Collins , a wealthy Quaker farmer from New Jersey . <p> When Henry Flagler extended his railroad south to Miami , John Collins took the train from his home in Morristown New Jersey , to inspect his investment . The coconut plantation had been carved out of beach sand and mangrove swaps which were not ideal for farming . However , to the west and north of this area , Collins discovered a ridge on which Pine trees were growing out of black sand . This indicted there was fresh water on the island . Collins bought an additional five-mile strip of land between 14th and 67th Streets and planted bananas , mangoes , avocados , corn peppers and tomatoes . <p> At this time , John and James Lummus , each president of a different Miami bank , began acquiring bay and beachfront land on the Southern end of Miami Beach . They established The Ocean Beach Reality Company .

The Tatum Pavilion represents the first permanent facilities built to accommodate recreational activities on Miami Beach . <p> 1911 - 1920 The Early Development Years <p> In 1911 Collins started the Miami Beach Improvement Company . He was beginning to tire of making the 10-mile boat trip across the bay to bring harvest to market . His vision was to first dredge a canal through Miami Beach which would allow him to move his fruits and vegetables to the Bay followed by the construction of a wooden bridge that would connect Miami Beach to the mainland . <p> The Collins Bridge Project was costly . Collins borrowed money from the Lummus Brother 's banks to finance the project , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a half a mile short of completion . <p> In 1913 , Carl Fisher , a wealthy Midwestern industrialist appeared on the development scene .

At over two miles in length , the Collins bridge was the longest wooden bridge in the world . <p> Fisher also loaned money to the Lummus Brothers to carry out improvements on the southern end of the island such as draining the swamps and dredging the bay . <p> Fisher establishes the third real estate company on the Beach , the Alton Beach Reality Company , and acquired the land between 14th and 19th Streets ; linking Lummus to the south and Collins to the north . Fisher also had a vision for the island--to create a city existing in an of itself - not as an adjunct to the established city of Miami across the bay .

The following year the name was changed to Miami Beach . <p> At this time 80% of the population lived at the southern end of the island in the Lummus tracts and there were only thirty-three registered voters in the community . J.N. Lummus was elected Mayor and plans were made to supply electricity , telephone , sewage and water , which at the time was supplied by windmill powered underground wells . <p> In 1916 the sale of the land was sluggish . Both Lummus and Fisher had invested large sums of money in improvements , but the land sales did not meet their expectations and they were compelled to create further incentives . Lummus offered free lots to anyone who promised to build homes on his land . <p> In 1919 Collins and Fisher became partners to sell real estate and promote the area .

He raised the prices of his lots and increased his marketing efforts . He built the luxurious Flamingo Hotel to house visitors until they could settle . Never did he envision a city dominated by large scale hotel development for transient seasonal population . Significantly he refused to locate any of his many hotels along prime oceanfront property . <p> 1920 - 1929 The Boom Years <p> In January of 1921 President-elect Warren Harding spent the winter at the Flamingo Hotel . <p> World War One was over . It was safe to travel by train or ship and the tourists returned to Miami Beach . <p> New hotels were opening on the beach and each fought to become the fashionable hotel to spend the winter season .

Hotels were damaged , telephone and electricity service was knocked out and almost 400 people were killed . The hurricane turned the real-estate boom into a bust . <p> On February 11 , 1928 , John Collins died . Later that year , Al Capone 's gang moved to Miami Beach , buying a house on Palm Island . Gambling and bootlegging activities proliferated on the Beach before his arrival , but when Canoe 's gang showed up , the illegal operations became big business . <p> The stock market crash of 1929 turned the nation 's economy into a Great Depression . The depression forced the rich Miami Beach residents to close their estates and move off the beach . <p> 1930 - 1941 The Post Depression Boom Years <p> Although Miami Beach entered into an economical decline two years before the worldwide crash of 1929 , it also began its recovery sooner . <p> The 6,500 permanent population of 1930 doubled to 13,350 by 1935 , and doubled again to 28,000 by 1940 .

These structures from 1930 -1935 form the transition period on the Beach from Mediterranean-eclectic to the three dimensional , Streamline , Moderne brand of Art Deco <p> In 1935 the city of Miami Beach purchased the recreation grounds of the Flamingo Hotel for $300,000 to create a city park called Flamingo Park . <p> In 1939 Carl Fisher died .

@@45271652 @5271652/ <h> Stung by a Jellyfish ! <p> This evening around 6 pm , I thought I would go for a relaxing swim in the warm , gentle waters off South Beach . I drifted out maybe 100 feet from shore , and then stood up , looking at the interesting cloud formations behind the buildings on Ocean Drive -- when suddenly my back felt like it was being electrocuted ! I yelled out in sharp pain , reaching behind me and feeling something stringy . I jumped away and turned , but did n't see anything there -- though it did n't take long for me to realize I 'd just had my first experience with a jellyfish . I got to shore as fast as I could , trying to remember the protocol for jellyfish stings . There were a few other people out swimming in the water , having fun . I thought of yelling out , " Jellyfish ! " but decided against it . Clearly , this jellyfish only had a problem with me . <p> The lifeguards had already closed their stations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type pain was starting to become a less painful tingly sensation , so I just put my shirt back home and started home . <p> I passed the Ocean Rescue headquarters on my way , and seeing a lifeguard returning to his car , and thought I 'd ask him exactly what to do if you 're stung by a jellyfish . I showed him my battle wounds ( a red blotch on my lower back ) and explained what happened . He said he gets stung almost every day , and suggested I put vinegar on it and take a hot shower . <p> I asked if I had to worry about toxins in my system , and he said that it is very rare for someone to have a serious reaction to a sting . If you have shortness of breath , that is the sign that you may need medical attention . Aside from the sharp tingling feeling on my lower back , I felt fine . He said children and the elderly run the greatest risk of having a bad reaction . <p> Jellyfish stings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found out . The last fatal shark attack here was in 1961 , and there have only been 10 unprovoked shark attacks in Miami-Dade since they started keeping records . Unfortunately , it 's often hard to spot jellyfish in the water until it 's too late ; but the good news is , the pain subsides rather quickly . <p> If you 're swimming , the best way to avoid getting stung by a jellyfish is to go when the lifeguards are on duty . If there is a purple flag hanging from the back of the lifeguard stations ( or a yellow flag with a black jellyfish on it for Portuguese Men-of-War ) , that means there is dangerous marine life in the water , and you should be on your guard . But even that 's not foolproof ... <p> Ouch ! I 've been stung a few times . Did you soak the burn in ammonia ? Here 's some advice on what to do if you get stung by a jellyfish : <p> * Pick off any tentacles with a gloved hand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Apply ammonia and water compress liberally onto the sting * Vinegar is NOT recommended for Portuguese man-of-war stings . * Apply ammonia compress for 30 minutes or until pain is relieved . <p> I did n't have ammonia , and read that rubbing alcohol is good . It is n't . The tingly feeling is becoming more of an itchy feeling , and spread from the area to different parts of my body . I took an allergy pill last night just to be on the safe side , but I felt really restless for some reason . I always thought you could spot them more easily , but maybe that 's just the Portuguese Men of War that are so visible .... <p> Ammonia on jellyfish stings and taking Wellness Formula right when you start to feel sick are the best remedies I know . <p> The Wellness FamilyG of products is designed to support the immune system when under physical stress .

I must say , the doctor was always amazed at how much Nick was growing . He doubled his birth weight in a week ! <p> I 'm just saying , lady knew her stuff ... there might be some truth to it . That said , you 'll NEVER catch me tinkling on myself if I get stung . <p> Thankfully , Suzy , ammonia did the trick , so I wo n't have to resort to the other stuff ! <p> Nyckid , I 've been swimming in the water here almost every day for the last two months , and have never had a problem at all , until now .

I was stung by one a cupla years ago during the summer . It was incredibly annoying , this one little tiny speck on my leg that was burning like hell . It ruined my beach day for about an hour , but eventually I was back in the water . Thank God it was n't a large sting . I feel for ya ! <p> Hey Maria , long time no ... read ! Yeah , the jellyfish thing was a bummer , but I 'm all better now . Ammonia was very effective . My jellyfish must have been pretty small because I never saw it coming .

Some of them are actually rich , others are " pretending " to be rich . I am not lying--if someone is nice to us , we instinctively ask " Where are you from ? " because they are probably not from Miami if they treat you with respect . But despite all that it is still a nice place to live . There is no " perfect " place anywhere in the US . <p> As for the cost of living , you have to do some work to save money but it is doable . I would say groceries are only about 10% higher than what I was used to in the Midwest . Gas prices are at about the national average--more than the deep south but less than other similarly-sized cities . There are a few Winn/Dixie stores around that have ok prices ( if you use the card and take advantage of the sales and $5 off coupons ) . The prices at the Whole Foods off US-1 are not really that out of line . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery section with good prices . We are hoping that when the new Super Walmart opens on Coral Way the prices will go down at Winn Dixie . We go to Matinee Movies at Sunset Mall to save a few bucks . <p> I do spend more money on some things . 1 ) Tolls ( avoid the highways ) . 2 ) Lost time in traffic ( like I said , avoid the highways ) . 3 ) They charge for parking all over the place down here , especially in Coral Gables . I have found that I save major headaches by going into school at 7:00-7:30 AM . Miami is not an early rising city and it is really easy to beat traffic . 4 ) Touristy stuff--it 's a tourist town so expect to pay more for fun stuff like going to the beach or zoo or botanical gardens . <p> Also , do not forget the cost of CAR INSURANCE ! ! ! ! ! ! That is the one thing that is far more expensive in Miami than anywhere else . ( Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a car accident ) . <p> Many thanks for the heads-up on the various aspects of living in The Gables , joejoezz ! I will surely steer clear of the " extremely rich " and " the pretending to be rich " . Actually , I probably wo n't have to cos they would be steering clear of me in the first place since I 'm neither of these . LOL . <p> By the way , given this protrayal of the dark side , I am wondering how 's the " random socializing " situation in The Gables . I was there for only a day . So , I have no idea of the socializing norms there . I had dinner at Norman 's and saw that there was a crowd of people socializing at the bar in the restaurant . These people were dressed quite similarly ... so , I 'm guessing they went there together . I am asking this question cos I heard that people tend to be quite cliquish there . So , if a person was at this bar area alone having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this person and engage in small talk ? And if this person tries to chat with someone there , would this person be given the cold shoulder or be viewed with suspicion ? In my small town , we smile and say hi to everyone we see ( whom we do not know nor have the intention to know ) as we walk down the street . If people are standing in the same area at public places , someone would always strike up a conversation just to pass time and be friendly ... What is it like in The Gables ? Are people there snobbish ? <p> Hi joe ! Thank you very much for your input ! It is very valuable . We love to hear from locals like you with great real-life advice . <p> I know that area of the Gables very well . They do n't call it the " City Beautiful " for nothing . But yes , alas , that comes at a price regarding people . <p> I would have to disagree though on a couple of things , just from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful in Miami-Dade besides Coral Gables and Coconut Grove . Some areas of South Miami , Pinecrest are gorgeous with regard to lush foliage and beautiful homes . Brickell ( not just Brickell avenue ) and Key Biscayne are also beautiful . Miami Shores has some lovely spots , too . <p> Most locals here call Whole Foods " Whole Paycheck " ... it is by far the most expensive market besides the smaller ones like Gardner 's down the street . However , you can shop smart at Whole Foods if you take advantage of their sales and Whole Foods brand products . <p> During heavy traffic times , the back roads are sometimes just as miserable as the expressways . Sigh ... <p> You are right about the Winn Dixie rewards discount card , which now comes with the added advantage of gas discounts . You can save tons of money at Winn Dixie . I have n't set foot in a Publix for months . <p> Our forum friend Perri wo n't have a car , so fortunately that will not be an issue . She wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that area you are talking about is still a good distance away , though doable by bus and bike , I think . I knew several students who lived there when I was in grad school . <p> I do find the people in the Gables tend to be snobbish but that depends on where you go ! The Ale House , Tarpon Bend , The Bar , are much " friendlier " low-key place than Norman 's . <p> Miami will never be like up north where people are friendly . But there are ways of getting around that . I strike up conversations all the time on my own but that 's because I have the skill and inclination to do so . I 'm not saying it 's always easy , but as you spend more time here you 'll find the places that are more appealing to you . <p> If you are going to be living alone without a car , I would strongly recommend living closer to downtown South Miami than downtown Coral Gables . Not only will you be closer to campus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobby . South Miami is also home to Miami 's oldest bar ( Besides Tobacco Road ) which caters to all kinds of people -- from total American pie retirees to young UM students . They just all congregate at different times .

" Date : December 15 , 2005Reviewer : Miami Beach 411 User , New York , NY Casa Tua is the best restaurant I have ever been in the world , and I travel all the time internationally . Every time I am in Miami , a weekend a month in winters , I try to book a table . ( which is sometimes tough , so plan as far in advance as you can ) I always sit outside , as the candle lit trees and garden really set the mood for an amazing evening of wine ( great Italian wine selection ) and the best food I 've ever eaten . The scallops are amazing , the risotto is fantastic and the steak with pate is out of this world . Service is very attentive and patient .

My husband and I have dined at some of the top restaurants in Europe , the US and the Far East , so the elegance , exquisite food and superb service in Casa Tua came as a surprise from this less well known Miami restaurant . We intended to dine Italian style with both of us ordering our own appetiser , pasta dish and entree , but our waiter advised us that would be too much and suggested we share an appetiser , share a pasta and order an entree each . This was the perfect suggestion given the simple but stunning nature of each dish and the portion . The truffle risotto was by far the best risotto I have ever tasted and precisely the right amount . The service all evening was impeccable ( something that is often lacking or alternatively claustrophobic in even the most prestigious restaurants ) and the general ambience was simple yet stylish .

It had to be secured with a credit card , and I was called that day to ensure I would arrive . When we did arrive , we found that the restaurant was quite empty , and although I had been given a window in which to book the reservation , the tables remained largely empty throughout the night , leading me to believe that all the " booked " talk was a ruse to increase the buzz about the restaurant . <p> The service was good , but with a slightly condesending attitude . I was asked if it was my first time there , and when I stated that myself and my guest were first timers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place his version of what the order should be , to the point of closing the three page menu and opening it to the parts he wanted us to order from .

While I have eaten in many restaurants in Miami over the years , and the atmosphere here was most wonderful , I found the portions to be rather tiny , making the ordering of 3 courses plus dessert a necessity to leave with a satisfied feeling . That aside , I found the first course to be very good ( bay scallops ) , the second course to be OK ( rissoto with truffle ) and the third course to be just awful ( 3 " Fiji " shrimp very over cooked for $36 in a dessert sweet mix of barley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back , but then my partner 's dinner would have been cold waiting . So we continue . Dessert ordered was Dark Chocolate mousse with coconut icecream . What I got was like a scoop of Jello Pudding with a very thinly flavored dollop of coconut ice . My companion ordered an apricot tart with almond ice cream , the tart was ice cold , the almond ice cream was like that from Publix . During dinner we had two cocktails , one glass of wine and one coffee . At over $250 for two , we would not recommend this restaurant , and the sad part is that if the meal was $100 for two , we still would n't . <p> Casa Tua " Best restaurant in Miami " Date : May 3 , 2005Reviewer : Miami Beach 411 User , NY After almost three years of trying top restaurants in the Miami area I have found that consistency of food quality and service rank high among my primary reasons for choosing Casa Tua as my favorite restaurant .

The filet mignon with foie gras is incredibly tender and flavorful . The Branzino a very mild Mediterranean fish are a must try . The desert selections offer choices from the very dense and decedent milk chocolate mousse-cake to the light and very delicate frozen champagne soup with fresh fruit salad .

@@45271783 @5271783/ <h> Miami Beach HistoryJohn Collins Biography <p> Much has been made of Miami Beach pioneer John Collins ' religion . Leisurely Miami 's image seemed at odds with the Quaker virtue of hard work . While Collins was seen as a gentle Quaker , his children saw him as a he-man , full of energy and will and impatience . <p> Born on December 29 , 1837 , in Moorestown , New Jersey , John Stiles Collins was the sixth generation of Collinses to farm the family 's western New Jersey homestead since 1678 . Part of the liberal Moorestown Meeting , the Collins family , except for John 's wife , Rachel , did not wear traditional Quaker garb , but upheld the traditional Quaker virtues of " honesty , sincerity , patience , sobriety , and a talent for hard work . " <p> Collins ' passion for farming extended beyond his own land to the marketplace . In 1855 he opened the Pleasant Valley Nurseries and farmers ' supply yards in Moorestown and Merchantville . Widely known for cultivating the Kiefer pear and Wilson blackberry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Jersey Horticultural Society . <p> Adventurous in his investments , Collins first bought land in Florida in 1891 . Although he did n't visit the state until 1896 , he was immediately captivated by the land , purchasing additional acreage with two fellow New Jerseyites with the intention of growing coconuts . <p> The partnership did n't last . Partner Ezra Osborn died , and partner Elnathan Field was too conservative for Collins . Field was interested only in growing grapefruits , already a proven commodity . With an eye toward the marketplace as much as the soil , Collins wanted to grow exotic crops which had n't yet been introduced to the market : in particular , mangoes and avocados , or " alligator pears , " as they were called then . Collins eventually bought out his partners , making him the sole owner of five miles of land between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay -- roughly 50 blocks of modern-day Miami Beach . <p> Hiring predominantly black workers , Collins tamed the swamp , full of rats and tangled roots . By 1907 his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potatoes flourishing . Tourism was also beginning to flourish . Collins , though , was not interested in tourism , and now his focus switched to improving transportation , not for the sake of travelers but for his crops . Overground transportation was too slow , he felt , and he wanted a canal . <p> Enter the Collins children . Collins had set up his sizable family -- three sons , two daughters and their spouses -- in the family business . Under their shrewd management , the New Jersey nurseries had prospered while their father was planting Miami . Collins ' canal would cost more than he could afford , and he asked his children for the money . Having lived through any number of their father 's hit-or-miss investments , they were reluctant to pour their money into Miami sight unseen . <p> What the Collins children saw in Miami led them away from horticulture and toward tourism , and they agreed to finance the canal only if their father would agree to build a bridge across it , thereby opening the beach to traffic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Atlantic City , " the family founded the Miami Beach Improvement Company . Construction on the bridge in 1912 triggered a flurry of real estate activity , and the land was soon advertised as " a veritable Treasure Islandand winter play ground for the masses . " <p> At the end of 1912 , money was short , and so was the bridge . With a half mile still to be built , Carl Fisher , the Indiana auto parts mogul , took one of innumerable gambles in his life . Ultimately credited with bringing Miami to life , Fisher , who described Collins as " a bantam rooster , cocky and unafraid , " gave the 74-year-old $50,000 in exchange for 200 acres of his land on the beach . <p> With Fisher 's money , Collins finished his bridge on June 12 , 1913 , nearly a year after the projected six-month endeavor had begun . To remain competitive in the developing region , Collins and his son-in-law built a hotel . But John Collins never lost sight of his trees . By 1922 Miami Beach boasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Miami 's agricultural roots would n't last much longer , sacrificed for the tourist trade . <p> When Collins died on February 11 , 1928 , Miami bore little resemblance to the wild swamp he had tamed years before .

@@45271791 @5271791/ <h> How To Be A Good Waiter / Waitress <p> Are you moving to Miami with dreams of living the vacation life ? What , you have never heard of the vacation life , you say ? Let me explain , the vacation life is where you sleep in late , go to the gym , and hang out on the beach , waiting for your restaurant to open . Although there is not much job security , the lifestyle does wonders for your psyche and tan . <p> People often ask me , " how difficult is it to get a waiter job with no experience ? " The answer is , not very difficult in South Beach . With so many restaurants nearby , someone is always hiring , but most places will want you to have some experience . <p> Here are 25 things every good waiter or waitress should know : <p> 1 ) Do you know the difference between a Gibson and a Gimlet ? Severs must have a basic understanding of the bar . They must know the ingredients in popular drinks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . Two cocktails that often get confused are the Gibson and the Gimlet . Although the names are similar , the cocktails are very different . A Gibson is gin martini , garnished with an onion . A Gimlet is made with vodka and lime juice and garnished with a lime . With both drinks , it is the waiters responsibility to ask the customer if they want it served up or on the rocks . <p> 2 ) What is the garnish for a Dirty Martini ? A Dirty Martini is garnished with an olive . The cocktail is made by adding olive juice to the mix . Side note : Traditionally , a martini , it is made with gin , but most people order vodka martinis , so , it is the waiters responsibility to ask the customer if they want the martini made with gin , or vodka . <p> 4 ) When a Spanish-speaking customer asks for " whiskey " what do they usually want ? Scotch . A good way to find out for sure , is by suggesting a recognizable brand like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bottles of Chardonnay , Cabernet , and Merlot from your wine list ? Since popular wines are always changing , I 'm not going to list any here . If you want to learn about wine , buy a copy of Wine Spectator magazine and do your homework . <p> 6 ) What type of wine is paired with pork ? Most everyone knows , white wine is served with fish and chicken , and red wine is served with beef . But what does a waiter suggest when a customer orders pork ? Either . White wine , or a light red wine , like Pinot Noir can be served with pork . <p> 7 ) Can you open a bottle of wine in 30 seconds ? If not , you need to learn how . Every good waiter / waitress must be able to open a bottle of wine fast and confidently . You can practice at home with an empty bottle . If you need more help , here is a video that shows how to do it . <p> 8 ) Do you know the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large wine bottle , which holds the same as two normal bottles of wine . A Jeroboam is a large bottle of wine , which holds four regular wine bottles . <p> 9 ) Where is Champagne made ? This is a trick question . Most people think Champagne refers to all types of sparkling wine , but this is not correct . For sparkling wine to be called " Champagne " it must be produced in the province of Champagne , France . Sparkling wine made anywhere else can not legally use the name , Champagne . <p> 10 ) When opening a bottle of wine , is it customary to sniff the cork ? No , there is no reason for anyone to sniff the cork . If you want to smell the wine , smell it directly from the glass . <p> 11 ) What do flat , sparkling , and tap refer to ? Water . Flat and sparkling come in bottles that customers pay for . Tap , or iced refer to water that is free . <p> 12 ) What is a cordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been flavored with fruit , nuts , spices , cream , and sugar . Cordials are typically quite sweet ; and served after dinner , with coffee and dessert . Popular cordials include : Grand Mariner , Frangelico , Kahlua , and Bailys . <p> 13 ) Tawny and Ruby refer to what ? Tawny and Ruby refer to Port wine . Ruby Port is aged for a few years in stainless steel barrels . It has a dark red color and is generally sweet and fruity . Tawny Port is aged much longer in typically wooden barrels . During the aging , Tawny loses its red color and turns brown . <p> 14 ) What do Spanish-speaking people often call coffee ? Most people in Miami call coffee " espresso " or " cafecito . " If someone ask you for a coffee , you should ask them if they want " American " or " espresso " In many restaurants , it is the servers responsibility to also make the coffee . If you are unsure about how to make a proper espresso , here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What is an espresso garnished with ? An espresso is always garnished with a lemon peel . <p> 16 ) What is a 2-top ? A 2-top refers to a table with two people . A 4-top is a table with four persons . <p> 17 ) When you 're co-worker says , " I 'm in the weeds " or " I 'm weeded " what should you do ? Help them , if you can . " I 'm in the weeds " is restaurant slang for " Im way too busy and going under , fast . " I 've only heard phrase used in Miami . Every restaurant has their own slang terms . When you are starting out at a restaurant , learn the slang . Other restaurant-related slang terms include " on the fly , " which means , do it fast , and " 86 , " which means an item from the menu that the kitchen is out of . <p> 18 ) Can you carry 3 plates in 2 hands ? This is another skill you can practice at home . The secret is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can balance the second plate on your pinkie and forearm . For hot plates , use a towel as a layer between your hand and the plate . For more instruction , here is a PDF that shows how its done . <p> 19 ) What side of the guest do you serve from ? Serving etiquette calls for customers to be served from the left and cleared from the right . The reason being , to avoid knocking over a glass . However , work around your customers needs , and try to never ask a guest to hand you a plate , or glass . <p> 20 ) When a customer asks for a steak prepared " blue " what do they mean ? Whenever a customer orders a steak , it is the waiters responsibility to ask them how they want it prepared . If the customer says " blue , " it means , they want the steak cooked extra , extra rare . <p> 21 ) What is a good excuse to say to a customer when you forgot to order their meal ? Blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Chef dropped your plate , or the kitchen gave your food to the wrong table . <p> 22 ) Can you sing " Happy Birthday " with gusto ? If you choose a career in the restaurant industry , be prepared to sing " Happy Birthday " a few times , every night . I understand that singing to a group of strangers can feel embarrassing . The best thing to do , is put a big smile on and just go for it . Singing Tip : start the song off in a low key . <p> 23 ) When is it OK to argue with a customer ? Never . If you encounter an angry customer , get your manager involved . Good servers enjoy making people happy . If you 're in a bad mood when you come to work , check your attitude at the door . <p> 24 ) What are the tools of the trade ? Here is my best tip for how to look like a star on your first day of workshow up with all your tools : a wine opener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 25 ) What does T.I.P.S stand for ?

Throughout the year , she offers ocean cruises to Caribbean . <p> Check Dates &amp; Prices for cruises to Caribbean . <p> Royal Caribbean has launched Freedom of the Seas . It takes the itle " biggest-ship-ever " from Cunard 's Queen Mary 2 . <p> While this ship features many Voyager-class signatures -- ice skating rink , indoor promenade , rock climbing wall -- the 1608,000-ton , 4,375-passenger ship also offers some unique-to-cruising features . Freedom of the Seas will have three separate pool " regions " ( Voyager class ships have just two ) . In detail : <p> Absolutely , the coolest new spot will be the H2O Zone , a fabulous interactive water park . Whimsical and playful -- and most definitely aimed at families -- features include numerous water-spouting contraptions , such as a waterfall , umbrella jets , a cone spill bucket , spray cannons , spray loops and pipefalls , all decorated as colorful sculptures . There are two splash pools as well , one of which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At night , this area , with the integration of a fantastic and dynamic lighting system , will be transformed into a sculpture garden . <p> Another first-ever feature is a dedicated sports pool in the main pool area . Like Voyager-class vessels , there are two side-by-side pools that comprise that part of the deck , but in this case one will be used almost exclusively for athletic pool games , ranging from basketball and volleyball to pole jousting and synchronized swimming . Other times , it will have designated lanes for lap swimming . <p> One more brand-new feature is the wave machine . FlowRider generates a thin sheet of water that flows over the surface , creating a wave-like shape . <p> Riders surf or body board against the waterflow of 30,000 gallons per minute . At night , designers hope to entice passengers back to the main pool area with an open-air nightclub . There 's a large dance floor between the two pools and Royal Caribbean anticipates themed parties and disco events . The solarium pool is more than just a " stretched " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in look , and featuring an additional row of loungers , there are two cantilevered whirlpools that are tucked into a bow-like window 112 ft. above the water . They 're pretty gigantic ; each one holds 16 . Just as nifty is a series of free-standing hammocks scattered about the solarium . <p> The rock-climbing wall has expanded , going from the 30 x 33 ft. model on Voyager-class ships to one that 's 43 x 44 ft. , and this one will have additional spire for climbing . In all there are 11 routes to climb . <p> Beyond the pool areas , the only real details Royal Caribbean would share concerned some new ideas about staterooms . Cruise Critic has already reported that staterooms on Freedom of the Seas will be larger than those found throughout the rest of the fleet and that all will be outfitted with flat-screen televisions . <p> But what was revealed in May was the creation of new concepts in staterooms ( popular and familiar sizes , such as royal suites , will continue to be featured ) . <p> Family travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seas will offer family-friendly cabins in a variety of categories , from insides to promenade view to ocean view . These will feature alcoves with bunk beds for kids and some will feature bathrooms with tubs , not just showers . <p> The presidential suite is the largest ever on a Royal Caribbean ship . Not only does it clock in at 1,215 square ft. ( and that 's just inside the balcony measures an additional 810 square ft. ) , it has four bedrooms , and four full baths . The verandah is complete with a whirlpool , wet bar , alfresco dining , and loungers for just about everyone . <p> Overall , Richard Fain , Royal Caribbean Cruises ' top honcho , told the assembled gatherers in May that Freedom of the Seas " emphasizes an all-inclusive " something-for-everyone atmosphere in which freedom of choice is the mantra . We 'll be interested to see how that applies to interior features -- from Adventure Ocean and the teens ' Living Room to alternative restaurants and shops -- and will feature those innovations as soon as they 're unveiled .

@@45271818 @5271818/ <h> Why the lack of professional jobs in Miami ? <p> Miami is the capital of Latin America . It just happens that geographically it 's in the United States . I think the lack of jobs here is a result of many companies not wanting to business in a foreign country , otherwise known as Miami . <p> I find that chain restaurants that begin in NY or LA gladly open a restaurant in Miami . However , top law firms , publishing houses , financial institutions skip Miami when opening other offices . <p> So for restaurants you 'll see <p> Los Angeles-New York-Las Vegas-Miami <p> And for law firms you 'll see <p> New York-Boston-Chicago-Los Angeles <p> I know some regulars think new residents only last 1 or 2 years here , but it 's not due to the traffic , the hurricanes , or the some people having a problem with Latin Culture .. it 's the lack of professional jobs . <p> I think it is partly because it is a young city , and partly because of the hurricanes . And , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . <p> The thing is , businesses , like people , like to be where others like themselves are . Ever wonder why so many computer-technology businesses ended up in Silicon Valley ? Is it because there is more sillicon there to make computer chips out of ? Of course not . <p> Why are all the financial institutions in New York ? Why so many industrial companies in the rust belt ? Why all the movie companies in LA ? History . Decades or centuries ago , some started there , and others gathered . <p> Miami originally was a farming and port town . Miami Beach was built specifically as a resort town . Heavy industry and professional business has not historically been part of the mix . <p> In addition , there have been several devastating hurricanes . None terribly recently , but large , long-term corporations look at that kind of stuff . <p> It takes time and effort to move that kind of corporate lethargy . Corporations do not often move their offices . When they do , they look for a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need to offer something more than other cities offer . <p> Coach , those are some good points , but I think you missed one of the most important : the skill level of the workforce . Miami ranks very low on that scale . <p> The other very important factor you forgot is the education system , again very mediocre in Miami when compared to other US cities . Perhaps the two are related . Many of the largest companies do n't start out large and then decide where to locate , they usually are homegrown , with the founders being graduates from that area . Thus silicon valley is near great colleges like Stanford and Berkeley . <p> It 's a bit of a chicken and egg problem , but no city can be greater than the sum of its residents . <p> I 've used to work for a major company relocating HQ 's and such . Miami would never even make the short list . The biggest reason was the lack of educated people and inferior labor pool . There is n't a big named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles .

I never bought into to argument that this niche is needed . If you ever wanted to start a ruckas in my household , it 's as easy as arguing that Heineken 's cultural differnces commercial is bogus . The Mrs.is a VP at an agency that soley targets the hispanic market . <p> Cruise lines , Burger King , and some banks . I mean , I 'm sure there are others , but that 's about it when you think about major coroporations based in Miami . <p> Face it , we are not a serious town .

I think Spanish has a lot to do with it , but past that you 'd think it would make competition easier for those of us who bothered getting diplomas . Soooooo not the case . Like it or not , the cultural makeup of Miami makes it more difficult to find a job if you are not Hispanic .

I grew up in Venice on the west coast and I remember there being two Royal Castle locations in Sarasota : one on the northeast corner of US41 and Bahia Vista St. and the other at the southwest corner of US41 and Stickney Point Rd .

The Bahia Vista location became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oaks Bar-B-Q which stayed in that building for a number of years but relocated some years back to a bigger building farther north on 41 . I have n't lived in Sarasota for over fifteen years so I can not say if either building still stands . <p> Am I correct about Royal Castles TV ads ? It was known as , " The hamburger place where people who love to eat , love to eat .

There was a Royal Castle at the corner of Hollywood , Blvd and State road 441 or hwy 7 as we locals knew it . I would eat breakfast there every morning after swim team practice . They also served typical southern breakfast sausage patty eggs and grits . I spent three years in Casablanca Africa from 1953-1956 . When we got off of the USS Willam S. Lykes in Tampa , Fla. , I asked my parents to take me straight to ROYAL CASTLE . I ate 12 burgers and two Birch Beers . A truck driver bought me the second birch beer after seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough money for another birch beer . I grew up on these great burgers &amp; I am glad to see that they are still around I will make it a point to visit one of the remaing ROYAL CASTLES when I come to MIAMI to visit my family .

By the time the dust settled all burgers were acounted for and soon evaporated with ease .

My brother made a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge route , he must have made a mint ) . The last meal I had with my grandfather was at a Royal Castle , probably around 1967 or 68 , before going out fishing together on a party ( head ) boat . My grandfather got very seasick on that trip , which I do n't  think he ever had before . I do n't  remember seeing a McDonalds until long after that , though we were eating at Burger King by then , which I did n't  like . I do remember when I was younger , I loved eating those little Royal Castle hamburgers , and the Birch beer . But I also remember feeling that the cost added up too quickly in relationship to my appetite when I was paying for them myself . I needed my money for more important things , like slot cars and movies . <p> Posted on 09/10/2013 at 8:31 AM <p> John Lipe says : <p> During years at Miami High(59) we , almost daily , went to Royal Castle Near 37 th Ave and Tamiami Trail , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen mug.The man who usually served us was named Mr. Johnson , his son also attended MHS.One day , when we first started going in there , he told us to quit " mumbling " when we placed our order .

@@45271865 @5271865/ <h> Ana Maria Angel : The Abduction and Murder of a Miami Local <p> In a city where daily stories of brutal murder are generally read with the same passing apathy as a West Coast box score , it becomes hard to find a crime that will shock anybody in South Florida . But that is exactly what happened in the spring of 2002 , when two South Miami high school seniors went out for a date , and one of them never came back . This horrific tragedy saddened even the hardest of Miami hearts when honor student and soccer captain Ana Maria Angel was found shot to death on the side of Interstate 95 near Boca Raton , having been brutally gang-raped and her boyfriend assaulted to within an inch of his life . The first of the five men charged with this crime was sentenced to death this past summer , and to many it seemed an appropriate punishment for perhaps the most brutal and viscous act of random violence in Miami history . <p> HORROR IN SOUTH POINTE PARK <p> On the night of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out to celebrate their five-month anniversary with dinner at Los Ranchos in Bayside . After the meal , the couple decided to go for a romantic moonlit stroll near South Pointe Park in south beach . As the walk ended , the couple attempted to return to their car when they were ambushed by five men , one wielding a gun and another a knife . They forced the couple into pickup truck , and dragged them off for a night of incomprehensible terror . <p> According to testimony from Portobanco and the accused criminals , the men , concerned about security guards who regularly patrolled the area , forced the couple to the floor of the rented Ford F-150 . They told Portobanco to put his head between his knees , then demanded Angel 's ATM card and PIN . Upon receiving both without objection , the assailants stopped at an Amoco station on the 3600 block of Biscayne Boulevard and withdrew some money , stopping at another gas station before heading north on I-95 . <p> Once on the highway , several of the men made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being held . Portobanco was repeatedly assaulted and forced to keep his head down while the attackers held his girlfriend . As she cried and begged them not to , the assailants took turns raping her as the truck sped up the highway . They brutalized the young woman for almost 20 minutes , which must have seemed like an eternity to Portobanco as he heard , but could not see , what was happening to Angel . <p> As the truck reached north Broward County , the men forced Portobanco from the truck and , behind some shrubs that shielded them from on-looking cars , beat and stabbed him over ten times . The teenager decided to play dead in hopes of the attack stopping before he was killed . After slitting his throat , the assailants kicked Portobanco a few more times , then stomped his head to the ground for good measure before taking off in the truck . Portobanco , thinking that Angel had also been thrown out of the vehicle , searched for her briefly before running to the shoulder of the interstate to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital , where he reported the crime . <p> As the attackers realized their rental truck was due back in Orlando the next day , they quickly decided to rid themselves of their last victim , Ana Maria Angel . When they were finished raping her , they pulled over just before the Palmetto Park Road exit in Boca Raton , dragged her to a retaining wall , and as she begged for her life shot her once in the head at point blank range . For the first few days after the crime , the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and local authorities conducted a massive manhunt for Angel , as Portobanco and her family hoped she would be found alive . Family members even left voicemail messages on her cell phone begging the kidnappers no to harm her . But a few days later Angel 's body was found right where the killers had left it , her hands frozen in a praying position , as if she had died begging for her life . <p> BAD GUYS GET CAUGHT QUICK <p> It did not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the killers . Going off a traced cell phone call and some anonymous tips , the combined authorities arrested five men in Orlando . By April 30 , FDLE officials had arrested brothers Victor Manuel Caraballo and Hector Manuel Caraballo , Joel Lebron , Cesar Mena and 16 year-old Jesus Roman for the murder , assault , robbery and rape of the couple . <p> Lebron , who broke down in tears during his confession , admitted to being the shooter . Intent on killing the young woman , Lebron admitted that the first two times he had tried to shoot Angel his weapon had not fired because no bullet was in the chamber . Only after his third attempt , and listening to the young woman beg for her life as his revolver would not fire , was he able to complete his crime . His confession also led police to Angel 's body , saddening investigators but giving them enough evidence to move forward with the case . The suspects were all brought to Miami-Dade County and held under suicide watch . All had threatened to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KILLER <p> After being transported to Dade County 's Metro West Detention Center , Lebron was quick to take advantage of what he perceived as his celebrity-criminal status . What he did not understand , however , is that this criminals ' reverence is held for perpetrators of spectacular crimes , not cowardly acts of disgusting violence . Especially ones for which you are caught in less time than it took to commit the crime . So while Lebron bragged incessantly upon his initial incarceration about the evening of April 27 , his fellow inmates were , appropriately , disgusted . Even hardened criminals , apparently , find it offensive when you brag about raping and killing an innocent girl . And so within a few weeks of arriving at Metro West , Lebron was transferred into protective custody after it was discovered that inmates were planning to kill him long before he would ever stand trial for the brutal crime . <p> While in protective custody at the pretrial detention center , Lebron then tried to arrange a hit on both a family friend who he believed turned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could testify against him . Lebron , apparently , was not familiar with DNA evidence often gathered at rape scenes . When word of his attempts reached the police , they sent an undercover detective in to meet with Lebron to arrange the hit . His offering price : $250 . Lebron was never charged with anything as a result , but it was troubling for those on the outside who still fear man who has long since been put behind bars . <p> A BOTCHED CONFESSION <p> While everyone in South Florida , from its most upstanding of citizens to the dregs of its jails , was disgusted with the South Pointe 5 , fortune would prove to be their only friend . Lebron 's confession , considered a key piece of evidence in not only his prosecution , but in that of the other four defendants , was apparently non-existent . That is not to say that it never happened , but when Miami Beach Police Detective Larry Marrero sent tapes of the confession to FDLE agent Ed Royal , who had also been an important part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assuming Marrero had sent him the wrong tapes , Royal asked for the detective to send another copy . When he went to copy the originals , Marrero discovered that those too were blank . <p> Apparently , the device used to record the confession had two settings , one to record telephone conversations and the other to record live ones . Marrero had not switched the setting over from his previous use of the device , and therefore recorded 90 minutes of dead air , leaving no audible proof of what Lebron had told him . <p> One would think investigators would be crushed by such a blow , but thanks to DNA evidence and witness testimony , prosecutors were able to continue with the case . It would n't have mattered anyway : Judge William Thomas threw out the confession as he ruled the suspect had not been properly advised of his Miranda rights . <p> THE FIRST TO GET PUT AWAY <p> While the dismissal of a confession and the lack of a good eyewitness ( Portobanco later admitted he could not positively identify at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign for those seeking justice for Ana Maria Angel , DNA evidence and testimony from the defendants themselves has proven enough to convict at least of the killers thus far . As each member of the South Pointe 5 has claimed to have done nothing but watch the others commit the crime , prosecutors have applied the felony statute to the case , holding anyone associated with the committing of a crime as responsible as the one who actually did it . <p> The first to stand trial was Victor Caraballo , who claimed not only to have not beaten or killed anyone , but not to have raped Angel either . He says he feared he would catch AIDS if he had done so . His brother Hector , who was infected with the disease , had already raped her repeatedly . He claimed the DNA evidence found on Angel 's body was from his masturbating on her , and as such he was not guilty of the rape . The jury saw it differently . <p> This past April , nearly five years after the horrific crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armed sexual battery and two counts of armed kidnapping and armed robbery . The jury recommended the death penalty , and Judge Thomas agreed . Caraballo had requested the death penalty . He faced life in prison without the possibility of parole and , claiming mental illness , said he did not want to spend the rest of his life in prison . As it stands , that is exactly what he will do , but his life will be , at least presumably , considerably shorter . <p> A HOPEFUL PRECEDENT FOR SURVIVORS <p> It is not certain if similar fates await the other four men involved in the crime . Caraballo was the first to stand trial , but this means that in order to see justice carried out Portobanco and Angel 's family will have to endure reliving that horrific night four more times . If Caraballo 's case is used as a precedent , it is not unlikely that three others will also receive the state 's ultimate penalty .

A similar case , filed against the City of Miami Beach , has been dropped . The system will deal with the criminals but she , and her co-plaintiff Portobanco , seek the financial damages for the pain and suffering they have endured . Penrod 's , which owns much of the property around where the assault began , has not commented on the issue due to pending litigation . <p> The reason this particular crime shook crime-ridden South Florida so much is simple : When one reads about drug dealers killing one another , or rival gang members in a bad neighborhood shooting each other up , or even tourists getting shot by vicious street criminals , locals believe it still wo n't happen to them . I 'm not a drug dealer , I 'm not in a gang , I 'm not a tourist stupid enough to get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an innocent Miamian out doing what millions of us have done week in and week out , it scares you . It makes you realize that as safe as you usually are , you never know who is lurking behind the bushes . Even in what is generally considered a rather safe area south of Fifth . <p> So while many in Miami will watch the next four trials rooting for justice for Ana Maria and her family , we are also rooting for ourselves . For the next time anyone takes a moonlit stroll on the beach , they may not be fearful , but they will no longer feel as comfortable as they might have before April 27 , 2002 . And that loss , while minuscule compared to that of Osario and Portobanco , is enough to make everyone in South Florida hungry for justice . <p> UPDATE : On November 8 , 2007 , a Miami jury convicted Cesar Mena on one count of murder , two counts of armed kidnapping , two counts of robbery .

Throughout the year , she offers ocean cruises to Europe , Mediterranean , and Panama Canal . Check dates and prices for cruises to Europe , Mediterranean , and Panama Canal . <p> Such as ? You 'll find classics like the Schooner Bar , but there 's also miniature and simulated golf , and the Seaview Cafe . Some Royal Caribbean traditions have received new twists . The revamped Viking Crown Lounge is called the Starquest DiscoBar and the bar actually revolves . Business and conference facilities have been expanded on this ship . Latte-tudes Coffee bar , which replicates a coffeehouse atmosphere -- complete with Internet terminals -- replaces Radiance 's cafe/bookshop combo . <p> One of the immediate impressions we got on Brilliance of the Seas was an imitation of a cash register ringing in our ear : K'ching . Royal Caribbean seems to be moving into " a'la carte territory " . By this , we mean spending beyond the usual stuff , like shore excursions , spa services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take Pathway to Yoga at the fitness center , 99 cents-and-up to buy a pastry from Latte-tudes , $9.95 to watch relatively recent-run movies on RCTV , and a $20 service fee to eat in the ship 's alternative restaurants . <p> On the plus side , Royal Caribbean has been introducing beverage packages that can cut costs . These include soda cards ( for adults , the package averaged out at about $5 a day , while kids paid about $3 a day ) . At this point , Royal Caribbean 's the only line to offer an adult " Royal Cocktails " card ; for $39 plus tip passengers can buy 12 drinks of the house variety , which works out to about $3.25 per drink , saving roughly $1.75 each time ) . <p> Brilliance of the Seas tries to be all things to all cruisers . While the ship 's smaller than the Voyager , it does have enough room for all the extras we 're coming to expect on contemporary cruise ships : a range of restaurant options , a fitness facility with rock-climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basketball court . There are so many bars that even after a 12-day cruise we 're not sure we found them all . And service was generally warm and personable . <p> But that " big ship " atmosphere has a down side , too . While the ship 's layout aims to spread passengers out , it can get congested ( and passengers often got a bit aggressive , particularly at the elevators ) at " rush hours " , at the guest relations/shore excursion desk early and late in the voyage , and , most particularly , getting back on board when shore excursion buses all pull up at the same time late in the afternoon . <p> Cabins <p> Brilliance of the Seas is the second in Royal Caribbean 's new Radiance class . The ship 's layout and facilities combine some of the best features from the larger Voyager class and the smaller Vision class ships . <p> Of a total of 1,050cabins , 813 have an ocean view ; of these , 577 have balconies ( about 77 percent , the highest ratio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television with remote , which broadcasts a variety of channels , from RCTV 's interactive network ( where you can order room service or pay-per-view flicks , buy shore excursions or check your onboard tab ) to CNN .

Cabins in categories C and higher have bathrooms with tubs ; all others just have showers . Standard outside cabins are very roomy and attractive and have huge porthole-style windows and loveseats . Standard balcony cabins are about the same size with the additional space of a verandah ; a note : balcony cabins on deck seven face an overhang ( that conceals tenders ) . Inside cabins are surprisingly roomy . <p> Beyond the basic-style cabins , Brilliance has a succession of suites , starting with " C , " which is a more spacious version of the deluxe verandah ( slightly larger balcony ) .

Note : Diamond-level members of Crown &amp; Anchor ( passengers having sailed ten or more Royal Caribbean cruises ) also receive access to the Concierge Lounge regardless of cabin level . <p> Dining <p> In the Minstrel Dining Room , we were pleasantly surprised at the consistently , well-prepared dishes . Minstrel is open seating for breakfast and lunch ; then set seating ( 6 pm for main , 8:30 pm for late ) at dinner time . Romantics may need luck to snag a two-top as there were n't many ( or plan to head to the alternative restaurants ) . <p> Windjammer Cafe was the most popular daytime eatery on the ship . It is a buffet restaurant , open for breakfast , lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onsite bar for soda , wine and beer purchases . And a few outside tables . The food was quite good , though the selection for breakfast got pretty humdrum after a few days . Windjammer also has basic 24-hour beverage stations ( coffee , tea , water ) . <p> We stumbled onto Seaview Cafe by accident and it became a regular lunch/snack place . The atmosphere evokes a cozy beach-front cafe . Seaview is Johnny Rockets with a bigger menu and a beer/wine/soda bar . It is typically open for lunch when the ship is at sea ; on port days , it opens for late afternoon and after-dinner snacking . <p> The Solarium Cafe has a pizza bar and is open all afternoon . <p> Brilliance has two alternative restaurants and both require a $20 per person service fee . Is it worth it ?

One note : On our cruise , the dining rooms at both spots were rarely more than half-filled , yet , the service was inconsistent Later in the cruise , both Portofino and Chops Grille were open for lunch and dinner ; same service fee and menu applies . <p> Room service is available around-the-clock . <p> Entertainment <p> In the Pacifica Theater , there were three major production shows .

The pool area usually had a three-piece band at prime time sunning hours . <p> One big disappointment for movie lovers was the ship 's in-cabin and cinema selection of flicks , some so old that we saw them on cruises last winter . Passengers who want to relax privately with a more current movie need to go for the pay-per-view option . Fitness &amp; Recreation <p> The Spa 's Thermal Suite -- available for an unlimited rate of $50 or a daily cost of $15 -- includes tiled , heated beds ( great for sore backs ) , showers that operate in mist or tropical forms , and ( unisex ) aromatherapy-oriented steam and sauna . <p> The Solarium pool has two whirlpools , along with comfortable , cushion-topped promenade loungers . <p> A running track snakes around the main pool area ; seven times around equals a mile .

Latte-Tudes offers specialty coffees , and the Casino Royale has the usual gaming tables and slots . <p> The Colony Club incorporates four different lounges/rooms . The Bombay Billiards Club has self-leveling pool tables , Singapore Sling is the ship 's events lounge , The Jakarta Lounge has backgammon , checkers and chess tables , and Calcutta Card Club is where guests can play board games and bridge . <p> The ship is well equipped with three Internet stations ( 50 cents a minute ) which seemed more than adequate . One tip : passengers who travel with their own laptops can plug into the ship 's Cyber-Cabin program . For about $10 a day ( a bargain if you go online for anything more than 20 minutes each day ) you can hook up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macintosh computers . One more tip : There 's no guarantee that the satellite will cooperate every time you log on -- whether in the cabin or in one of the workstations . <p> The ship 's library is a disappointment for the size of the ship . Brilliance 's assortment of shops carry from duty free liquor to insignia wear to jewelry to perfumes . Regarding the liquor policy , passengers can buy at duty free prices ( and have their purchases delivered to their cabin on the last day ) or opt for immediate consumption ; the price difference is fairly significant . The duty-free price for a bottle of Absolut vodka was $9.95 ; the immediate takeaway cost for that same bottle is $19.45 . The ship also has a photo area where snapshots taken by ship photographers can be purchased . Adjacent to that are two conference/boardrooms , where all sorts of meetings are held -- as well as interdenominational and Catholic religious services . <p> Brilliance has a state-of-the-art medical facility and also has a helicopter landing pad for emergency medical evacuations . <p> Kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer lab , play stations with video , Adventure Beach with water slide and pool , arts and crafts , games , rock climbing and science fun .

@@45271876 @5271876/ <h> Drink Prices in Miami Beach vs elsewhere <p> Not too long ago I went with a girlfriend to the Blue Bar at Fountainbleau . We each ordered a vodka cranberry . The bill came to $45 . I kept that receipt for a long time , just to remind myself to never drink there again . <p> This weekend I went to Orlando and went to a great bar named Ember with 4 others . I ordered 2 beers , a red wine , a vodka redbull , and a blueberry martini for myself . When the bill came , it was $25 . I laughed so hard the barman asked if everything was all right ? I told him yes , I 'm just from Miami and these prices are ridiculous . <p> I saved the bill but ca n't upload it as it is it too large . If I ever figure it out I 'll show you all . <p> Yeah , shockingly $5 a drink is considered AVERAGE in most cities . Unless you 're going to like the highest-end places in mid-range cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 5 spot . <p> Truth be told , there 's actually a lot of places in South Florida like that , you just have to get off the Beach and venture into the city to find them .

And I 'm not even female ... <h> Re : Drink Prices in Miami Beach vs elsewhere <p> In the college towns near me the average price of a basic mixed drink is probably 4-5 bucks . In a nice place a quality drink averages about 10 . One nightclub I went to in Charlotte , NC had $4 Patron shots on Friday nights . Since tourism drives Miami they can stick it to everyone and continue to thrive , it takes planning to drink on a budget there . <h> Re : Drink Prices in Miami Beach vs elsewhere <p> Originally Posted by Jess <p> Read it and weep Miami Beach locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place and liquor you drink . perhaps what you did not know is that the price is calculated on surrounding competition on the style of venue .. the rent that is paid , the liquor license ... the staff .. security , marketing , dj/music , equipment , etc .. just do n't  look it at like man i can buy a bottle for the price at the store .. yeah i can buy a bottle for that price but that wo n't get you everything else that you went to that bar or club for .. <p> i do agree that some places are overpriced compared to others . nuff said . <h> Re : Drink Prices in Miami Beach vs elsewhere <p> Originally Posted by Fabian G. <p> prices vary from city to city and place to place and liquor you drink . perhaps what you did not know is that the price is calculated on surrounding competition on the style of venue .. the rent that is paid , the liquor license ... the staff .. security , marketing , dj/music , equipment , etc .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a bottle for the price at the store .. yeah i can buy a bottle for that price but that wo n't get you everything else that you went to that bar or club for .. <p> i do agree that some places are overpriced compared to others . nuff said . <p> Fabian , actually I DO look at it like , man I can buy a bottle for ...

I 'm not rich but I like to have a good time <p> Shannon you 're right about the hangover causes . With some liquors the cheap stuff can contribute to a worse hangover but it 's due to the reasons you listed . Low quality Tequila is n't made from 100% Agave and to comply with Mexican law it has to be at least 51% . The other 49% is usually just cheap sugar alcohol so the added sugar content will contribute to a worse hangover . Cheap Scotch is the same way . There 's virtually no difference in Vodka other than a slight different taste . Same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquors would be if you 're sipping it on the rocks or mixed with other high quality liquors and fresh fruit . Anything mixed with more than 50% mixer does n't matter what kind of liquor you get . The whole point of a shot is to get it down quickly and move on to something else , I 'd never shoot anything good because I would n't have time to enjoy it . <p> As far as the prices in Miami vs. everywhere else , I understand the costs to operate the clubs are higher than about anywhere in the country . Unless the employees in Miami are making a killing ( which I doubt ) , the only cost that would be significantly more than anywhere else would be rent . Liquor is pretty much the same everywhere . The furniture , A/V equipment , and building materials are about the same throughout the country . Local taxes may add a chunk but State &amp; Federal taxes , and ABC license wo n't be any different than anywhere else . So unless the employees are making a killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame them one bit for the prices they charge if they can get it . If there were no tourists in Miami they would all be forced to lower their prices or go out of business . Few places cater to the locals because they know where the money comes from . Tourists will continue to go to the most expensive clubs and pay thousands for a bottle . The club owners know this and take advantage of it , it may not be right but it 's business . <p> Ale House in Coral Gables has $5 drinks . Not sure if it 's every night , but I was there one Sunday with Carlos and we definitely took advantage of the prices ! <p> Flanigan 's in Pinecrest ( and I believe all of them , actually ) has 1/2 off EVERYTHING after 9 PM . Not pitchers but drinks . So you can order premium and get half . I 've had martinis there for $3 . I have to double check if it 's only Mon-Fri though . <h> Re : Drink Prices in Miami Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually I DO look at it like , man I can buy a bottle for ...

@@45271881 @5271881/ <p> The Pride of Aloha cruise ship departs from Honolulu , HI . Throughout the year , she offers ocean cruises to Hawaii Islands . <p> Check Dates &amp; Prices for cruises to Hawaii Islands . <p> On our last Pride of Aloha cruise , service was very good . While cuisine was already quite delicious in the ship 's boutique eateries -- Royal Palm Bistro , Kahili and Pacific Heights , we found that standards had risen in Pride of Aloha 's surcharge-free dining rooms , Crossings and Palace . <p> The Hukilau Cafe still offered mediocre buffet-quality fare , but service was good , lines moved quickly , and key food items did n't run out . Our cabin steward was efficient ( if invisible ) . <p> Norwegian Cruise Lines ran into trouble with the debut of Pride of Aloha for two reasons . One was that the ship 's unique American-flagged status meant that 99 percent of its employees must come from the U.S. The U.S. has not been a player in the onboard staffing of cruise ships ; in America , there 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondly , the ship simply was n't ready . In a stroke of extreme bad fortune , Pride of America , the U.S.-flagged new-build initially slated for the official NCL America launch in July 2004 , was swamped while docked at its shipyard during a storm in January of that year and sank to the shallow bottom . As a result of the damage caused , it was delayed for a full year and Pride of Aloha ( formerly known as Norwegian Sky ) was rushed into refurbishment and service . <p> I was on the ship 's first cruise in July , and experienced problems firsthand , and so can report that it has made such a significant turnaround . <p> The ship offers a unique resort-at-sea cruise ; passengers can spend a maximum of 96 hours in ports ( that 's including time in Honolulu on both ends of the voyage ) . And onboard , the ship incorporates elements of Hawaii into just about every aspect of the journey . Its white hull is adorned with a huge floral " lei " of pink , yellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside the multi-story lobby atrium , passengers are welcomed with a lei greeting , and a Hawaiian fantasy of enormous , colorful tiki poles with Gauguin-inspired murals , pots of Hawaiian plants , and painted tiles with Hawaiian designs . Overhead , windsurf sails hang suspended in the air . <p> Cabins <p> Whether you 've booked an inside ( 121 sq ft. ) or a suite , cabins on Pride of Aloha are small . Outside and balcony staterooms both measure 152 sq ft. ; the latter 's balcony adds another 50 sq ft. to the total . That balcony can be a lifesaver in cramped quarters . <p> Regardless of size , cabins are cheerful , and there are mattress pads on the beds and duvet covers stuffed with lightweight down comforters . <p> Bathrooms are disappointing . Our small , shower-only bathroom featured dingy lighting , flimsy nylon shower curtains , and minimal water pressure ( and a water temperature that typically fluctuated from steaming hot to cold ) . <p> Suites come in two varieties . There are 10 penthouses ( 311 sq ft. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whirlpool tub . TVs have VCR 's , and balconies are outfitted with furniture you can actually sit on . There are just four Owner 's Suites . These are about twice the size of the penthouses and also feature living rooms with a dining area and balconies with private hot tubs . All suite passengers are entitled to butler service . <p> Dining <p> While Pride of Aloha offers NCL 's much praised " Freestyle Dining " options , the smaller ( and older ) ship only features a handful of those found on newer and larger vessels like Norwegian Spirit , NorwegianDawn and Norwegian Sun . Still , the dining experience never lacked variety . <p> The ship has two main dining rooms : the Palace and Crossings . At least one is open for breakfast every day , lunch on some days , and both serve dinner from 5:30 - 10pm . Tables for two were plentiful and staff was gracious . <p> Breakfast menus feature a variety of hot dishes , including eggs , omelets , and French toast . There 's a special each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cart stocked with ingredients for Bloody Mary 's and a selection of sodas . <p> Lunch varies ; there are a handful of hot dishes as well as salads . At dinner , the menus are very simple . They do n't change much throughout the cruise , but every day , there is a featured recipe from one of Hawaii 's celebrity chefs . <p> The Hukilau Cafe is the ship 's buffet restaurant and is open for three meals every day.You will encounter lines , particularly during high-traffic times . However , the ship has carved out niches for desserts , soups and NCL 's trademark vegetarian Indian offerings . Food was fair to middling . <p> The ship 's lunch and dinner buffets , held on the pool deck , were fun , festive affairs and ranged from barbecues to Hawaiian fare . <p> Tucked inside the Hukilau Cafe is Sprinkles , an ice cream station . <p> The highlights of the Pride of Aloha dining experience revolve around its three boutique restaurants . My favorite was the Italian-themed Kahili ; it 's elegant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scampi better than its " 40 Cloves of Garlic " version , I have n't tasted it ! Reservations are recommended and there 's a $15 per-person fee . <p> Pacific Heights features an Asian/Pacific Rim menu . The most significant offering here is a sushi menu . It 's priced a la carte but passengers can order up to $12.50 worth ( the amount of the restaurant 's service fee ) without paying . <p> The Royal Palm Bistro is the most romantic restaurant onboard ; save room for the signature chocolate fondue for dessert . <p> Room service for most is fairly limited . But suite residents can order off any restaurant menu at the appropriate times . <p> Entertainment <p> Pride of Aloha has 13 different bars and lounges . The Outrigger Lounge , on Deck 11 , features panoramic views . On more than one night , passengers took to the baby grand to give an impromptu concert . The Plantation Club on Deck 12 is also surrounded by windows , and is a gathering spot for a pre-dinner drink before heading to the Royal Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pub-like lounge . The Cigar Bar is tucked away in the back with an excellent selection of aged Cognacs and a pianist playing pop and show tunes . <p> The Blue Hawaiian nightclub on Deck 6 features a great DJ who manages to get baby boomers , teens , kids and seniors out on the dance floor together . <p> At the pool area on Deck 11 , there 's an assortment of musical entertainment with Hawaiian flair throughout the cruise . On Monday evenings , a regional dance troupe , Tahiti Productions , performs a " South Seas Spectacular " in the ship 's Stardust Theater . Two Las Vegas-style production shows round off the entertainment week in the Stardust . <p> Mother Nature also puts on a spectacular show for Pride of Aloha 's passengers . On Tuesday afternoons , the ship does some scenic cruising along the velvety green cliffs of Kauai 's Na Pali Coast . On Wednesday , Pride of Aloha takes a nighttime pass by the awesome Kilauea volcano on the Big Island . Waitresses serve glow-in-the-dark " lava flow " drinks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under a star-filled sky , there 's nothing like the scene of the fiery orange-red lava flowing down the mountain , and hitting the ocean in a plume of steam . <p> Pride of Aloha 's shore excursion program is exceptional . There are hundreds of offerings covering all the islands and they range from sedentary fare to daredevil adventures . While it 's fairly simple to book your own independent tours with off-ship operators , we appreciated the convenience and the high quality . Fitness &amp; Recreation <p> The Body Waves Fitness Center on Deck 11 is open 24 hours a day , and is equipped with a good selection of treadmills , weight machines and exercise bicycles . There 's an aerobics studio next door that offers yoga , spinning and aerobics classes . <p> When the Fitness Center gets crowded in the late afternoons , a brisk walk on the Promenade deck is a great way to burn off some calories ( 3.5 laps equals one mile ) and admire the view . The ship also has a basketball and volleyball court , and two golf-driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubs , as well as a shallow children 's pool . <p> The ship 's Body Waves Spa offers standard treatments , such as facials , manicures and hair styling . There 's a Hawaiian twist to some of their offerings , such as Lomi Lomi massage and Coconut Body Polish . There 's also a beauty salon that offers the usual services . Prices range from average to outrageously expensive . <p> One highlight of Pride of Aloha is its golf operation . NCL Golf Hawaii offers club and shoe rentals , onboard clinics and loads of golf-themed paraphernalia . The ship also boasts a wide variety of golf-oriented shore excursions ; cost for these includes green fees , transportation , and club rental ( you can bring your own clubs , but there 's a storage charge -- and we heard from golfers onboard that they were happy with the rentals ) . <p> Public Areas <p> The central focus of Pride of Aloha is its three-deck-high atrium .

My experience with this line was not one I 'd recommend . The food was really unacceptable and the restaurant service so slow it would take hours to get through a meal . The cabin was OK but small , the balcony a saving grace . I feel sorry for anyone without a balcony . Of all the cruise lines advertised and the money it costs to book a cruise , this line should be avoided .

A map of the intertwining cities of South Florida might momentarily impress you with its ample patches of green , but a closer inspection reveals that many of them are golf courses . <p> This week , I went off in search of spaces where you can find relief from the big city . The good news is that there is still a little outdoor real estate left in the area that does n't  contain sandtraps and caddiesbut the bad news is that Miami has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free and park . <p> Of the eleven I checked out , a hodgepodge of private , state , county , and municipal parks , only 5 had no admission charge whatsoever : Tropical Park , AD " Doug " Barnes , Pinecrest Gardens , Flamingo Park , and The Miami Beach Botanical Gardensand , technically speaking , the last three do n't  really count , since they 're not in Miami at all <p> Even among the municipal and county parks officially designated as " free " , there are often " parking fees " which negate the savings . <p> Generally , those affiliated with the Florida State Park system charge a nominal $4-5 per car ( or $3 for single-occupants ) , and $1-2 for bikes and pedestrians . Frequent visitors to the state parks may want to purchase an annual pass ( $43.40 for individuals , $85.80 for families ) , which entitles you to unlimited admissions to all of them ( " some surcharges may apply " ) , with the exception of Homosassa Springs and Skyway Fishing Pier , where a 33% discount applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at national or other parks where fees are charged , but at least there is one consolation : despite the lack of adequate municipal parkland , the state parks here are among the most beautiful anywhere to be foundassuming you 're willing to pay for the scenery . <p> My visits comprised area parks in both categoriesfree and feeand this is how they stacked up : <p> If your nature experience requires some extreme heart-pumping excitement , and the Monster Truck Show is still a few months away , take a little trip out to Oleta River State Park in North Miami ( 3400 NE 163rd St. , east of the I-95 , Miami , 305-919-1844 ) , where you can quench your need for speed as you mountain bike your way around wild curves and over spine-tingling hills and dips .

Minutes later , you 're in Biscayne Bay , where a series of small , uninhabited palm tree-studded islands tempt the Robinson Crusoe in you . No boat , no bike , no motor car ? No worries ! The Blue Moon Outdoor Center has a convenient location just off the main park road , shortly after the entrance station , where you can rent bikes , canoes and kayaks at reasonable hourly rates .

In this popular childrens park , there are pony rides to be had , and an ample supply of goats , cows , horses , chicken , sheep , and donkeys there for the petting . A demonstration shed provides opportunities for kids and adults alike to experience rural pasttimes such as sheep-shearing , cow-milking and horseshoeing .

They just turn into verdant , tropical paradises . Before Parrot Jungle moved to the MacArthur Causeway in 2003 and morphed into Jungle Island , it occupied this 14 acre space in the city of Pinecrest . Today , the parrots former home has been transformed into Pinecrest Gardens ( 11000 Red Road , Pinecrest , FL 33156 , 305-669-6942 ) , a beautifully landscaped enclosure , shaded by lofty banyans and luxuriant tropical vegetation .

Today , a cement sidewalk with coral edges winds its way through tropical foliage so fancy and thick that it often feels like you 're in an enormous greenhouse . Streamlets and pools abundant in turtles , cyclids , and coy accent the greenery , though the meticulous landscaping gives it all a slightly unnatural feel . Tossed into the mix are a few abandoned bird cages and miniature amphitheatres once used for wildlife shows , now hauntingly silent . Apart from the natural attractions , it also features a petting zoo , butterfly exhibit ( curiously empty the day we visited ) , and " Splash n Play , " a water area open to children ages 2-12 for a $3 admission charge . No smoking allowed . More photos here . <p> MIAMIS WOODSIEST RETREAT : GREYNOLDS PARK <p> I may have saved the best for last .

However , unlike Oleta Park , whose pine forests are dedicated to rigorous cross-country mountain bike riding , Greynolds satisfies more for those who enjoy a leisurely stroll beneath the endless oaks or a picnic by the river . <p> Although a dreaded golf course has encroached on some of the land , it provides basking ground for oodles of skiddish iguanas , who go racing across the green to an adjacent riverside nature trail when people draw near , where they hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More pics here . <p> HELPFUL HINT : The park is free on weekdays , and relatively free of people , also .

There 's much more to experience , like the 35 acre Fruit and Spice Park in Redland , for example ; or Bill Sadowski Park , with its 30 acres of tropical hardwood hammock . Even so , for its surface area , Miami does n't  appear as enthusiastic about its shrubbery as it could be . Ask a local why there are n't  more parksor at least something akin to a sprawling Central Park in Miami , and the response is generally that the weather here is just too hot much of the year to enjoy the outdoorsunless there is a lot of water involved .

There are a few boats here and there , but it is n't really crowded at all . That has to be the quintessential Miami experience ! <p> I would also like to add that I would think that kayaks would have the right of way , because in other right-of-way situations , the less powerful vehicle always gets the right of way , e.g. , a pedestrian has the right of way over a bike , a pedestrian and a bike have the right of way over a car , etc . <p> Excuse me for reproducing here some dialog that I hope sheds some light on the issue ... <p> On Aug 14 , 1:09 pm , " Lee Bell " &lt;pleeb ... @bellsouth.net&gt; wrote : &gt; ComandanteBanana wrote &gt; &gt; &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sardine in their &gt; &gt; eternal quest to survive the big fish ... &gt; &gt; Glad to hear it since you do not appear to be competent to defend your &gt; position on the issues you did address . <p> Perhaps gaining ground for the little boats out there is ambitious enough not to take upon my shoulders the defense of the whole sardine population . <p> &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue here is , WHY A KAYAK OR CANOE MUST GIVE THE RIGHT OF &gt; &gt; WAY TO THE MOTORBOATS ? &gt; &gt; Here is is in a nutshell .

I make a habit of doing that for vessels small enough that going &gt; behind them , through their wake , is not a problem while forcing them to go &gt; through mine might be . On the other hand , if you were paddling into his &gt; path , you also had the option to give yourself more room . <p> Which means , I should stop paddling and become a sitting duck , not a slow duck . <p> You know my strategy ? Just ignore him , and go on living like this is my last day . ; ) <p> &gt; &gt; Mostly , I think you think you should have equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't able to impose your will on those bigger than you are .

Some cops are good just as some boaters are good , and even deserve to be called captains . <p> Comandante , I hear the place to kayak and snorkel is just north of Venetian Causeway , near the old site for Miami&amp;#39 ; s failed real estate development , Isola di Lolando . Have you been there before ? <p> From the Causeway , you can see a bunch of pilings in the water , that create a peaceful habitat for kayakers , dolphin , manatee , and many types of fish due to the restrictions on boat and jet ski traffic . <p> Where are you kayaking at ? <p> The first time we put our kayak in the water , we ran into a crocodile . It scared us so much , we considered selling our kayak . <p> I go to that area but mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair game to the speeding boats that frequent that area . <p> My suggestion , unless you 'd rather attempt a citizen 's arrest on the water , pick spots that have less or even restricted motor traffic . I know you should n't have to change how you boat , but you would n't swim in chum while surrounded by Great Whites , would you ? <p> Gus offers a great option Comandante . You can also try the Gables Waterway or even the river . While they both allow motorboats , they are in no wake zones so you wo n't get manateed , I mean run over . <p> Like I said the bay is beautiful and pretty safe at night . Otherwise I take the risk on the ocean provided I 'm visible enough . If they ca n't spot sunrise kayak and paddle and red flag , they wo n't see the Majesty of the Sea . well , they do see that because they ai n't stupid . <p> One of my favorite places to go kayaking is Oleta River Park . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off from a peaceful mangrove lagoon , out through a little cove to Biscayne Bay . Once you enter the bay , there is this little coconut palm-covered island you can ride out to . There are a few boats here and there , but it is n't really crowded at all . That has to be the quintessential Miami experience ! <p> Nice spot . I was there just yesterday on bike . Been there by kayak too , once . <p> ( Hey citizens and guests of Miami . Maybe you have been aboard more motorboats than me , so you can tell the truth about the issue ) <p> On Aug 14 , 1:09 pm , " Lee Bell " &lt;pleeb ... @bellsouth.net&gt; wrote : <p> &gt; They 're called Captains or pilots , not drivers .

You know full well that the best of my SCRAPS , after you , go to the Little Animals ... Well , I want you to write LAWS , so from now on it 'll be them , and not me , who would rule over this God chosen kingdom ... " <p> After a few months of hard deliberations ( and a few " private parties " and " business trips " ) the Foxes ( now turned politicians ) returned with a long , long book of laws written in a language so hard to understand to the Little Animals that they thought it was old Greek . After translation , it started like this : " The animals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with paws and teeth will be above the Laws ; and the animals who will represent the interests of the Little Animals , us , will be granted a raise in benefits and status ... Of course , ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION will be considered ILLEGAL , and will result in the Lion eating the Little Animal ... " ( Moral : The trick is in the law. )

In a former lifetime it was a warehousethe " Public Storage " of its daya repository built in 1926 into which wealthy residents could deposit their most valuable possessions , safe from the scourge of Mother Nature , while they escaped the hot and humid summers of a world before air-conditioning . <p> Over half a century later in 1992 it was established by the Wolfsonian Foundation as a museum and research facility , and subsequently donated to Florida International University in 1997 , where it and its sister location in Genoa , Italy continue to provide an intriguing experience of industrial modernism in the form of style , substance and ideas . <p> In addition to its collections , the museum also features the Dynamo Museum Shop and Cafe , named for the Edison Dynamo generator occupying the hallway outside its entrance . You do n't  need tickets to visit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit back and leisurely enjoy some of their Indian chicken curry with mango chutney sauce , or Spanish tapas , while sipping a cup of French-press coffee or a glass of wine . <p> Its an ideal way to spend the day away from the sun ( or the rain ) and the hustle bustle . But while you 're there , be sure to save a toast for Mitchell Wolfson , Jr. , without whose efforts none of this would have been possible . <p> MICKY WOLFSON - THE MAN AND HIS VISION <p> Since his birth in 1939 , Miami Beach native Mitchell " Micky " Wolfson , Jr . has always been a collector . It started with keys . Hotel keys , cabin keys , little reminders of his many travels with his family , who operated a chain of movie theatres in South Florida . As he grew up , his collection came to include an eclectic assortment of posters , paintings , furniture , appliances , ceramics , glassware , and assorted artifacts , most of which centered on a couple of recurring themes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded it , spanning the years between 1885 and 1945 . <p> " They talk to you just as another person would , " he notes , careful to emphasize that propaganda need not be malicious in nature . <p> Armed with a 1963 BA degree in comparative literature from Princeton University , as well as a subsequent Masters in International Relations from John Hopkins , he continued his travels , spending five years in the diplomatic service in Miami , Washington , Genoa and Turin between 1966 and 1971 . <p> Wolfson maintained his contacts in Genoa , and today operates the second branch of the Wolfsonian there . Says Wolfson , the Genoa location is " flourishing brilliantly in a converted mineral-water warehouse . There are 10,000 objects and a staff of three . Weve published two books there on architecture , we loan objects , participate in symposia ; we have connections to the scholarly community in Italy . " <p> In the years following his diplomatic service in Italy , his holdings grew to number over 120,000 objects . They spoke of social , economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobilize the global workforce , of resourcefulness and imagination . <p> Once you 've amassed this much stuff , you basically have two options : hold the mother of all garage sales , or showcase it for future generations to enjoy . Fortunately for us , Mitchell Wolfson , Jr . chose the latter . In 1985 , he purchased the Washington Storage facility which had so long housed his treasures , and a year later he began the Wolfsonian Foundation , as well as The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts , a magazine dedicated to late 19th and early 20th century decorative and propaganda art . <p> Today , he sits on a number of academic , philanthropic , civic boards and advisory councils , actively promoting research , preservation and education . In 2005 , he co-authored the book " Miami Beach : Blueprint of an Eden " , with artist Michele Oka Doner , a romantic retrospective on the local culture from the 1920s through the 1960s . <p> THE THINGS YOULL SEE <p> An impressive lobby leads the way to a rear elevator , which serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temporary exhibits , housed on the 3rd , 5th and 7th floors . On the way there , you 'll pass an exquisite indoor fountain whose surrounding walls proclaim " Lo and Behold " and " Mira Y Ve " a creation of artist Lawrence Weiner , who conceived it in honor of the 2006 Art Basel celebration . Its simply-stated purpose is to elicit a response : it is an affirmation of art as a motivating forcea challenge to let it inspire you to participate in the ever-unfolding drama it presents . The words are presented in both English and Spanish to convey the multicultural make-up of Miami Beach . <p> The elevators first stop was the third floor gallery , which , while rather small in size , nonetheless made a powerful statement with its current exhibit : Indoctrinating YouthSelections from the Pamela K. Harer Gift of Propaganda Books for Children <p> Normally , when I think of propaganda , I generally think of the Soviets , the Nazis , George Orwells 1984 or Tokyo Rose wooing American G-Is during their South Pacific bombing campaigns during World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Riveter , Uncle Sam , and childrens book illustrations not dissimilar from countless Walt Disney and Warner Brothers cartoons forever captured in the annals of my mind , I realized that so much of our own pop culture was no less propagandistic in nature . <p> Next , on the fifth floor , I found the permanent collection : an eclectic amalgamation of roughly 300 works , including advertising and political propaganda , paintings with industrialist themes , sculptures , books , and a few surprising relics : a couple of primitive vacuum cleaners , some vintage radios , and a turn-of-the-century Turkish folding chair . <p> There were materials dedicated to transporation and travel : posters , brochures , models , postcards of cruise ships , zepellins , airplanes and trains , interspersed with relics from the British Arts &amp; Crafts movement , and Italian Art Nouveau . Among the more intriguing curios : a Magic Chef Stove , circa 1935 , rescued from a Miami Beach apartment building and restored to its pristine condition , a tribute to streamlined design . I 'd never thought of a stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less an example of the futuristic Buck Rogers imagination than the Art Deco spires of the hotels on nearby Collins Avenue . <p> The juxtaposition of objects both rare and seemingly mundane inspired me to look at the more common things in a new light . <p> The seventh floor was a cornucopia of Nazi lore . Various swastika-emblazoned posters adorned the walls , in propaganda which both praised and ridiculed the ambitious movement , demonstrating its deceptively benign emergence in the 20s and 30s on handbills and affiches , morphing from what seemed a minor disgruntled labor movement into a sadistic , totalitarian empire . The sterility of the building itself provided a stark contrast to the intensity of the stories these objects told . <p> One particular exhibit that caught my eye was Agitated Images : John Heartfiled &amp; German Photomontage , 1920 " 1938 ( Now through February 10 , 2008 ) . Heartfields works were able to craftily make use of Nazi stances and formalities in ways that emphasized their innate absurdities , by combining various photos in a montage style not unlike the visuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany and Czechoslavakia between the two world wars , Heartfield aptly documented the countrys plunge into chaos and ruin , an environment which allowed Hitler to gain his foothold . <p> MAO MAO MAO <p> The Wolfsonian has been described as many things : a curiosity shop , A " celebration of modernity " , a " house of persuasive arts " , and a tribute to industrial modernist design in technology , philosophy and transportation . It is also , at its core , lest anybody forget , a research and study center , with a program in place awarding fellowships to visiting scholars since 1993 . But , interestingly enough , the one label that Mitchell Wolfson , Jr . wants to avoid is " museum " . At its opening ceremonies on November 12 , 1995 , he proclaimed : " This is a movement , a crusade and a mission , and were all zealots - because we want people to see more than the objects .
