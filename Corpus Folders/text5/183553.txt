@@42737475 @2737475/ <h> Is Cheap Web Hosting Cost You ? <h> Many small business websites and blogs will run fine on cheaper web hosting plans . However , never compromise quality or that web hosting may end up costing you money ! <p> With more than 25 years of experience as a digital marketer , many of my friends have come to know me as a source of information for many things relating to website design as well as search engine optimization . But when my friend Will approached me about recommending a cheap hosting provider for his wifes new custom jewelry business , I was reluctant to make any recommendations . <p> I am not a big fan of cheap web hosting services . While it is true that not every small business website requires a dedicated server or even a VPN , things like uptime and the amount of available dedicated resources are some of the benchmarks by which those seeking low-cost website hosting should be concerned with instead of dollar amounts . <p> With that said , is cheap web hosting costing you money ? More often than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the cheapest hosting may come back to haunt you . Yes , there are bargains to be had and depending on the platform of your website , migrating from one host to another is relatively simple . However , if you are seeking organic traffic , or spending any money on search engine optimization , e-mail marketing , or social media marketing having a quality host becomes very important . When it comes to choosing a hosting provider , you should take a look at what they offer instead of just the cost . Here are four things you should ask any affordable website hosting provider before you buy : <p> Do you have an SLA that includes money back guarantee ? <p> An SLA ( service level agreement ) is a contract where a provider pledges to reimburse a client if the service provided fails to meet the requirements of the agreement . In the case of website hosting services things like a website go offline because of the server crashing should be covered . A good SLA should also cover things like power outages and ISP reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating with the equipment larger data centers have disposed of or sold after renovations . Old , dated servers with a lot of hours on them are prone to fail without notice leaving you with an offline website . While it is important that your hosting provider has an SLA , it is just as important that the contract covers network availability , data center infrastructure , and hardware reliability . <p> Is your data backed up ? <p> Backup is something that normally is not emphasized but extremely important . Some providers offer great deals as long as you manage your account and server . This may include routine backups of web content and databases . It is important that you understand whose responsibilities is this . Unless you are- IT savvy , more often than not you may require a third-party agent to execute the routine , scheduled backups . If you 're going to pay a third party for this service is often a good idea to have the data center do the backup in-house even if this entails an extra expense . <p> How long does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire server ? <p> Once you and your data center have agreed on who 's doing the backup is extremely important to have an idea how long your is your websites going to be off-line in the event of a catastrophic failure . Many data centers operate with skeleton crews and have the bulk of the maintenance done by remote agents overseas . A catastrophic server failure may require an on-site technician to address the issue . If the data center has no available staff or a limited crew , it could be hours if not days before the server is back online . Large data centers , as well as many small top providers , will have standby servers ready to go at a moments notice . However , this quality of service is rarely found at a bargain price . <p> It is human nature to seek a good buy but more often than not those seeking an affordable web hosting platform are more concerned about the actual cost than the performance . Regardless of how much a hosting account cost , if it is constantly going down or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lack of memory or over usage of resources than that hosting account may be costing you money . At the end of the day , you know what they say , you get what you pay for and not a penny less or at anymore . 20738 @qwx430738 <h> RiyaJain <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737494 @2737494/ <p> Later in the day , after we posted our questions , Google changed its mind and gave us some short answers to a few " but not all " of our questions , via an email from a spokesperson . Heres what we learned . <p> 1 . Is the TPU pre-trained ? <p> This is a big one that Google did not answer . It probably is , but we do n't  know for sure . It comes down to whether the TPU is executing an AI algorithm that has been " trained " on a separate system . The classic is example is that to train an AI system to recognize what 's in a photograph , you have to show it millions of photographs and let it learn by trial and error . Once the learning is done , you just let the algorithm run on a chip . Examples of " pre-trained " chips include IBMs TrueNorth and Fathom , from startup Movidius . Chances are pretty good the TPU is too , but Google would n't say . <p> 2 . Can the TPU be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second sub-question included , which requires a bit of explanation . In the taxonomy of chips , the TPU is considered an ASIC , or Application Specific Integrated Circuit . In English : A chip designed to do one thing extremely efficiently . <p> The conceit of our question was this : If AI algorithms change , and logically they should over time , then would n't you want a chip you can reprogram to accommodate those changes ? If that 's the case , then a different type of chip , known as a Field Programmable Gate Array , or FPGA , comes to mind . It allows for reprogramming , unlike an ASIC . Microsoft is notably using FPGA chips for enhance some AI functions in its its Bing search engine . So naturally we wondered , why not use an FPGA ? <p> Googles answer : FPGAs are much less power efficient than ASICs due to their programmable nature . The TPU has an instruction set , so as TensorFlow programs change or new algorithms are developed they can run on the TPU . <p> This answer takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration at Google , whose data centers are both huge and span the world in places as varied as Finland and Taiwan . Higher power consumption raises the cost to operate a data center , and when multiplied many times over it would add up to real money . Googles engineers have weighed the efficiency of FPGAs versus ASICs and decided on the latter . <p> The second part of the answer refers to the TPUs instruction set . This is basically a list of commands hard-coded on chip itself that it recognizes and can perform ; in the chip world , its considered fundamental to a computers operation . <p> The instruction set on the TPU has been created specifically to run TensorFlow , the open source software library designed for creating AI applications . I think Google is saying that if any changes to the underlying AI are necessary , theyll happen in the software , while the chip is flexible enough to accommodate those changes . <p> The technical details of the TPU architecture have gotten a lot of people who think about chips wondering . Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more closely resemble a third type of chip known as a Digital Signal Processor . Let the chin-scratching speculation commence . <p> 3 . Will TPUs work only with TensorFlow ? <p> Since there are about a half-dozen other software languages for AI applications , its natural to wonder if the TPU can work with them too . <p> Googles answer : Other code can run on TPUs , but TPUs are optimized for TensorFlow . <p> 4 . Could several TPUs be connected in a system to work together ? <p> Googles answer : Multiple TPUs were used in the AlphaGo match . So they can work together as part of a larger system . <p> This is a super-interesting answer that triggers SkyNet-like visions of hordes of AI chips outthinking humans at all sorts of things . The AlphaGo match was the human-versus-computer matchup earlier this year , where Googles DeepMind computer defeated Lee Sedol , the human champion of the board game Go . Sedol later scored one for humanity by winning a game . Still , its likely cold comfort for Sedol , knowing he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the server rack , why is the TPU inserted inside a hard drive ? <p> Google had said that the TPU had been inserted in its server racks next to the hard drive , which seems a little odd . Why wouldnt you want it a little closer to the servers CPU , where all the computing action takes place ? <p> Googles answer : The TPU has a PCIe connector . It does n't matter whether a PCIe card is in a motherboard PCIe slot or connected by a short cable . We had room for them in disk slots in our servers , so that was just a convenient place . <p> 6 . Where is the memory ? <p> Googles answer : Under the heat sink . <p> This is just as we thought . If you go back question number one " whether this chip is pre-trained " a trainable chip requires a lot of memory . Judging from Googles photographs , it seems like there 's not room for significant amounts of memory under that heatsink . So there does n't  seem to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TPU is indeed pre-trained . <p> 7 . Where is the chip being built ? <p> Google did n't  answer this one either . Unless its hiding a factory somewhere , it would have to hire someone to build the TPU . The leading candidates are the two largest chip foundry companies in the world : Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and GlobalFoundries . Let the rumors persist . 20738 @qwx430738 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737510 @2737510/ <h> Google 's introduce new Fuchsia OS has a UI now <p> Google , never one to compete in a market with- a single product , is apparently hard at work on a third operating system after Android and Chrome OS . This one is an open source , real-time OS called " Fuchsia . " The- OS first popped up in August last year , but back then it was just a command line . Now the mysterious project has a crazy new UI we can look at , so let 's dive in . <p> Unlike Android and Chrome OS , Fuchsia- is- not based on Linux " it uses a new , Google-developed microkernel called- " Magenta . " - With Fuchsia , Google would not only be dumping the Linux kernel , but also the GPL : the OS is licensed under a mix of- BSD 3 clause , - MIT , and- Apache 2.0. - Dumping Linux might come as a bit of a shock , but the Android ecosystem seems to have no desire to keep up with upstream Linux releases. - Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was first released at the end of 2014 . <p> Googles documentation describes Magenta as targeting " modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors , non-trivial amounts of RAM- with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation . " Google has n't  made any public , official comments on why Fuchsia exists or what it is for , leaving us only to speculate . The " modern phone " shout out certainly sounds like something that could eventually compete with Android , but for now the OS is so early , its hard to tell . <p> Fuchsia is impossible to talk about without mentioning a hundred other related projects that also have code names . The interface and apps- are written using- Googles Flutter SDK , a- project that actually produces cross-platform code that runs on Android and iOS . Flutter apps are written in Dart , Googles reboot of JavaScript which , on mobile , has a focus on- high-performance , - 120fps apps . It also has a Vulkan-based graphics renderer called " Escher " that lists " Volumetric soft shadows " as one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Material Design " interface guidelines . <h> Armadillo , the Fuchsia System UI <p> This all leads us to- an interesting point right now : the Fuchsia- interface is written with the Flutter SDK , which is cross-platform . This means that , right now , you can grab chunks of Fuchsia and run it on an Android device. - Fuchsia first went public in August 2016 , and but back then compiling it would get you nothing more than a command line. - Thanks to- Hotfix.net- for pointing out that the Fuchsia System UI , called " Armadillo " - is actually pretty interesting now . <p> Its possible to download the source and compile Fuchsias System UI into an Android APK and install it on an Android device . It consists of a wild reimagining of a home screen along with a keyboard , a home button , and ( kind of ) a window manager . Nothing really " works " " its all a bunch of placeholder interfaces that do n't  do anything . Theres also- a great readme- in the Fuchsia source that describes what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a giant vertically scrolling list . In the center you 'll see a- ( placeholder ) profile picture , the date , a city name , and- a battery icon . Above the are " Story " cards " basically Recent Apps " and below it is a scrolling list of suggestions , sort of like a- Google Now placeholder . Leave the main screen and you 'll see a Fuchsia " home " - button pop up on the bottom of the screen , - which is just a single white circle . <p> The center profile picture can be tapped on , and here you 'll bring up a menu that 's a bit like Androids Quick Settings . The top row of icons shows the battery and connectivity . Below that you 'll get sliders for volume and brightness , and icons for airplane mode , do not disturb , and auto rotate . You can interact with the buttons and sliders , but they wo n't actually do anything on Android . Below that are buttons labeled " log out " and " more , " which do n't  work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cards labeled " Story something . " The readme describes stories as " a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal . " That seems pretty close to a recent apps list , maybe ( eventually ) with some- kind of grouping feature. - Tapping on any card will load it as a full-screen interface , and since one is labeled " email , " its pretty obvious that these are apps . The list is sorted by " last opened " so the most recently-used cards will sit at the bottom of the list . <p> This list also has some window-management features . You can long press on a card and drag it around , and if you drop it on top of another app , it will trigger a split screen mode . The split screen system seems really capable , and probably needs to be reigned in a bit . - You can do a 50/50 split vertically or horizontally . You can drag in a third app and 33/33/33 split horizontally or vertically , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a tab bar appear for the three full screen interfaces . You can drag in four apps and do a 75/25 split on one side of the screen and 25/75 on the other , and then you can keep dragging in apps until the whole thing crashes . Go back the story list and you 'll see your split screen layout is reflected in the card , too , which is nice . <p> The bottom " Google Now " panel starts with a search bar mockup . Tapping on it will bring up a keyboard , but this is- not- the Android system keyboard , and it is instead a custom Fuchsia interface . It has a new , dark theme , and things like long-pressing for symbols or settings do not work . Below that appears to be- Google Now , which has several " suggestion " cards . They seem to be a little different than Google Nows news , weather , and calendar suggestions though , with the docs saying " Conceptually a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That almost makes it seem- like an app launcher . <h> A long road ahead <p> With any new project at Google , its hard to know what the scale of the project will be . Is this a " 20 percent " project that will be forgotten about in a year or something more important ? Luckily , we have a direct statement from a Fuchsia developer on the matter . In the public Fuchsia IRC channel , - Fuchsia developer Travis Geiselbrecht told the chat room the OS " is n't a toy thing , its not a 20% project , its not a dumping ground of a dead thing that we do n't  care about anymore . " <p> The Fuchsia logo . <p> Android was conceived in the days before the iPhone . It started as an OS for cameras , and then became a BlackBerry clone , before being quickly retooled after the iPhone unveiling . With Android , Google is still chained to decisions it made years ago , before it knew anything about managing a mobile OS that ships on- billions of smartphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now are <p> Getting OS updates rolled out across the third-party hardware ecosystem <p> A lack of focus on smooth UI performance . <p> While there has n't  been anything said about an update plan , the OSs reliance on the Dart programming language means it has a focus on high-performance . <p> Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks- " how would we design Android today , if we could start over ? " Its a brand-new , Google-developed kernel running a brand-new , Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new , Google-developed programming language and its all geared to run Googles Material Design interface as quickly as possible . Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL , it can dump Java and- the problems- it caused with- Oracle , and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Androids upstream projects and bring all the development in-house . Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be- a massive project . <p> The hardest part might not even be developing the OS , but coming up with some kind of transition plan from Android @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating system . The- " cross platform " feature of the Flutter SDK sounds important for a transition plan . If Google could get developers to start writing apps in- Flutter , it would be creating an app ecosystem that ran on iOS , Android , and , eventually , Fuchsia . Google has also shown that it is able and willing the make the Android Runtime work on non-Android platforms- with Chrome OS , - so if Google does choose to go through with a transition plan , perhaps it could port and entire Android stack over to Fuchsia as a stop-gap app solution . <p> Back in August when Fuchsia went public , Geiselbrecht told the Fuchsia IRC channel " The Magenta project started about 6 months ago now " which would be somewhere around February 2016 .

As of publication time , - more than a week later , the resulting 1.3 gigabyte compressed archive file remained available on a popular data breach sharing site on the clear Web . It was easily accessible to anyone , including hacking victims , fellow hackers , and law enforcement agents . The dump was discovered by analysis firm Risk Based Security and confirmed by Troy Hunt , operator of the have i been pwned ? breach disclosure service . <p> " When services such as Nulled.io are compromised and data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain anonymous and hide behind screen names , " the Risk Based Security blog post stated . " By simply searching by e-mail or IP addresses , it can become evident who might be behind various malicious deeds . As you can imagine , this can lead to significant problems for forum users . " <p> The leak provides a fly-on-the-wall account of the bartering that normally takes place only behind closed doors on criminal forums . In one exchange , two members discuss the trading of stolen Bitcoin and PayPal accounts and negotiate a profit share of 5 percent to 10 percent . <p> " Do n't  you make a fortune off Amazon Refunding ? Lol , " one user asks in the exchange , which involves trading $250 worth of bitcoins for $250 in PayPal credit . <p> " I will when my bank is also out of negative balance m8 so I can get the full 250 .

All of the discussions show the IP addresses the members used when making their comments . Assuming they correspond to traceable Internet accounts , the data could be used to reveal the real-world identities of the members.The dump also includes e-mail addresses and password data for as many as 536,000 user accounts . The passwords appear to be protected by MD5 , a hashing algorithm that 's woefully inadequate for storing passwords because the underlying algorithm is so fast . The hashes observed by Hunt have cryptographic salts attached to them , so its possible the MD5 hashes were iterated enough times to make mass cracking impractical . Either way , its surprising that a hacking site that counseled users to expect the unexpected did n't  rely on a more secure hashing function such as bcrypt or PBK2F2 . <p> According to Risk Based Security , the dump also includes details of members purchasing leaked content , stolen credentials , and pirated hacking software . The data cache contains discussions that took place in VIP forums , which allowed members a smaller , more intimate setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are 2.2 million posts , 800,593 user personal messages , 5,582 purchase records , and 12,600 invoices . Company researchers said they also found credentials for the the sites PayPal , Bitcoin , and Paymentwall gateways and geolocation data linked to some users . <p> Its not clear precisely how Nulled.io was hacked , but the Risk Based Security researchers pointed out that the IP.board forum software and accompanying plugins the site relied on were riddled with critical vulnerabilities . They speculated that unknown hackers exploited the vulnerabilities to gain complete control to the site and then leaked the entire database . The breach is the latest reminder just how fragile privacy is on the Internet . Its likely that at least some Nulled.io users are now learning this lesson the hard way . 20738 @qwx430738 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737549 @2737549/ <h> Review : Lenovo ZUK Z1 Best Combination of software and hardware <h> Our Verdict <p> The Lenovo Zuk Z1 is an able performer , despite the two year old SoC . At Rs. 13,499 , its not more powerful than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 , but if you like modding your smartphone , its worth a shot . For those waiting for a CyanogenMod-powered phone worth buying , this is it . <h> PROS <p> Great display <p> Long battery life <p> Good performance <h> CONS <p> Camera needs work <h> Lenovo ZUK Z1 : Detailed Review <p> Lenovo has made some baffling decisions over the past two years . They tried to sell the Vibe Z2 Pro smartphone at over 30k , put an enviable camera on the Vibe Shot , - but compromised on other features , and they took a long time to sell the Lenovo K3 Note in India . Through all this , Lenovo still became one of the top sellers in the country , right up there with Samsung and others . How did it do this ? The story has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's phones went from downright low value , to being really well priced . It followed this up with the K3 Note , which delivered good performance at a good price . The icing on the cake was perhaps the Lenovo Vibe X3 , which is easily Lenovo 's best smartphone till date . But amidst all this , we 've been hearing whispers about the companys Zuk brand . If the other phones were meant for the masses , Zuk aims to take over the enthusiast market . <p> In a lot of ways , the Lenovo Zuk Z1 is exactly the OnePlus One , but that also makes it two years old . Why then , does Lenovo confidently push this device ? Having reviewed the Lenovo Zuk Z1 now , I can say it has ample reason to do so . <p> Build and Design : Sturdy and appreciable .. <p> The basic elements of the design on the Lenovo Zuk Z1 are borrowed from the Vibe X3 . It has a metallic frame , combined with a plastic back . But before you roll your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The polished plastic feels more metallic than some all-metal smartphones out there , and conforms seamlessly with the frame . Many would actually make the mistake of calling this an all-metal phone . The Zuk Z1 , like the Lenovo Vibe X3 , is a good mix of plastic and metal , which , in my opinion , looks better than the plastic strips for antennas on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and LeEco Le 1s . It 's just a more seamless design . <p> Having said that , this is n't an ergonomic smartphone . It 's quite wide , which puts single handed usage out of question . If you 're buying this though , you 're most likely not looking at ergonomics any way . The Zuk Z1 wants to feel like a big smartphone , and the reason for that is evident ( to be discussed ahead ) . <p> My review unit has a few , very slight , - gaps- between the metal frame and plastic back , but I would- not call this a badly built device . For one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like you 're carrying around a behemoth in your hand . Secondly , as big as it is , 175 grams is acceptable , if not out and out appreciable . <p> Display : Perhaps the best in this range .. <p> The reason why Lenovo has chosen to make this phone wide , is its display . A 5.5 inch FHD display does n't sound like much , till you realise this is the exact same display we saw on the Vibe X3 . Its not about pixel density and resolutions , although 401 ppi and 1080p are nothing to be ashamed of . The Lenovo Zuk Z1 is all about colours and vibrance , and the wide frame ensures that you notice that . <p> The quoted maximum brightness of the display is at 450 nits , but it 's not the best in terms of sunlight visibility . Indoors , colours are really good , with very good blacks and even better whites . The contrast ratio is great . Lenovo says the display can do 100% of the NTSC colour gamut. - What 's delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings.CynogenMod 12 allows deeper control on the display . You can tweak the colour temperature , and choose different temperatures for day and night . You can also change the DPI settings , but that does n't seem to make a very big difference . The control over the display is just the addition that could have made this display better , and it did . <p> OS and UI : So stable <p> The Lenovo Zuk Z1 runs on Android 5.1.1 , but Lenovo has said that the Marshmallow update will be made available in June , with CM13 . Currently , it runs on CyanogenMod 12 , which allows a bunch of customisations . If you happen to have used the Yu Yutopia smartphone , you would already be familiar with this . <p> When I reviewed the Yutopia though , the OS was nowhere close to as stable as it is here . According to Lenovo , CM12 on this phone , has been specially tweaked for the Snapdragon 801 SoC inside , but more on that later . <p> As discussed above , you get minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled by default , giving you access to granular control over how apps perform . CM12 also has the app permissions option from Marshmallow- built into it . So , you can manually decide what app gets what permissions , instead of granting them all at the same time . <p> While all of these features were available on the Yu Yutopia as well , none of its bugs are present here . CM12 is smooth , stable and performs well . In fact , Lenovo already has test devices with CM13 on it , and you can flash the ROM onto your Zuk Z1 , but it wo n't be stable . <p> It 's also worth noting that the Zuk branded phones are the only Lenovo devices where rooting wo n't void the warranty . If you happen to brick your device while rooting , Lenovo will return it to the original CM12 state . <p> Performance : Steady .. <p> The elephant in the room then . The Snapdragon 801 is an able SoC , but it 's also over two years old . Hence , logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old flagship smartphone , upon arrival . It 's a tough sell , but here again , Lenovo 's Zuk team has done a good job . Benchmark scores do n't tell the story here , because this phone is less about numbers and more about experience . <p> The fact that CyanogenMod has been tweaked for the phone is evident by how smoothly the UI performs , or how fast regular apps open . App load times go up only when you 're running heavy games etc , like Injustice : Gods Among Us . That said , it 's worth noting that actual gameplay is pretty much lag free , except over extended periods . <p> The temperature is below 40 degrees , even when the processor goes up to nearly the max clock speed , at around 2.4GHz . If you 're outdoors , in the summers , this would of course be more . <p> Having said that , the only concern is in the fact that the Snapdragon 801 is still old . It 's possibly one of the most balanced and stable SoCs Qualcomm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64-bit SoC . In addition , GFXBench 's testing app shows that you ca n't run Android Extension Pack-based and other newer benchmarks . <p> I have about 50 apps that I use on all my phones though , and each one of them is compatible with this device . What was n't acceptable in the OnePlus X , is acceptable at a price point of Rs. 13,499 . Moreover , it has 64GB of internal storage , which makes it a better bet than the OnePlus X. <p> The fingerprint sensor on the device is n't as fast as Nexus imprint , but it 's not slow enough to complain either . It missed my fingerprint a few times , but then , so does the Apple iPhone SE . <p> Camera : The only weakness .. <p> Against all the things that are good about this device , the camera is the only weakness . It can take good- and sharp photographs in outdoor sunlight , but lower the light and this camera starts failing . In indoor and low light conditions , the camera struggles with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite acceptable across the board , though.The camera is also slow , compared to devices like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 . There 's no shutter lag , but the phone takes perhaps a second too long to focus . <p> Battery : Lasts long , very long <p> The width of this smartphone , that I talked about in the beginning , has also allowed Lenovo to include a bigger battery . On the Geekbench 3 battery test , the Zuk Z1 lasts for about 8 hours , which is quite good . On regular usage , with the screen brightness at auto mode throughout the day , the phone easily lasted the whole day , even with a considerable period spent gaming on the device . For most users , the Lenovo Zuk Z1 will easily pass the full day mark . This can go up to as high as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 , if you use the balanced mode . I kept my phone on performance mode all the time . <p> Bottomline : All about the experience .. <p> The Lenovo Zuk Z1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spec sheets , you wo n't find this device to be anything special , but having used it , the Lenovo Zuk Z1 is definitely worth a shot . It 's a value for money smartphone , and though it 's not more powerful than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 , if you like modding your device , this one 's definitely worth a shot . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737556 @2737556/ <h> Review : AirBar Get Touchscreen For Any Laptop <p> If your laptop does n't  have a touchscreen , you do n't  need to replace your whole computer to get the functionality . At CES , Neonode showed off the AirBar , a $49 peripheral that connects to a USB port and gives any display touch capability . The company plans to ship the AirBar in May . <p> Airbar is unobtrusive and fits just under the display . Its a thin , black rectangle that rests on the bezel underneath the screen - if you have a black or gray laptop , you may not even realize that its there . It uses invisible light to detect where your finger is on the screen and provide that feedback to the computer.The AirBar is simply a thin black bar which attaches to the bottom bezel of your laptop display , and plugs into a USB port to draw power . It then projects what the manufacturer calls an " invisible light field " across the notebook screen , enabling the user to employ touch gestures just as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AirBar will work with laptops- running Windows or Chrome OS . The AirBar will come in four sizes to support most displays : 11.6 inches , 13.3 inches , 14 inches and 15.6 inches . Representatives told me that all of the sizes will retail for the same price.The AirBar 's a slim sensor that magnetically latches onto the bottom of your Chromebook or Windows laptop 's display and connects via USB . Once it 's hooked up " Neonode says it 's plug and play , with no extra drivers necessary " the device casts a beam of light across your screen , and you can poke , pinch , zoom , swipe and scroll around with your hand the way you would on a touchscreen PC . <p> Since the AirBar 's powered by light , rather than touch , you can use it to interact with your laptop in ways that traditional touchscreens do n't allow , such as with a glove or even chopsticks , as this video shows . <h> Power of Touch <p> In fact , this is a touchscreen-plus , because unlike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user wearing gloves indeed , you can use a paintbrush or other items for touch control with the device should you wish . <p> And youre getting full touch functionality without paying the Earth for the upgrade either AirBar retails at $49 ( -33 ) , although that 's without shipping . Still , it does n't  seem like much to pay for a touchscreen . <p> The only caveat is currently Neonode only produces one size of the device to fit a 15.6-inch laptop , but presumably if its successful , other sizes will be manufactured . <p> Its also worth bearing in mind that the gadget only works with Windows notebooks or Chromebooks currently , although Mac laptops may eventually be supported . That said , the company claims that the product does offer limited functionality on OS X , and you can always try it out if you do happen to have a MacBook . ( Also See Our Article On Latest Macbook Release ) . <p> The story behind the story : AirBar 's price is certainly right , but that 's only one part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device has to nail the feeling of actual touch input if it truly wants to succeed . Will it pull it off ? Neonode 's going to be showing off the AirBar at CES 2016 in a few weeks , where we 'll hopefully have a chance to poke and prod it ourselves . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737563 @2737563/ <h> Review : Apples New Macbook ( 2016 ) <p> The modest updates to Apples 12-inch MacBook laptop do n't  go far enough to make it the new must-have machine for everyone . At the same time , there 's a sizable enough boost to performance and battery life that the system can no longer be considered an outlier only suited for a very limited audience that values portability over productivity . <p> Nor is it the only player in the game . Since the 2015 original , we 've seen super-thin laptops such as the upcoming HP Spectre shaving millimeters from previous versions , or tablet hybrids such as the- Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and Samsung Galaxy TabPro S showing off what Intels new Core M chips can do in a small , reasonably priced package . <p> But even if its closer to the middle of the road than the it was last year , the 12-inch MacBook is still a love-it-or-hate-it laptop . It seems to inspire either fierce loyalty or intense derision , at least judging from comments on my review of the original version , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new set of updates for 2016 , including new processors for faster performance and better battery life , plus a new rose gold color option , may help throw off some of that shade , but not all . <p> Indeed , I liked the 2015 version of the MacBook , despite its many limitations . It relied on Intels initially unimpressive Core M processor , and its performance and battery life compared unfavorably to the bigger MacBook Air and Pro systems . The keyboard was unusually shallow , in order to fit into such a thin body . And most of all , the single USB-C port was a hard pill to swallow for those convinced of the need for separate power , video , and data ports . <p> It was not the perfect laptop for everyone , or even most people . But over time , I found myself appreciating Apples exercise in strictly enforced minimalism . I turned to it more and more often , especially for on-the-go computing in coffee shops around New York , eventually declaring it as my all-around favorite ( as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still get bogged down with too many programs and windows open , and the battery life was n't at the level where it could go days and days between charging sessions . The USB issue turned out to be less serious than I feared , and only two or three times in the months after the products original release did I find myself stymied by a lack of ports ( although when I did get stuck with a USB key and a misplaced converter dongle , it was very annoying ) . <p> The 12-inch MacBook , on top of a 13-inch MacBook Pro , on top of a 13-inch MacBook Air . <p> With this 2016 update , Apple has addressed some , but not all , of the issues with the original . Both this system , and other computers with the second generation of Core M processors ( confusingly part of Intels sixth generation of Core chips , also known by the codename Skylake ) , are closer to the mainstream levels of performance seen in laptops with more common Core i3 and Core i5 processors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPUs ( the M series now follows the same 3/5/7 format as the Core i-series chips ) , the new MacBook gets Intels updated 515 integrated graphics , which wont make you a gamer , but may help with video application performance . The speed of the internal flash memory has also improved , but I doubt that 's something casual users would even notice . <p> Frankly , the most obvious difference between the 2016 MacBook and the 2015 model is the new addition of a fourth color option , rose gold , which is already available on iPhones and iPads . Sadly , our review sample is a rather straitlaced space gray ( silver and gold are the other two options ) . <p> Note also that were testing the step-up model , which costs $1,599 in the US ( -1,299 and AU$2,199 ) , and includes an Intel Core m5 processor and a big 512GB of storage . The base $1,299 model ( -1,049 and AU$1,799 ) has the Core m3 and 256GB of storage . <p> Color aside , the body is identical to last years model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick . The HP Spectre packs a 13-inch display ( but only a 1,920+1,080-resolution one ) into a 10.4mm body , but at the cost of more weight , at 2.45 pounds . That coming-soon HP also uses Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs , which should give it a significant performance boost . Its becoming increasingly obvious that PC makers need to balance size , weight , performance and battery life , but can usually max out two out of those four at best . <h> APPLE MACBOOK ( 2016 ) <p> Price as reviewed <p> $1,599 <p> Display size/resolution <p> 12-inch 2,304 x 1,440 screen <p> PC CPU <p> 1.2GHz Intel Core M5-6Y54 <p> PC Memory <p> 8GB DDR3 SDRAM 1866MHz <p> Graphics <p> 1536MB Intel HD Graphics 515 <p> Storage <p> 512GB flash storage <p> Networking <p> 802.11ac wireless , Bluetooth 4.0 <p> Operating system <p> Apple El Capitan OSX 10.11.4 <h> A keyboard you may like , but wont love <p> This is still the thinnest Mac that Apple has ever made . Part of the reason for that is the butterfly mechanism under the keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , but the keys are shallow , barely popping up above the keyboard tray and depressing into the chassis only slightly . It takes some getting used to , especially if you 're accustomed to the deep , clicky physical feedback of other MacBooks or the similar island-style keyboards of most other modern laptops . It took a while to get used to , and itll never be my favorite keyboard , but I found it was easy to acclimate to after a few days of heavy usage , and Ive easily written more than 100,000 words on the 2015 version of this system . <p> The touchpad retains the Force Touch feature found in both the previous MacBook and the current 13-inch MacBook Pro . ( A version of this migrated to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus as 3D Touch . ) A set of four sensors under the pad allow you to " click " anywhere on the surface , and the Force Click effect , which combines the sensors with haptic feedback ( or , as Apple calls it , " taptic " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an app or task . That deep click feels to the finger and brain like the trackpad has a stepped physical mechanism , but in fact , the movement you feel is a small horizontal shift , which , even when fully explained , still feels like you 're depressing the trackpad two levels . <p> I 'm more of a tapper than a clicker , and the first thing I do on any new MacBook is turn on tap-to-click in the settings menu ( which is still inexplicably turned off by default ) , so I have not given Force Touch much thought since it was introduced , with the exception of deep-clicking on addresses occasionally to bring up a contextual map pop-up . here 's another Mac trackpad tip : besides the tapping feature under the trackpad preferences menu , you should go to the accessibility menu and look under Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Mouse &amp; Trackpad &gt; Trackpad options to turn on tap-to-drag . <h> A small but sharp screen <p> The 12-inch Retina display has a 2,304+1,440-pixel resolution , which gives you a very high pixel-per-inch density , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to the 16:9 aspect ratio found on nearly every other laptop available now , and in HDTV screens . <p> The slightly glossy screen works from wide viewing angles and is very clear and bright . On-screen icons , text and images all scale well to be very viewable despite the smaller size and higher resolution . While the bezel around the display is thin , its nowhere as minimalist as the barely there bezel on the excellent Dell XPS 13 . <p> Audio remains thin , best suited for YouTube videos or single-viewer Netflix experiences . While Apple has owned the Beats brand for a while now , there 's no sign of any kind of Beats-enhanced audio in any Macs yet . <p> Another issue carried over from the previous version is the webcam , which is still just a low-res 480p model , which leads to generally soft images when using FaceTime , Photo Booth , or other camera apps . <h> Still the elephant in the room <p> If you ask 10 people about the 12-inch MacBook assuming they know enough about this product to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the lines of : " Thats the one with just one USB-C port , right ? " <p> There were hopes that wed see a second port , either USB-C or something else , in this updated model , but that was not to be . The use of a single port for data , video and power and a not-quite-mainstream one at that remains the most bedeviling thing about this laptop . <p> And yet , using the 2015 MacBook fairly heavily over a course of months , I also found it was n't nearly the deal breaker some had feared . The battery life was long enough that I did n't  need to worry about taking up the power port to connect an external peripheral , and frankly , so many things have migrated to the cloud , that Ive even removed the once-ubiquitous key-shaped USB drive from the keychain , where it hung for many years . <p> Yes , if you need a wired Ethernet connection on a daily basis , use sneakernet-delivered USB keys every day , or need to send a video output to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are USB-C dongles and adaptors available for each and every eventuality , but they 're inconvenient and often expensive . A simple USB-C to USB-A adapter is $20 , while Apples big multiport dongle that gives you HDMI , USB-A and USB-C ( the latter for pass-through charging ) is $80 . <p> Through hands-on testing , I 've concluded I can mostly survive in a single-port world , but that wont be true for everybody . <h> Core M , take two <p> The original pitch for Core M was that it enabled laptops to be very thin and light , but still powerful and long-lasting . That was an appealing idea , but the first-gen Core M chips found in premium-priced systems such as this and the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro did n't  live up to the hype in terms of performance and battery life . Of those early models , the MacBook was the most impressive , likely because Apple was able to tune both the hardware and operating system to work optimally with that still-new CPU . Despite that , the 2015 MacBook could slow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with very large documents and files in use . <p> The handful of systems we 've tested with the newer , second wave of Core M chips , including the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S and HP Spectre x2 , have all felt zippier , even if still lagging behind full-size laptops with Core i5 processors . With this updated MacBook , you can get a new Core m3 or Core m5 processor . Were testing the better Core m5 version , so its not going to be an exact comparison to the original 12-inch MacBook . <p> So far , in a couple of days of use , this Core m5 system feels faster than the older model , not so much in terms of minute-to-minute responsiveness or opening apps , but in that there were fewer moments where the system seemed to slow down or lag when pushed . The benchmark results reflect this , and while it felt like you 'd be pushing your luck to use the 2015 MacBook as your mission-critical , all day , every day computer , I feel more confident in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to say for sure . <p> Battery life in this new version is , by Apples account , about an hour longer than a system with the first-gen Core M CPU would get . In an online video streaming test , the MacBook ran for 10:33 , which is about a half hour longer than the most-recent 13-inch MacBook Pro . Were continuing to run other battery tests , and will update this review with additional results . <h> An even better laptop , but still with caveats <p> In hands-on use , the new MacBook feels almost exactly like the previous version . If you 've got the 2015 MacBook , there 's no need to upgrade , but if you were holding off to see what the second generation looked like , the potential boost to performance and battery life makes me feel even more confident about using this as primary laptop , especially for frequent travelers . However , the lack of ports and the feel of the keyboard will still be enough to discourage some , especially those who are looking for a laptop that will stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Keep in mind , too , that well almost certainly see updated MacBook Pro laptops later in 2016 , possibly as early as Apples WWDC event in June . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737570 @2737570/ <h> Review : Canon EOS 1300D / T6 DSLR <p> When you think of getting your first DSLR , a beginner level DSLR is always the safest bet . It not only gives you the ability to play with the manual controls and accessorize it to your liking , but also does n't come as expensive as a full frame SLR . <p> Canon has brought in a new budget DSLR into the mix , the 1300D . This is the successor to the 1200D , and has lot of new things up its sleeve . Let 's get right on to it . <h> Info For Canon EOS 1300D <h> PROS <h> CONS <h> BOTTOM LINE <p> If you 're a beginner , entering the world of photography , and are looking for a not so expensive DSLR with versatile shooting capabilities , Canon 1300D is the one to go . <h> Body and- Comfort Design <p> Canon is known to make ergonomically pleasing camera bodies , and the 1300D is no exception . The body is light and really easy to handle . It is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll definitely be too much to ask for . <p> All buttons are aligned to the right side of the body , which is easily accessible . If you 're a Canon user , you 'll definitely feel at home . You 're greeted with a sharper 3 inch display which offers a good visibility . The display is sharper than its predecessor . And since the camera is so light , everything can be easily toggled and tweaked with just one hand , using your thumb . <p> The menu buttons are perfectly tactile as they 're supposed to be , the index finger switches comfortably from the shutter button to the toggle dial , making last minute changes really easy . There is also a thumb grip at the back , above the menu buttons which is like a cherry on top . <p> The dial comes with a few new modes now . You have the normal manual switch , shutter priority and aperture priority . You also have a full auto mode , a no flash mode , portrait mode , landscape mode . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a creative auto mode where you can set a few settings to improve your photo in auto mode . <p> To the left we have an HDMI port , microphone jack , and a micro USB port for data syncing . The camera comes with just one microphone at the front , which is really sad considering a stereo setup would 've been way better for videos . <h> Sensor and Mount <p> The 1300D features an 4:3 18MP CMOS sensor , with DIGIC 4+ image processor . DIGIC 4+ is 60% faster at processing than the DIGIC 4 seen on the 1200D , and it surely feels like it . It was accurate , agile and delivered snappy shots . The camera comes with a total 9 focus points . The shutter can click up to 3FPS burst shots , which is n't very impressive . <p> The sensor supports ISO ranging from 100 to 6400 , which can be extended to 12800 , as seen on the 1200D , but the end result is far from good , with a ton of noise ruining the shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is definitely a great addition , and adds to the versatility of the camera . <h> The Shots <p> We got the 1300D with an EF-S 18-55mm kit with aperture ranging from 3.5 to 5.6 , and an in-built image stabilizer . Canon is known to generate one of the best color reproductions on its DIGIC sensors and this camera is no different . <p> The colors delivered by the 1300D were bang on . I did n't see any oversaturation on the images and the colors were natural and clean . The DIGIC 4+ delivered smooth color gradients and resulted in some really amazing shots . <p> Even on auto mode , the camera did n't disappoint and gave some stunning images . The 18MP shots were n't as detailed and sharp as we wanted them to be , but still it worked out pretty well . The Creative Auto mode was definitely my favourite , as it allowed you to play with your images , by making them vibrant , or adding cool filters etc . <p> While shooting in low lights , the 1300D started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low light images were n't very good , and bumping up the ISO only made it worse , generating a ton of noise . We could see a clear loss of color accuracy and the sensor could definitely be seen breaking a sweat here . <p> The camera also supports recording FHD movies , and although it does shoot decent videos , it is n't very ideal for videography . <h> Practical usage <p> This is a really fun camera , and its hand friendly ergonomics makes shooting on this camera really easy and convenient . The overall weight , button placement and the grippy texture at necessary places enhances the shooting experience . <p> One thing that definitely annoyed be was the fact that the memory card tray was at the bottom , with the battery . This is n't a very ideal placement as if you 're resting your camera on a tripod mount , you 'll need to remove it every time you 're switching memory card . We would 've definitely loved it to be on the side of the camera . <p> Moreover with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files has become a breeze . It 's really easy to set up and share files to our smartphone . <p> Just download the Canon app from the Android Play Store or Apple App store , connect via a Wi-Fi connection , and pair the camera with the same wifi network . After that you 're good to go . It is a really handy feature for quickly sharing content on social media . <p> Powering the camera is a 860mAh battery pack . The battery took a mere 2-3 hours to fully charge and gave me a battery life of approximate 600 stills which is really decent . <h> Bottom line <p> If you 're a beginner , entering the world of photography , and are looking for a not so expensive yet versatile DSLR , Canon 1300D is the one you must go for . <p> It is easy to handle , delivers decent shots , it comes with a very potent DIGIC 4+ sensor , which gives you an array of lens options to explore from the EF and EF-S series of lenses .

@@42737575 @2737575/ <h> OnePlus 3 : Everything you need to know <p> Last year , my idea of a fantastic " high-end " budget phone was something like the Google Nexus 5X a bit smaller than your usual flagship with a **26;60;TOOLONG camera and a processor that , while not at the top of the class , still made gameplay and movie streaming fun . But for less than $400 , that was about the best you could get . <p> The OnePlus 3 changes everything . OnePlus grabbed headlines when it launched its first smartphone in 2014 for a couple of reasons . Firstly , the OnePlus One delivered flagship specs for significantly less cash . Secondly , the Chinese company made the " flagship killer " desirable by introducing an invite system that consequently made the OnePlus One harder to get hold of than other smartphones . <p> Since the original OnePlus One , we have seen two more smartphones from OnePlus the OnePlus 2 and the OnePlus X. Both follow the same lead as the OnePlus One by offering decent specs for a decent price , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chases the mid-range . Now its the turn of the OnePlus 3 . <p> Launching via the medium of VR later today , but confirmed via a mail-out from Amazon India , here 's everything you need to know about the new flagship killer . <h> OnePlus 3 : Design <p> One of the notable features of OnePlus devices has been offering a premium build without the premium price . That was certainly true of the original OnePlus One , looking to distinguish itself from the cheap plastic devices it launched against . The OnePlus X pushed this angle heavily , offering a premium finish that matched much more expensive flagship devices . <p> The OnePlus 3 offers an aluminium unibody design , which on first glance looks like the sort of thing you 'd expect from HTC , or more recently , Apple . Its cut from a single block of aluminium , so should result in a solid handset . The OnePlus 3 measures 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm and it weighs 158g , which is pretty typical for this size of device . <p> There 's a fingerprint scanner on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glass 4 display cover . There 's only a 0.755mm bezel around the display . <p> OnePlus has also retained the alert slider , as featured on the OnePlus X , similar to the iPhones silencer button . <h> OnePlus 3 : Display <p> OnePlus is using an Optic AMOLED display on the OnePlus 3 , measuring 5.5-inches on the diagonal . <p> Unlike some of its rivals , the OnePlus 3 has a full HD resolution , so 1920 x 1080 pixels , for 401ppi . This is the same as the iPhone 6S Plus , but falls short of the 2560 x 1440 pixels that you 'll find on some flagships , like the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge , for example . <p> As we said , the display is topped with Gorilla Glass 4 , so should be well protected from scratches to keep it looking good . <h> OnePlus 3 : Camera <p> The OnePlus 3 has a Sony IMX298 sensor at the- heart of its rear camera , giving it 16-megapixels with a 1.12-m pixel size . That 's small compared to a number of rivals matching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that larger pixels let in more light for better shooting in tricky conditions , but so often the deciding factor is the software processing , rather than the core hardware . <p> However , the OnePlus 3 offers optical image stabilisation , an f/2.0 aperture and phase detection autofocus , so on paper , the camera is every bit as sophisticated as any of its rivals . <p> Manual controls will be offered , as well as the convenience of auto HDR . OnePlus is also introducing a feature called Dynamic Denoise , a noise reduction technology to help give you cleaner results . The sample images we 've seen so far have been impressive . <p> It will offer raw image capture , 4K video at 30fps and 720p slow motion at 120fps . <p> The OnePlus 3 has an 8-megapixel Sony IMX179 sensor on the front , offering 1.4-m pixels and an f/2.0 lens , which should be good for those low-light selfies . Unlike some rivals , there 's no autofocus or OIS offered for the front camera . <h> OnePlus 3 : Specs and hardware <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires with both barrels . The OnePlus 3 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 . That 's the same chipset that 's powering most of the top-tier handsets in 2016 . However , the OnePlus 3 comes with 6GB of RAM , smacking down the 4GB that 's common in most rivals . Exactly how that will impact on daily usage , we cant wait to find out . <p> Elsewhere the OnePlus 3 is dual SIM , offers all the sensors you expect , including NFC , which has n't  always been the case for OnePlus handsets . Yes , it even offers a 3.5mm headphone socket , unlike the recently-announced Moto Z. <p> There 's 64GB of internal storage . <h> OnePlus 3 : Battery <p> The OnePlus 3 has a USB Type-C on the bottom , supporting a technology that OnePlus is calling Dash Charge , citing 5V/4A power , to charge up the 3000mAh battery in no time at all . <p> Fast charging is now commonplace on Android handsets and in many flavours . You 'll need to use the Dash Charger to get the best results , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a full day usage from a single charge . <h> OnePlus 3 : Software <p> Software is one area that OnePlus can differentiate from rivals , offering its Oxygen OS . This is essentially a skin over the top of Android- Marshmallow , which this handset launches with . <p> Oxygen OS like Samsung TouchWiz or HTC Sense introduces a range of features and in the past has been best known for customisation . <p> This will offer things like OnePlus Shelf and custom icon packs , as well as a dark theme to save you from wasting battery life . <h> OnePlus 3 : Price and availability <p> The OnePlus One cost -230 when it first launched , while the OnePlus 2- starts at -239 and creeps up to -289 for the larger storage capacity . <p> The OnePlus will cost $399 in the US or- -309 in the UK and can be bought without an invite to purchase . <p> The OnePlus 3 will be available to order through the virtual world exclusively for those with the OnePlus Loop VR headset for the first two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available to everyone on the OnePlus website from 20:00 BST on 14 June . 20738 @qwx430738 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

These tools do not simply look for large uploads of data or access to blatantly malicious websites ; they detect when an employee 's behavior differs from the way the employee normally uses work tools . Every large company with sensitive data should have some form of activity monitoring , and it can be seen as a huge failure that the $80 million transfers from the Bangladesh bank 's account were n't detected , delayed or blocked , especially given the dubiousness of the destination accounts .

@@42737589 @2737589/ <p> ASUS probably wo n't appreciate the inevitable comparison with Apples MacBook Air , but the similarities between its new ZenBook UX330UA and Apples veteran ultraportable are hard to avoid . In fact , they 're really quite blatant . However , the ZenBook UX330UA offers better value for money , delivering features and performance beyond those of its ageing macOS-based rival . <p> The ZenBook UX330UA has a distinct MacBook Air look about it , but the internal components are a significant improvement on Apples ageing ultraportable . <p> With the ZenBook sitting on a desk alongside my own MacBook Air , its only the darker tone of the ASUS laptops aluminium casing that really sets the two systems apart ( and even then , the ZenBooks rose-gold hue is taken directly from Jony Ives colour swatch ) . They 're virtually identical in size , with 13.3-inch screens and measuring just 17mm at the thickest point along the rear edge . The ZenBook also shares some very specific design details with the MacBook Air , including the chunky border around the screen which looks rather dated compared to todays edge-to-edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edges of the keyboard . ASUS has at least shaved a little weight off , the ZenBook UX330UA coming in at 1.2kg , compared to the MacBook Airs 1.35kg . The Apple influence does at least mean that the ZenBook boasts excellent build quality , with a sturdy metal chassis providing good support for the screen panel , and a comfortable , responsive keyboard and trackpad . <p> That , thankfully , is where the ASUS/Apple similarities end . The metal border around the screen may look dated , but the ZenBook UX330UA is much more up to date in terms of both features and performance . The ZenBooks 3,200-by-1,800-pixel display ( 276ppi ) dwarfs the MacBook Airs antediluvian 1,440-by-900 resolution ( 128ppi ) and provides a bright , colourful image with excellent all-round viewing angles . It will work well for viewing web pages , streaming video or giving presentations and , like a number of recent tablets , the ZenBook allows you to reduce the blue light emitted by the screen in order to reduce eyestrain when working on it for long periods of time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to miss that option . Our only minor complaint here is that the stereo speakers are n't  particularly loud , so a set of external speakers will probably be needed if you 're going to give a presentation to more than a handful of people at a time . Youve got plenty of connectivity options for speakers and other accessories though , as the ZenBook includes one of those legacy 3.5mm audio sockets that Apple is trying to kill off , along with two USB 3.0 ports , USB-C , Micro-HDMI and a SD card slot . There 's no RJ-45 Ethernet for connecting to a wired office network , but ASUS does include a USB-to-Ethernet adapter at no extra cost . <p> The slimline 13.3-inch ZenBook UX330UA includes two USB 3.0 ports and a USB-C port among its connections . <h> Value for money <p> The ZenBook UX330UA also comes out ahead of the MacBook Air in terms of price and performance . Our review unit was priced at -999.99 ( inc . VAT , or -833.33 ex . VAT ) , and includes a sixth-generation , dual-core Intel Core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , along with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state drive . At that price , the MacBook Air offers only a fifth-generation Core i5 processor running at a modest 1.6GHz , and a 256GB SSD . You can also shave -100 off the ZenBooks price by opting for a Core i5 CPU , which at 2.3GHz is still faster than the MacBook Air , so there 's little doubt about which laptop offers the best value for money . <p> And , of course , the Core i7 processor delivers excellent performance that 's more than capable of handling Microsoft Office and other mainstream productivity apps . When running the Geekbench 3 test suite , the ZenBook achieved scores of 3323 ( single core ) and 6983 ( multi-core , which put it well ahead of the MacBook Airs respective 2594 and 5574 . ( And , for Geekbench afficionados , the new Geekbench 4 reported single-core and multi-core scores of 3800 and 7200 , along with 18050 for the new GPU tests . ) <h> Performance &amp; battery life <p> To maintain its streamlined design , the ZenBook UX330UA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GPU , which managed a speed of 38.3fps when running the Cinebench R15- OpenGL test . That 's not quite in the mobile workstation class , but will be adequate if you need to do some simple photo- or video-editing for presentations work , or even for a spot of casual gaming in off-duty hours . <p> We were also pleased to see that the Core i7 processor ran cool and quiet at all times , even during the demanding graphics tests . In fact , the ZenBook UX330UA does n't  even include any air vents for the cooling system , and there are n't  many laptops that manage to squeeze Core i7 performance into such a slim , lightweight design . Microsofts Surface Pro 4 does provide an i7 option , but that starts at -1,299 ( inc . VAT , or -1,082.50 ex . VAT ) with no keyboard and just 256GB of storage , so the ZenBook manages to provide a good all-round combination of performance , portability and price . <p> Battery life is more modest , though . ASUS claims up to 12 hours of web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming video from the BBC iPlayer in our tests . Even so , that 's still not bad for a laptop that combines Core i7 performance with such a high-resolution display , and lighter web browsing should certainly allow you to get a full days work out of the ZenBook . ASUS also plans to release a model with a conventional HD ( 1,920+1,080 ) display , which would be less power-hungry , although no price was available for that model at the time of this review . <h> Conclusions <p> At first glance , the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA looks little more than a MacBook Air clone . However , its Core i7 processor and high-definition display put it significantly ahead of Apples ultraportable without any additional price premium . And while many ultrabooks sacrifice performance for portability , the ZenBook UX330UA manages to combine desktop levels of performance with an attractive , lightweight design that will appeal to business travellers who need a powerful mobile workhorse. 20738 @qwx430738 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

If everyone you work with wears a tie , this might not blend into the corporate culture . If people bring their dogs to work and your office has either bean bag chairs or a foosball table , it should fit in just fine . <h> A Keyboard for Showing Off <p> Like the 13-inch Razer Blade Stealth , the keyboard in this 14-inch Blade is part of Razers Chroma line , which also covers standalone desktop keyboards , and provides more backlighting flexibility and features than any other laptop . It makes for a fun party trick that will turn heads when you set it up to display some multicolored pyrotechnics . <p> Using the included Chroma app , different sections of the keyboard can be programmed to show different colors such as highlighting the all-important WASD keys in a different color than the rest of the keyboard . Sure , you can meticulously program a custom keyboard backlight scheme , but for most people , itll be enough to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the keyboard is capable of . <p> The preset called " spectrum cycling " let 's the keys fade new colors in and out in unison , just slowly enough to not be distracting . " Reactive " leaves a trail of lit keys in your wake as you type , like a fading echo . " Ripple " sends a burst of a single color expanding outward , away from each individual key press . In this mode , typing causes cool-looking explosions of color all across the keyboard . You probably wont use it on your own , but as a fun demo for friends , set the keyboard to " Wave , " and a rainbow of colors will move rapidly left to right ( this movement is also reversible ) across the entire keyboard . <h> More than enough for most games <p> The combination of an Intel Core i7-6700HQ and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 970m puts the Blade about a step behind the very fastest gaming laptops , which have the Nvidia 980m GPU , but that should n't have much practical effect in everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to 1,920+1,080 , as even those 980m cards can struggle to play games at high details levels and nearly 4K resolutions . There are new GeForce 1080 desktop cards about to hit from Nvidia , eclipsing the somewhat old 900 series , but for now this is still the top-end of the mobile graphics card list . <p> In most of our application and gaming tests , a tricked out midsize Acer Predator 15 is faster , but that 15-inch gaming laptop is both more expensive and much larger , despite having a screen only 1.6-inches diagonally bigger . <p> Battery life is always a tricky proposition on a gaming laptop , especially one with a higher-res screen . That said , the 5 hours , 41 minutes that the Blade ran on our streaming video playback test was better than expected . It does n't  come close to a 15-inch MacBook Pro , but a recent Samsung midsize laptop with a similar configuration ran for about two hours less on the same test . <h> Conclusion <p> The Razer Blade sits in between a few categories , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . There are more powerful gaming laptops , there are slimmer and lighter midsize laptops , and there are laptops with higher-res true 4K displays . And , if you 're interested in the Razer Core peripheral , which adds significant cost , it might be more practical to start with the $999-and-up 13-inch Stealth model , then add the Core and your own desktop graphics card . <p> But , for high-end gaming on the go , or a laptop that works in a professional environment but also can play Fallout 4 or Doom , this is a piece of premium hardware that looks and feels great .

However , just like in the case of browsers where it faced competition from Google 's Chrome and Opera , the UC News app faces competition from rivals such as Flipboard , News Republic or Google 's News and Weather app . Would we pick this over the other three ? Let 's find out.UC News ' interface looks very basic in comparison with Flipboard and News Republic . <p> Interface and design <p> UC News has a clutter-free interface . The stories are arranged under various interest-based categories in vertical columns . Swiping towards right to move to the next category works smoothly , while pulling down refreshes stories in all the categories and not just one . You can add and remove any of the categories you want by tapping on the + icon on the top of the page . As of now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you can read news stories not just in English , but in Hindi as well and from all leading Hindi web sites . This is good , but not unique . <p> You can read news sources in Hindi in Flipboard and News Republic too , with News Republic in particular offering a lot of content from a number of Hindi publications . <p> UC News ' interface looks very basic in comparison with the other two . <p> Flipboard has multiple pages , yet it 's easy to use and also looks visually appealing . It not just allows users to select their categories but also select the publications they wish to follow . Its home page collates the top stories from the users ' list of favourite publications just in case the users do n't have time to go through each category . One of the key highlights of Flipboard is the vertical flip which divides a story in several small pages allowing users to keep tab of the progress in longer stories . <p> News Republic has a very minimalistic layout and uses hidden side screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another major news app which comes preloaded on most Android devices is Google 's News &amp; Weather app , which shows the most popular stories on Google News in a mobile-friendly format . Stories are cataloged under sections and you can see the top ten most trending story items in each of them . The recent update has added the option to read the story within the app so you wo n't be redirected to the Chrome browser when you want to read a story . The layout is plain and mostly text-centric but you can switch to a dark theme for reading at night . <p> Content and features <p> What gives Flipboard and News Republic an edge over the UC News is the sheer amount of content they offer . There are more categories and all major international publications and websites based on language and country are available on them . One of the highlights of Flipboard is the option to login to one 's social media profile and access news posted by a friend on Facebook , Twitter and Google+ from within Flipboard . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public reaction to a story . Also , it can read the text in the story in case you do n't want to read it . <p> Though Google News &amp; Weather app does n't have a Hindi language option ( it 's available on the browser version ) , you can always get news that is trending in other countries by changing the edition in the settings page . The latest weather update is a bonus which you wo n't get on any of the other news apps . <p> Is UC News worth downloading ? <p> UC News , though it is doing the content and interface bit quite well , really offers nothing unique which you wo n't get on News Republic , Flipboard or Google News &amp; Weather already . And if an app eventually becomes a habit , it is quite hard to move away from it . And for all its positives , UC News is arriving a bit too late in the news app space , without any really unique elements . 20738 @qwx430738 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

It builds on the gaming-focused Shield branding first used in the Shield Portable and later used on the Shield Tablet , but as is the case with the Shield Tablet the Shield Android TV box can be used for much more than just games . <p> THE GOOD <p> The Nvidia Shield Android TV streaming box offers best-in-class hardware , connectivity and gaming capabilities . It works with 4K streaming services including Netflix and YouTube . The Android TV platform delivers good conversational voice search from the included game controller . Native app selection is solid , and if you use your smartphone or tablet to Cast compatible apps , it can access most important services . The interface is lightning-fast even with relatively complex apps . You can upgrade storage up to 128GB . <p> THE BAD <p> Its more expensive than any other streamer and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Native app selection is still weaker than that of Roku , Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV . The menu system seems designed to push users toward Googles media services , and voice search does n't  yet include Netflix . <p> THE BOTTOM LINE <p> The Nvidia Shields 4K video and solid gaming chops will appeal to geeks , and software updates have made it more stable , but app shortfalls and a relatively high price limit its appeal . <p> The Nvidia Shield Android TV box tries to straddle two galloping horses headed in different directions . Its a difficult and potentially painful balancing act. - A gamer-friendly 4K streamer in search of mass appeal . <p> One plucky palomino is the world of media streamers , represented by the- Chromecast , Amazon Fire TV , Apple TV and Roku . They 're all cheap , work great ( more or less ) and are only growing in popularity and app support . <p> The other raging stallion is the gaming world , in the form of the Xbox One ( Also See Our Article On Microsofts XBOX One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Shield , but they 're superior gaming devices . Most serious gamers have one or the other , or an even more expensive gaming PC . <p> Doing the splits in the middle is the Shield , which starts at $200 or -150 . It uses the Android TV streaming media and app platform , which has solid voice search , Google Cast functionality just like a Chromecast , a pushy interface and fewer native apps than competitors . <p> Android TV has access to a limited library of apps compared with the Google Play Store for phones and- tablets , and still lacks Amazon Instant Video , Watch ESPN and Spotify apps among others . Fire TV and Roku have a better selection of native apps , although neither has the Shields Google Cast capability . <p> If you have an early 4K TV that lacks built-in 4K streaming apps you might be tempted by the Shields 4K capability , but the less-expensive Roku 4 is the better choice . The Shield might also appeal to people who have large libraries of Android games they want to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of older games for $8 per month . If any of those people actually existed . <p> There is one group of buyers to whom Shield does appeal . Since it debuted in 2015 Shield has gained a good following of people I like to call file hoarders . They have big collections of files namely TV shows and movies downloaded from various no-questions-asked corners of the Internet , usually ripped by somebody from DVD or Blu-ray that they want to play on a TV over a home network . The powerful Shield does a superb job of that , whether via Plex , Kodi , Emby or something else . Of course , it also costs more than many other hoarder-friendly devices . <p> When they reach for their wallets , most people will bet on another horse : a different streamer or a serious gaming rig like a console or PC , or both . Although its better than it was a year ago at launch , the expensive Shield still fills too narrow of a niche . <p> Editors note , April 25 , 2016:This review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates including Android Marshmallow , which improved stability and added features , as well as new apps and games , and testing of the GeForce Now game-streaming service . Its Value rating was changed from 5 to 6 and its Ecosystem rating was changed from 7 to 8 , which increased its overall rating from 6.9 to 7.5 . <h> Triple Shielded <p> The Android TV box is the third Nvidia Shield in the PC graphics companys armory . All three are Android devices with access to the Google Play Stores app library . They also get three Nvidia-specific features , namely optimized games and a handful of big titles like Borderlands : The Pre-Sequel and Metal Gear Rising : The Revengeance ( here 's a partial list ) ; compatibility with GameStream , which let 's you stream games running on an Nvidia-equipped PC to screens elsewhere in the house or remotely ; and access to Grid , the companys cloud-based game-streaming service . <p> Allow me to draw tenuous comparisons to three kinds of medieval shields as we run through the family tree . <p> The first Nvidia Shield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shield Portable and sells for a whopping $550 . Its still available , although this generation is being phased out . Basically a game controller with a touchscreen screen grafted on top , the weird device suffered from a small game library compared with other portables like the PlayStation Vita or Nintendo 3DS . <p> The second , called the Shield Tablet , is a high-powered , $300 Android tablet that we really like . Our admiration stems from its relative value for the specifications , not from its gaming prowess . Its a classic medium heater shield in terms of popular appeal and screen size . <p> The third is the new Nvidia Shield Android TV box . Like a tower shield , or scutum , its the biggest of its kind , at least in terms of the screens it feeds . <p> It comes in two varieties , the $200 Shield and the $300 Shield Pro . Both are available in the US and Europe now ( Australian availability is not part of the conversation sorry ! ) . <p> The Pro increases onboard storage from 16GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the two units are identical aside from storage capacity ( and weight , although the other physical dimensions are the same ) , my observations apply to it as well . <p> If you 're hard-core enough to be considering the Pro , be aware that the upgrade to Android Marshmallow brings with it the ability to replace Shields internal storage with an SD card or USB device up to 128GB . Unless you 're storing numerous files and big games on the device , that 's probably enough . <h> The box : Is that Dragonglass ? <p> If set-top boxes were graded on aggressive looks alone , the Shield would bash the competition , and perhaps slay a White Walker or two along the way . This slim , angular shard is traced by diagonal ridges , alternating glossy and matte-black finishes , and a razor-sharp sideways green " V " that illuminates when its on . Best . Power . Indicator . Ever . <p> The default orientation is horizontal but you can also set it into an optional matching stand ( $30 or -25 ) to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accidentally hit more than once , and the slim front face sports an infrared ( IR ) sensor so the Shield can work with most universal remote controls <h> The controller : Feature-packed but too bulky <p> A single Shield controller ships with the device . Chunkier than other controllers , especially those of the PlayStation 3 and 4 , it feels significantly heavier in the hand . <p> Its decent , but I definitely prefer the Xbox and PlayStation controllers , mainly because they feel much lighter ; their longer grips felt more natural , especially over extended periods of gaming . Happily , the Shield worked with a variety of Bluetooth controllers ( including Amazons ) and the wired Xbox 360 controller . <p> . <p> The Shield controller out-features most , however . It offers a volume control , a microphone for voice search and a headphone jack for private listening , a la Roku 3 . Unlike the Roku , volume on the Shield also controls the HDMI ports output level , so you can control the TV or AV receiver volume , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Apple TV , the Shield can pair with Bluetooth headphones like the- Sennheiser Momentums I tried . <h> One-handed remote : A $50 option ( ouch ) <p> Unlike pretty much every other streaming box , the Shield does n't  ship with a simple remote . Sure you can use the controller to do everything , but its impossible to use with one hand . You can also use theAndroid TV Remote Control app , which is great ( especially for entering text ) but requires your phone or tablet . <p> The optional clicker costs a whopping $50 or -40 . Its nice enough , as these things go , with a slick , touch-sensitive slider for volume control . I do wish the home key were more prominent and the voice-search button was less so . Dedicated controls for play/pause , rewind and fast-forward would be welcome too , but the cursor key works fine for those functions . <p> Just like the controller , the remote offers voice search via a built-in mic and a headphone jack for private listening . Its also rechargeable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . <p> My main complaint about the remote and the game controller is that they had a tendency to become disconnected after awhile , so I had to wait for a second or two ( or sometimes longer ) before they could properly command the Shield . I 'm guessing the idea is to save battery life , but its an annoying issue in a living-room device . <h> High-end hardware <p> Nvidia justifies the Shields high price with better specifications than any streaming box out there . <p> It starts with Nvidias latest Tegra X1 processor , 3GB of RAM and a 265-core Maxwell-generation GPU , for " raw performance " that 's 3x better than the 2015 Apple TV , 4x better than the 2015 Fire TV , and 10x better then the Roku 4 , according to Nvidia . Those numbers deserve a healthy dose of salt , but you get the idea . <p> The box supports 4K video output with the potential for HDR . It has both fast 802.11ac dual-band Wi-Fi and an actual Ethernet jack Gigabit , of course . For expansion , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a microSD card slot that supports cards up to 128GB in size , to augment the built-in 16GB of storage on the standard Shield . <p> As I mentioned above , one of the chief features of the latest operating system update , Marshmallow , is to allow SD cards and USB devices up to 128GB to serve as internal storage . This feature replaces the clunky , buggy " Move apps to SD card " function . I upgraded a couple different Shield models , one with a 64GB SD card and another with a 128GB USB 3.0 stick , and it they worked fine . Nvidias support forum has a detailed walkthrough . <p> The Shield is easier to accessorize than any streaming box I 've tested . The USB ports work with external USB hard drives and USB sticks for media playback . I connected a 2TB drive filled with photos and videos , including lots of 4K material , and it worked great once I installed the VLC Player app for playback ( the default Photos &amp; Videos app is terrible ) . <h> The 4K factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stream Netflix and YouTube at 4K resolution , but newer 4K devices like the Roku 4 and Amazon Fire TV have since entered the market . Compared with Roku in particular the Shield has fewer 4K-capable apps . The big missing pieces are Amazon and Vudu . None of the current games available for Shield are in 4K yet either . <p> Of course , nearly every 4K TV sold in the US offers its own 4K Smart TV apps , so if you have a 4K TV you 've probably already watched Netflixs 4K streams . Support for UltraFlix and YouTube in 4K is less common among 4K TVs , but available on some . <p> To watch Netflix in 4K , and other copy-protected content , you 'll need to connect the Shield to theHDCP 2.2 input of your 4K TV . The Shield supports 4K at 60 frames per second thanks to HDMI 2.0 , and videophiles will appreciate the ability to force the player to output in 24 frames per second . Nvidia also says the device is capable of delivering HDR content , although none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a few of the 4K TVs in CNETs lab , the Shield performed as expected , delivering a sharp 4K image , which of course was entirely dependent on source material . I did n't  perform the same kinds of side-by-side tests that I have in the past , but its worth reiterating : Do n't  expect to be blown away by the improvement over regular HD , at least not with the current crop of content . <h> GeForce Now and GameStream on the big screen <p> You can also take advantage of Nvidias GeForce Now and GameStream features . <p> GeForce Now is Nvidias cloud gaming service , which used to be called Grid when it was in beta . It allows you to pay $8 per month for unlimited access to a selection of older titles , or pay full price for access to newer ones . <p> GeForce Now in the New York area , both at home , with an average Fios Internet connection of 15Mbps , as well as at the office , with more than 100mpbs . In both situations it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Witcher 3 : The Wild Hunt . Graphics looked decent , if significantly softer than what I 'm used to on the PC or a console . More important it was playable , with little lag and no stutter . I only experienced issues once I began a download on another device , which sucked up a good chunk of bandwidth , sending graphics quality downhill and introducing lag and delays doing pretty much anything . It was unplayable like that . <h> Android TV : Apps , search and interface <p> Beyond all the hardware , 4K and gaming extras , Shield is basically an Android TV box . The platform still lags behind Roku , Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV in my book , but has improved significantly since launch , most recently with Showtime Anytime . One big miss is native support for a large on-demand library beyond Google Movies and TV . <p> You can get access to many more apps using Googles Cast technology , the AirPlay-like system that debuted on Chromecast and is now compatible with numerous other devices . The main issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone and wait for it to connect to watch anything . <p> Search , via both voice and text , worked well . Conversational searches worked well , although recognition was n't always successful . When I was within certain apps , like YouTube , Plex and Sling TV , voice search worked there , too , but it did n't  work within Netflix or Hulu Plus . <h> Conclusion : Too expensive and niche for most people <p> If you want the most powerful Android TV experience around , or if the Shields unique gaming and 4K-streaming capabilities float your boat , its a very solid choice . It should also appeal to Plex and Kodi junkies with reams of files ( regardless of provenance ) who want to pipe videos to a big TV . <p> Beyond that , its a tough sell . The Fire TV is an all-around superior streaming device and the Roku 4 is even better , and both cost less than the Shield . <p> As Google continues to pour resources into Android TV , Nvidia continues to add high-end games and 4K content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential . In the last year it has improved quite a bit , but its still too expensive and limited to appeal to most people . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

Dell XPS 13 : First-Look Review And Smackdown <p> Choosing between Mac and Windows is n't easy , and its even harder when you 're deciding between two of the most striking ultraportable laptops on earth . <p> With the new 12-inch MacBook ( starting at $1,299 ) , Apple has created a fantastically light notebook with a vibrant Retina display and an all-new keyboard and touchpad . In the Windows-powered Dell XPS 13 ( starting at $799 , $1,299 as tested ) , you get a quad-HD , 13-inch touch display in a 11-inch laptops body " thanks to a crazy-thin bezel " and a fast Core i5 CPU . <p> We put these minimalist marvels through 10 rounds of battle to crown a winner , and the XPS 13 came out on top . <p> Apple MacBook <p> Dell XPS 13 Touch* <p> Price <p> $1,299 <p> $1,299 <p> CPU <p> 1.1-GHz Core M <p> 2.2-GHz Core i5 <p> RAM <p> 8GB <p> 8GB <p> Storage <p> 256GB <p> 128GB <p> Display <p> 12 inch ( 2304+1440 pixels ) <p> 13 inches ( 3200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USB 3.0 , Mini DisplayPort , SD card reader <p> Webcam <p> - 480p <p> 720p <p> * Editors Note : There is a cheaper non-touch , fullHD version of the Dell for $999 , but we opted for the touch quadHD screen for this face-off . <h> Design <p> The MacBook Air is almost laughably light , weighing just 2 pounds . You almost cant believe it when you pick it up . However , the aluminum unibody design still feels remarkably sturdy . Even better , Apple has finally decided to offer color options . This machine comes in traditional silver but is also available in a more sophisticated space gray and a fun-but-not-too-blingy gold . <p> In our review of the XPS 13 , we called it a " design triumph " because of its Infinity Display . The bezel around the screen is so narrow that it seems to float above the keyboard . The rest of the system is fetching , too , thanks to an aluminum bottom and top and carbon-fiber deck with soft-touch finish . The Dell is heavier at 2.6 pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.7 x 0.14 to 0.52 inches versus 11.98 x 7.88 x 0.33 to 0.6 inches ) . <p> The XPS 13s only design faux pas is its awkwardly placed webcam , which is in the lower left corner instead of above the screen . This can make for some unflattering selfies . <p> Winner : MacBook . This round is very close , but the MacBooks lighter weight and multiple color options give it the edge . <h> Display <p> The XPS 13 has an edge heading into this round for two reasons : It has a larger 13-inch display ( compared with 12 inches for the MacBook ) , and it has a higher resolution ( 3200 x 1800 versus 2304 x 1440 pixels ) . Plus , only the Dell offers touch capability . But the viewing experience tells a slightly different story . <p> When I looked at the two screens side by side while watching a 4K trailer for Interstellar , the MacBook delivered more saturated color in Matthew McConaugheys face than the XPS 13 . Plus , the Dell kicked back more reflections , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the MacBooks screen literally and figuratively outshone the Dell . Apples ultraportable has a brighter panel ( 353 nits versus 295 nits ) , and its more colorful , representing 101.8 of the sRGB color spectrum ( versus 97 percent ) . The colors offered by the MacBooks screen are also more accurate , as it registered a Delta-E score of 1.2 ( lower is better ) , compared with 5.1 for the XPS 13 . <p> Winner : MacBook . Dells panel is sharper but Apples is more vibrant , richer and has more accurate color . <h> Audio <p> This round was pretty close . Despite its diminutive stature , the MacBook pumped out loud and mostly pleasing audio when I listened to Maroon 5s Sugar and Jay Z and Kanye Wests No Church in the Wild . However , the XPS 13 delivered clearer vocals and performed slightly better on the high end . When I had two fellow colleagues listen to both systems side by side , they liked both but preferred the low-end thump of the MacBook . <p> Winner : MacBook . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as short as the MacBooks list of ports . Apple equipped its laptop with a headphone jack and single USB-C port . Its a versatile port , but you ca n't juice your notebook and connect a peripheral at the same time without an adapter . <p> The XPS 13 has everything I want in an ultraportable , including two USB 3.0 ports , an SD card slot and a Mini DisplayPort adapter . <p> Winner : Dell XPS 13 . No trade-offs required here . <h> Keyboard and Touchpad <p> One of the biggest differences between the XPS 13 and MacBook is ergonomics . While the Dell sports a more traditional touchpad and keyboard combo , Apple developed a new butterfly mechanism for its layout , which allows for a thinner design . The XPS 13s keyboard definitely has more travel . Were talking about the difference between 1.2 mm versus just 0.5 mm on the MacBook . <p> The result for the Mac is a keyboard that feels flat but delivers pretty speedy results . On the 10FastFingers.com test , I averaged 70 words per minute with six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors on the cushier Dell layout . <p> The new Force Touch trackpad on the MacBook delivers haptic vibrations instead of a physical click , but it feels more like the latter . Plus , you can pull off timesaving tricks with a hard press , such as previewing websites in Safari on search result pages , or pulling up a map within the Mail app by force-clicking an address . <h> Webcam <p> You 're not going to FaceTime in HD on the MacBook , as it features a webcam with a resolution of just 848 x 480 pixels . The XPS 13 sports an HD webcam , but as mentioned above , its awkwardly positioned toward the bottom left of the display , which means other video callers will be looking up at your chin . <p> The MacBook delivered more accurate colors but there was noticeable grain throughout the image . The XPS 13s image had less grain but oversaturated hues . <h> Performance <p> The MacBook comes to this battle armed with a 1.1-GHz Core M processor , 8GB of RAM and 256GB of flash storage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.2-GHz Core i5 CPU paired with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD . On Geekbench , which measures overall performance , the Dell wiped the floor with the MacBook , outscoring it 5,653 to 4,631 . <p> However , the MacBook redeemed itself on our spreadsheet productivity test , which involves matching 20,000 names and numbers . Apples notebook took 4 minutes and 33 seconds , compared with 5 minutes for the XPS 13 . <p> The MacBook also benefits from faster flash memory . On our file transfer test , it delivered a rate of 254.5 MBps versus 154.2 MBps for the Dell . <p> Winner : XPS 13 . The Core i5 chip is simply more powerful . <h> Graphics <p> The XPS 13 has more advanced graphics , too . It features Intel HD Graphics 5500 , compared with the HD Graphics 5300 card in the MacBook . We saw the difference on our World of Warcraft test . <p> The XPS 13 hit 35 frames per second with the effects on autodetect and the resolution at 1080p , while the MacBook mustered a not-quite-playable 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Winner : XPS 13 . The GPU in the Dell has more muscle . <h> Battery Life <p> The MacBook packs a big battery into its slim frame . On the Laptop Mag Battery Test , which involves continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits of brightness , the MacBook lasted 8 hours and 43 minutes . <p> The touch-screen version of the XPS 13 lasted more than an hour less at 7:24 . However , if you opt for the nontouch version with a lower-resolution 1080p screen , you 'll get 11:42 of endurance . <p> Winner : Draw . The MacBook lasts longer than the touch XPS 13 , but the nontouch version lasts 3 hours longer . <h> Value <p> The Apple MacBook starts at a premium $1,299 , which gets you a 1.1-GHz Core M CPU , 8GB of RAM and 256GB of flash storage . You can step up to a 1.2-GHz chip and 512GB for $1,599 . <p> Dell gives you a lot more options with the XPS 13 . The starting $799 configuration comes with a Core i3 CPU , 4GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full-HD display . The XPS 13 Touch - we used for this face-off costs $1,299 and sports a 2.2-GHz Core i5 processor , 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD , along with a quad-HD screen . A $1,599 version includes an even faster Core i7 chip and 256GB SSD . <p> Dell also offers a $999 customizable Core i5 version of the XPS 13 , which allows you to choose your SSD and display . <p> Winner : XPS 13 . Well take a faster CPU over more standard storage space in the MacBook , as well as more configuration options . <h> Overall Winner : Dell XPS 13 Touch <p> There are two key reasons the XPS 13 narrowly defeats the Apple MacBook in this face-off : It has more ports and it has more power . For $1,299 , I 'd rather have a faster Core i5 processor and the ability to plug in more than one peripheral at once without a dongle . The Dell XPS 13 also offers a more comfortable typing experience . <p> The 12-inch MacBook is strong in other areas . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glare and lasts longer on a charge . However , the non-touch Dell XPS 13 lasts even longer . Ultimately , the Dell wins this contest . <h> 1 Comment <p> Its also worth bearing in mind that the gadget only works with Windows notebooks or Chromebooks currently , although Mac laptops may eventually be supported . That said , the company claims that the product does offer limited functionality on OS X , and you can always try it out if you do happen to have a MacBook .

@@42737624 @2737624/ <h> Review : Dell XPS 13 ( Late 2016 , Kaby Lake Core I5 ) <p> A little less than a year ago TechOptimals found the Dell XPS 13 to be a stylish slimline business workhorse with all-day battery life . Dell has upped the ante with the 2016 model , bringing Intels 7th Generation Core ( Kaby Lake ) processors into a mix of specifications that gives buyers plenty of choice . <p> The XPS 13s screen fits into a compact chassis thanks to its thin-bezel InfinityEdge design . The thin top bezel means that the webcam is relocated to the bottom left corner . <h> PROS <p> Intel 7th Generation ( Kaby Lake ) processors <p> Very good ( although oversold ) battery life <p> Slim and lightweight <p> Compact for a 13-inch laptop <p> Solid build <h> CONS <p> Rose gold chassis is an expensive option <p> The XPS 13 is an ultraportable laptop that packs a 13.3-inch screen into a chassis that seems , on paper , to be too small for the job . The secret here is what Dell calls InfinityEdge which results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around 20mm along the bottom of the screen . <p> Compare this to the bezel on HPs EliteBook 1030 G1 , which is referred to as near edge-to-edge , where we find a bezel measuring 5mm on the sides , 13mm at the top and 18mm along the bottom . <p> Overall , the XPS 13s chassis measures 304mm wide by 200mm deep by 9-15mm thick . Compared to a sheet of A4 paper , the XPS 13 is 7mm wider and 10mm shallower . <p> As well as being small , the XPS 13 is also lightweight : non-touch versions start at 1.2kg , while a touchscreen brings the starting weight up to 1.29kg . <p> This is a very tough laptop . The aluminium chassis is solid and I found it difficult to flex the screen between my hands . The Corning Gorilla Glass NBT touchscreen provides added strength and scratch resistance , and Dell emphasises the palm rests carbon fibre construction , saying it has the strength of aluminium but is lighter , and feels cooler . I can attest to the cooler finish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also welcome . <p> The 13.3-inch screen is available in touch and non-touch versions , at FHD ( 1,920+1,080 ) or 3,200 by 1,800 resolution . We reviewed the high-res touchscreen version . <p> The screen is superb , although its reflective , which is a bit of an annoyance . However , the tiny bezel somehow makes it feel more pleasant to work on than screens that sit inside a wide , dark frame . My review unit had a resolution of 3,200 by 1,800 pixels ( 276ppi ) and delivered fantastic detailing . Lower-resolution FHD ( 1,920 x 1,080 , 166ppi ) screens are also available . <p> The narrow upper bezel means the webcam has been relocated from the middle of the upper bezel to the bottom left corner of the screen , which has some usability consequences . <p> When positioned in my normal typing position , in the middle of the laptop , I found my head sat slightly right of centre in the webcam image . It did n't  take much manoeuvring to get my head central I just had to learn to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a problem . When the webcam is in its usual position , you seem to be looking ahead at your interlocutor . In this case looking ahead delivers the effect of staring off into the middle distance . Additionally , the cameras view is not head-on to full face , but angles upwards from the chin . If you 're a regular video conferencing user you might want to check this out and make sure you 're happy with it . <p> The keyboard has a slender Enter key and somewhat cramped cursor keys . The Fn keys are slightly narrower and somewhat shorter than the main keys , which those with stubby fingers might find a little tricky to use . To be fair , these compromises are down to the relatively small keyboard area , and the main keys are all well spaced and large enough to hit accurately . <p> The keyboard is backlit and well set up for touch-typists , although the cursor keys are somewhat cramped . <p> The overall feel of the keys is slightly less robust than I like , but that 's a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type at my normal speed . There 's a keyboard backlight , which can be toggled through two brightness levels and turned off via a Fn key . <p> The trackpad is wide enough to take the cursor right across the width of the screen in one sweep , and was nicely responsive . <p> One of the star attractions of the 2016 Dell XPS 13 is Intels 7th generation ( Kaby Lake ) processor , which should contribute towards battery life ( see below ) . But do n't  expect to use this laptop for intensive graphics work : the GPU is upgraded to Intel HD Graphics 620 , but , like other CPU-integrated graphics , its no substitute for a dedicated graphics chipset . <p> Our review sample ran a 2.7-3.5GHz Core i7-7500U with 8GB of RAM , and there are also Core i5 options in the lineup . Indeed , there are no fewer than 11 different configurations of the new XPS 13 available on Dells UK website . One of the reasons for this is the option for a rose gold chassis . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -1,329 ( inc . VAT , or -1,107 ex . VAT ) . That model is identical to the -1,299 ( inc . VAT , or -1,082 ex . VAT ) version apart from its rose gold chassis colour it looks great , but does add a fair bit to the price . <p> Compared to the -1,329 model , our review unit had the benefit of an upgrade from the Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro . In fact , there are no Windows 10 Pro versions available off the page , although you can opt for Ubuntu Linux . <p> Ports and slots are the same as on last years model , in the same places ( on the left and right edges ) . There are two USB 3.0 ports , one on each edge and one with PowerShare . There 's also a USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port , an SD card reader , and a 3.5mm headset jack . <p> Depress a small button on the left edge and up to five tiny white LEDs illuminate to indicate the remaining battery charge . This is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home or office , without having to boot up the laptop . I do n't  understand why this feature is n't more common . <p> So , what about battery life ? Last year we found that the XPS 13 would manage an 8-hour working day on battery power , which was fine , except that Dell claimed up to 18 hours for the 2015 model . <p> For the 2016 model , Dell claims up to 22 hours of use if you 're working with the lower-resolution FHD display . The main product page is unforthcoming concerning the 3,200-by-1,800 display , but elsewhere I found a quote of up to 13 hours for the high-res screen and a Core i5 processor . With a Core i7 and the high-res screen , we can assume that the theoretical battery life is closer to 13 hours than 22 . <p> During testing I worked pretty much non-stop for five hours using a range of online services , depleting the battery to 70 percent in the process . On that basis , a full 8-hour day plus an evenings work should be achievable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@42737628 @2737628/ <h> Review : Sony A6300 Camera <p> Sony may have spent the last few years reshaping the full-frame market with a string of popular compact system cameras , but its also managed to simultaneously keep its APS-C alternatives relevant and exciting . <h> VERDICT <p> The Sony A6300 is a doozy of a sports camera , with 425 autofocus points and 4K video all baked into a mirrorless system . <h> PROS : <p> Very good JPEG quality <p> High-quality viewfinder <p> Fast and capable AF system <h> CONS : <p> Underpowered LCD at default settings <p> Display not touch-sensitive <p> No in-camera raw processing <p> Sony may have spent the last few years reshaping the full-frame market with a string of popular compact system cameras , but its also managed to simultaneously keep its APS-C alternatives relevant and exciting . <p> Its previous A6000 was very much testament to this , with a well-rounded spec sheet and excellent performance helping it to become a successful model for the company . Thankfully , the new A6300 retains what made that model so popular , but the areas in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added layers of appeal to enthusiast users , whether they tend to shoot sports , video or something else . <p> As an upper-level APS-C model the camera goes up against the likes of the Fujifilm X-T1 , as well as the newer and pricier X-Pro2 , together with Micro Four Thirds offerings such as the Olympus Pen-F and more affordable Panasonic Lumix GX8 . Interestingly , at its current price , it also occupies something of a middle ground against Sonys full-frame alternatives , being a little cheaper than the A7 II but pricier than the still-available A7 and A7R . <h> Key features <p> The Exmor CMOS APS-C sensor maintains the same 24.2MP pixel count as the one inside the A6000 , although the sensor itself is newly developed , and features copper wiring in its construction to boost readout speed and light-gathering efficiency . <p> Sony has also said that refinements to the cameras BIONZ X processing engine mean it can squeeze all the goodness out of the new sensor , with particular focus on low-noise , high-resolution results in the upper range of the cameras ISO100-51,200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its 4D Focus system , with 425 phase-detect AF pixels that reach almost to the peripheries of the frame . This is the highest number of phase-detect points we 've seen on an interchangeable-lens camera to date , and this density , together with 169 additional contrast-detect points , is said to enable the camera to focus on moving subjects in as little as 0.05 seconds . <p> Furthermore , the cameras phase-detect points continue to function when using A-mount lenses via an adapter , which will no doubt please those moving up from the older system . <p> Those intending to use the camera for moving subjects will also be pleased to learn that not only has the 11fps burst-shooting option of the A6000 been maintained with focus tracking and exposure adjusted throughout the burst but that a slightly slower 8fps alternative option is also on hand , with a blackout between each frame to provide a similar experience to using an optical viewfinder . <p> Video recording has also received plenty of attention . In contrast to the Full HD standard on the A6000 and most other cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting in the Super 35mm format a first for a non-full-frame Sony model . <p> Instead of using pixel binning , this captures 6K footage i.e. oversampling the scene before downsampling it to a 4K resolution , a process that Sony claims produces exceptional depth and detail . <p> Other changes include a new XAVC S codec used for the above , and the S-Log Gamma function . Thanks to the changes made to the focusing system , focus speeds are also said to be twice as fast as the system inside the A6000 , while a 3.5mm mic port has also been included . <p> The 3-inch display on the rear , with its 921k-dot resolution and ability to be tilted , has been carbon copied from the A6000 , which means its shaped in the video-friendly 16:9 aspect ratio , although sadly its not a touch-sensitive screen . <p> The 0.39-inch electronic viewfinder above this , however or Tru-Finder in Sony parlance has now been equipped with a 2.359 million-dot XGA OLED panel , against the 1.44 million dots seen previously . <p> If this viewfinder sounds familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also sported one with similar specs , from the Cyber-shot RX1R II compact to the A7 family of mirrorless models . Magnification is once again set at 1.07x , which is roughly equivalent to 0.70x in 35mm terms , and Sony also claims that setting it to its maximum display rate of 120fps results in very few afterimages . <p> Other changes include improved dust and moisture resistance , although not quite to the same splash-proof level as the Olympus OM-D E-M5 II and Fujifilm X-Pro2 , as well as a gauge for keeping shots level , and a new silent shooting mode that should see the camera more suited to sensitive environments . <p> Battery life has also been boosted , with 350 frames quoted when using the viewfinder and 400 frames when using the LCD screen , although the number actually achieved will be subject to display settings and image-reviewing habits , among other things . <p> In terms of connectivity , the camera is furnished with the standard USB and HDMI micro connections , with Wi-Fi and NFC on the inside to keep things cable-free where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it records all images and videos onto SD , SDHC and SDXC media ( with support for up to UHS-I ) , as well as the less-common , Sony-specific Memory Stick PRO Duo format . <p> The A6300 makes a positive first impression . The large , rubbered grip , combined with the bodys depth and the raised edge on the thumb rest , makes it easier to handle than many similar cameras . The body also appears to strike the right balance between offering plenty of logically positioned controls without attempting to cram these onto every surface , causing you to press buttons inadvertently . <p> Occasionally , however , I felt the grip wasnt raised far enough from the front plate for it to always be entirely comfortable , particularly when holding the camera between shots . I found the tips of my fingers were often squashed against the front plate , and ultimately I resorted to holding the camera by the lens rather than the grip when carrying it , with my index finger on the back plate for extra security . <p> The top and front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one button present across both ( a customisable control next to the shutter release button/power switch collar ) . Because of this the camera is able to offer both a built-in flash and a multi-interface shoe in addition to the electronic viewfinder , together with two large dials a command dial and another for changing the shooting mode . <p> The stiffness of the shooting mode dial is welcome , as most photographers wont be adjusting this with such frequency that would require it to be looser ( and thus more prone to accidental turning ) . Likewise the stiffness of the command dial next to it , which can be used to adjust aperture , shutter speed , exposure compensation and more which is perhaps just as well given its more exposed and easy-to-knock edges , although it would be good to see the camera more responsive to its turning , as it can take a fair few turns to get to where you want to be . <p> The back plate mostly follows a tried-and-tested formula , with a handful of well-marked controls and the loosely moving control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . <p> One new change is the arrival of a collar around the magnify button ; this can be used in conjunction with the button to select Auto-Exposure Lock , or alternatively to quickly switch to manual focus . This works well and falls right next to the thumb , so its great if you often find yourself fine-tuning focus . <p> The rear display pulls away easily , but is stiff enough to remain in the position to which its adjusted . When extended to certain positions , however , some of the most frequently-used controls are awkward to operate , particularly the Fn and menu buttons , as well as the control wheel . <p> The menu system is comprehensive , with a generally good level of clarity in terms of display and language ( a handful of abbreviations are used , although the majority are n't  quite as cryptic as on other cameras ) . <p> But , although options are segregated into different tabs , some groups of settings overflow where they could easily be placed under one . Given that there are 27 separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being no colour-coding something present on other Sony models it can sometimes be difficult to find what you need . <p> One slight annoyance is the position of the movie record button , right at the edge of the rear plate . During this test , I assigned movie recording to the C1 button on the top plate to make this more convenient to press , although this can be assigned elsewhere should you already have this set to another function of your choosing . <p> The diopter correction wheel is also in perhaps the least convenient place possible , making adjustments while your face is to the camera unnecessarily awkward . <p> Although the A6000s viewfinder was a capable performer its still welcome to see this component upgraded on the Sony A6300 , given how key a part of the camera it is . As someone who does n't  wear glasses I found its eye-point to be in just the right spot for me when held at a comfortable distance away . The panels resolution provides very good clarity and contrast is high , and although noise and lagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The on-screen ( shooting ) display of the LCD is large and clear , and the fact that images captured in the standard 3:2 aspect ratio do not occupy the entirety of the screen helps , as the black borders on either side allow for most of the secondary shooting information to stand out ( the rest is superimposed on the image ) . <p> The screen itself appears somewhat underpowered when used outside , however , even under overcast conditions . Switching the camera to the Sunny Weather option , or brightening the display manually , is a great help , although this obviously comes at the expense of battery life . <p> Although the camera does n't  quite offer the near-instant start-up time of a similar DSLR , its not so far behind that it makes any difference in all but critical situations . <p> Sony states that the A6300 can shoot 21 consecutive raw frames or the same number of Raw+JPEG frames , and 44 JPEG frames at the highest quality setting . In practice , the camera easily met all of these targets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory cards may throttle this . <p> Helpfully , the camera also remained operational while writing images to the card , not fully functional but often allowing a few subsequent frames to be captured as these were being dealt with . <p> The revamped focusing system is one of the A6300s main highlights , so does it deliver on the high expectations ? Largely , yes . In good light it brings subjects to focus with very little delay , refocusing whenever the lens is zoomed to an approximate point so that focusing takes as little time as possible when initiated by the user . <p> The camera also willingly deploys the AF assist light wherever it feels it needs to , which helps to keep focusing speed swift in poorer light . <p> The high number of phase-detect AF points , and in turn their density , also plays a significant part in ensuring that moving subjects are tracked successfully and performance here is strong . As soon as focus is acquired , the relevant number of points dance around the subject , and continue to adhere as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work very well whether the subject was moving towards or away from the camera , roughly along the optical axis , or if it was moving across the frame . In the latter case the camera would , more often than not , continue to track the subject as it approached the very edge of the focusing array ( it does n't  stretch right up to the peripheries , but close enough ) , and it managed to do this with subjects moving at a variety of speeds . <p> Although I could appreciate how well the A6300 did from monitoring the focus points movement at the time of capture , examining my images afterwards showed that while it did occasionally leave the subject , and sometimes move instead to a flat , featureless area that you would n't ordinarily expect would present any kind of distraction , on many occasions it successfully managed to make its way back to the subject . On other occasions it did not , although the overall hit rate showed the system to be highly capable in such scenarios . Overall , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . <p> The 8fps burst shooting mode will be a popular option for those coming from DSLRs , given how its not possible to appreciate exactly when images have been captured using the faster 11fps mode . Of course , the sound from the shutter gives you some idea , but the lack of a visible cue does result in the disconnect that Sony has attempted to remedy with the slower option . <p> There is an even slower Lo option , which fires at three frames per second , although whichever mode you use the constant presence of the focusing points and their movement keeps you updated on how accurately the camera is keeping up on the subject . Its a shame , however , that only the Lo option can be used in conjunction with silent shooting , as you may want to use the faster options when capturing live subjects . <p> The Sony A6300s metering system is largely reliable , with just an occasional bias towards underexposure . Often this would only be around half a stop or so away from what was expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in post-capture raw processing . <p> The cameras auto white balance system also did very well to faithfully reproduce colours in a range of conditions , even impressing under typically problematic artificial sources . <p> The quality of JPEGs straight out of the camera is very good . Images show good sharpness , contrast and colour next to raw files , although the raw files are generally well coloured to begin with , so the difference here is not as significant as usual . <p> JPEGs also show that the DRO system does well to slightly bring up shadow areas , to make images more suitable for immediate use . <p> Noise is generally well controlled across the range , and images are perfectly usable even at higher settings such as ISO6400 . My only reservation is the cameras Normal noise reduction setting , which appears somewhat heavy handed in its approach to high-ISO images ; thankfully , a Low setting and the option to disable the feature completely are on offer . <p> With the Sony E 16-70mm f/4 Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar T* ZA OSS mounted the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing consistency across the frame when the lens is stopped down to a mid-range aperture . Many users , however , are likely to be using the camera in conjunction with the Sony E 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ OSS kit option , which I did n't  have access to for this review . <p> Overall video quality from the A6300 is excellent . Footage shows plenty of detail and motion is nice and smooth , and there are no obvious artefacts present in footage captured under balanced conditions . Even in lower light , where noise patterning starts to take hold , footage shows just a slight texture rather than being swamped with unsightly coloured noise . If you 're viewing results on a display with a resolution lower than 4K , you 're also likely to see such imperfections to a lesser degree . <p> Audio quality in videos is also decent , with a clean sound and good balance between bass and treble . As with many other cameras , it is somewhat susceptible to the battering sounds of wind noise , although using an external microphone with a deadcat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible to use the Sunny Weather setting when recording in 4K , which means the aforementioned screen brightness issues rear their head . <p> We chose three rival cameras for the Sony A6300 to see how it measured up in our lab tests : the Panasonic GX8 , the Olympus PEN-F and the Fuji X-Pro2 <p> Weve carried out lab tests on the Sony A6300 across its full ISO range for resolution , noise ( including signal to noise ratio ) and dynamic range . We test the JPEGs shot by the camera , but we also check the performance with raw files . Most enthusiasts and pros prefer to shoot raw , and the results can often be quite different . <h> Sony A6300 resolution charts <p> We test camera resolution using an industry-standard ISO test chart that allows precise visual comparisons . This gives us numerical values for resolution in line widths/picture height , and you can see how the Sony A6300 compares with its rivals in the charts below . <p> JPEG resolution analysis : The A6300 leads the way for detail resolution amongst its competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis : The A6300 puts in an impressively consistent performance , managing to maintain a high level of detail into the high sensitivity settings . <p> his is a test of the cameras noise levels . The higher the signal to noise ratio , the greater the difference in strength between the real image data and random background noise , so the cleaner the image will look . The higher the signal to noise ratio , the better . <h> Sony A6300 signal to noise ratio charts <p> JPEG signal to noise ratio analysis : The A6300 does an excellent job to match the signal to noise performance of its rivals at its base ISO , and remains strong as sensitivity is raised . Even at the highest settings tested , the readings show it to be very capable . <p> Raw ( converted to TIFF ) signal to noise ratio analysis : Despite strong JPEG results , the camera fails to keep up with the competition when raw images are analysed here . Performance is consistent across the sensitivity range , but sadly lower throughout . <p> While there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A6300 is nevertheless a competent and reliable camera that does what it sets out to do very well . Crucially , it captures pleasing images on standard settings and records video to a high standard . <p> The previous A6000 can currently be had for less than half the price of the A6300 , and this could make the newer model appear overpriced although those using the viewfinder or focus tracking with some frequency , or needing 4K video recording to hand , may find this premium more reasonable . <p> Still , the model is n't short of strong competitors . Videographers may well be drawn to the cheaper 4K-shooting Panasonic Lumix GX8 ; that cameras form , and the additions of an electronic viewfinder and flexible LCD , make it seem like the A6300s closest rival , while the companys bulkier GH4 or the GH4R update are also viable alternatives if video recording is key . <p> Those not fussed about 4K video resolution can also turn to the excellent Olympus OM-D E-M5 II or newer Pen-F , both of which offer the advantage of built-in image stabilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also add the Fujifim X-T1 , and even one of Sonys similarly priced A7-series models , to their shortlist . <h> Likes <p> There 's plenty to like about the Sony A6300 . Its focusing system is sound , replete with options for capturing a range of different subjects and performs strongly when tracking moving subjects , while the viewfinder is a pleasure to use . The tiltable screen makes composing images at ground level or high up easy . Video quality is excellent , and images are pleasing straight out of the camera . <h> Dislikes <p> In the absence of any significant failings , its only really a handful of smaller shortcomings that let the Sony A6300 down . The screen feels somewhat underpowered ; some of the controls are n't  quite as accessible as they could be ; and the lack of in-camera raw processing is a shame . Furthermore , while the tiltable LCD is great , its shame its not a touchscreen . <p> These are all minor issues though , and none of them should realistically discourage anyone interested in what the A6300 offers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model that should have wide appeal , both on account of what it offers on paper and its performance in a range of situations . <p> Those intending on using the A6300 for more considered video recording , or for tracking moving subjects ( or both ) are likely to be very pleased with what the camera offers , while the excellent electronic viewfinder also makes it a good choice for traditionalists who may have reservations about moving away from optical types . Its only really a handful of design and handling issues that let it down , making it slightly less convenient to operate than needs be . <p> Those who are tempted by what the camera offers but are on a budget should consider the previous A6000 , which is still available at a temptingly low price . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

The Kindle Oasis feels like the expensive device it is , with mostly clever design choices that will make it the superior way to experience text in 2016 , - for a certain audience , anyway . <p> That audience is affluent , book-obsessed and traveling near constantly . The Kindle Oasis owner understands the value in putting the smartphone down to focus on leisure when appropriate .

The innovations are slowing : Kindle Oasis is likely the best eReader you can buy , but it is mostly a new shell for existing technology .

Given what we 've seen in the explosion of AI assistants and software bots from other companies , you 'd expect Google to brand these products ' connective tissue with a personality and a name " Apple has Siri , Amazon has Alexa , and Microsoft has Cortana . <p> Instead , Google 's new AI assistant is just called Google Assistant . What used to be known as Google Now , the predictive assistant inside Android , has been broadened into a bigger initiative to bring those capabilities further into the real world , bolstered by years spent building out its extensive Knowledge Graph and honing its ability to parse human language . It 's an indication of Google 's ambitions for the product that it wants us to simply call it Google . <p> " WE THINK OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Today , we have an understanding of 1 billion entities : people , places , and things , and the relationships of them in the real world , " said CEO Sundar Pichai onstage Wednesday . " We can do things which we never thought we could do before . " <p> In the- mobile chat app Allo , Google Assistant can understand follow-up queries and perform complex operations on your behalf . Google Home , a- new Amazon Echo-like speaker , - can manage your daily routine and pull information and media from the web . One uses text , the other voice . But both are powered by the same core Google software . " We think of this as building each user their own individual Google , " Pichai said . <p> Starting with products like Allo and Home , Google is extending its search-like capabilities to solve real-world problems . Conversations with friends , decisions about services , purchasing , media consumption " these are all ways Google can now serve us away from the web browser and even beyond the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will be challenging . With Alexa , Amazon has become an early leader in the digital assistant and smart home spaces , so much so that Pichai name-dropped the company onstage at I/O . Amazon succeeded in part by positioning Alexa as a do-it-all AI butler with a familiarity you can recognize and rely on . <p> ALEXA POSES A BIG THREAT TO GOOGLES AMBITIONS IN THE HOME <p> Alexa may not be anywhere near as powerful as Google search " it certainly ca n't process follow-up questions and complex queries at the level Google 's assistant can . But Amazon 's software is teaching consumers a vocabulary with which to interact with Amazon and third-party services . Using the Echo is simple , and it works . Amazon has also racked up an impressive suite of integrations , making Alexa more powerful by way of connecting it to other company 's products . Google has n't yet announced a similar set of tools for developers to unlock and tap into its capabilities . <p> Competing with Alexa is- not just about overcoming Amazon 's early lead- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat Google as more than a search engine . That reorientation is likely why the company does n't want to add another name like Siri or Alexa into the mix . It wants its name being uttered in homes and into phones all around the world . The company 's AI assistant is n't just called Google , it is Google . That 's going to take some getting used to . <p> " That search box is so iconic , " Scott Huffman , Google 's vice president of engineering for search , told The Verge . " Its such a strong thing in peoples minds . Its associated with I express my need in a really simple way and I get back public information . ' " But , he adds , " its been a bit of a leap for our users to now think of that box as a place where I can also call grandma . " The expansion from searching the internet to using Google for any need that can be accomplished with an internet service is central to the company 's future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking . Google knows your weekly calendar , your flight times , your dinner reservations , your music and TV and movie tastes , who your friends are , how often you talk to them , and much , much more about your personal life . Soon , Google will be in your home , learning even more about you . With this information , it can reach deeper into the fabric of everyday life . <p> It sounds unsettling , and Alphabet-owned Nest even- resisted the urge to release an Echo-like product for fear that consumers would reject the idea of Google listening to us in our living rooms . Yet what Amazon did , perhaps to Google 's benefit , was show how willing we are to set aside our fear of being eavesdropped by corporations in exchange for the convenience the software provides . The tone set at I/O , and the future that Google is promising , represents a powerful vision of technology-assisted living , perhaps powerful enough to overcome uneasiness about always-listening software . <p> ITS A BOLD MOVE , AND IT MAY FALL FLAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brin created a searchable roadmap for the early consumer internet , Google believes it can now help us navigate the real world and alleviate us of its more mundane tasks . This time around , the company wants to use the power of its search engine and AI advancements to turn our everyday activities into learnable data points . It feels only inevitable before more and more of those activities are performed by Google , on your behalf and with you needing to ask . <p> Yet if Google succeeds , it could become an early and indisputable leader in what is shaping up to be an AI arms race . Part of that will involve teaching consumers that the name we 've come to trust for finding information on the internet is just as capable at reaching through the screen and assisting us in the real world . 20738 @qwx430738 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

The speakers virtually mapped the large performance space in seemingly minute detail I could even tell where the rowdiest audience members were standing .

Other 800 Series speakers have been used in Abbey Road Studios , Skywalker Ranch , Capitol Records , Warner Music Group , Sterling Sound and many other pro studios . <p> The 800 D3 Series speakers are the culmination of seven years of development at the companys research center in Steyning .

Though it does n't  look radically different from the second generation 805 Diamond Series speakers , Bowers &amp; Wilkins claims hundreds of design changes have been made from the model that was introduced in 2010 . <p> My samples were finished in a lovely matte Rosenut veneer , but gloss black is also available . Build quality standards are commensurate with the 805 D3s high asking price . Bowers &amp; Wilkins also offers handsome floor stands for use with the 805 D3 which will cost $1,000/-450/AU$1,499 per pair . <p> Rather than build the cabinet from more common medium-density fiberboard the 805 D3s cabinet is constructed from multiple layers of beech wood bonded to a laminate , which is curved under pressure at the Bowers &amp; Wilkins factory . When combined with the cabinets internal Matrix bracingwhich is made from medium-density fiberboardthe company claims the result is a stronger , more acoustically-inert design . Wrap your knuckles against the 805 D3s cabinet , and all you 'll get are sore knuckles . <p> The most obvious change to Bowers and Wilkins 800 Diamond Series speakers is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 805 D3 instead sports a grey 6.5-inch Continuum cone which was developed inhouse by Bowers &amp; Wilkins . The brand new Continuum driver is a sandwich consisting of a metallized weave and a foam core that 's said to be lighter and stronger than the Kevlar cone , and which the company says results in much less distortion . <p> The 805 D3 comes with removable black cloth grilles , but I never used them . A flared and stippled " Flowport " bass port , which the company has long used to combat the chuffing effects of " port noise " , sits just below the woofer on the front baffle . <p> The one-inch ( 25mm ) diamond tweeter that sits atop the 805 D3s cabinet is now fitted to a solid aluminum housing , which is compliantly mounted to the cabinet to decouple the tweeter from cabinet vibrations . The tweeters diamond dome is formed by " chemical vapour deposition " , a process Bower &amp; Wilkins uses to " grow " diamond particles into a complex shape . The company claims the 805 D3s diamond tweeter remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or fabric dome tweeters , so the highest treble is " cleaner , " less distorted and stereo imaging is enhanced . <p> The beautifully-machined , solid-metal speaker connectors work with banana plugs , spades , pins , or stripped bare wires . Each speaker has a double set of connectors , so the 805 D3 can be biwired , or used with standard single wire cables . <p> The speakers " nominal " impedance is 8 ohms , but it drops down to 4 ohms at some frequencies . That said , the 805 D3 can be used with nearly any receiver or amplifier , but a speaker with the 805 D3s capabilities should be paired with the best possible electronics . <p> For home theater applications you might team the 805 D3 with the matching Bowers &amp; Wilkins HTM2 center channel speaker ( $4,000 , -3,000 , AU$5,900 each ) , add a second set of 805 D3s as surround channel speakers , and the Bowers &amp; Wilkins DB1 subwoofer ( $4,500 , -3,250 , AU$6,500 each ) . <p> The 800 Diamond Series also includes three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is itself an improvement on the speaker used in Abbey Road Studios . It will put you back a cool $22,000 ( -16,500/AU$35,900 ) a pair . The **25;116;TOOLONG 803 D3 boasts a similar shape but will " only " set you back $17,000 ( -12,500/AU$24,500 ) while the more orthodox 804 D3 floorstander costs $9,000 ( -6,750 , AU$13,500 ) per pair . <h> Sultry Sonics <p> I listened to the 805 D3s in the CNET listening room with a Rotel RA-1592 stereo integrated amplifier and an Oppo BDP-105 Blu-ray player ; and a different pair of 805 D3s at home with my high-end system with a Pass Labs XP-20 preamplifier , XA100.5 power monoblock amps , and a dCS Puccini SACD/CD player . <p> Listening to a David Crosby demo of " Deja Vu , " singing alone with an acoustic guitar there was an undeniable organic " wholeness " to the sound of his instrument , so even by high-end speaker standards it sounded more like a real guitar . Its a simple recording , with no added production tricks , and maybe that 's why it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on me . <p> The 805 D3s tell the truth about the sound of music . They reveal more , like the way Holly Coles drummer slides his brushes ever so gently over his drum heads on " I Want You , " from her " Temptation " album . I 've played this tune on literally hundreds of speakers since this record was released in 1995 , but the drums never sounded this real before . Ms. Coles steamy vocals were also more completely realized , the 805 D3s were letting more of her music through . <p> Its a great late night listening speaker , even at hushed volume , there 's no loss of detail or resolution . Turn it up and the sound gets louder of course , but the quality of the sound remains constant . Still , this is n't the sort of speaker you buy to play head banger music cranked way up loud . If your room is huge , or high impact sound is what you crave , go for one of the 805 D3s larger tower siblings . <p> Stereo imaging was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nama " CD . This folk music from Argentina with vocals , guitar , accordion , bass , and percussion sounded remarkably natural and present . The stereo imaging was n't just deep and broad , the sound of each instrument occupied its own " space " between the two 805 D3s . The diamond tweeters delicate and airy high frequencies were extraordinarily clear . <p> The sound of solo piano is a tough test for any speaker , but here with the 805 D3s Patrick Cohens lovely " Satie Piano Work " CD made me sit up and take notice of Cohens touch , each note was clear , his subtle dynamic shadings were precisely rendered . <p> To test the 805 D3s stamina with blitzed out rock I popped on the Flaming Lips completely insane remake of Pink Floyds " Dark Side of the Moon " album . The guitars and God knows what elses blistering distortion and massively processed sounds lit up the 805 D3s . There 's a ravishingly dense texture to the sound of this recording , that 's for sure ! <p> Bowers And Wilkins- speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Browns astonishing " Love Peace Power , " Live at the Olympia Theater , in Paris , 1971 album . Even by JB standards this concert is over the top , the band is on fire , and Browns lungpower is super-human . The 805 D3 did n't  hold anything back , the fierce grooves never let up . I next pummeled the speakers with Battles frantic prog rock from their " Mirrored " album , and the 805 D3s took the abuse in stride . The Battles John Staniers drumming dazzled , and the 805 D3s unraveled the bands jam-packed mixes with ease . That ability is cruise through even the most complex mixes is one of the things that separates the 805 D3 from other merely excellent speakers . <p> The 805 D3s tonal balance is cooler and leaner than strictly neutral , its not a warm and sweet sounding speaker . Then again , no speaker is ever really 100 percent neutral , they all impart some character to the sound . The 805 D3s mid-bass definition is very good , but not up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep bass under 50 hertz is in short supply , just as it is with any similarly sized speaker . Even so , few 805 D3 owners add subwoofers to their stereo systems , but if you want to feel your room shake consider purchasing Bowers &amp; Wilkins DB1 , PV1D , or another brands subs . <h> Top-end audio for a top-end price <p> The Bowers &amp; Wilkins 805 D3 is a tour de force of high-end speaker design . Not just in sound quality , every aspect of the speaker the tech and materials used in the cabinet , drivers , and crossover network are all exemplary . While its a very expensive speaker , when compared with high-end speakers from Magico , Sonus Faber , Wilson Audio , or YG Acoustics the 805 D3 is relatively affordable . However , while other components of a system such as digital playback devices , streamers , and processors will , in the coming years go out of date , the 805 D3 might provide literally decades of enjoyment . In that light its a sensible investment for buyers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 805 D3 will be one of my reference speakers for years to come . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 
@@42737660 @2737660/ <h> ZTE unveils Axon 7 with high-end specs with a budget price <p> Unless you 're a hardcore tech lover and you follow all the Android fan blogs , odds are good that youve never heard of the Axon 7 and had no idea it was in the works . <p> The word " elegant " does n't  usually come to my mind when I think of ZTE ( the Chinese phone manufacturer is mostly known for its inexpensive , midtier handsets ) , but with the announcement of its latest Axon 7 flagship , I ca n't help but think the phone looks , well pretty elegant . <p> While ZTE still stuck to a competitive price ( the device costs $450 unlocked , or approx. -346 , AU$604 ) , it features powerful enough hardware to satisfy Googles recently announced virtual reality platform , - Daydream . And compared with its other high-end competitors , its one of the cheapest marquee handsets on the market . <p> The phone will be available today in China and then roll out to other markets in mid-June . There will be two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RAM , and another that has 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM . The former , however , will be more widely available and itll be the only one sold in the US . <p> I had a chance to spend some meaningful time with the Axon 7 , but it did n't  have its final software version loaded just yet . That being said , I was still able to get a good look at the device and I ran some preliminary tests too . Of course , once we get a final model in , I 'll update my impressions with a full review . If you also want to see how the handsets specs compare to its competitors , head down to the comparison chart below . <p> ( PS : And , if anyone out there is wondering what exactly happened to Axon 2 through 6 , do n't  worry there werent really any . ZTE decided to include its Grand S and Star series in the flagship lineage and then jumped to 7 because reasons -(p)/- ) . <h> Fit for a Daydream <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced a new VR initiative called Daydream , which was a hardware and software platform that would guide Android phone companies to make VR headsets . ( For a deeper dive of the endeavor , check out our feature with Googles VR chief Clay Bavor . ) The tech giant said a bunch of manufacturers are already on board with Daydream-ready phones including LG , HTC and ZTE.The Axon 7 is one of these handsets that fulfill Googles VR standard . This includes hardware like a 9-axis gyroscope , Hi-Fi audio ( which I 'll get into later ) and a powerful processor . Though it will be some time until anyone gets their hands on a Daydream headset , ZTE gains a lot by throwing its name behind Googles . By being Daydream-ready , the Axon 7 will be able to keep up with its competitors and attract users who are already interested in VR . <h> Easy on the eyes <p> With its unibody design , metallic aesthetic and solid build quality , the Axon 7 is the best-looking phone ZTE has created so far . Its 5.5-inch display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to view in the sunlight outdoors . <p> Given its luxe looks , though , I did notice that it felt heavy in the hand . Tipping the scales at 6.52 ounces ( 185g ) , it weighs more than any of its competitors ( again , see chart below ) . However , its still comfortable to hold and maneuver in general.Similar to the LG G5 , the device features a fingerprint reader in the back , which you can use for extra security . The sensor works quickly , and I did n't  notice any lag from when I pressed the reader and when the screen unlocked . If you do n't  want to use your fingerprint , you can also use your voice to say a pre-programmed phrase and unlock the handset that way . <p> On the front top and bottom bezels are the dual audio grilles . ZTE put a big emphasis on the phones audio experience . In addition to the two speakers , the Axon 7 is decked out with Dolby Atmos audio technology and an advanced chipset that will allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I played a few music tracks and movie clips on the handset , audio was indeed loud and clear . It also had a lot of depth and did n't  come off as " crunchy " as phones with small , narrow audio grilles usually do . <h> Software goodies with optional stock Android <p> The Axon 7 runs Google Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow . This newest version of the mobile OS includes more emojis , security updates , and you can launch the camera by double pressing the power key . <p> If you do n't  like ZTEs MiFavor interface , you can switch it up to stock Android . <p> Aside from a few new voice and gesture controls ( you can activate the camera shutter , make a call , get the device to read out texts just by speaking to it ) , the handset does n't  have anything particular new or compelling in terms of software . <p> It will give users , however , the option to switch from ZTEs own MiFavor user interface to stock Android . Because the unit I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't able to check out this feature yet . ( When I do , I 'll be sure to update this piece . ) Until then though , I welcome this option . I 'm a big fan of vanilla Android due to its clean aesthetic and simplicity , so the ability to switch to it is great . However , because this is n't a Nexus phone ( they also run the stock UI ) , it wo n't receive software updates from Google as soon as they are available . <h> New camera , new tricks <p> The Axon 7 is equipped with an 8-megapixel front-facing shooter and a 20-megapixel camera in the rear that can record 4K video . Last years Axon had two rear cameras ( a 2- and 13-megapixel ) that enabled users to adjust and refocus the background and foreground after they captured an image . Though this years device only has one camera , ZTE loaded it up with software that still let 's users change an images focal point . For the most part , this tool is n't totally necessary ( especially if you like to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty fun to play around with when I wanted to make my pictures look more dramatic . <p> Overall , the camera was fast , and images were sharp and in focus . Colors looked true-to-life and lighting was exposed properly and evenly . For more about photo quality . <p> Other features include short live photos that turn pictures into moving GIFs and timelapse video . The latter is n't new to high-end handsets in general , but it is new for a ZTE phone . <h> Checking out the hardware <p> The Axon 7 runs smoothly and tasks like fingerprint unlocking , launching the camera and returning to the home screen were executed quickly . Its 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor is the same used in other flagships and it clocked in some of the highest benchmark results we 've seen . In fact , it was on par with the Samsung Galaxy S7 with our 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test , as well as both Geekbench 3 tests . It also edged out the HTC 10 , the G5 and the Google Nexus 6P . Anecdotally , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to day-to-day tasks , I could n't really tell that the Axon 7 is any " faster , " than the rest . Its impressive benchmark numbers , however , is a notable indicator of how far ZTE handsets have come in terms of hardware performance . <h> Battery life <p> ZTE beefed up the battery just a tad going from last years Axon Pros 3,000mAh capacity to 3,140mAh . During our lab test for continuous video playback on Airplane mode , the phone clocked an average ( out of two trials ) of 11 hours and 18 minutes ( compared to last years 8 hours and 8 minutes ) . It also has Quick Charge 3.0 technology from Qualcomm , which promises a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes . When I tested this claim , the device had a 47 percent charge in half an hour . A full charge takes about an hour and a half . <p> For comparison , ZTEs handset did n't  outlast the G5s 12 and a half hour scour , nor the Galaxy S7s 16 hours . But it did edge out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted 11 hours and 15 minutes . <h> ZTEs time to shine <p> Though I 'll hold out any final judgements until I get my hands on a final post-production unit , the ZTE Axon 7 has a lot of potential . The fact that it performs comparably well to the flagships of Samsung , LG , HTC and Google is a testament of how far the company has come in just the last year with its Pro predecessor . In addition , by being compatible with Daydream , the phone will keep up with the mobile wave as it makes its way into VR waters . <p> At $450 unlocked ( which converts to about -346 , AU$604 ) , the devices low price tag and high-end specs like its 20-megapixel camera , Snapdragon 820 processor and booming audio speakers make it a tempting buy . True , it wont fit everyones needs ( for instance , you cant take out the battery , and its stock version of Android wont get updated as quickly as a Nexus handset ) and ZTE still struggles with low brand recognition . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right marks that goes into a solid flagship . 20738 @qwx430738 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 
@@42737661 @2737661/ <h> Review : Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 On-Ear <p> The Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 is an incredibly well-built pair of headphones that deliver compact , warm and pleasant audio . However , it comes at a hefty price . <h> Our- Opinion <p> The Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 on-ear ( M2 OEi ) are not the average headphones that you would spot around . It looks beautiful , is built very well , and delivers warm , wholesome audio that is very , very pleasant to hear . It does miss slight intricate- details , but the entire auditory experience is entirely focussed around letting you enjoy your music , than be an audiophile studio companion . At Rs. 15,990 , it is a worthy investment for anyone who loves good audio with added design elements . <h> PROS <p> Beautiful , premium looks <p> Very well built <p> Warm , compact audio <p> Sound is well balanced <p> Dual-3.5mm audio cable with interlock <h> CONS <p> Expensive <p> Lacks the most intricate details <p> Slightly compromised soundstage <p> Uncomfortable on prolonged wear <h> Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 On-Ear : Detailed Review <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among premium headphones for a while , with great build quality , tight , well-balanced audio and all the finesse that you can ask for . What we have here with us is the second iteration , an ivory-finish , wired version of the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 On-Ear headphones . Sennheiser has given it a slight redesign to address complaints of discomfort in prolonged usage , and claims to have improved on audio quality . While I have n't tested its predecessor myself , here 's what I found the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 On-Ears to be all about , after two weeks with it . <p> Build , Design , Comfort Let 's set things off with the first aspect that you will notice - the impeccable build and finesse on the Momentum 2.0 . Crafted out of metal gantries , smooth , durable plastic , Alcantara fabric and fine , premium grade stitching , the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 is a sight to look at . The headband is pliant and durable , with smooth , matte fabric and a ridge at the centre of it to decrease the pressure while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallic plates in place on the outer shell , labelled Momentum to the left , and Sennheiser to the right . The brushed metal plates on the dark tan fabric impart class , and complement the neat stitches . The metal hinges on either end allow the headphones to fold and have an interlock in the middle , adding firmness to the entire build . The metal gantries are strong , and will not give in to copious amounts of careless usage . Nevertheless , chances are that you would n't use the Momentum roughly , and the following paragraph explains why . <p> The earcups on the Momentum are a sheer delight . Clad in Alcantara fabric with decent cushioning , the Momentum 2.0 has improved upon wear comfort with these . You still feel the tightness around the earcups after about 45 minutes of wearing it , but it is still reasonably comfortable for supra-aural on-ears . The incident pressure on ears is 3.2 N , falling within the recommended range of 4 N. It is important to highlight exactly how premium the Momentum 2.0 are " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Porsche 's customised cars , and that says a lot . A gleaming metal band lies between the ear cups and the ivory-toned plastic base of the cup , held to the metal gantries with round adjustable jockeys on either side . The height adjustment of the headband is smooth , as against the obstacle ridge adjustment mechanism deployed by many others . <p> Sennheiser also provides a dual-3.5mm audio cable , something that we missed in the Urbanite . This helps in case you lose the cable , and need a quick replacement . The headphone-end jack of the cable has an interlocking mechanism to prevent sudden tugs from disconnecting it . It takes a short while to figure out the cable unlocking process ( you need to turn it slightly clockwise and pull ) , but once you do , you will bless Sennheiser for this quick innovative addition . Overall , the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 on-ears ooze class , and creates a lasting impression of the pair of headphones that you would love to own . <p> Audio Performance All of that , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends up with a lot to live up to with its impeccable build , and once you start listening to it , you 'll realise how it does so . <p> The Momentum 2.0 does not deliver an incredible array of details , nor does it over-impose you with bass unlike you 've ever heard . What it does is deliver warm , compact and very well-balanced audio that most would love . You do notice a lack of highly intricate details in tracks , like the overlapping range of vocals in Bohemian Rhapsody , or the background siren metronome in Uprisingby Muse . However , what you also notice are the soaring , warm highs of Eric Johnson 's Stratocaster , the timbre of Roger Daltrey 's four-octave vocal range , and every note of Flea 's bass at Slane Castle . <p> Let 's break all of this down into more details . The Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 delivers woody , warm audio , thereby removing any notion of unwarranted shrillness from tracks . The audio remains sharp and precise , and the harmonic distortion rating of &lt;0.5% means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , even at the highest volume level . The Momentum 2.0 uses closed , dynamic transducers , which have always been known for the warmth delivered in audio ( the permanent ring magnet and the moving coil combining to drive clear , precise and warm audio ) . <p> Soundstaging here is good for a supra-aural headphone , but is not the best . The compactness of the audio has a mixed impact here " while it works towards delivering clear , tight audio , it limits the range of incident audio , giving you the sense of concentrated sources around each ear . However , the excellent audio balance here means that tracks sound clear and vibrant , somewhat balancing the impact that the slightly limited soundstaging has here . <p> Low frequencies are incredibly tight . The high amplitude of the lows keep them loud , but do not overpower tracks . Basslines are tight , and preserve well-knit audio tracks that have prominent yet sober amounts of bass . While bass-heavy tracks do sound slightly booming , almost every other genre of music sounds incredibly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mids here is the most pleasant aspect . The Momentum does not mute the mids in any way , and gives an incredible amount of freedom for mids to sound pronounced . The warmth is amplified , and the compactness of audio means that vocal ranges sound incredibly powerful and controlled . However , it is here that the Momentum does not relay maximum detail in tracks , and you would often miss the most intricate details . Of course , you would miss them only if you are straining for them , or listening to a track that you have heard only too many times . For instance , play Pink Floyd 's Learning to Fly , and the slight lack of details can be heard in the background voice of Nick Mason 's flight training . It does not call for the destruction of our romance with the Momentum 2.0 , and here 's why " in most cases , the range of audio coupled with excellent balance and ample loudness makes almost every track sound really good . If you happen to be working on audio recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go amiss . Outside the studio , however , the warmth and balance creates an aura of well-tuned audio delivery that you would love , and not criticise . <p> " The compactness and warmth of audio is what the Momentum 2.0 is all about " <p> The highs have a similar story as the mids . The slight muting of the highs help in not adding too much sharpness that can often be jarring for lovers of neutral balanced or bass-biased music . On the other hand , details are not very sacrificed , meaning that you get your tracks as they are . Keep listening to Virgil Donati playing for Planet X , or Caravan from Whiplash 's soundtrack , and the highs sound really well-balanced , ever-so-slightly cut out of depth to save shrillness. - The compactness and warmth of audio is what the Momentum 2.0 is all about . <p> The Momentum 2.0 packs in all the essentials , and leaves out some that we would have liked it to have . For instance , the slight lack in details is too audible when you listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who like their audio to be slightly more open and wide in terms of delivery , the compactness can be a bit too claustrophobic at times . Certainly , over prolonged usage spans , you will feel the need to take the Momentum off and let the ears breathe for a while , and that is not only because of its make . It is because of the fact that the Momentum really channels in the audio around you , creating an ambience comparable to prolonged studio sessions . That , surprisingly often , can be quite tiresome . <p> There is no notable distortion across any given point , and the Momentum 2.0 is amply loud . You can click here for detailed specifications of the headphones , in case you would wish to check . The Momentum 2.0 is the most comfortable to listen to at about 75% volume , the sweet spot at which it sounds the best . The in-line mic and controls are well-made , and mic reception is quite strong . I did not need to place the mic near my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations . The in-line buttons are sturdy , and offer good feedback . Sennheiser has managed to make the buttons quite comfortable to operate , something that I have often complained about in headphones . <p> Bottomline The Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 on-ears ( M2 OEi ) are an incredible delight . Very well crafted and delivering beautifully balanced , warm audio , the Momentum 2.0 make for an excellent purchase for anyone who loves and knows their audio . Chances are that you qualify for both if you 're considering this , and at Rs. 15,990 , it is one of the better ones that you would come across . There are the Beats 900 lineup at about this price point , but they do not come close to the premium livery here . The Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 might be pricey , but they sure do n't disappoint . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737665 @2737665/ <h> Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 review : The best Android experience $150 can buy <p> Xiaomi has been cranking out quality handsets over the past couple of years at attractive price points . I really liked last year 's Redmi 2 and was anxious to put the Redmi Note 3 through its paces to see what you could get for $150 ( Rs. 10,000 ) in India . <p> As it turns out , a lot . There are two variants available " one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage , and one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of space . I tested the former over the past few weeks ; here 's how it fared . <p> The 5.5-inch Note 3 has a sleek aluminium body with little to distract from its gently curving lines . Save for the polished trim and the color-matched sections at the top and bottom , the design is clean and fluid . It 's complemented by Xiaomi 's trademark minimalist hardware buttons as well as the slim volume rocker and power button on the right . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves <p> The phone feels significantly lighter than its 164g weight . Because it 's nicely balanced and the sides are softly curved , the Note 3 is easy to hold for extended periods of time , whether you 're gaming or watching a show . <p> What I particularly enjoyed about this device is the beautiful matte finish on the sandblasted aluminium back and sides . It looks great from every angle and most people would guess this was a much more expensive product than it is . <p> The Note 3 has a fingerprint sensor and a 16-megapixel camera on the back <p> The Note 3 comes in three finishes , gold with a matching front fascia , silver with a white front panel and grey with a black front . While I 'm drawn to the handsome grey version , the gold one stands out from most other devices . <h> Display and sound <p> The Note 3 features a 5.5-inch full HD display , making for a sharp-enough pixel density of 401ppi . I like that it gets plenty bright to use in the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reading in bed or to save power . <p> You can adjust the color temperature and contrast in the Settings menu . There 's also a handy reading mode that cuts out blue light to reduce eye strain ; it can be engaged either across the OS or for specific apps . <p> A single speaker on the back of the device , near the bottom , sadly does n't get loud enough to enjoy music on the go , and the problem is compounded by a poor soundstage . However , it 's fine when you 're in a quiet space and need to catch up on podcasts or YouTube videos . <p> That being said , the Note 3 offers plenty of options for enjoying audio with headphones on . There 's an equalizer with a number of presets that you can fiddle with , as well as Mi Sound Enhancer settings to suit the type of headphones you use . <p> I generally do n't mess with equalizers much , but switching between the settings for various types of earphones drastically affects the sound . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this option helps correct it easily for more natural output . <h> Features <p> This phone packs a ton of handy features , including a fingerprint reader , Child mode to lock down apps , and an IR blaster to control your TV and other appliances . <p> I found the fingerprint reader to be fairly quick . Xiaomi says it take 0.3 seconds to unlock your device ; I could n't tell much of a difference between this one and the sensor on my iPhone 5S . It worked better than the LeEco Le 1S , which failed occasionally and was a bit slower to respond . <p> The Note 3 's sandblasted aluminium finish is gorgeous <p> The Note 3 includes dual 4G SIM slots , one of which can accommodate a microSD card for upto 32GB of additional storage . <p> There 's also a massive 4,050mAh battery that will quickly spoil you " I easily got a day and a half with normal usage from a full charge . The Note 3 supports quick charging so you can juice up about 50 percent in just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fuss ; however , using GPS on 4G and gaming will certainly take a big bite out of its power reserve . <p> On the features front , I was disappointed with the Note 3 's overall score for its lack of a NFC and the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the back . Neither of these are deal-breakers , however , so take this with a grain of salt if you 're not particularly concerned about them . <h> Software <p> The Note 3 I tested shipped with Android 5.1 with Xiaomi 's excellent MIUI 7 software layer on top . There 's a lot to like about the custom OS : it 's fast , supports a theme store with a diverse selection of options to trick out your phone , and is well designed , from the Settings menu to the diminutive notification bar . <p> MIUI 7 also has a bunch of well designed apps for things like email , notes , data usage tracking , remote controls for appliances and texting . <p> MIUI 7 is packed with useful features and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its theme store " it 's easy to switch up the look and feel of the device with just a couple of taps , and there 's an ever-expanding range to choose from . <p> The launcher does away with the app drawer ( which I wish it did n't ) , but it allows you to move and uninstall multiple apps at once . However , it lacks options to automatically organize apps alphabetically or by install date , which means you 're on your own if you want to clean up your home screen . <p> MIUI 7 has a huge theme store to change up your interface <p> Overall , MIUI 7 offers a pleasant experience and performs very well across the board . However , power users will likely want more control over the interface and switch to a custom launcher like Nova . <h> Camera and Video <p> The Note 3 has perhaps the best camera I 've used on a sub-$200 phone . The 16-megapixel rear snapper focuses quickly and does a good job reproducing colors and contrast naturally . However , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's fairly easy to get a bit of depth of field in your pictures thanks to the large f/2.0 aperture and the phase detection autofocus . <p> The HDR mode is particularly impressive " it adds nuance to your shots without going overboard and works nearly as fast as the standard shooting mode . <p> The phone is capable of shooting 1080p video , but the quality does n't compare to that of its still images . I did appreciate the camera 's quick metering to adjust to varying intensities of light and found the audio to be clear and balanced " but I did n't once feel tempted to use the feature . <p> The 5-megapixel camera in front is a lot better than others I 've tried , like those on the <p> LeEco Le 1S , Xiaomi Mi 4i and the OnePlus 2 . Pictures are sharp and detailed even under artificial light , and are an absolute treat outdoors . There 's also face recognition and a Beautify feature to smooth out blemishes automatically , which works fine when set to Low ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features in a minimalist interface <p> The camera app offers a ton of features , including live filters , manual controls , a gradient display to help straighten your shots , and even a faux Fisheye shooting mode . The interface is well designed , allowing you to access controls by swiping and getting out of the way when you just want to focus on composing your shot . <h> Performance <p> Under the Note 3 's hood is a Snapdragon 650 1.8GHz hexa-core processor paired with an Adreno 510 GPU and either 2GB or 3GB RAM depending on the variant you choose . <p> It also ran graphics-intensive games like Hitman : Sniper , Relic Run and Total War Battles : Kingdom fairly well . Besides the occasional stutter in frames on endless runners , the Note 3 gave me no reason to complain while gaming on long commutes . <h> Verdict <p> With the Redmi Note 3 , Xiaomi has once again proved it knows how to make a budget phone better than anyone else . It offers exemplary build quality , solid performance , a great feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , for a very reasonable $150 . <p> You 'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal at this price range . Typically , sub-$200 phones are either poorly designed or scrimp on useful features like fast charging , and almost always come with a crappy camera . <p> Not so with the Note 3 " it checks all those boxes and then some . I liked it more than its closest rival , the LeEco 1S , because it offers a significantly better camera and OS while costing $15 less . It also beats out the 3rd generation Moto G in terms of build quality and performance . <p> If you 're looking for a great phone on the cheap , you ca n't do much better than the Redmi Note 3 . The only bummer is that it 's only available through Xiaomi 's annoying flash sales " but even then , I 'd say it 's worth the hassle . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 
@@42737667 @2737667/ <h> Huawei P9 review : New Phone Familiar Tricks <p> Huawei still is n't a household name in every corner of the world , despite having ousted Microsoft last summer to become the worlds third-largest smartphone manufacturer . The company might not have the pedigree of LG , Sony and others , but there are few greater endorsements than being recruited by Google to deliver a Nexus device . That was more than six months ago , but its with that kind of exposure in mind that we welcome Huaweis latest flagship , the P9 , and see what it has to offer . <h> Pros <p> Fun , versatile camera <p> Excellent performance <h> Cons <p> Unexciting design <p> Lacking in standout features <p> Questionable value for the money <h> Summary <p> If there 's one feature that will convince you to buy Huaweis P9 , its the clever camera . Two separate sensors let you take gorgeous , native monochrome images and play around with depth of field , not to mention other fun and useful shooting modes . Performance is also one of the P9s strong suits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship finesse . Considering its price , the P9 ultimately fails to strike an appropriate balance between feature set and cost . <h> Hardware <p> You can usually tell at a glance when a smartphone is of flagship lineage . By that I mean : iPhones look like iPhones , the Galaxy S series has n't  changed all that much in recent years , and so on . Huawei , too , has settled on a common design language for its top-end P line . Put the P9 , P8 andAscend P7 side by side and you 'll notice more iterative changes than considerable transformations . <p> As the years have passed , Huawei has veered further toward an angular , clean-cut design for its P series . There 's no doubt the P9 is the best-looking of the bunch so far , and yet I cant help but feel that its rather indistinctive . <p> That said , the P9 has all the characteristics youd expect of a -450 ( or roughly $650 ) smartphone . Its thin , light and wrapped in aluminum , and the build quality is impeccable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling more like plastic than " aerospace-class " metal , though this does help with grip . Then there are the soft corners , the thin chamfered edges and the slight curvature of the glass borders : all the little details that mellow an otherwise sharp form . <p> The only edge that perhaps has n't  been buffed enough is the elevated rim around the fingerprint sensor . It can feel a bit scratchy under your fingertip , and , speaking of the sensor , its the first time Huawei has included one on a P series device . It registers contact as quickly as any fingerprint sensor I 've used , and sits in a convenient position high on the back of the device ( where your forefinger naturally rests ) . <p> Everything else is pretty much where it should be , and I 'm thankful for the tiny , multicolor notification LED hiding behind the earpiece . The volume rocker and power key ( which has a nice bumpy texture to it ) lie on the right-hand edge , with the micro-SIM/microSD tray on the left and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom . <p> Personally , I wish Huawei had n't  bothered with Type-C . It does n't  charge the device any quicker than regular micro-USB would the company never promised any kind of fast charging , to be fair and it means the absurd number of live cables I have scattered around my house for tablets , Kindles , phones , Bluetooth speakers and console controllers are useless . Instead , I have just one lonely wire I basically need to carry around with me . <p> I have my hands on the titanium gray model , which pairs almost purplish aluminum with a black underlay wherever there 's glass . Plenty of other color configurations are out there if you can find them : two with similar gold finishes , ceramic white , mystic silver and , of course , rose gold . Their availability varies based on the market and model , however , including whether the P9 in question is a single- or dual-SIM variant , and whether its kitted out with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage , or 4GB/64GB . In the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray and mystic silver options ( 3GB/32GB ) for sale . <p> In all , the P9 is by no means an ugly device , but its not particularly exciting either . And that sentiment does n't  just apply to its looks . <p> exciting either . And that sentiment does n't  just apply to its looks . <p> HUAWEI P9 <p> Dimensions <p> 145 x 70.9 x 6.95mm ( 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.27 inches ) <p> Weight <p> 144g ( 5.1 ounces ) <p> Display <p> 5.2-inch IPS LCD ( 1,920 x 1,080 ) <p> Pixel Density <p> 424 ppi <p> Glass <p> Gorilla Glass 4 <p> Processor <p> Octa-core Kirin 955 ( 4 x 2.5GHz , 4 x 1.8GHz ) <p> RAM <p> 3GB <p> Storage <p> 32GB ( expandable ) <p> Primary camera <p> 2 x 12-megapixel BSI ( one monochrome , one color ) <p> Secondary camera <p> 8-megapixel <p> Battery <p> 3,000mAh <p> OS <p> Emotion UI 4.1 ( Android 6.0 Marshmallow ) <p> Cellular <p> Cat 6 LTE <p> WiFi <p> Dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n/ac <p> Bluetooth <p> 4.2 <p> NFC <p> Yes <h> Display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P9s display that 's going to make your mouth water . Huawei has opted for a 5.2-inch , full HD ( 1,920 x 1,080 ) IPS LCD panel the same one you 'll find on the year-old P8 . While I think 1080p is a perfectly acceptable resolution for a 5.2-inch device , I cant ignore the trend toward denser displays , particularly on Android flagships . Quad HD screens are almost the norm now , and top-tier devices from LG and Samsung havent dipped below this spec for some time . Even the Nexus 6P has one of these 2,560 x 1,440 panels , leaving the P9 feeling a bit behind the times . <p> Nevertheless , you do get a great 1080p panel . Colors are vivid , blacks are as deep as I 've ever seen on an LCD display , and whites are the perfect temperature ( you can tinker with this in the settings if your eyes do n't  agree ) . There 's also plenty of power behind those pixels , making the display easy to read on the brightest of days . Glare is n't entirely eliminated under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the park to stream a movie on your phone , but the screen is bright enough for every other outdoor-use scenario . The auto-brightness setting is usually pretty accurate , but it can falter in strong sunlight , meaning I 've found myself turning it off in certain situations to get the most out of the display . <p> Considering how small the P9s speaker grille is , Im surprised by the volume and quality of the audio that comes out of it . Not exactly built for lighting up a party , given its lacking in the bass range , but perfect for some crisp and clear hands-free calls . At a push , you can get away with watching an episode of Family Guy or a succession of YouTube clips if you 've forgotten to bring your headphones to bed with you , but its not really cut out for enjoying a feature film . I have discovered that , for whatever reason , the P9 does n't  support AC3 audio , which is a common enough format for videos . Pick the right files , though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality is something of a mixed bag : The P9 is n't the best phone I 've rocked out with , but its not the worst either . You get a decent amount of clarity and bass coming through , especially when the DTS audio setting is switched on , but things can start to get raspy and abrasive at the high end . Volume is something of an issue too . I can still hear myself think at maximum power , and if you tend to use leaky in-ears like I do , then the P9 wont do a great job of cutting through the ambience of a noisy train . <h> Software <p> The P9 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box , not that youd really know without checking the phones settings menu . That 's because of Huaweis Emotion UI ( EMUI ) overlay , now at version 4.1 . While its a major re-skinning of stock Android , its at least free of unnecessary animations that slow the device down to any degree . Compared with vanilla Android , EMUI is a bit cartoony , with flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquated . <p> EMUI does serve as a platform for third-party skins , though , giving you a high level of customization . Jump into the Themes app and you 'll find plenty of different veneers to download to your device some more comprehensive than others from clean to wacky and everything in between . <p> Actually poking around EMUI is n't all that different from stock Android , but there are a couple of obvious differences . Everything happens on the home-screen carousel , for example ; there 's no separate app drawer . Also , the notification pull-down splits quick settings into its own little tab , and you can access music player controls , the calculator , the flashlight and a few more bits and pieces from the lock screen ( like the Control Center on iOS ) . <p> There are a bunch of quirks to like about Huaweis version of Android . I particularly dig that you can swipe downward on the fingerprint sensor to bring up the notification drawer , that you can double-tap the volume-down key to instantly take a picture when the handset is locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are some things that might annoy . <p> Maybe a minor point for some , but I cant find a way to hide contacts that do n't  have a phone number in my Google-imported list , which is insanely frustrating . A couple of apps that duplicate the functionality of Googles also neednt exist , like an email client and calendar . <p> Pre-installed bloatware is relatively minimal : some random games , a PDF reader , the Booking.com app and a couple more . Thankfully , all of these can be purged at your whim , and I can salute the P9 for introducing me to Todoist , which I 'm really getting on with . A few of Huaweis apps are neat enough . " HiCare " is a handy kind of on-device manual and serves as a conduit for customer service and support ; " Phone Manager " let 's you optimize performance and save a few minutes of battery life by identifying and closing down power-hungry background apps ; and " Health " is a basic pedometer app that tells you how far you 've walked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your travels . <p> Would I prefer stock Android ? Yes , I would . Am I unduly offended by EMUI ? Not by a long shot , and as I 've said , there are several enjoyable little features that Google does n't  offer as standard . <h> Camera <p> On to the main event : the P9s dual rear cameras . Before that , though , a quick note on the 8-megapixel front-facer . The number alone should tell you that it takes some really sharp , and fairly wide-angle , shots . Selfies and video calls certainly are n't  an afterthought on the P9 , and Huaweis beauty slider will smooth away those blemishes ( or make you look like a stubbly child ) if you 're having a bad-skin day . Taking a page out of Apples book and when does Huawei notlook at what others are throwing at the wall the P9s display will serve as a makeshift flash if you need dat club gram . <h> Huawei P9 camera <p> The P9 is the first device Huaweis created with input from high-end optics outfit Leica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the lenses for the P9 and helped redesign the camera software . Sticking two cameras on the thing was definitely Huaweis idea , though , and one the company first explored with the Honor 6 Plus . <p> But the arrangement is altogether different on the P9 , as it uses two 12-megapixel sensors : one color and one monochrome . There are a couple of reasons for this . First , the monochrome camera allows you to take native black-and-white images , and damn , do they look good . I really , really like this feature , but a fellow tech journalist did put it into perspective for me somewhat . We were discussing its merits , and I was gushing about how much better these black-and-white pictures looked in comparison with filtered color images . He agreed kind of : " But is it a feature anybody asked for ? " <p> Perhaps not , but then I 'm the kind of tool who has an ancient Pentax permanently loaded with 35mm Ilford film , so I 'm exactly the type of person it would appeal to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a smartphone replacement , monochrome sensor or not . <p> The real reason for having a monochrome sensor does n't  have much to do with native black-and-white snaps . Primarily , its there to play assistant to the color sensor . Huaweis image-processing alchemy uses the lighting and contrast of the monochrome picture as a sort of data to enhance the quality of the final color image . And having two cameras instead of one means the P9 can simulate a whole range of aperture settings , just like HTCs Duo Camera feature that debuted on the One M8 . <p> While the color sensor actually takes the picture , the monochrome sensor is capturing depth information . This means that you can simulate the aperture of a bona fide camera lens , from f/16 all the way to f/0.95 ( a nod to one of Leicas most premium lenses ) . The aperture shooting mode therefore let 's you take close-ups with the kind of bokeh ( background blur ) you get from propercameras . And after the fact , you can edit the same snap to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Because this is all done with software , though , there 's an obvious cutoff point at which images go from having a nice , believable amount of bokeh to looking a bit ridiculous ( think : that Neo-versus-Smith army fight scene in The Matrix Reloaded where real Keanu so obviously becomes CGI Keanu ) . The f/0.95 setting looks more like someones gotten way too smudge-tool-happy in Photoshop , for instance , rather than the image looking like its been shot with a real f/0.95 lens . <p> Cramming two cameras into a smartphone is nothing new , and it might not be the killer feature Huawei wants it to be . After all , why would HTC ditch its Duo Camera unless it discovered users werent all that fussed about it ? Still , even if Aperture mode is tantamount to a gimmick and one that 's been pinched from another manufacturer the P9s camera is still pretty great , and versatile at that . <p> You can leave everything on auto and quite easily get some really crisp and detailed 12-megapixel shots out the P9 . Exposure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the time ; rarely have I taken a shot with the handset and not felt it to be a faithful representation of what I can see behind the viewfinder . It adjusts to artificial light well , and focusing is rapid to the point of being practically instant , which Huawei puts down to its hybrid laser- , depth- and contrast-informed method . <p> Like autofocus , shutter response is just as instantaneous , almost regardless of lighting conditions ; burst capture is so rapid you might as well be shooting a 30fps video . On that note , the P9 is pretty handy in low-light situations . It seems to capture most of the natural light available to it without too much artificial enhancement by way of jacking up the exposure . It ca n't work miracles , but moonlight alone is sometimes enough for at least a distinguishable image . And when its not , you can rely on the powerful two-tone flash for a synthetic burst of illumination . <p> If you want to delve beyond the simple point-and-shoot interface , there are a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to head straight for the " Pro " mode , which let 's you tweak every setting manually , even the focus , and outputs RAW images . There are three different " Film " modes of Leicas design that subtly change the texture of colors standard , smooth and vivid the latter being a kind of lighter HDR mode , which is also available to add that familiar high-contrast pop to images . The panorama mode is also worth mentioning because it does a fabulous job of stitching images together . <p> The exploration continues with various video toys , including time-lapse and slow-motion modes . Video quality does leave something to be desired , it has to be said . Full HD clips are a little too noisy for my liking , even in favorable lighting conditions . Colors are flat , and audio has a muffled , distant tone to it . But you cant have it all , I guess , and who needs good video when you 've got so many photo modes to dip in and out of ? To conclude : At some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " testing " the camera and just started having fun with it , which is probably the best endorsement I can make . <h> Performance and battery life <p> You wo n't find any Snapdragons round these parts . Huawei P9 makes its own processors , and the P9 is kitted out with the best of em : the octa-core Kirin 955 . Thats four 2.5GHz cores and four 1.8GHz cores , if you were wondering . Pair that with 3GB of RAM and you have one potent combination . And that 's all I really need to say . From simpler 3D games like- Sonic Dash and NBA Jam to more resource-intensive titles like Asphalt 8 , Real Racing 3 and Ravensword 2 , the P9 handles them all effortlessly . No dawdling on the loading screens , no dropped frames , no problem . <p> Browsing performance is governed by the speed of your connection above all else , and in general day-to-day use , I have n't seen any strange behavior that would constitute a chink in the processors armor . One variant of the Huawei P9 , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage . The 3GB of RAM and 32GB of space on the unit I 'm using does n't  leave me wanting in either department , however , especially since microSD cards are supported for upping memory up to 128GB . <p> Elsewhere in the performance stakes , there are a few missteps . GPS is inaccurate , for one . Google Maps jumps from my current position to where I was five minutes ago regularly , and there 's often a large margin of error even when it is roughly on point , leading to the occasional wrong turn . Also , WiFi takes a while to connect to saved networks for some reason , which is annoying on the London Tube when you have only 30 seconds at stations to get online and do whatever you need to . In terms of connections , you do have everything you could want available to you : Cat 6 LTE , dual-band WiFi ( a/b/g/n/ac ) , Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC . <p> Compared with other smartphones thatve run our review gauntlet in recent times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , in our standard looping video rundown test ( 720p clip at 50 percent brightness ) , I managed to squeeze nine hours and 20 minutes out of the 3,000mAh cache . That 's more than an hour less than the HTC 10 and LG G5 , and way behind the 13-plus hours that the iPhone SE and Galaxy S7 lineare capable of . <p> Outside of lab conditions , the Huawei P9 is good for about a full working day of frequent use , but not much more . On one particularly busy Wednesday , I tethered my laptop to the handset for over an hour , and took a bunch of pictures and made several calls , in addition to reading and responding to a constant stream of emails , WhatsApps , etc . Unplugging at roughly 7 AM , the phone was dead by about 10 PM . With less frequent use , you 're looking at more like a day and a half away from a charger . <h> The Competition <p> Its probably best to kick this section off with a few editors notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US , and Huaweis said it does n't  have any plans to launch it there . Second : I 'm not an expert on the Asian market , where Huawei P9 is competing with the likes of Xiaomi and Nubia , potentially making the P9 a completely different proposition in that region . All I can reliably comment on is how it fits into the UK landscape , and even then , I 'm struggling to see its niche . <p> Regardless of my opinion , Huawei seems to have wooed UK carriers , with every major network announcing its intention to range the handset the day it was announced . This is the biggest splash a new Huawei handset has ever made by an absolute mile , though its yet to reach any of these providers . Contract reseller Carphone Warehouse is offering the phone for free from -26 per month . That 's more than the Nexus 5X , the same price as the iPhone SE and only slightly cheaper than the LG G5 . <p> An unlocked , SIM-free model will set you back -449 at Huaweis official online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money . Its more than the most expensive iPhone SE , -50 cheaper than the LG G5 , and roughly -100 shy of the iPhone 6S , HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 , not to mention that its identical in price to the Huawei-made Nexus 6P . I could probably dedicate a thousand more words to listing all the potential alternatives and relative pricing , but what I 'm basically trying to say is : I do n't  think the P9 hits that sweet spot between feature set and price . <p> The Huawei P9 is meant to be a flagship device , remember , but for a near-flagship price you 're not getting any of the comforts I might expect , like waterproofing , wireless charging , a Quad HD display , a striking design , high-res audio , a long battery life and so on . Apart from the dual camera which HTC did years ago there 's little to elevate the P9 user experience above great little devices like the Moto G or Wileyfox Swift , which you can pick up for a fraction of the price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's no one feature to serve as its life jacket . <h> Wrap-up <p> The Huawei P9 is a perfectly good smartphone , particularly when it comes to performance and camera tricks . I had a ton of fun playing around with all the shooting modes , ogling the gorgeous native black-and-white images , and fiddling with bokeh . But the dual camera is something HTC pioneered yonks ago , and has since sent it to feature heaven . And what else are we really getting ? <p> A nice 1080p display ( albeit no improvement over last years P8 ) , a rather uneventful metal unibody design , a somewhat charming but unfamiliar Android build and a days worth of battery life . Huawei is n't the only company taking baby steps , mind . Aside from LGs ambitious G5 , the biggest smartphone launches of 2016 thus far have largely been iterative . <p> If I had to take issue with one thing specifically , it would be the P9s price , which is almost impossible to justify . The handsets camera is its only standout but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty quid for that ? No deal . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 
@@42737669 @2737669/ <h> LG G5 Review : When innovation meets lazy design <p> The LG G5 is the most exciting smartphone in a long time . Instead of just the expected metal redesign and bumped up specs , LG chose to actually do something daring : try to reinvent the smartphone . <p> It was the first phone from a major manufacturer to feature two different rear facing cameras , the first mostly-metal phone to allow users to replace their batteries , and the first smartphone with the potential for multiple extension modules . <p> But potential and execution are two different things . While the G5 remains the most inventive smartphone of the last few years , spending more time with the device has , in part , been a sobering reminder that innovation does n't always mean better . <p> And so LG has built the most divisive phone of the year so far . <p> Design <p> LG has made a metal phone , just like everyone else . Yay ! Too bad it 's so boring . <p> It 's a metal rounded rectangle . Its- most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clickable fingerprint sensor . Both of them protrude in an oddly wart-like manner . <p> The G5 does n't look quite like an anything else out there , but still feels pretty generic . <p> Meanwhile , the detachable bottom leaves a tiny gap in the casing that looks like someone took a machete to the- phone 's chin and then tried to put it back together . There must 've been a better way to cover that seam . <p> The front end fares better. - The way the top of the device slopes slightly away from you is a neat touch . - I preferred the concave curvature of the G4 , because it made the top of the screen a little easier to tap , but hey who needs practicality right ? <p> The top of the device slopes away from you . A nice touch , though not practical . <p> The detachable portion looks better from the front too " there 's a little lip that makes the transition from glass to metal seem the same as any other smartphone , and you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-hand feel is okay " the G4 's curvature and grippy pleather made it more comfortable to hold . But the worse part is that the G5 does n't really- feel like it 's fully metal . <p> Though it 's not because the phone is actually mostly plastic , like some have suggested , it feels slightly hollow in a way an iPhone 6s or HTC 10 never does . <p> I managed to scratch off- some paint- while it was just sitting in my bag with my keys . My fault , but also not a good sign . <p> Of course , LG has n't always been known for building the most beautiful devices , or even for having a consistent design ethos . But- at least they felt like they were trying to be unique . <p> The G5 's lack of polish betrays the fact that this is the company 's first metal phone ; I actually would 've preferred something more in line with the eccentric design of the V10 or the G Flex 2 's extreme-but-useful curvature . I 'd even argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G4 . <p> But those modules ! <p> Now of course some of those design choices are because of the detachable modules , or Friends ' as LG calls them ( *sighs* ) . <p> The most notable of these is the replaceable battery , which for the first time solves the problem of irreplaceable batteries on all-metal phones . <p> That 's why it's- unfortunate that LG does n't include a replaceable battery with the G5 by default ; it 's a stand out feature that average consumers wo n't be bothered to use because they wo n't buy an extra battery . At least some carriers have had the initiative to include one , along with a dedicated charging cradle . <p> The gap between the detachable module and the rest of the phone is a bit distracting . <p> Aside from the standard battery module , there are two other Friends currently available : a Hi-Fi Bang &amp; Olufsen audio module complete with its own DAC , and a camera grip with extra buttons an additional 1,200 mAh- battery . LG did n't make either available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party manufacturers to create more modules , but who knows whether any of those will actually come to fruition . I hope LG at least makes- the Friends compatible with future G-series phones , - but given the company 's track record , that seems unlikely . <p> Still , at least having the option for customizability is pretty awesome , not to mention replacing your battery after its capacity drops in a year or two . That 's something no other metal smartphone can claim . <p> Display woes <p> First , the good stuff . At 5.3 inches and QHD resolution , the display has a 577 ppi- pixel density , and viewing angles are great , with no rainbowing from the- IPS LCD panel . <p> It gets really bright too , which makes it- fairly easy- to read in sunlight " noticeably more than its predecessor . Contrast is also good for an LCD panel , though it 's obviously nowhere as good as an OLED screen . <p> Unfortunately LG " a company that specializes in making displays " managed to make the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason : the color temperature is way too cold , with a distractingly blue-green hue . <p> Samsung Galaxy S7 , Lg G5 , Nexus 6P . The G5 's display is drastically cold compared to almost any high end display nowadays . <p> LG has tended towards cooler displays than other manufacturers in the past , but I ca n't remember the last time I saw a panel so blatantly bluish compared to everything else out there . And unlike the HTC 10 , which has a better panel to start , there 's no tool to adjust the color saturation or color temperature . <p> It fares decently when your ambient color temperature is already fairly cool " the noon day sun , fluorescent lighting , or cloudy mornings " but even then is still noticeably bluer than most displays . <p> Basically , it feels like the G5 is never capable of making a true white color , even after a couple of weeks of using the phone . Maybe LG was just trying to be different , but it's- just jarring . The display alone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using it <p> Like Samsung , LG has redesigned its UI for- its latest generation of devices . Unlike Samsung , I 'm not sure it 's for the better . <p> While I actually quite like Samsung 's new light blue color scheme , LG is using this wireframe black-on-white look that kind of reminds me of a Mac from the 90s . <p> That would n't be so bad if it were n't for the aforementioned cool display . It makes the entire UI look worse . For example , the entire settings menu and notifications sheet take on this pale blue-gray look in use that just looks very meh . <p> The extensive white used in LG 's new UI looks like more like a cool teal on the G5 's screen . <p> The customizations are also all around less useful than Samsung 's . There 's no one-handed mode to be found , and LG has removed the ability to use apps in split screen or windows mode . <p> That might be because Google is baking those features into Android N , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the fastest at issueing OS updates . <p> But " and this is an important but ' " the software does n't seem to slow down the phone at all . While my- Samsung S7 feels no faster than my Nexus 6P , the G5- is slightly faster than either in side-by-side comparisons . <p> Whether switching apps , playing games , navigating maps , or scrolling through the Web , there seemed to be no way of significantly slowing the device down . And this is despite the fact that the G5 and S7 have identical processors , and that both of my review models came pre-loaded with AT&amp;T software . <p> Also , one software tweak I do like : LG let 's you pull down the notification sheet from the navigation bar , which makes the phone infinitely more useful on the go . Other manufacturers , take note . <p> Two cameras really are better than one <p> Here's- one thing LG did really well : the G5 has the best camera setup of any smartphone , and it all comes down to that second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenses of our smartphones ; the ultra wide-angle lens on the G5 's second shooter allows you to capture much more of a scene . <p> The standard 16 megapixel camera <p> The ultra wide-angle camera captures much more of the scene from the same spot . Just be careful ; the field of view makes it easy to get your finger in the frame . <p> That means no wasting time with a panorama and bad stitching , no stepping back to fit the entirety of that building in your photo , no hurting your friend 's feelings because you could n't fit them in the group photo . Just toggle the wide-angle camera from the main shooting UI , and you 're good to go . <p> It makes shooting with the G5 the most fun I 've had using a smartphone camera in years . There 's a reason professional photographers tend to carry multiple lenses around : they provide different perspective and can completely change the nature of a scene . <p> The G6 's main shooter does a good job with macros with smooth bokeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 megapixels , there 's a fair bit of fish-eye distortion , and the main camera is- slightly worse than- Samsung 's new sensor and lens combo , but none of that really matters . The G5 is more versatile and the quality is more than good enough with either camera . <p> The rest of it is typical Android smartphone fare : RAW photos , manual controls , laser autofocus and- 4K video . The UI is largely unchanged from the G4 and V10 , but it did n't need much changing . <p> Ultimately , it comes down to this : pick up a G5 , and you can take wide-angle photos that simply are n't possible on any other smartphone out there , at least not without inconvenient panorama stitching . <p> That alone makes the G5 a more versatile photography tool than anything else on the market . You can be assured other manufacturers will follow suit ( looking at you , - Apple ) . <p> Battery <p> Battery life was a resounding pretty decent ' . I get a bit over 3 hours screen-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last until the night without an issue . Quick Charge 3.0 also means the battery can recharge very quickly , although it 's worth noting for some reason LG only includes a Quick Charge 2.0- adapter in the box . <p> I do n't think anyone will be complaining much about battery life overall , and it seems better than what I got from my G4 anyway . <p> But on the other hand , you 're still settling for less : the S7 and HTC 10 offer bigger batteries with smaller screens , and that 's been reflected in their excellent longevity so far , which are able to get in the 4+ hours of screen-on time range . <p> The replaceable battery is a compromise in quantity over flexibility . <p> And yet neither of those phones will let me pop in a second , fully charged battery within 30 seconds of the prior one dying . I thought it was one of those nice-to-have features I 'd never actually use , it turns out I 've used it every single time my G5 has run out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about it , behind the camera . <p> Too bad the extra battery and charger is n't included by default , even if it would 've brought up the price point a bit . <p> Potential , disappointment , and resignation <p> I 've never had more trouble reviewing a device than with the G5 . <p> It was supposed to be the holy grail for Android power users : all-metal design , expandable storage , top-notch specs and a removable battery . It even kept the- IR blaster ( which I still use , thank you very much ) . <p> Unfortunately for everyone else , the execution is so disappointing . While Samsung , HTC , Apple and and others seem to have refined their smartphone designs to something nearing perfection , the G5 feels distinctly like a work in progress . It 's like LG was trying so hard to get ahead of the game that it forgot to get some of the basics right . <p> But lest this review end on too negative a note , let me clarify that I think the G5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great somewhere in its design process. - It just happens to have come out in a year with the toughest smartphone competition ever , and good is n't good enough . <p> Here 's to hoping LG keeps all of the G5 's best ideas and gets the rest right with the G6 . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737671 @2737671/ <h> Review : Dell Latitude 13 7000 ( 2016 ) <p> Is the XPS 13 still king of the ultraportables ? I would say so , as few machines have given Dells compact laptop much to think about since it set the standard for design last year . <p> Featuring a near-bezel-less 13.3-inch InfinityEdge display , the XPS 13 has the dimensions of an 11-inch laptop . A win for both productivity and portability , the innovative display tech has since been ported over to Dells revamped XPS 12 and XPS 15 devices . Even the companys OLED monitors are getting in on the game . <p> As its competitors play catch-up ( see HPs Spectre 13 and the equally alluring MacBook ) , Dell is now looking to replicate the XPS 13s success in the business space with the Latitude 13 7370 . <p> Dell 's most secure 2-in-1 is a lightweight UltrabookG and a detachable 33cm ( 13 ) tablet in one powerful device , featuring Intel- CoreG M processors . <h> VERDICT <p> With a compact design , excellent keyboard and impressive battery life , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . Its design might not rev your engine , but its one of the most practical business laptops around . <h> PROS : <p> Tactile keyboard <p> Thin and light <p> Solid battery life <h> CONS : <p> No Core i option <p> Pricey <p> The first enterprise-focused laptop to sport an InfinityEdge display , it arrives with a number of work-friendly features in tow . Its tempting to think of the Latitude as a productivity-focused XPS 13 , but such a comparison is a little too simplistic . <p> The Latitudes keyboard is superior , but it features a weaker Core M processor on the inside . Its also around -410 ( $580/AUS$756 ) more expensive . While you could pick one up and use it for non-business purposes , its worth taking extra time to consider whether the similar yet cheaper XPS 13 is better suited to your needs . <h> Design <p> The XPS 13 is hardly flamboyant in design , and the Latitude 13 7370 is even more demure . Featuring a sensible blend of materials and colors to appeal to its business audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , grey and black . If James Bond quit his job as a super-sleuth to become a salesman , this is the lightweight machine he would take on the road . <p> I could n't find a trace of flex no matter how hard I pressed down on the Latitudes soft-to-touch carbon fibre body . Most premium laptops makers claim that their systems are built from military grade stuff , but when Dell says that the 13 7370 has passed the MIL-SPEC 810 test I 'm not tempted to question it . <p> The Latitude 13 7370s aluminium CNC-machined lid is held by a hinge that stretches the full length of the laptops body and barely wobbles once positioned . Its a darker shade of silver than the one on the XPS 13 lending it a moodier appearance . The lid rotates 180 degrees to fold completely flat , which comes in handy if you 're using an external monitor and are n't  using the laptops screen as a second display . <p> On the underside Dell has swapped the XPS 13s silver finish for a matte black one , removing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relatively minor : the lettering on Latitudes keys has been shifted to the top-left position to allow room for a makeshift numberpad that 's positioned in an inverted triangle on the right-hand side of the keyboard . Its an innovative layout and one that I 'd like to see replicated on other laptops . <p> Below the trackpad are clicky left and right buttons which are tactile and responsive . Their existence makes the base slightly longer than the XPS 13s , which I found only makes typing more comfortable . Dell has squeezed in Page up and Page Down keys above the arrows keys on the right-hand side of the keyboard , leaving a packed layout that utilizes every inch of space . <p> Like the XPS 13 , the Latitude 13 7370 is no space hogger . Though a little thicker and wider , it remains far more portable than most other laptops with 13.3-inch displays . <p> Tipping the scales at a light 2.77 pounds ( 1.2kg ) , the Latitude is barely lighter than the the XPS 13 ( 2.8 pounds/1.27kg ) and beats the Yoga 260s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three laptops is scant and you would barely notice the difference when slung into a backpack . <h> Spec sheet <p> Here are the specifications of the Latitude 13 7370 sample provided to techradar for revew : <p> The first sign that the Latitude 13 7370 is a business device is the price . In the US , the base Latitude 13 7370 comes outfitted with a lowly 1,366 x 768 pixel-resolution display for $1,299 ( around -880 or AUS$1,785 ) . In the UK , the entry-level configuration features a 1080p display for -1,367 ( around $1,689 or AUS$2,553 ) . In the Lenovo camp , the Yoga 260 starts at -1,009 ( around $1,294 or AUS$1,679 ) for the version with the 1080p display . <p> As mentioned , the Latitude is powered by Intels Core m3 , m5 and m7 processors rather than the Core i chips that feature in both the XPS 13 and the Yoga 260 . I find the decision a little puzzling , not least because it shows that Dell reckons business users do n't  need the added performance . I 'd hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a vast range of legacy systems as reasons to argue the opposite is true . Core M in a wafer-thin MacBook or Asus UX305 is expected , but not here . <p> Like the XPS 13 , the Latitude 13 7370 can be equipped with a QHD+ display . However , this is only available on the top-end configuration that starts at -1,641 ( around $2,363 or AUS$3,064 ) and comes with an Intel Core m7 CPU , 256GB SSD and 8GB of main memory . <p> The various connectivity options are where the Latitude 13 7370 begins to justify its price tag . Along the right-hand edge is a micro SIM card slot , micro HDMI port and optional SmartCard Reader . On the machines left-hand side is a power connector and traditional USB 3.0 ( Type A ) port . <p> There 's also two Thunderbolt 2 USB-C ports that carry data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps and can be used to charge the machine . They also allow you to connect the laptop to a block-shaped dock used to hook up two external 4K monitors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be able to customize your 12.5-inch notebook with either a three or four cell battery . <p> Speed is n't an issue most of the time when using the Latitude 13 7370 . Despite not being a top-of-the-line processor , the Core m5 chip and 8GB of RAM under the hood kept things running smoothly . With my usual suite of office apps open in the backround including GIMP , FTP , Skype , Evernote , Wunderlist and Spotify , only Firefox began to freeze when I started loading tabs into a third browser window . <p> Refreshingly , intels display driver did n't  crash once during my three weeks with the machine . Unlike the Dell XPS 15 and XPS 12 I tested , which gave me a frozen black desktop at least a few times a day , the Latitude played nicely with the firmware and drivers that came pre-installed on the machine . <h> Benchmarks <p> here 's how the Latitude 13 7370 performed in our suite of benchmark tests : <p> The Latitude may be competent when it comes to running basic computing tasks , but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over -1,600 when configured with a QHD+ display . Bear in mind that the Asus UX305 , which is thinner than the Latitude and features a Core m3 processor , 8GB of memory and a QHD+ display , can currently be bought online for just -549.99 ( around $794 or AUS$1,032 ) . <p> When it comes to processor intensive tasks , such as transcoding video and resizing high-resolution images , the Latitude is n't going to be as suitable . Compared to the XPS 13 , it scored 61% lower in Cinebenchs CPU test and 20% lower in PCMark8s Home Test , which runs a number of benchmarks to simulate every usage . <p> There are two choices of resolution when it comes to the display : 1080p ( or Full HD ) and QHD+ . Full HD remains the best choice to balance batter life and pixel density on a 13-inch laptop , and Dell has ensured that what the Latitudes 13 7370 lacks in sharpness it makes up for in color saturation and brightness . Being a matte display , it offers wide viewing angles and its anti-glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laptop under bright conditions . Of course , if its defined lines , crisp fonts and sharp icons that you 're looking for , you 'll want to check out the QHD+ version ; because even a decent 1080p display ca n't keep them jaggies at bay . <p> On the plus side , the combination of a 1080p display and Intels Core M processor helps battery life . With the bare minimum of programs running and the brightness lowered to 50% , the Latitude reported that 10 hours of life remained in the tank . Once you start opening a few programs , however , that number quickly falls by a few hours . In a normal working day , expect to reach around five hours away from the mains . <p> I 'm a stickler for a comfortable keyboard when it comes to typing , whether its a mechanical gaming keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches or Apples low-slung magic keyboard . The Latitude 13 7370 has one of the most comfortable keyboards I 've ever used on a laptop , its sturdy keys possessing a generous amount of travel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to type up a 5,000-word transcript , a task that gave my fingers cramp on the Dell XPS 15 . In addition to deeper travel keys , the Latitudes keys feel softer , and more cushioned in comparison . If you 've used the Dell XPS 12s keyboard , the two are nearly identical . My only criticism of the Latitudes keys are that they 're slightly on the small side and would benefit from a larger surface area . If you 're making the transition from a MacBook , it may take you a short amount of time to become comfortable with the key size . Once you are , you 'll find that your fingers fly . <p> There is a trackpad that 's equally as good as the one on the XPS 15 , which is one of the most impressive I 've used on a Windows laptop . The Latitudes is n't quite as large , but it offers the benefit of being able to tap on it to execute a left or right click in addition to using the physical trackpad buttons underneath . <p> A common problem among Dells XPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue on the Latitude 13 7370 . Located underneath the screen in the left-hand corner , its low position made it difficult to look anything other than a bit silly on conference calls with my colleagues . I had to balance the Latitude on an empty cardboard box for one call , which goes against the Latitudes otherwise professional nature . <p> The Latitude 13 7370 is a unique busines machine . Like the XPS 13 its compact , light enough to carry anwyhere and and stands up well to knocks and scrapes . Youll have to pay extra for its enterprise features , however , whether you want them or not . <h> Likes <p> With its InfinityEdge display , there 's no other business ultrabook quite as compact as the Latitude . It slips into a bag for easy transportation , and stands up well to knocks and scrapes . Its soft-touch interior contrasts well with the solid aluminium exterior , adding up to result in a machine you can confidently take anywhere . Its keyboard is one of the best in the business , with keys that feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little on the small side . <p> If you go for the 1080p version you 'll get the best combination of battery life and screen real-estate . With plenty of connectivity options and 10 hours of battery life on the go ( if you stick to having one app open at a time with the brightness turned nearly all the way down ) , there 's enough juice to keep you going in an emergency . <h> Dislikes <p> The Intel Core M processor inside is a confusing choice and muddies the Latitudes value . Had it come with a Core i5 chip inside , its high cost wouldve made much more sense . As it stands , unless you really want its compact design and excellent keyboards , there are other laptops out there that are n't  far off such as the Yoga 260 that carry Core i7 chips and are around 50% more powerful for the same price . <p> There being no touchscreen is either a good or bad thing depending on your view . If you 've got used to using one then its ommission will come as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps keep weight and cost down . <h> Final- Conclusion <p> There 's no two ways about it : the Latitude 13 7370 lives up to the XPS 13s excellent reputation and convincingly carries over its best traits into the business world . You can sling it into a bag , rough it up a bit , go for hours on the road with one under your arm and connect just about anything you like up to it . Productivity comes easy thanks to its 1080p display and best-in-class keyboard . ( For a Windows machine , anyway the MacBook Airs keyboard is arguably the more comfortable of the two thanks to its larger keycaps . ) <p> Its disappointing then , that the Latitude is powered by a processor more accustomed to value laptops like the Asus UX305 and tablets such as the XPS 12 and Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S. Its not like the Latitude is too thin to queeze in full Core-series processors , which are already offered in the slimmer XPS 13 . It results in an unnecessary compromise , and one that restricts the Latitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users can depend on to take on any task . <p> On the other hand , if you 're seeking a well-built , compact laptop that packs enterprise features and enough horsepower under the hood to get through daily tasks , the Latitude 13 7370 is in a ( business ) class of its own . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

The company announced on Tuesday a 6.4-inch big-screen phone , and as silly as such a large device sounds , the company seems to think there 's demand for its Mi Max . <p> No doubt this is due to its low price , with the base model starting at 1,499 yuan ( $230 , -160 or AU$315 converted ) and the highest-end phone , with 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage , going for a song at just 1,999 yuan ( $350 , -210 or AU$420 ) . <p> Now , Xiaomis not the first Chinese company to go big : Huawei did it with the 6.8-inch P8 Max .

My early impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't a phone you can wield one-handed , like the bastard swords of yore , this is a strictly two-handed affair . My thumb got quite a good stretch trying to reach to the other edge of the screen but still failed to reach . <p> Thankfully the phone has a feature called palm rejection . This means that if your palm accidentally grazes the display while you 're holding the phone , the phone will ignore that as an input . This means you wo n't accidentally scroll down the Web page you 're looking at , or turn on your caps lock when you 're typing . In my experience , this is really important in larger phones . <p> The Mi Max has quite a few things going for it . Its big and beautiful , and Xiaomi has wrapped it in classy metal . It feels hefty due to its size , but its only 11 grams ( 0.4 ounces ) heavier than the iPhone 6S Plus , and while I do like it , those with smaller hands may find it a tad cumbersome . The 6.4-inch display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could just be the perfect phone for watching videos , and is more likely to fit in your pants pocket than , say , a slightly larger 7-inch tablet . <p> The Mi Max is one of the first phones to sport Xiaomis MIUI 8 software , which sports a new design based on colors and geometric shapes that change according to the context . Different months in the Calendar app will have a different color , for example , while if you 're using the audio recording app , the color changes based on the input volume . Animations have also been tweaked to feel more fluid and natural , while a new font called " Mi Lan " has been added . While the fonts more for Mandarin characters , there 's also one for the English alphabet . <p> Its not hard to dismiss the Mi Max due to its ridiculous size only the Huawei P8 Max is bigger but perhaps Xiaomi is to be commended for giving big-phone lovers what they want .

While this is technically a US-only product because its " optimized to work in North America , " Amazon will ship the Smart Lock internationally the price coverts to roughly -150 and AU$315 at the current exchange rate . <p> Smart locks are a fickle category . Because they 're securing your front door , you want something durable and reliable that will actually make your life easier . But that has n't  always been our experience during testing . Some models are hard to install , others have confusing apps or hit-or-miss performance . The next-gen August Smart Lock has none of that nonsense . It looks good , its reliable , the app is easy to use and this version works with Nest , Logitech Harmony , Comcasts Xfinity Home and Siri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd still strongly recommend Augusts Editors Choice **28;143;TOOLONG Smart Lock . <p> THE GOODFrom its improved design and easy install , to its simple software interface and top-notch performance , the $229 second-generation August Smart Lock does everything a little bit better . Oh , and it integrates with Siri via Apples HomeKit software , as well as the Works with Nest platform . <p> THE BAD The lock is n't compatible with every deadbolt , HomeKit can be challenging to get up and running , and the Siri integration wont matter to Augusts non-Apple users . <p> THE BOTTOM LINEAugusts HomeKit-enabled Smart Lock 2.0 improves on an already awesome product and is worth strong consideration even if you do n't  have an iPhone . <h> Leave the deadbolt , take the smart lock <p> Like Augusts original Smart Lock , which is available for the reduced price of $199 while supplies last , version 2.0 retrofits to existing deadbolts . Be sure to check out the full list of compatible deadbolts- before you buy , but it will typically work with most thumb-latch models from Baldwin , Kwikset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Smart Locks aesthetic does n't  deviate much from the original model . Its available in either a silver or a dark gray finish , with both copper and red finishes planned for future release . And , at 3.39 inches tall by 3.39 inches wide , with a depth of 2.22 inches ( 8.6cm round by 5.6cm deep ) , its larger than a standard doorknob , but unobtrusive nonetheless . <p> You wo n't notice any major design updates , but August did smarten up its configuration to make the physical hardware easier to interact with . A new easy-grip pattern and rounded edges improve the ergonomics of manually locking and unlocking the Smart Lock . The team also added magnets and a tweaked design to better secure the faceplate which hides the four included AA batteries . The plate on the original model tended to slip off when you turned the lock . ( Battery life will vary a lot depending on usage , but August says it should last about 6 to 9 months . ) <p> Beyond ease of use , the Smart Lock also looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Poly-Control Danalock . Its a little tougher to compare style when you venture over to models like the Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt , which require a full replacement of your existing deadbolt . Even so , the second-gen August Smart Lock holds its own as a clean-looking piece of hardware on your front door . <p> Augusts design is also discrete since you install it on the inside of your door . Since you keep your old deadbolt in place , your original keyhole and house keys will still work the same way . And everything will look exactly the same from the exterior of your house a plus if you want a smart lock , but do n't  want people to know you have a smart lock . <h> Installation in five easy steps <p> Its extremely easy to install the August Smart Lock . If you 're someone who 's interested in do-it-yourself smart home projects , but is new to DIY in general , this would be a great place to start . Assuming your deadbolt is compatible , you should only need a screwdriver ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on your deadbolt ) and about 10 to 15 spare minutes to swap out your old lock . <p> Here are the steps : <p> 1 . Make sure your deadbolt is compatible . Again , check this compatibility chart to make sure your hardware will play well with August . <p> 2 . Remove the thumb-latch on your old lock . Use a screwdriver to remove the screws on your existing thumb-latch ; remove the thumb-latch . <p> 3 . Attach the August mounting plate to your deadbolt . Line up the mounting plate August provides with the tail piece of your deadbolt ( that 's the bit of hardware sticking out that rotates your deadbolt open and closed ) and use the screws from your old lock to secure the mounting plate to the door . <p> 4 . Attach the adapter to the back of the lock and lift the wing latches . Select the adapter that 's compatible with your tail piece , attach it to the back of the lock and lift up the wing latches on the lock . ( August provides three adapters ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kwikset deadbolt , but you can figure out which adapter is best for your deadbolt in Augusts detailed installation guide . ) <p> 5 . Connect the lock to the mounting plate and flip down the wing latches . Fit the lock over the mounting plate on your door ( you 'll feel it snap into place ) and close the wing latches to secure it in place . <p> it feels a little unfair to compare this setup to models that require a full deadbolt replacement . Even so , this lock is by far the easiest to install out of all the models we 've reviewed so far . <h> So its on my door , now what ? <p> After you 've successfully installed the Smart Lock , remove the magnetic faceplate and throw away the plastic battery separator tab so it can enter pairing mode . August is a Bluetooth lock , which means that you can only control it via its app when you and your phone are within roughly 30 feet ( 10m ) of it ( there are exceptions if you add compatible accessories , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or iPhone August app , create an account and select the " Set up lock " option . From there , the app will scan for and find your lock , and you simply have to name the lock ( I named mine " Front Door " ) , add a house name ( in our case , " CNETs House " ) and it should connect . <p> Then , you 'll be instructed to " calibrate " your lock , which just means you need to open and close it one time each manually so August can learn how much the motor needs to work and how far it needs to turn to lock and unlock . That 's it for setup if you 're only using Augusts basic Bluetooth functions and nothing more . <p> For some , this functionality will be more than enough . It means that you can lock and unlock your door from the app when you 're within Bluetooth range , send virtual keys to friends , family members and anyone else youd like to grant either permanent or temporary access to your house . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unlocking geofencing features that , as the names suggests , will lock and unlock your door for you based on your ( and your phones ) comings and goings . <p> To opt-in to geofencing , select Auto-unlock in the settings section of the app . Toggle the switch over to enable the feature . If your phones location services are switched on , the geofencing map should automatically adjust to your current location . You can also customize the detection perimeter to any distance from 100 to 5,000 meters . <p> Unlike the auto-unlock feature , auto-lock is timer-based . That means the Smart Lock will automatically lock the door anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes after you unlock the door . Just specify your preferred time frame in the app and you 're set . <p> Auto-lock features were available with the original Smart Lock and worked quite well , and they continued to work well ( if not better ) this time around . They were both responsive and worked consistently . While its easy to see the value of hands-free access to your front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user-to-user by location and even by phone carrier . Here are Augusts troubleshooting tips if you run into any issues . <h> But wait , there 's more <p> There 's a bit more to this story , though . August also sells a $79 Connect accessory ( about -55 or AU$105 , converted ) that gives your Smart Lock Wi-Fi smarts for true remote access from anywhere you can get your phone online . In addition , an August spokesperson confirmed that the all-new $199- August Doorbell Cam ( converted , -135 or AU$260 ) can also act as a Wi-Fi bridge for the lock . If you 're interested in Augusts doorbell and its lock , you wo n't need the separate Connect accessory for remote integration via Wi-Fi . These are excellent add-ons if you 're looking for longer-range remote control , but do n't  care about Apples Siri-based smart home platform . <p> That brings me to HomeKit . Apples HomeKit smart home platform gives select connected home products access to Siri so you can control devices straight from your phone using your voice . Augusts second-gen Smart Lock is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deadbolt , you can ask Siri to " Unlock/lock the Front Door , " and even assign a room name so you can simply say , " Unlock the living room door . " <p> This requires additional configuration from the August app , including scanning an eight-digit code inside the Smart Locks faceplate , naming your lock and naming the room . This part of the HomeKit setup is seamless , as its integrated directly into Augusts software and the steps are easy to follow . But this only allows for local Siri control , meaning within range of your local Wi-Fi network . <p> If you want to use Siri to control your August Lock when you 're away from home , things get slightly more complex . Currently , you need a fourth-generation Apple TV to act as the Wi-Fi/security bridge connecting your phone and Siri to your lock . Theoretically you only need to be logged in to the same iCloud account and have the Keychain function turned on in your phones settings . <p> Unfortunately , because there is n't a dedicated HomeKit app or other sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via your Apple TV , getting it to work takes maneuvering . Troubleshooting suggestions from both Apple and August include tips such as restarting your phone ; logging out of and back in to your iCloud account on Apple TV ; and making sure the software is up-to-date on both devices . It is n't exactly difficult to see if your phone has the latest software , but it can be time-consuming to test out various scenarios before finding the culprit . <p> It can make the overall experience a little trying , but he potential frustration might be worth it if you have a new Apple TV handy and want remote Siri access . Once I got it to work , it was very reliable . Augusts second-gen Smart Lock also integrates with iDevices , Insteon+ and Lutron HomeKit apps if you happen to have multiple HomeKit devices . <p> While this lock does n't  integrate with Samsungs SmartThings or Wink , it does work with Logitech Harmony and Comcasts Xfinity Home . Its also a Works with Nest partner . That means you should be able to program your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode when you unlock or lock your door and see the current temperature in your home from the August app . You should also be able to see activity-based video clips the Nest Cam records from the August app . <p> All of that 's to say that you have a lot of options in terms of how you connect to the second-generation August Smart Lock and how you might integrate it into your wider smart-home setup . The Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt is one of Augusts closest competitors due to its HomeKit integration , but you only get remote access with that product if you buy the Apple TV . August , on the other hand , has the Connect accessory and the Doorbell Cam that can also perform that function . <p> In addition , a lot of Schlage and Yale locks require third-party hubs to work and do n't  come with dedicated apps as a result . The Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt , for example , does n't  have a software component . Instead , you have to use the SmartThings app as your access point for installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like SmartThings , but it can also be limiting if your smart-home hub of choice happens to go kaput . <h> The- Conclusion <p> Even with the clunky remote Siri setup , the second-gen August Smart Lock is excellent.From the easy installation to interacting with the app and the hardware itself , the entire process was straightforward , simple and , best of all , worked very reliably . Given the number of Smart Lock accessories available and the option of adding Siri into the mix via HomeKit , I can easily recommend this lock as a truly smart addition to your front door . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742 
@@42737677 @2737677/ <p> THE BOTTOM LINEThere are better VR experiences to be had than the LG 360 VR , and better G5 accessories to spend your money on . <p> It seems like everyone is having a crack at making a virtual reality headset , so why shouldnt LG get to have a go ? After all , if Viewmaster can stage a VR comeback , then surely so can the Korean electronics giant ? <p> Despite handing over a headset to CNET for testing , LG did n't  tell me the price ( despite the fact that some online retailers are listing it for $200 , which converts to around AU$265 or -140 ) . Nor did it offer a rundown of the specs or even confirm if the 360 VR was getting an Australian release . And truth be told , if the company decides to base any release decisions on early response to the product , maybe we wont be seeing the 360 VR any time soon <p> But first off , let 's look at how it compares with its most obvious competitor , Samsungs Gear VR : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Resolution ( per eye ) <p> 960+720 pixels at 693ppi <p> 1,280+1,440 pixels , at 518-577ppi depending on phone <p> Connection <p> USB-C cable <p> Micro-USB connector inside headset <p> Weight <p> 134.3 g ( 4.7 oz ) <p> 318 g ( 11.2 oz ) headset only , phone will add 171 g ( 6.03 oz ) <p> Dimensions <p> 164.1+185.6+45.9mm with arms extended ( 6.46+7.3+1.8 inches ) <p> 92.6+201.9+116.4 mm ( 3.64+7.95+4.6 inches ) <p> Works with <p> LG G5 <p> Samsung Galaxy S6 , S6 Edge , S6 Edge+ , Note 5 , S7 and S7 Edge <h> So its like the Samsung Gear VR ? <p> The 360 VR does actually work in a very similar way to Samsungs Gear VR . It uses the processing power of the LG G5 to run the virtual experiences . However , instead of placing your phone directly into the headset and using the phones screen as your window into virtual reality as you would with the Gear , the 360 VR complete with its own screen plugs into the G5 via a USB-C cable . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of safety goggles , only less cool-looking . Its not the prettiest product Ive ever seen : grey plastic on grey textured fabric does nothing for me . Urgh . <h> Since it does n't  use the G5s screen , what 's its screen like ? <p> The headset has two IPS displays built in , offering a dual 960+720-pixel resolution with 693 pixels per inch . That 's a lower resolution than you 'd get with a Gear using a Galaxy S7 as its screen , which has a pixel count of 1,280+1,440 per eye . <h> But its more comfortable to wear ? <p> Credit where credit is due : The 360 VR is the most comfortable of the VR headsets that Ive worn , but that comes with a big caveat . The open design makes for a lot of light leakage , where light seeps in from the real world . While the HTC Vive and Gear VR work to block out the real world , I found it really easy to peek around the sides of the 360 VR . <p> I 'm assuming this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headset itself means you 're supposed to control your way around using the phones screen and the design let 's you look down to see what you 're doing , although you could easily do it by touch alone . It does , however , make for a less immersive experience . That said , I never had the lenses steam up the way the Gear VR will do occasionally , which was a nice , sweat-free change . <p> The arms are made of a springy , curved plastic and ca n't be adjusted . Despite having a fairly large head , I never found them uncomfortably tight . I did quickly learn to take off the headset with both hands though using the one-handed style of " whipping off " caused the arms to hit my eye rather painfully . Oh , and dealers choice : you can plug your headphones into either the headset or your phone . <h> Can I wear it with glasses ? <p> No , but it does have a nice trick to help with that . You can adjust the lenses individually by manually turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , there is a problem . If the light shield is on , you can only make the adjustments when you 're not wearing the 360 VR , so it becomes a series of trial and error to get the distances right , continually putting on and pulling off the headset to play with the focus . Removing and replacing the light shield is a complete pain as well . To compound my frustration I found that putting it back on could cause me to bump the lenses and misalign the adjustments I 'd just made . <h> OK , so what can I actually do with this thing ? <p> At the moment , when you start using the 360 VR your main options are the Jaunt VR app and YouTube . Any content you 've recorded on the LG 360 , be it images or video , can also be viewed . <p> Jaunt mostly has 360-degree videos of varying interest . Short documentaries on the history of Machu Picchu and news stories , for instance about a replica of Paris in China , are both featured on the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manager app has added the Epiq VR , SBSPlayer and NextVR icons , but these are still greyed out and ca n't be accessed , so its not clear what 's going to be offered via these . <h> What 's the experience like ? <p> Not great . Actually , I 'd go so far as to say not even good . The lack of immersion makes the experience feel quite odd , as if the image is floating in front of you rather than you being in the moment . Samsungs Gear VR , while slightly uncomfortable , has a more exciting feel to its virtual reality . <p> The image is crisp enough , when you manage to get the focus right , but I experienced a sensation of motion blur that gave me a bit of a headache when I used it for more than a few minutes . Lag was n't particularly bad , but the open style of the headset also made it easy to get distracted by the real world , even when I was engaged in what I was watching . At times it felt like watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world I was inside of , and that 's not a great VR experience . <h> I want to try VR and have a G5 : Should I buy the 360 VR ? <p> Short answer : No . While LGs approach has merit from a comfort standpoint Samsungs Gear VR is clunky to wear in comparison the 360 VR just does n't  do what it needs to do in order to convincingly transport me into another reality . I want to be swept away and forget about the real world for a while , and the 360 VR simply fails in this endeavour . <p> That said , we still do n't  know the final price . If its low enough , the 360 VR could work as a fun accessory to tinker with . Something along the lines of the- Viewmaster VR goggles . But if it turns out to be closer to the $200 that some retailers are suggesting , then I recommend building your own Google Cardboard- or buying one outright ( prices start as low as $15 ) . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

@@42737682 @2737682/ <h> Microsofts Xbox One Console : Better with age ? <p> The Xbox One is the product of two different Microsoft . The console- debuted in 2013 following a disastrous six-month-long PR campaign that ultimately led to then " Xbox head Don Mattrick leaving the company . Initially Microsoft said that the Xbox One would require an internet connection even for single-player , store-bought games . The company backpedaled on that ahead of the consoles release , cobbling together bits of code to ensure that games played at launch . Even then , the Xbox One arrived with a sizable day-one patch . <p> Months of incremental post-launch updates added Twitch streaming , a controller battery-life indicator , custom wallpapers , party chat and some much-needed UI improvements . The biggest changes , though , have come since Phil Spencer assumed Mattricks old position . The Kinect sensor is no longer a requirement for the system , nor is Microsoft packaging it with every console sold . Because of that , the Xbox One is now priced lower than its most obvious rival , the PlayStation 4 : $299 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch it cost $500 with just the 500GB console , a controller and Kinect in the box . <h> Pros <p> Windows 10 makes the console more responsive and easier to navigate <p> Most backward-compatible Xbox 360 games run well on Xbox One <p> Now costs less than the PlayStation 4 <h> Cons <p> Kinect voice commands still do n't work reliably <p> Navigating the console remains sluggish compared to the PS4 <p> Still missing features from the Xbox 360 like system-wide game defaults <h> Summary <p> In the two and a half years since the Xbox One first came out , it 's become a fundamentally better product , thanks to last year 's Windows 10 update which made the UI faster and easier to use . That said , the console is still saddled with various quirks it 's had since day one . <p> - Spencers focus is on games an about-face from Mattricks " services and entertainment first " approach . Notably , Microsoft found success in January 2015 when it debuted the forthcoming Windows 10 update that brought Xbox One " to " PC game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out last fall , but if you poke around the Xbox One of today , there are still some skeletons from the consoles past lurking in the corners . <p> Hardware <p> Aside from Kinect no longer being a requirement , nothing has changed about the Xbox Ones hardware . Until a possible mid-cycle hardware refresh happens , the system still has HDMI input and output sockets on the back , an awkwardly placed USB 3.0 port on the left ( plus two more on the back ) , gigabit Ethernet and a Kinect-specific USB input . <p> Design-wise , its still a big , black box , but now you can get it in different- game-themed colors if that 's your thing . There are now models with 1TB hard disks ( or even hybrid hard/solid-state drives ) , but they all cost more than the standard 500GB configuration , ranging from to $400 to $500 . And with support for USB 3.0 external HDDs , its still more economical to go the 500GB route than for an Xbox One with more internal storage . <p> Stepping up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different type of benefit , though : It includes Microsofts awesome Xbox One Elite controller . <p> in the box . Whereas the gamepad that came with the console at launch suffered from sharp edges , stiff shoulder buttons and a generally unfinished feel , the Elite is an improvement in every way . <h> UI <p> The most visible change to the Xbox One is its user interface . The Windows 8 tiles that made up the consoles dashboard at launch have given way to a more streamlined experience that 's easier to use and faster than what came before it . The good thing with Windows 10 is that the massive window that dominates the home screen and quickly gets you back to whatever you were doing previously has n't  been altered just for the sake of change . <p> But the alterations we have seen are incredibly welcome . Previously , it felt like using a controller to navigate the system was an afterthought in favor of using Kinect voice commands . Common features and tasks were hidden under layers of unintuitive menus , but that 's different now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the biggest change is what happens when you scroll left from the home screen . Doing so brings up the quick-access menu introduced in last years software update , which is populated with the friends list , party chat , achievements , messages , notifications , system settings and , at the very bottom , app snapping . <h> Social <p> More than previous generations of consoles , the current crop are all about being social , whether in the form of sharing in-game screenshots to Twitter and Facebook or broadcasting your gameplay via Twitch . Even if you 're not jumping into multiplayer , interacting with others is a big part of console gaming these days . The Xbox One handles this in a few different ways . To the right of the home screen resides the community tab , which was also introduced as part of last years Windows 10 update . Its a feed that shows your and your friends recent activities , including achievements unlocked plus screenshots and videos shared . Its elegantly designed and easy to use . <p> Perhaps most important , the multimedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking out that clip of your buddy nailing six kills without dying in Halo 5 : Guardians . You can easily re-share something that you 've seen , too . That said , uploading a screenshot or video clip while you 're in-game is another matter entirely . Double-tapping the guide button brings up the quick-access menu after a slight delay . Press the " Y " button to grab a still or " X " to record video . Unlike on the PlayStation 4 , you can capture only gameplay , not menus or anything else . After you get your screenshot , you have to open the Game DVR app , hover over the content you want to share and then press the menu button to open up the options for the image . <p> From there you can choose to share it to the activity feed , profile , Twitter or OneDrive or as a message to a friend . You 'll notice that the largest social network on the planet , Facebook , is n't a share destination for some reason . A Microsoft spokesperson tells Engadget that the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that might happen . Once you 've shared , you have to manually exit the DVR and go back to the game . Its also incredibly frustrating that you ca n't share to more than one platform at a time . <p> Compare that with the PlayStation 4 , where uploading a screenshot to Twitter or Facebook ( but not both simultaneously ) takes all of five button presses , and then you 're automatically transported back to whatever you were doing prior to hitting the controllers share button . <p> Using the Upload Studio app for cutting shareable video clips is pretty painless , at least . But again , sharing directly from the app where something was created is n't possible and requires another trip back to the Game DVR , sifting through a few menus and then finally uploading it to whichever platform you choose . <h> Twitch <p> The elegance of the Xbox Ones Twitch app is impressive , and its also easier to use than Chromecasting from Android or iOS . The main attractions ( video and chat ) reside on a broadcasts main screen , with channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streamer all off to the right . <p> Broadcasting from the system works pretty well , too , though you 're stuck with the sluggish legacy app-snapping feature for beginning a stream . It is n't ideal , but you can at least hide the Twitch app and maintain your current broadcast without any onscreen clutter . For a quick stream with a few friends it works , but basing your fledgling broadcasting career around it is n't the best idea . Besides , chances are , if you 're serious about streaming , you 're already using external methods to do so ( e.g. , a capture card and PC software ) . <h> Kinect <p> When the Xbox One launched , the second-gen Kinect was touted as a huge improvement over the original . It was also essential to using the console itself . But ever since Microsoft decided that the sensor would no longer be required to use the system , the Kinect has become more and more irrelevant . <p> Nearly everything the sensor does can now be done with a few button presses . And whereas the voice recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , every time . The Kinect was supposed to be the most natural way to conduct Skype calls , turn the console on ( " Xbox : On " ) , grab a screenshot or video clip ( " Xbox : Record that " ) or snap an app ( " Xbox : Snap Twitch . No , snap Twitch . Xbox : Snap Twitch . Xbox : Are you even listening ? " ) . <p> More than two years since launch , however , saying " Xbox : On " still does n't  activate the console on the first try . Even if my apartment is dead quiet and I say it in a loud , forceful voice , the Xbox One will still sometimes refuse to power up . <p> Its frustrating , and more often than not I do n't  use the voice commands , aside from " Xbox : Use a code " to redeem a downloadable item . Ya know , because saying the same thing over and over to my console makes me feel pretty silly even when I 'm alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes its way to the Xbox One the situation will change , but for now I 'm happy to stick with what works . <h> Backward compatibility <p> By far the biggest change since the Xbox One came out in terms of actually , you know , playing games is the advent of backward compatibility . In the run-up to the consoles launch , Don Mattrick- infamously said , " If you 're backwards compatible , you 're really backwards . " Fast-forward to June 2015 , when Phil Spencer decreed that over 100 fan-requested Xbox 360 games would be playable on the Xbox One by years end . The most recent console update even let 's you buy backward-compatible Xbox 360 games right from the Xbox Ones marketplace . <p> That said , you cant just put your well-loved copy of Assassins Creed II in the Ones slot-loading Blu-ray drive and start playing off the disc . Instead , that only starts the process , because the old games rely on software emulation to play on the Xbox One . After inserting the disc , you 'll have to download a free backward-compatibility update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game designed to run on the newer hardware . Want access to your old saved files ? Hopefully you had automatic cloud saves activated on your 360 ; if not , I hope you still have the console around so you can manually upload your progression data and then download it to the Xbox One . <p> Its far from a seamless experience . The Xbox 360s interface for transfers is n't great , and uploading a bunch of old saved data at once is a slow-going process even with a speedy internet connection . But once its set up , it works as promised . Grabbing screenshots , making video clips and broadcasting via Twitch works without a hitch but since its software emulation , the quality of the experience varies on a game-by-game basis.Assassins Creed II runs great , as does South Park : The Stick of Truth , but the- Gears of War side story , Judgment , and Halo : Reach suffer from slowdown issues that could render the games unplayable for some . <h> Games <p> The good news is that for all the consoles changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Installing everything to a 500GB HDD remains a pain , but there 's support for external drives now , which renders that complaint mostly moot . Armchair pundits love griping every time a multi-platform game comes out and runs at a lower native resolution on the Xbox One versus PS4 , but unless you have both versions running side by side , its going to be difficult to tell the difference . Sure , there are edge-case scenarios , but I have n't seen any instances of games being unplayable . Really , the more game developers work with the Xbox One and familiarize themselves with the hardware , the better the performance will be . <p> In fact , buying a multi-platform title on Xbox One is becoming an enticing value , because publishers are packing in free versions of previous games for upcoming sequels . Bethesda Softworks did it with a backward-compatible Fallout 3 for Fallout 4 buyers , and Ubisoft did something similar with its Rainbow Six : Vegas series for Rainbow Six : Siege players last fall . <h> Game selection <p> Quantum Break from developer Remedy Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is still lagging behind the competition . While the Forza racing series remains awesome , like so many of the other games you can play only on Xbox One , up to this point they 're mostly sequels to long-running franchises that , while bigger and prettier , are n't  anything you have n't seen before . That could change this year , however , with Microsofts new focus on truly original , exclusive games likeSea of Thieves , from Rare , and Quantum Break ( Also See FinalFantasy ) , from Remedy Entertainment . Only time will tell , though . <p> Microsofts contentious attitude toward indie game developers under Don Mattrick is still hurting the company to this day . Both the Xbox One and PS4 offer free games to download every month as a bonus for subscribing to Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation+ , respectively . The difference is the selection : Microsofts " Games with Gold " was a reactionary offering to PS+ games , and Redmond still cant quite match the quality or consistency of free titles that PS+ subscribers get . Indies are a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they might already be out on PC , they 're still new for folks who do n't  own a gaming rig . <h> Xbox PC app <p> Another part of the Windows 10 experience on Xbox One that was n't available at launch is the ability to stream games from the console to a PC . I 'm not exactly sure who the target audience is here , but so long as your Xbox One and PC are on the same network , the setup is simple . Of course , streaming does n't  look quite as good as running a game off the console itself ( compression artifacts are n't  uncommon ) , but if someones hogging the TV in the living room and you have an itch to play Sunset Overdrive , there 's a solution . <p> Its worth noting , though , that if the TV hog in your household is using the Xbox for Netflix or HDMI passthrough , game streaming is n't possible . On the flip side , Microsoft promised last July that it will soon be possible to stream PC games to the Xbox One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will actually happen is anyones guess . <h> TV <p> Pre-Spencer , there was always a point during Microsofts E3 press conferences where the talk would go from the next Halo or huge game announcement to entertainment options and services . Whether it was introducing the now-defunct Xbox Entertainment Studios or things like Xbox Fitness , it never failed to suck all the excitement out of USCs Galen Center , where the briefings are held . That manifested during the Xbox Ones debut on Microsofts Redmond campus , too , where a majority of the time was spent talking about the consoles aim to replace your set-top box not your aging Xbox 360 . If the new " games , games , games " approach- from Spencer , along with user tweets and internet comment sections , are any indication , that direction to control your TVs main HDMI input was a failure . <p> The Xbox Ones big TV problem : Its not a DVR ( cable and antenna DVR support is currently in testing ) , and it ca n't talk to one to find recordings , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I need a guide to do . That makes it mostly useless for cable TV subscribers . For cord-cutters , a Sling TV app , a TV tuner add-on and support for streaming video from other devices have all failed to make the Xbox One into a replacement for your cable or satellite box . <p> One thing that 's better now is the initial setup . An update along the way added some support for HDMI-CEC , which means the Xbox One can recognize some of the TVs or boxes its connected to and load the IR codes for them automatically . Unfortunately , actual control is still possible only via the IR-blasting Kinect . Another welcome change is that last years Windows 10 update ushered in a faster , easier-to-use OneGuide with better picture-in-picture and a full-screen guide that makes good use of your TVs screen real estate . <p> Otherwise , being able to flip channels or pause a video without hunting for a remote is great when it works . And , you know , when Kinect is n't getting confused by sounds from the television itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to TV via headphones . It means plugging them into a controller , which is a little worse than the Bluetooth option now available via Apple TV , but on Xbox One I can use it for late-night cable TV or Blu-ray watching without waking anyone up . <p> Microsofts focus on Xbox One TV features has shrunk since the consoles poorly received reveal at E3 2013 , which makes it seem unlikely that things will change much in the future . There 's no indication that Microsoft plans to launch anything like PlayStation Vue streaming service for cord-cutters , and even as it tweaks , many of these problems need help from outside parties . Unless a company like Comcast or TiVo decides to give the XB1 direct access , for example , the guide will still be mostly useless for cable owners with DVR . Meanwhile , folks ditching cable or satellite can get most of the TV features on cheaper boxes . <h> Wrap-up <p> The Xbox One has come quite far in a relatively short span of time , but it still has a ways to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots , controllers still disconnect from the console seemingly at will , and were still missing Xbox 360 features like default game settings applying to your user profile ( camera viewpoints , difficulty settings , automatic or manual transmissions for racing games ) . Each time the Xbox 360 was updated , the console did n't  still feel like it was missing things . Instead , it always felt like new features were being added on top of everything that worked so well in the first place . The Xbox One has n't  reached that point yet , but its getting there . <h> Follow Us 20739 @qwx430739 20741 @qwx430741 20740 @qwx430740 20742 @qwx430742

Its called And Chill , and its a movie recommendation engine.Via Facebook Messenger or text you can engage And Chill , where it will ask you to tell it a particular movie you enjoyed and why you liked it . The bot will analyze your reasoning and use the data it receives to recommend films in the same vein as the one you stated a preference for . The science behind it all is n't so readily shared by the startup itself , but it " uses a few different frameworks to detect patters , attributes , and other factors " to work its magic . <p> At the time of this post And Chill is under some heavy load , promising it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect delays . I was n't actually able to get a recommendation due to said delays ( I waited 20 minutes for a response ) but it looks from other user reviews its offering some decent suggestions here and there . <p> Its definitely a leg up from doing the Netflix shuffle where you flip back and forth through categories aimlessly , but itll need some time before it works as flawlessly as wed want .
