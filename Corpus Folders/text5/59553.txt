But this does n't necessarily mean that he is poor . His real wealth is discourse , first the oral narration of his marital adventures , and then the manuscript he offers his friend Peralta the lawyer to read , a literary text . Campuzano 's real talent ( in the Biblical sense of wealth given him ) is as a teller of tales . He is rather like Cervantes himself in this.1 Campuzano is the last in a series of sympathetic but impotent soldier-poets who appear throughout Cervantes ' works . He recalls Ruy PTrez de Viedma , who narrates his experiences as a captive in Algiers and runs into his brother , the successful <p> lawyer , in Don Quijote I , 39-41 . He is also a more elaborated version of the soldier-poet in La guarda cuidadosa , who woos the girl with love poetry and the record of his military service but loses her to the sacristan.2 There is also a relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tries his best to be a man of letters but is derided and rejected , and forced finally against his will into the profession of arms , where he ? wins ? fame ( as a soldier ) and death simultaneously . Otis H. Green once postulated that Licenciado Vidriera has an autobiographical dimension ; certainly Casamiento/coloquio does.3 Finally , Campuzano is a remote descendant of Elicio in La Galatea , who mobilizes an army of soldier-poets to rescue poetry itself , allegorized in the person of Galatea , from the clutches of the Portugese.4 We are accustomed to read the Casamiento narrative from some kind of moralistic high ground and to judge Campuzano from that perspective . Mauricio Molho , for example , makes much of what he calls ? le pechT de Campuzano. ? 5 Is he a liar ? Can we trust the Coloquio story in view of his self-confessed deceit in the other one ?

In fact , he draws attention to it . See ? Tradici=n y actualidad literaria en La guarda cuidadosa , ? in his Fuentes literarias cervantinas ( Madrid : Gredos , 1973 ) , 95-108 . Mary Gaylord has also written about this : ? La poesfa y los poetas en los entremeses de Cervantes , ?

Woodward has worked this out with precise references to the precepts of rhetoric . The Casamiento is the inductio to the Coloquio . It proceeds according to the prescribed method ordo artificialis , with the short illustrative story about Campuzano and Doa Estefanfa , the proverb about Don Simueque and his one-eyed daughter , and the sententia from Petrarca.6 Campuzano , the man of arms , tells his stories to Peralta , a professional of letters , literally a letrado . Now what happens here ? The man of arms becomes the man of letters . It is he who proffers texts to be reacted to , not his friend the lawyer , who makes a good living by manipulating words but whose manipulations never become part of any text we read . The ? man of letters ? is silenced . In this sense , as Campuzano 's story , the last of the Novelas ejemplares is the story of a writer trying to become one . In fact , maybe this is Cervantes ' final or most detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in society.7 But there are several portraits of the artist in this text . There is Campuzano who addresses Peralta , there is Berganza who addresses Cipi=n , there is Caizares who addresses Berganza . And there is also a narrator who addresses the reader . There is a nexus between the dogs ' speech , the witches ' speech , and Campuzano 's oral and especially written discourse . All these speakers have in common that they are supposed to remain mute . Campuzano 's text ( the Coloquio ) is about giving voice , that is , speech , real membership in the community , to those marginated elements whose status is so insignificant it <p> renders then infans and thereby deprives them of membership . Campuzano 's text is designed to make the unspoken speak , to raise the repressed ( collectively , the things society does n't want to think about ) to the level of consciousness . We should consider Caizares , as witch and as woman , and her speech first . The prevailing viewpoint is exemplified most forcefully in recent Casamiento/Coloquio criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous embodiment of disorder ? ( 61 ) . Caizares herself is ? the monster at the center of the labyrinth ? ( 59 ) . ? Whether or not Cervantes actually believed in witches . . . it is nevertheless clear that he was well aware of the imaginative power of the myth of witchcraft , that he effectively introduced its vision of annihilating energy and its vocabulary of horrible inversion at the moment of climactic disintegration in his narrative , and that he exploited its theological implications to pursue to its most profound depth his major theme of the nature of evil ? ( 71 ) . Marfa Antonia GarcTs has recently offered a more modern and marginally less moralistic version of Forcione 's thesis . Largely because she insists on Caizares as a sexual being ( a characteristic Forcione shies away from ) , her vision of the old woman as the monstrous locus of evil is even more virulent that his . GarcTs also situates the problematic of Berganza 's encounter with Caizares within the context of Lacan 's theories of accession into language and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb , a descent into the abyss where the monster lives , . . . a face to face encounter with the ? void ? epitomized by a woman 's genitals. ? Caizares is ? the most repulsive invention of the maternal , a desecration of that saintly body which represents the highest construct of the Christian civilization regarding human conception and nurturing . . . . Therefore corruption ? sexuality , syphilis and sin ? is identified from the onset with the feminine , of which the maternal is the real support. ? 9 The association of Caizares the witch to a fearsome crone who is somehow also a mother need not proceed from the theories of Julia Kristeva , whence GarcTs derives it . Caizares the crone may also be considered as the debased , degraded and disempowered <p> 8 Alban Forcione , Cervantes and the Mystery of Lawlessness ( Princeton : Princeton UP , 1984 ) .9 Marfa Antonia GarcTs , ?

She is identified with the earth , with the generative principle , and with the seasonal and life cycles . There is a lively debate among scholars both feminist and otherwise concerning whether her worship signified a matriarchal socio-political order , or simply reflected matrilineal reckoning of descent , and whether the Goddess was ousted by the discovery of paternity , by Indo-European barbarians , by the institution of private property , or just what.10 Barbara Walker divides the Goddess into three aspects not unlike the Trinity familiar to Christians . ? This many-named Goddess was the first Holy Trinity . Her three major aspects have been designated Virgin , Mother , and Crone ? ( 21 ) . Around the fifth century A.D. Christianity incorporated her worship or at least her veneration , but with significant modification . The Virgin and Mother aspects where merged into the familiar figure of Mary . The Crone aspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the logic of the natural cycles she presided , was simply amputated . This tactic allowed the fact of death to be replaced by the promise of eternal life , and it made female sexuality disappear behind virginity and nurturing . There is accumulating a body of feminist analysis of the silencing of women by the patriarchal order . Elaine Showalter observes that ? It was because witches were suspected of esoteric knowledge and possessed speech ? possessed ? is an adjective modifying ? speech ? that they were burned. ? 11 Showalter 's apparently offhand observation about witches is the fruit of an alternative , almost an underground tradition of attempts to explain the phenomenon of witchcraft from the perspective of the witches instead of that of their persecutors . In 1862 in a book entitled La SorciFre , Jules Michelet explained the rise of witchcraft in the Middle Ages and Renaissance precisely as the only means of revolt possible for women against <p> the oppressive feudal-patriarchal order . It is easy , especially for a man , to dismiss Michelet 's melodramatic account of the peasant bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising his droits de Seigneur on her body as hyperbolic docu-drama , but contemporary feminist theory finds his hypotheses congenial and rewarding . HelFne Cixous , Catherine ClTment , and Marguerite Duras all return approvingly to Michelet 's theses on the origins and meaning of witchcraft . When XaviFre Gauthier founded her feminist literary review in 1976 she names it SorciFres . For Gauthier all women are sorciFres . The figure of the witch is a kind of hyperbolic trope , the extreme case of woman 's situation in man 's society . The French feminists ' attraction to witchcraft is based on a perception of witches as powerful liberated women . Their attributes : ? ? direct ? contact with nature , with their body , with the body of others ; ? practices , ideas , and a language that are presented as positive models for a specifically feminine , as opposed to an oppressive masculine culture ; ? a halo of mystery and secrecy that evokes the notion of a private territory or kingdom where women are queens . Witches were subversive because of their alliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , imagined or real , especially during the Sabbath ? orgies ? . . . . Witches as healers , poisoners , aborters , and midwives knew about plants and the body . . . because they had studied them practically . If witches used plants effectively it is because they classified them and experimented with them , and that is a ? scientific ? approach . It is not a better practice because one calls it scientific , but it means that witches used their brains in the same way as men , who later monopolized medicine. ? 12 Across the channel , Catherine Belsey observes that witchcraft can be considered ? as a practice offering women a form of power which was forbidden precisely by orthodox concepts of the family. ? 13 <p> Michelet 's theses have been favorably received by at least a segment of competent clinical opinion in this country as well . Thomas S. Szasz considers that witches were silenced and hounded out of existence because they competed , rather too successfully , with the established order and its corollary of male supremacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the witch tended to undermine the established hierarchies of dominance ? of priest over penitent , lord over peasant , man over woman. ? 14 Marxism , which shares with feminism a vision of society divided into oppressors and victims , also shares the alternative approach to understanding witchcraft . Marja Ludwicka Jarocka bases her discussion of the witches in the text and their place in Cervantes ' society on Michelet 's theories.15 Jarocka notes that Caizares is not the only witch in our text . Rather , she belongs to an entire subculture composed of marginated women . The witches also competed with the new science of medicine , and exclusively masculine practice restricted to university graduates and encoded in the Latin language.16 It has even been argued that this competition alone was responsible for the systematic hunting down and extermination of witches precisely during the period of the formation of modern medicine . Thomas Szasz observes that the sorceress ? acquires , by experimenting with drugs extracted from plants , a genuine knowledge of some powerful pharmacological agents ? ( 85 ) . Among these he lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wise woman who understood its use.17 Julio Caro Baroja comes perhaps as close as a man could in 1961 to identifying witches ' behavior with their status as women . Like Marja Jarocka , he considers the witch as a woman on the margin of society . He evokes women who find themselves belittled by their surroundings , perhaps left with a ? complejo de <p> impotencia ? after a series of failed amorous relationships , and concludes that ? las hechiceras antiguas formaban como una sociedad secreta de mujeres. ? 18 Juan Blzquez Miguel traces what he calls a ? proceso de satanizaci=n de la mujer ? beginning in the twelfth century , a tendency to blame women for everything from outbreaks of plague to ecclesiastical schism.19 The enormously influential Malleus maleficarum of 1486 , for example , identifies witches as women because ? all witchcraft comes from carnal lust , which in women is insatiable. ? 20 As a Spanish example Blzquez Miguel cites Martfn Castaega , writing in 1529 : ? Cristo , conociendo su naturaleza perversa , las apart= de sus sacramentos , mientras que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excrementos ; son ms fciles de engaar por su natural simpleza ; son ms curiosas para saber y escudriar cosas ocultas ; son ms habladoras y se ensean unas a otras ; como son menos fuertes tienen mayor propensi=n a la ira y son ms vengativas ; al llegar a la vejez tienen apetitos carnales que no pueden satisfacer y piden ayuda al diablo. ? 21 Having noted the general tendency to equate women and their alternate healing arts with witchcraft and the Devil , we can proceed to the specific historical context of Cervantes ' witches . Everyone has noted the presence , by name , of a real witch , Leonor Rodrfguez , La Camacha de Montilla . Leonor Rodrfguez and her sister ( ? ) Catalina were both tried for witchcraft and condemned at the auto of 8 December 1572 . The proceedings have been published by Rafael Gracia Boix.22 The material published by Gracia Boix is only very tenuously related to Cervantes ' text , except for the name ? La Camacha , ? which figures so prominently in it . Neither of the historical Camachas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coloquio de los perros , although there are some similarities , which should be noted . Like Caizares in the story , both Catalina and Leonor were condemned <p> to volunteer work in a hospital . Catalina was to serve ? cinco aos en C=rdoba en el hospital que se le sealare ? ( 94 ) , and Leonor ? los dos primeros aos de los diez of her exile en un hospital en C=rdoba , cual se la sealare ? ( 96 ) . Both women , as indeed all the witches who were tried and condemned on the same occasion , devoted a good part of their professional practice to what we might call magical alcahueterfa , arranging for certain men to come into the presence of female clients , including the celebrated apparition of a certain Don Alonso de Aguilar in the client 's garden in the form of a horse ( Bernarda Alba , watch out ! ) , but neither of them is noted as a midwife , and there are no references to childbirth in the proceedings . Similarly , and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sabbaths or aquelarres . Thus the two most crucial aspects of Caizares ' intervention in the Coloquio are missing from the Camacha proceedings . In spite of the textual prominence of the Andalusian Camachas , it seems that of all the manifestations of the European witch craze of 1450-1750 , the one that most probably bears on Cervantes ' text is the famous Logroo auto of 1610 . The largest such event in history , it attracted some 30,000 spectators . An extensive relaci=n was published in the same year by Juan de Mongast=n , which Cervantes surely must have read.23 In this context it is perhaps not insignificant that Caizares herself directs attention away from Andalucfa to Navarra when she remarks that she and La Montiela ? habfamos estado las dos en un valle de los Montes Perineos en una gran jira. ? 24 She refers to an aquelarre in the Basque country . The word is of Basque origin , suggesting the prominence of that region in both the production and persecution of witches . ? Akerr ? is ? macho cabrfo ? , and ? larre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site respectively of the witches ' clandestine gatherings . The question has <p> 23 Ameza , for one , seeks to minimize the importance of this event , because he believes the Coloquio was written no later than 1605 , and probably in Fall 1604 , when Cervantes was living in Valladolid . He is willing to admit , however , that Cervantes could have incorporated some details from the 1610 relaci=n into last-minute revisions of his text . Ameza , Cervantes creador , II , 452 . All Forcione says is : ? Various Cervantists have connected the genesis of the Caizares episode with the famous auto de fe of Logroo in 1610 . ? ( Cervantes and the Mystery of Lawlessness , 68 , n. 14 ) . He then remits to Ameza 's edition of Casamiento.24 ed . Sieber , vol . II , p. 340 . <p> 25 M. J. Harner has recently observed that all the famous unguents are found to contain atropine , a powerful alkaloid , as well as mandragora and henbane . The broom the witches were said to mount served to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result of this application is said to be a ? trip ? in the modern sense of drug culture slang . M. J. Harner , ? The Role of Hallucinogenic Plants in European Witchcraft , ? Hallucinogens and Shamanism ( London , 1973 ) , 124-150 . Other unguents have been found to contain aconite or monkshood , cinquefoil and belladonna . This combination is said to produce cardiac arrhythmia , which in a sleeping person would give the sensation of falling or flying . Blzquez Miguel , Eros y Tnatos , 23-24.26 Pedro Ciruelo , Reprobaci=n de las supersticiones y hechicerfas ( 1530 ) , ed . Alva V. Ebersole ( Valencia : Albatros , 1978 ) , 37 . <p> 11.1 ( 1991 ) <p> Of Witches and Bitches <p> 17 <p> that the Devil , and not some chemical agent or the imagination of the individual concerned , is responsible for what happens . Caizares : ? Hay opini=n que no vamos a estos convites sino con la fantasfa , en la cual nos representa el demonio las imgenes de todas aquellas cosas que despuTs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sino que verdaderamente vamos en cuerpo y en nima ; y entrambas opiniones tengo para mf que son verdaderas , puesto que nosotras no sabemos cuando vamos de una o de otra manera , porque todo lo que nos pasa en la fantasfa es tan intensamente que no hay diferenciarlo de cuando vamos real y verdaderamente . Algunas experiencias desto han hecho los seores inquisidores con algunas de nosotras , y pienso han hallado ser verdad lo que digo ? ( 340 ) . When Caizares says that the Inquisitors have conducted experiments and found both of two contradictory propositions to be true ( ? Do we really go there , or do we imagine it ? ? ) , she is probably reflecting , in a general way , the double explanation proposed by Ciruelo as long before as 1530 , and in a more immediate and empirical context , the antagonism and opposed interpretations of the Inquisitors whose investigations led to the famous Logroo proceedings of 1610 . These were the hard liners Alonso Becerra Holgufn and Juan Valle Alvarado on the one hand and Alonso de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . On 20 April 1611 , concurrently with the Becerra/Valle and Salazar Frfas debates , and at the request of the Inquisitor General , the humanist Pedro de Valencia offered a reaction to the recently published account of the 1610 auto . Either the witches ' meetings were real , and took place with the cooperation of the Devil ; or the witches ' meetings were dream-visions produced by the witch unguent ; or the witches ' meetings were sometimes real and sometimes only dreams , but in any case involved the cooperation of the Devil.27 Salazar Frfas had violent disagreement with his two hard-nosed colleagues , which led to a series of position papers and mutual recriminations in the years following the 1610 proceedings . <p> 27 Valencia 's observation remained unpublished until 1900 , when Manuel Serrano y Sanz published them as the ? Discurso de Pedro de Valencia acerca de los cuentos de las brujas y cosas tocantes a magia , ? Revista de Extremadura 2 ( 1900 ) , 189-303 ; 337-347 . Summarized in Gustav Henningsen , The Witches ' Advocate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( See also the testimony of Marfa de Lesaca reported by Idoate . ) <p> We might conclude tentatively that witches , signalled by Caizares ' presence at the center of Cervantes ' text , are the extreme form of all the oppressed segments of the population who are empowered , that is , given voice , made to speak , by Campuzano 's speech and written discourse . But before we get too carried away with the idea of witches as women of power who offer an alternative to patriarchy , we should recall the facts as reported in the Inquisition documents . First of all , witchcraft was by no means the exclusive province of women . The real witches were both women and men , in more or less equal distribution . Carlo Ginzburg in fact begins his influential study of the witches ' sabbath with the off-handed observation that ? male and female witches met at night , in solitary places. ? 32 Second , the dominant note is the sexual submission , by both witches and warlocks , to the often brutal phallic domination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initiation for witches consisted in a brutal rite of both vaginal and anal penetration , a savage reaming accompanied by great pain and bleeding . A few examples from the 1612 document , among many that might be cited : ? Graciana de Amezaga , de edad de 40 aos , dice que el demonio los conocfa a todos carnalmente , a los hombres por detrs y a las mujeres por ambas partes , y que cuando a ella la conoci= carnalmente el demonio por primera vez , era doncella y la deflor= , sintiendo mucho dolor , y le sali= sangre , que llev= en la camisa a su casa , y al dfa siguiente la tenfa y vio en ella. ? ? Martfn de Vizcar , de edad de 70 aos , dice que el demonio le estupr= y sac= gran cantidad de sangre , que le corrfa por los muslos y le ensangrent= mucha parte de la camisa . Y cuando su mujer la vio llena de sangre , le dijo que de donde diablo trafa la camisa de aquella manera , y Tl le respondi= que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marfa de Dinarte , de edad de 40 aos , dice que la primera vez que el demonio la conoci= somTticamente , tuvo mucho dolor y la sali= sangre , y otro dfa se ech= de ver en la camisa. ? 33 This is , shall we say , something less than sexual or any other kind of liberation . The point , which even Cervantes ' ? ponderous ? sense of irony could have grasped , is that in practice , <p> witchcraft was not about the empowerment of women , but ( pace Gauthier ) about a different form of patriarchal domination . Witchcraft as described in the documents is a kind of freudian-slip revelation of the violent but invisible underside of the visible structures of ? straight ? patriarchal society . Now , what has all this to do with Cervantes ' text ? I think a great deal , because while Cervantes had to have been familiar with documents such as those just quoted , or at least with verbal summaries of the most scandalous parts , Caizares ' discourse eliminates the Devil and all traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caizares really is empowered . The crucial difference between her and the historical witches whose testimony fills so many pages may be stated linguistically . Caizares is a speaking subject , an I , who generates herself through her discourse . The historical witches are robbed of discourse , they figure only as ? este testigo , ? and their testimony is recast and recounted in the third person by that very patriarchal establishment before which they stand accused , as objects . This explains Caizares ' discourse , but it does n't explain the frankly negative portrait of her offered by Berganza and enthusiastically endorsed by Cipi=n . And every critic has also called attention to the dogs ' depiction of her as monstrous . This may be Cervantes ' last irony on the matter . Yes , Berganza and Cipi=n accede to language and the Symbolic order , as everyone has noted . But coming into language simply means that they immediately become the victims of ideology , blithely unaware of the already gendered nature of the language ( the only language ) that is available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology here , because it does n't seem to have occurred to him to create two talking female dogs ( ? The BWitches ' Colloquy ? ? ) . On the other hand , it does occur to him to create two competing discourses : the dogs ' masculine-gendered speech and Caizares ' emphatically feminine version . This duplicity of discourse is what is responsible for the duplicitous intellection of Cervantes ' text and for the duplicity for resulting critical discourse . Forcione and GarcTs , who see Caizares as a monstrous embodiment of evil , seem to be speaking from within the discourse of patriarchy , manifesting the hysteria provoked by the terror of ? that sex which is n't one. ? Mary Gossy , on the other hand , begins her consideration of Caizares with reference to what she calls Forcione 's ? paranoid descriptions of feminine sexuality ? <p> 22 <p> CARROLL B. JOHNSON <p> Cervantes <p> and observes how ? heterodox femininity is . . . identified with evil ? ( 70 ) . Like GarcTs , Gossy identifies Caizares as a representation of female sexuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the description to masculine fear of ? the menace and horror stimulated by the unfathomable uncertainty. ? She further observes , inacurately , that Caizares is the only woman in the Casamiento/coloquio who actually has a voice , who exercises the motherly function of generation ? of discourse . Not entirely incidentally , Gossy also draws attention to the dogs ' entry into language and the Symbolic order ( 73 ) , again foregrounding the situation they share with Caizares in patriarchal society : marginalized and silenced.34 Cervantes creates a situation here analogous to that of Don Quijote I , 50 , where the discourse of the Canon , as spokesman for the Aristotelian poetics of verisimilitude resting on a clear-cut distinction between history and poetry , is challenged and opposed by Don Quijote , who conflates those presumably mutually exclusive categories of Aristotelian orthodoxy and generates an alternate discourse based on a poetics of psychic , as opposed to circumstantial verisimilitude . I believe it was Alban Forcione who first realized that the presence of Don Quijote 's alternate discourse disqualifies the Canon as a spokesman for Cervantes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude that the presence of Caizares ' alternate discourse disqualifies Berganza and Cipi=n as spokesdogs for Cervantes ' position on witches . Their hysterical aversion to Caizares ' physical person and what she represents in society can no longer be taken as normative . We are left , as usual , where Cervantes so often leaves us , with nagging unresolved ( and probably unresolvable ) questions of ambiguity and multiple perspectives , and unresolvable dialectic of competing voices . It is possible that the immediate impulse for all these officially silenced members of society given voice and speech by Cervantes , and especially the talking dogs , is a throwaway in Guzmn de Alfarache , where Guzmn wants to denounce an abuse but does n't bother to complete the process because he 's only an insignificant/infans pfcaro . He concludes : ? Estos ladridos a mejores perros tocan ; r=mpanse las gargantas , descubran los <p> ladrones ? ( I , ii , 3 ) . This is the significance of Berganza 's last adventure , after he has taken refuge in the hospital . He attempts to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitutes , a plan he has overheard from one of the marginalized , officially ? voiceless ? inmates of the hospital , but all he can do is bark . ? AlcT la voz , pensando que tenfa habla , y en lugar de pronunciar razones concertadas ladrT con tanta priesa y tan levantado tono que , enfadado el Corregidor , dio voces a sus criados . . . , y un lacayo que acudi= a la voz de su seor . . . ? ( 358 ) . The power structure has a voice . Indeed , in this little episode the possession of a voice is what defines the power structure as such . A huge accumulation of scholarship has been led astray by Peralta 's refusal to take seriously the content of the dogs ' discourse , and has insisted instead on the tradition of talking dogs.35 This critical sleight of hand almost re-enacts Campuzano 's experience with Peralta , who evades the real question ( Is this a true and therefore troubling description of our society and its structural weaknesses ? ) by substituting for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In so doing he reduces his friend 's denunciation of society 's ills to an entertaining fiction . Cervantes literalizes Alemn 's allegory , demonstrating what happens when the bark is turned into speech but the new speakers are still without authority . The authority-less author 's potentially revolutionary social message is painlessly absorbed into the status quo by the simple expedient of identifying it as a fiction and relocating it outside the realm of reality . Antonio Rey Hazas points out that Guzmn de Alfarache engages in an imaginary dialogue with the reader , and that Cervantes puts Guzmn 's fantasy of the critical reader into the text along with the picaresque narrator . ? De ahf que la misma forma dialogal sea una probable respuesta par=dica a las invitaciones de Guzmn al t , al lector. ? 36 I would go further . Some years ago I suggested that many of Guzmn 's interpellations of <p> an imaginary reader were in fact manifestations of his own insecurity . This paranoiac self-revelation can only cause the reader to not take seriously the social abuses Guzmn is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Cervantes remedies this , as Rey Hazas says , by transforming the imaginary reader-critic into a real one , thus freeing Berganza from the burden of paranoia . The reader is similarly freed to take his ( both Berganza 's and his author Campuzano 's ) exposT of society 's ills seriously . But there 's the rub . The presence of the critic-authority turns the social message into a fiction and thus neutralizes it . The author ( Berganza , Campuzano ) is n't the author-ity . So in my view the real function of Cervantes ' parodic response to Guzmn 's invitation is to demonstrate that even with the burden of paranoia removed , the message still does n't need to be taken seriously . Let me try to work back through the hierarchy of authors from Caizares to Berganza to Campuzano to Campuzano 's creator . Mary Gaylord concludes , following an elaborate conceit with L=pez Pinciano and Vulcan the artffice cojo , that ? in Cervantes ' literary cosmos , the authorial deity is a crippled god . It is striking that Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in figures which do not suggest authority , control , power , but rather contingency , limitation , even impotence. ? 37 It is certainly true that Campuzano is cojo like Vulcan ; he is so described in the opening paragraph ( ? haciendo pinitos y dando traspiTs ? 281 ) . He is using his sword as a staff . I had always interpreted this fact in light of his recent venereal disease , as a symbolic representation of his earlier misuse of his phallus , now perhaps rendered unusable altogether . There is no question that the sword is a phallic object , but its signification transcends its literal sexual function . In a well known essay Sandra M. Gilbert called attention to what has become a clichT of feminist criticism , the pen-penis pair as the specifically masculine instruments of both biological and literary generation . The phallic sword is then subsumed under the pen/penis .

I would disregard these contentions and others similar to it made by the ? hard ? critics except for the fact that their effect , I think , has been undeservedly influential , to the extent that many Cervantists , though they may not wish to admit this , have been intimidated into taking cautious stands in forwarding any interpretation of Don Quixote which might bear signs of adherence to ( or contagion from ) the romantic or idealistic ? the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review here the polemics of the general debate but limit my observations to Russell 's use of Shelton 's translation in partial but important support of his argument . Russell , you will remember , contended that modern translators were much to be blamed for the misinterpretation of Cervantes ' intentions and for having helped romanticize Don Quixote , promoting the view of the protagonist as an ideal or symbolic figure . I quote here not from Russell 's 1969 article , ? ' Don Quixote as a funny book ? <p> 225 <p> 226 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> ( Hispanic Review , 64 , 312-26 ) , but from Chapter 8 of his book Cervantes ( Oxford , 1985 ) , entitled ? Don Quixote as Romantic Hero : ? <p> The Romantic approach , or attitudes derived directly from it , have continued to dominate much criticism down to the present time . These attitudes have also affected those of modern translators of the book from Spanish , so making the Romantic approach spuriously self-fulfilling . One example illustrates the point . In Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked out by stones thrown at him by some shepherds whom he has annoyed . Sancho thereupon attaches to his name the new descriptive epithet ? Caballero de la Triste Figura ? which Thomas Shelton , in 1612 , correctly translated as ? Knight of the Ill-favoured Face ? ? a comment on the knight 's smashed-up visage . Modern translators however regularly come up with linguistically anachronistic phrases like ? Knight of the Sad Countenance ? or ? Sir Knight of the Sorrowful Figure , ? with their deliberate implications of superior , even Christlike , suffering . Were we dealing with a modern Spanish writer , such a translation would be permissible ; used here , it simply fails to translate Cervantes ' ironic words or convey the situation he has taken pains to explain ( pp. 99-100 ) . <p> Russell 's observation about Shelton 's translation is correct only up to a point . One is unlikely to argue against the assumption that Sancho 's choice of ? triste figura ? stems , as he himself suggests jokingly , from the ? mala figura ? Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term ? triste ? in Spanish , like the term ? sad ? in English , obviously has several connotations , and Cervantes , who loved playing with words , at this point is skillfully using one of them . With this in mind , we can logically ask , does Cervantes ever insinuate another meaning for this word ? triste ? ? The perceptive Shelton himself would seem to have thought so . Russell , in his zeal to substantiate his thesis , fails to note these variations . From the Harvard Classics edition , the most readily available ( New York : Collier &amp; Son , 1970 , 63rd printing ) of Shelton 's translation of Don Quixote , Part I , we note that Shelton , from Chapter 5 of Book III ( I , 19 ) through Chapter 4 of Book IV ( I , 31 ) , does use the expression ? Knight of the Ill-favoured Face ? some eighteen times without change . Cervantes , playing with and perpetuating the newly applied ? epithet , ? uses it eleven times , Sancho seven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulcinea . The ? epithet ? ? Russell uses this word to further the pejorative , burlesque sense he attaches to the motto ? is used mechanically by Shelton who continues to render the initial meaning . Signing the letter to his fair lady , Don Quixote himself would hardly have used ? triste ? with the connotation ? smashed-up , ? unless <p> 8.2 ( 1988 ) <p> A reply to P. E. Russell <p> 227 <p> he meant something like ? scarred ? as in a battle . Shelton , at this point , intelligently begins to vary his interpretation of the phrase , and changes not noted by Russell occur from IV , 10 ( I , 37 ) on . Sancho , having noticed Dorothea kissing Fernando , suggests that his master keep on sleeping . In Spanish he addresses Don Quixote as ? Seor Triste Figura. ? Shelton , now rightly sensing a need for a different word for ? triste ? comes out with ? Sir knight of the heavy countenance ? ( page 366 ) . Three pages later Dorothea goes back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face , ? in simple repetition of the initial application . Don Quixote ( 374 ) , more appropriately now , calls himself , as Sancho just did , the ? knight of the Heavy Countenance. ? Chapters later , after coming out of the Sierra Morena and after many events occurring at the inn , a very important distinction is made . Dorothea ? trying to calm the furious Don Quixote who has upbraided Sancho for insisting Dorothea was not a princess ? uses ( 462 ) ? Sir knight , of the Sad Face. ? Shelton , it appears , convinced it no longer made sense to continue with the connotation ? ill-favoured ? in this situation , turned to ? sad , ? though , in truth , the knight was now plainly more furious than sad . The motto is used only twice more in Part I , but note its last form : the caged knight is called by both the barber ( 464 ) and the curate ( 471 ) the Knight of the Sad Countenance ! Inasmuch as the scene is a burlesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight is unhappy enough to be tagged ? sad. ? Without our turning to Part II , we see that the translator , writing in Cervantes 's time , has come a long way from ? Ill-favoured , ? and with seeming good reason . These changes may be coincidental , of course , but it is more probable that Shelton did truly sense , as the work progressed , a need to express and to use , on occasion , meanings other than the ? knight of the smashed-up face , ? which particular image , by the end of Part I , may even have been forgotten by the author himself . In considering usage of the motto in the first English translation of Part II , I interject parenthetically here that in a soon to be published article entitled ? The putative Shelton Don Quixote , Part II , 1620 , with Leonard Digges as the likely translator , ? I contend that Thomas Shelton did not translate Part II . This does not change the present discussion of the two earliest translated versions of the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translators are writing still during that period in which , according to Russell , everyone assumed Don Quixote was simply a funny book , and would not have thought of using ? triste ? as meaning unhappy or sad . It happens that in the putative Shelton Part II , the expression used <p> 228 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> continuously is the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance , the term ? sorrowful ? now implying one meaning only : that of sadness . To help confirm the accuracy of this connotation I call attention to the name frequently applied to Cardenio , the ? Knight of the Sorry Countenance , ? whose experiences in the woods gave him a wild appearance . ? Sorry ? in this case is truly meant to mean ? smashed-up , ? or better yet , ? scratched-up. ? In reference to Don Quixote ? sorrowful ? is meant to mean ? sad. ? ? Sorrowful ; ? unlike ? sad , ? can not be interpreted in any way other than ? full of sorrow. ? Since the translator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motto , ? Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance , ? remains unchanged , we can not ascertain how he came to use the term ? sorrowful. ? He may simply have followed Shelton 's example , or , indeed , he may have read the book carefully through to the end and noted on his own , despite that grand and gently humorous canopy of parody , that there are many instances of the knight 's showing sadness . In the end , according to the doctor who attends him , he dies of melancholy . This brief examination of Shelton 's and his successor 's versions of ? El Caballero de la Triste Figura ? invalidates Professor Russell 's declarations regarding this ? epithet. ? The 1612 Shelton and 1620 Anonymous English translations of this expression as noted above appear in five forms . Four of these are different from the first ( the one noted by Russell ) and imply ? sad ? more than they do ? smashed-up , ? and therefore do not support his contentions . The book certainly was considered funny , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed a measure of unhappiness by his translator-interpreters . Modern translators using the motto the ? Knight of the sad Countenance ? are no more ? linguistically anachronistic ? than Shelton was when he used the same phrase . Modern translators therefore can not be accused of perpetuating ? romantic ? attitudes by the use of the phrase , unless one is ready to admit that these same attitudes can be traced back two hundred years before the Romantics , to Shelton himself . It is interesting to note that after the episode of the Lions during which Don Quixote decides to call himself the ? Knight of the Lions , ? neither expression appears again to any extent . The duchess in her chat with Sancho ( II , 33 ) calls Don Quixote for the last time the ? Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance. ? Russell 's chief objection ? a well taken one , but again only up to a point ? is to those who seem unwilling to accept that Cervantes ' book is truly funny . These are , according to Russell , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to P. E. Russell <p> 229 <p> fail to read the text and thereby miss the point that Cervantes ' only intention was to satirize the novel of chivalry . ? It is a curious paradox of Romantic criticism , ? he chides in a catchy line , ? that , by turning away from the text Cervantes actually wrote towards the myth which has achieved a separate existence from the book , it seems to turn its back on the reality before its eyes in exactly the determined way the knight himself did ? ( p. 102 ) . I am sure this statement has sent many of the tainted ( or the anointed ? ) scurrying for cover . To admit the book is funny is one thing , but to deny the book is sad even at the end , as Russell apparently does , is another . Don Quixote 's sadness has been turned by Russell into an element crucial to the interpretation of the novel . It is , after all , from this sadness that the idea of an idealistic and symbolic figure develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their twentieth-century counterparts , the ? existentialists , ? so disparaged by the ? hard ? critics . Russell , in denying the existence of this sadness and so bolstering his thesis , is being equally stubborn , just as erroneous , and just as unwilling to ? face reality , ? perhaps , as those he accuses of not reading Cervantes ' text . Cervantes ' stated intentions are evident enough and not disputed here , but his descriptions of Don Quixote 's sadness , as we read the text , are another matter and a partial cause of the problem . Each time the knight is placed in a position to express his sadness , he is quickly countered by an equal amount of humor which neutralizes and obscures the sadness . Nevertheless , though it may be out of place in a work that is obviously a parody , the sadness is there , permeating the end . The closer we get to the end , the less Cervantes tries to hide it . Victor Hugo 's comments , mentioned by Russell himself as ? sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One might suspect the Spanish author of having attempted to mock ideals , but that was a defect more apparent than real . If one looked carefully it would be seen that the smile was accompanied by a tear ... ( 98 ) ? Hugo could be more right than wrong . I offer examples ( J. M. Cohen translation , The Penguin Classics , 1950 ) of what I mean by Cervantes ' countering Don Quixote 's sadness with humor . Don Quixote is run over by the bulls , II 58 ( funny ) ; he thinks of letting himself die of hunger ( sad ) ; Sancho counters with ? let Martha die , but with her belly full ( funny ) . ? Don Quixote is defeated , II 64 , on the beach at Barcelona ( sad ) ; Sancho thinks ? It would hardly be a pity if his Master 's madness had been knocked out of him ? ( funny ) ; they attempt to sleep ; Don Quixote , <p> 230 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> pining for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : ? With each line he sighed and shed some tears , groaning as if his heart were pierced through by grief at his overthrow and by his absence from Dulcinea. ? Obviously , the author here means for Don Quixote 's behavior to be very funny . Most readers do take it as such . However , Don Quixote , who is deliberately made to appear to be playing the fool , seems to other readers at this point to have reason to be truly grieving . Beneath the fools 's mantle these readers believe he has been forced to wear , he can be taken , now , to be truly sad . Then : Don Quixote lies dying ( sad ) . ? It was the doctor 's opinion he had not been in on the horse play that melancholy and despondency were bringing him Don Quixote to his end ( II , 74 , Cohen , p. 935 ) , ? confirmation by a ? neutral ? bystander , it certainly would seem , that the cause of the death of the would-be knight errant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mockery and the mainstay of Cervantes ' parody , is , as indicated , sadness . I shall not discuss here the enigma of Don Quixote 's recovery of his ? sanity ? and what would seem then to be an incongruous death , a death without real cause . Surely , if Don Quixote , having regained sanity , is to renounce the life he has attempted to lead in imitation of the books of chivalry , he must then ignore his defeat , deny his lady fair , Dulcinea , grieve and be sad no more , and live on to a ripe old age in his newly acquired wisdom . Cervantes ' ending is very perplexing , perhaps even contradictory , and it extends far beyond the limits of parody , that of the ? funny book ? Russell has wished to make of it . The ? Knight of the Sad Countenance , ? a phrase used by Thomas Shelton himself three hundred and eighty years ago , seems to be , in view of all the above , a more legitimate motto , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? than Professor Russell has been ready to admit . Don Quixote 's revealed sadness and suffering , separated from the juxtaposed humor ? detracting not a whit from that humor ? justifies the use of the motto . We may forget about a smashed jaw and missing teeth , easy enough to do with the slap-stick comedy at which Cervantes is delightfully adept , but it is more difficult to ignore or overlook those moments painful to the knight , shrouded in humor as they may be , which lend credibility to his sorrows . Cervantes , who tried , it seems , only half-heartedly to cover these with his gentle humor , may in this way have been revealing his sympathy for his mad knight . 
@@40786638 @786638/ <p> With the late-twentieth-century resurgence of Hindu nationalism , political Islam , Christian conservativism , and other assertively public religions , the question of the role of religion in the modern world has taken on a new and urgent intensity . Earlier , in the aftermath of the Second World War , it was a truism of social and political theory that the more a society becomes modern , the more its religious traditions decline or are , at the very least , privatized . Although a few old-guard theorists still cling to this latter idea , opinion in political and religious studies as a whole has shifted against this key premise of secularization theory . At the same time , although most scholars believe that the time is right for a new model of religion and modernity , there is as yet surprisingly little consensus on just what such a revisionist model might require . A distinguished professor of anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York , Talal Asad has in recent years been one of the most vocal and original of scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion and the modern . Asad 's role in this effort is all the more noteworthy inasmuch as the discipline of anthropology has been largely uninvolved in this discussion . The neglect reflects the fact that most anthropologists were never particularly impressed by secularization theories one way or another . In addition , until , roughly , the 1980s , most anthropologists were not interested in the equally expansive question of what it means for a society to be modern . In the 1980s and 1990s , however , the question of the modern moved to a position of central importance in anthropological theory . In part this was an effect of postmodernist debates . But it was also the result of far-reaching changes in the local communities anthropologists study . Despite the growing interest in questions of modernity , however , most anthropologists continued to show little interest in questions of secularity and secularization . As Asad notes , even today the main textbooks in the anthropology of religion make no reference to these issues ( p. 22 ) . Meanwhile , in other social sciences and humanities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic to the entire modern world , a condition unique to the West , or an ideological mythology that , even in the West , obscures the wellsprings of religiosity running through all societies . Asad 's Formation of the Secular does not attempt to take on these last issues directly , but instead places the question of religion and secularity at the center of a richly eclectic but deliberately unfinished anthropology of modernity . A mix of new chapters and essays originally written in the late 1990s , the book takes aim at these questions " indirectly " ( p. 67 ) , by way of epistemic reflections on the genealogy of " the secular " and " secularism . " As this latter phrasing hints , Asad 's approach owes as much to Foucauldian methodologies as it does anything specifically anthropological . In the volume 's introduction , Asad takes exception to colleagues who equate the anthropological method with " the pseudoscientific notion of ' fieldwork ' " ( p. 17 ) . It is not fieldwork that underlies the anthropological method , Asad counters , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of embedded concepts ( representations ) between societies differently located in time or space " ( p. 17 ) . He adds , " the important thing in this comparative analysis is not their origin ... , but the forms of life that articulate them , the powers they release or disable " ( p. 17 ) . Even this authorial aside fails to capture the peculiarities of Asad 's methodology . Whereas social anthropologists like Mary Douglas develop their comparisons of embedded concepts from the aggregate particularities of concrete interactions , Asad 's analytic begins with the macrosociology and epistemology he believes undergirds modern society and modern systems of knowledge . In his discussion of the secular , then , Asad is less concerned with concrete social particulars than he is with the general concatenations of capitalism , the nation state , and the " new concepts of ' religion , ' ' ethics , ' and ' politics ' " they have engendered ( p. 2 ) . The approach bears a stronger resemblance to the macro-civilizational analyses of Nietzsche , Weber , and , especially , Foucault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this broader concern with , so to speak , epistemic hegemonies that unites the volume 's eight chapters . The book opens with an overview of the category of the secular in Western social history , and then moves on to a longer and equally fascinating chapter on " What Might an Anthropology of Secularism Look Like ? " The next three chapters come at the issue of the secular more " indirectly " ( p. 67 ) , talking about agency and pain , cruelty and torture , and the epistemological assumptions of the " human " in human rights . The premise that links these essays is that Western discourses on these matters became possible only after the secularization of popular understandings of the body , the mind , and the relationship of individuals to abstract social imaginaries like " humanity . " This is an important point , one that Asad develops by way of a far-ranging survey of contemporary debates in moral philosophy , political theory , and the anthropology of subjectivity . In these and other chapters , Asad shows a preference for reading contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local social actors . When he does speak about actors-in-context , as in his discussion of Malcolm X 's views of human rights ( pp. 141-144 ) , the result is invariably original and convincing . Where the Olympian method becomes less bracing , however , is when it is used to explain the diffusion of concepts like democracy , human rights , and the secular across civlizational divides . When speaking about non-Western modernities , in particular , Asad places primary emphasis on the role of Western domination in globalizing new systems of knowledge and new social disciplines , including those of the marketplace , governance , and neo-secular understandings of " religion . " He writes : <p> " Assumptions about the integrated character of ' modernity ' are themselves part of practical and political reality . They direct the way in which people committed to it act in critical situations .... Modernity is a project--or rather , a series of interlinked projects--that certain people in power seek to achieve . The project aims at institutionalizing a number of ( sometimes conflicting , often evolving ) principles : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil equality , industry , consumerism , freedom of the market--and secularism. " ( p. 13 ) Of course there are powerful agencies in the West dedicated to the promotion of human rights and democracy in non-Western settings . However , to leave the matter there is to lose sight of some of the most far-reaching and grassroots changes taking place in our world . Whether among Mayan activists challenging ethnic exclusions in Guatemala , Indonesian Muslims promoting a civic-pluralist interpretation of Muslim politics , or Taiwanese women invoking their traditional role as custodians of the hearthhold to justify their participation in new forms of environmental activism , democratization is an emergent effect of varied influences , the most decisive of which are as much local as anything Western. 1 At several points in his analysis , Asad seems on the verge of acknowledging this fact . However , his genealogical method always pushes him back toward a culture-strong and actor-weak understanding of democratic culture and politics . The book 's last three chapters are the most comprehensively sociological , and provide the clearest statement of Asad 's own normative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a ' Religious Minority ' in Europe " explores the impact of the " grammar of a discourse " about " Europe " on mainstream European attitudes toward Muslims ( p. 161 ) . Although some readers may find Asad 's deconstruction of the " narrative of Europe " ironically homogenizing , its critique is no less unnerving . The next chapter , " Secularism , Nation-State , Religion , " makes a related and equally compelling argument about the way in which the modern public sphere in the West has , contrary to Habermasian idealizations , always been a space of social exclusions , in which those invited to speak may do so only inasmuch as they conform to certain liberal habits of knowledge and practice . The most critical of these requirements , Asad argues , has been that religion be either privatized or stripped of public political demands . As Asad shows in the book 's last chapter , a brilliant discussion of the " Reconfigurations of Law and Ethics in Colonial Egypt , " this latter requirement has posed especially vexing problems in the Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by secularizing governments " presupposes a very different conception of ethics from the one embedded in the classical shari'a " ( p. 209 ) . This last statement is consistent with much contemporary scholarship on shari'a politics , as is Asad 's observation that throughout the postcolonial Muslim world the shari'a has been transmuted into " a subdivision of legal norms ( fiqh ) that are authorized and maintained by the centralizing state " ( p. 227 ) . However , here , as in the previous two essays , Asad 's critique of the modern sequestering of the shari'a has an unexpected irony . He comments in passing that some modern Muslim writers " have claimed that secular life was always central to the past ... because religious law ( that is , the shari'a ) always occupied a restricted space in the governance of society " ( pp. 205-206 ) . But Asad never says whether this claim has any historic truth . More generally , the often problematic relationship of shari'a to other Islamic norms is noted in passing but not systematically engaged . Asad recognizes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems used in the administration of law in Egypt and other Muslim countries ( p. 210 ) . In a highly original rereading of Muhammad Abduh 's ideas , he also provides a provocative analysis of the way in which , contrary to many Orientalist readings , there is in mainstream Islamic tradition no binary opposition between Sufism and the shari'a . However , when discussing Muslim Egyptians ' reservations about reliance on shari'a-based codes as the foundation for the country 's modern legal system , Asad dismisses such opposition with the startling claim that it " represents an aspiration for a Westernized future rather than for a reformed continuity of the recent past " ( p. 215 ) . This observation flies in the face of the fact that pious believers like Abdulkarim Soroush of Iran and Nurcholish Madjid of Indonesia have concluded that the most compelling reason for a ( relative ) separation of political and religious authority is so as to protect the integrity of Islamic ideals from corrupt rulers and statist monopolies . This blind-spot is in turn related to what sociological readers of this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tendency to conflate secular differentiation with secularism as an " epistemic category " and " a political doctrine " ( p. 1 ) . As the recent controversy in France over the hijab sadly reminds us , there are fiercely secularist ideologies in the modern West , and the category of the secular is one to which many , although by no means all , modern Western political philosophers adhere . However , as Jos= Casanova has argued in his Public Religions in the Modern World ( 1994 ) , secularization theory was always concerned not just with the category of the secular or the political doctrine of secularism , but with the growing differentiation of roles , disciplines , and knowledge in society . This differentiation and its attendant tensions are by no means a uniquely modern phenomenon ; both were visible in the post-prophetic Muslim community . Moreover a recurring feature of Muslim civilizational history has been the tension between totalizing interpretations of the faith intent on controlling all aspects of social life and the demand--religious as well as secular--for an acceptance of differentiation , specialization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Law and Power in the Islamic World ( 2003 ) , the attempt to fuse religious and political authority into a monopolistic whole has provoked fierce resistance in Muslim societies , not because of secular ideologies , but because such efforts threaten the integrity of the law and the welfare of believers themselves . To the degree that a relative separation of religious and political authority has long existed in the Muslim world , then , it has done so in part because many believers are convinced that such a separation is demanded by the deepest Muslim ideals . Although he tends to downplay the Muslim world 's pluralism , Asad 's own political views embrace just such a pluralist vision . In an important conclusion to his essay on Muslims in Europe , Asad sets out the terms for what he calls a " decentered pluralism , " a notion he adapts from the political philosopher W. E. Connolly . Asad argues that Muslims in Europe will find little institutional representation as long as they are represented as a minority opposed to and presided over by a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decentered pluralism characterized by a " continuous readiness to deconstruct historical narratives " and to open up space for the full multiplicity of overlapping ( rather than opposed ) social identities ( p. 177 ) . This is an appealing formula , one consistent with an emerging body of deep-pluralist opinion in democratic theory . One problem Asad 's formulation leaves largely unresolved is that some authority figures , in both the ostensibly " mainstream " and " minority " communities , will oppose such a differentiating proposal because it challenges the elite 's in-group privileges . The violence of these controlling elites will in turn prompt some within the " minority " community to appeal for outside intervention , once again raising the question of how to balance citizen rights with decentered pluralities . A dark but brilliantly original work , Formations of the Secular is one of the most important books on religion and the modern in recent years . Some readers may wonder whether the genealogy of the secular developed in these chapters is too Olympian and discourse-centric for its own good . Not just an effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of pluralism and participation makes vernacularized ideals of citizenship meaningful to the most diverse social actors , including Muslims . Whatever one 's viewpoint on these matters , Asad 's book is a significant achievement . It provides a rich and troubling perspective on one of the central problems of our age : how to live together in a world in which religious difference has become , not a diminished , but a growing part of our public , plural lives .

Pirates plundered periodically throughout the ancient Aegean , but it was Roman jurisprudence that first characterized the watery brigands as hostes humani generis , enemies of all mankind , in a bid to protect a claim of imperial sovereignty upon the seas that linked their cross-continental empire . This legal designation , notably absent in the Hellenic era , was re-invoked two millennia later by the courts of the early modern mercantile empires for similar imperial objectives . As these latter-day maritime empires expanded beyond their familiar home waters , their desire to control the seas and the jurisdictional claims of sovereignty followed in the wakes of their carracks , caravels , fly-boats , and frigates .

Chapter 6 , revised from a previously published essay , engages the infamous women pirates , Anne Bonny and Mary Read , and is derived mostly from Captain Charles Johnson 's contemporary account . Chapter 7 describes the rhetorical , military , and legal campaign initiated by the ruling classes to " extirpate pirates out of the world , " and the final essay explores the symbolic origins of the Jolly Roger and " the interrelated themes of death , apocalypse , hell , and **29;29;TOOLONG matters of life and death and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seafaring people in the early eighteenth century " ( p. 153 ) . An epigrammatic conclusion ends the volume , leaving the reader somewhat dangling , like one of the many condemned pirates described in such fascinating detail throughout the preceding pages . <p> While endlessly engaging , there are some questionable aspects . The heroic stature granted these violent villains is somewhat disconcerting , as many pirates consistently engaged in the brutal torture of victims for sadistic purposes and the pursuit of personal wealth as much as for any alleged political agenda . Furthermore , while pirates undoubtedly came from all nations , the ones described herein are decidedly anglocentric , as are the majority of sources . In addition , the author 's reasonable contention that piracy made a major impact on the Atlantic trade is based mainly on anecdotal evidence and would greatly benefit from more detailed quantitative data compiled from a wider range of sources , especially Spanish , Dutch , French , and Portuguese archival materials . Finally , Rediker 's insistence that pirates " ruptured the Middle Passage " elides the more fundamentally complicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave trade ( p. 145 ) . <p> Careful periodization is the key to explaining these generational aspects of a long and complex history , and in the decade following the War of the Spanish Succession , when thousands of seamen and legally commissioned privateers suddenly found themselves unemployed , Rediker 's anti-authoritarian characterization of pirates is certainly well founded . The limited temporal scope , illuminating in its focus , at the same time obfuscates the more complex and often contradictory roles played by pirates and privateers--often one and the same--at the behest of merchants and colonial administrators throughout most of the early modern era . Indeed , the overall process of early European colonizing efforts , beginning with the induction by the Portuguese of the extortionate cartaze system in the Indian Ocean region , might properly be framed as state-sponsored piracy . In the Atlantic world , the conspicuous exploits of Drake , Raleigh , Cavendish , and Hawkins , as well as the abandoned privateer staging post at Roanoke , are only the most obvious evidence of this , while less notable but equally revealing markers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , the Scots effort in Darien , and the Puritan scheme of settling Old Providence Island near the Spanish Main . Throughout the seventeenth century , moreover , French , English , and Dutch buccaneers operated , with tacit support , if not official sponsorship , throughout the Caribbean basin , attacking Spanish ships and towns while selling their plunder in bustling pirate havens like Port Royal , Jamaica . As the lucrative sugar trade began to take hold , merchants and administrators became less tolerant toward the freebooters , and the buccaneers shifted their bases accordingly , forum-shopping for friendly ports along the North Atlantic seaboard and finding refuge in places like Charleston , New York , and Newport , while expanding their hunting grounds and networks to the South Sea and the rich trading world of the Indian Ocean region .

@@40786645 @786645/ <p> In the twenty-first century , as Americans learn each week about new developments for treating diseases , it is difficult to recall that only seventy years ago , most diseases and infections baffled the best researchers . Keith Wailoo 's insightful Dying in the City of the Blues uses sickle cell anemia to document the changes in our comprehension and treatment of disease from the early twentieth century to the present . Within the main theme of a disease 's shift from invisibility to visibility , Wailoo includes subthemes of the politicization of diseases , the changes in healthcare in the United States , and racism that frames understanding and treating African Americans . To Wailoo , understanding the cultural and social context of a disease is as important as uncovering its causes and treatment because it defines awareness , funding , and patient care . <p> Wailoo centers the story of sickle cell anemia in Memphis not only because Memphis included rural African Americans migrating from Mississippi , Missouri , Arkansas , and Tennessee , but also because Memphis became a center for health care by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderation for professional African Americans , by 1940 more black agricultural workers moved to Memphis as the boll weevil , agricultural mechanization , and lack of educational opportunities drove blacks , as well as many whites , to urban centers in the North and South . Their numbers in Memphis allowed them to occasionally manipulate Mayor E. H. Crump 's Democratic political machine to their benefit . Still , health care for African Americans remained poor and segregated . Aided by New Deal funds , philanthropy , and city bonds , John Gaston Hospital opened in the mid-1930s to provide health care for the poor . This facility and Memphis General provided researchers like Lemuel Diggs with cases that led them to understand the mechanism of what became known as sickle cell anemia . <p> Sickle cell anemia 's symptoms were known but obscured by attention given to other diseases . Most philanthropic funds and research investigated hookworms , pellagra , tuberculosis , and child mortality in the early decades of the twentieth century . As treatments were announced , reformers were convinced that the South 's problems were solved. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease control , most whites believed black infant mortality and illness were linked to ignorance and black 's biological inferiority . Awareness of sickle cell anemia was also concealed because of its similarity to malaria 's symptoms--the aches , chills , and pain . Yet public awareness of infant mortality in Memphis and other cities led to significant changes in healthcare . Federal and philanthropic funds made invisible diseases and mortality rates visible resulting in a " complex negotiation , a social , political , and intellectual process that can not be taken for granted " ( p. 82 ) . <p> Still , as Memphis healthcare benefited from funds to provide for better medical care , pathologist Lemuel Diggs 's findings on sickle cell anemia had different results . Diggs , trained in the emerging field of hematology , contended that the diagnosis of sickle cell required different blood tests that few local doctors knew . Most white researchers and the public , influenced by eugenics , regarded this rare blood disease as yet another indication of African-American inferiority. 2 Tainted by impure blood , blacks were assumed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditarily prone to disease " ( p. 79 ) . <p> Yet research , federal health studies , and an increasingly vocal civil rights movement during World War II combined to change health care and public perception of sickle cell anemia . Thanks to pressure from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , anthropologists , and liberal whites , the Red Cross stopped labeling blood according to race in 1942 . Blacks ' " Double-V " campaign marked their determination to equalize American society . <p> As African Americans demanded better healthcare after World War II , cases of malaria decreased in Memphis . Diggs 's studies on sickle cell anemia gained credibility because blacks continued to describe the same symptoms they had for decades . In yet another discovery , Linus Pauling 's research demonstrated that the disease existed within red blood cells at the molecular level . To Wailoo , " Pauling 's discovery immediately made sickle cell disease into a researcher 's cash crop " ( p. 115 ) . Like other diseases , sickle cell anemia 's enhanced visibility now made it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Memphis , where researchers like Diggs had gathered to study this blood disease , a sickle cell center at the University of Tennessee opened . Not only would the center devote its resources to studying the causes and cures for the disease , it also broke the Jim Crow barrier by admitting black patients . <p> As the 1960s civil rights movement increasingly focused on social , economic , and cultural inequalities between black and white Americans , sickle cell anemia was used to highlight neglect of African Americans and elicit sympathy for them . Now economic and social injustice , not genetics , became reasons for poor health . Magazines including Jet and Ebony and televisions and film stars like Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby publicized the plight of African Americans suffering from sickle-cell disease . Yet with publicity and increasing attention came other consequences . " What , " Wailoo asks , " was the relationship between the researcher 's curiosity about such diseases and the goal of improving the health of ' ordinary ' sick people ? " ( p. 155 ) The quest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Americans ' pain and psychological wounds from hundreds of years of racism . In the swirl of attention given to sickle cell anemia as a visible disease , less attention was given to the patients and their physical pain . <p> By the 1970s , research for cures of high-profile diseases became a high-stakes , competitive market for universities and institutions as the federal government and the National Institutes of Health offered grants . President Nixon 's allocation of federal funds included sickle cell anemia as well as his declaration of war on cancer . Universities with medical research centers fought for economic prizes . Diseases became politicized in yet a different way . Those that generated the most publicity received more funds . Politicians like Memphis Republican Congressman Dan Kuykendall promoted additional research in sickle cell anemia to appease his black constituency . On May 18 , 1972 , President Nixon signed the Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act , making the University of Tennessee one of ten federally funded clinics . <p> Americans became increasingly aware of the disease , but this awareness came with a price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated their history since slavery . Others argued that sickle cell anemia demonstrated the protective power of evolutionary biology because the sickle cell apparently evolved to guard Africans against malaria . More importantly , " even black Americans wondered why " this disease should be the focus of so much research when other health problems like hypertension " were even more important in black communities " ( p. 192 ) . Thus , " the story of sickle cell anemia was but one high-profile example among many of the ways in which patients ' advocates , physicians and researchers , and consumer groups organized specific disease campaigns , put diseases on stage , and shaped federal health policy " ( p. 195 ) . Here Wailoo succinctly states one of the central problems of modern medical research . The price of visibility means aggressive competition in the market for philanthropic and federal funds . Some diseases that gain public notoriety like sickle cell anemia win the cash prize ; others fall through the cracks . <p> One of Wailoo 's strengths in the book is how he contrasts Western medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In areas like Ghana , the disease had been known for centuries and named because of the chronic pain associated with it . While West African medicine focused on pain and the patient 's condition , Western medicine examined blood cells and molecules . Wailoo 's implication is clear . While Western medicine has accomplished much by searching for origins of diseases and their cures , the patient 's needs are neglected . <p> Dying in the City of Blues combines an extraordinary array of sources from blues lyrics to medical journals to politicians ' papers and more to illustrate the dilemmas of naming and publicizing diseases . As a disease becomes identified , lives may be saved or improved . Publicity and media reports garner resources for studies . Often , however , the process of discovery , naming , and defining a disease makes the illness a commodity . What is lost is the attention to patients and their welfare . The contemporary debate about prescription drugs and HMOs illustrates this problem and concludes the book 's focus on the politics of healthcare . <p> Wailoo provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective and purely empirical , remains bound by race , class , culture , and social boundaries . The more funds enter the research pot , the more some diseases gain . As some diseases gain celebrity status , they benefit from more research dollars . For example , funds for AIDS research are important , but more Americans die from heart disease and cancer . Even cancer research has its own politics . Breast and prostate cancer research are significant , but so are other cancers that have less visibility . <p> But Wailoo implies that the politics of healthcare is often driven solely by racism . Examples like the infamous Tuskegee Experiment with syphilis add to this , and no one could argue against his point that blacks lacked adequate healthcare before the 1960s . Yet so did many other Americans like poor white southerners , industrial workers in coal mines and textile mills , and women. 3 Many women recall the thalidomide controversy in the 1960s that led thousands to take a drug to prevent miscarriages that caused birth defects in their children . Only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's health problems may require different treatments from men 's . Racism existed across the nation when it came to healthcare . But the United States can scarcely claim a distinguished record when it comes to healthcare for the poor or many women . <p> Moreover , it is surprising that Wailoo neglected to interview some individuals with sickle cell anemia who were treated with various experimental drugs or were public images of the sickle cell patient like Marclan Walker or her family . Interviews may be criticized for relying on individual memory , but they often illuminate aspects of the story that personalize history . While Wailoo calls for more attention to patient 's needs , interviews would underscore this point . <p> Still , Wailoo 's book is an important contribution to our understanding of the politics of and cultural differences in healthcare . In the race for a cure , all too often the patient and the family are lost in a miasma of potential treatments that debilitate and rob patients of their quality of life .

@@40786646 @786646/ <p> fter defeating the Knight of Mirrors ( actually the Bachelor Sans=n Carrasco ) , Don Quijote puts the tip of his sword above his prostrate adversary 's face and orders him to confess that the knight he previously claimed to have defeated ? neither was nor could have been ? Don Quijote de la Mancha but was an illusion created by enchanters ( II , 14 ) 1 . Part of the irony of that incident lies in the fact that the character who pronounces those words , Alonso Quijano , ? neither is nor can be ? Don Quijote either . The character ? Don Quijote ? is precisely an illusion , and the ? enchanter ? who created him is Miguel de Cervantes , whose supreme feat of magic is that his illusory hidalgo seems to depart from the order of reality as we generally know it by actually being not just more interesting than people in real life but more significant for a new understanding of the real world . Even when what Don Quijote sees is obviously a figment of his imagination , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what is really there . At times Don Quijote defends his perceptions with a surprising earnestness and lucidity : he explains the existence of elements of the real world that are incompatible <p> 1 Passages from Don Quijote have been taken from the edition by Martfn de Riquer ; translations are mine . <p> 19 <p> 20 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> with his fantasies by claiming that they are illusions that enchanters have maliciously created in order to confuse people . Hence , for example , the windmills are not just giants but are giants cleverly made to look like windmills . Don Quijote rebels against such deceitful illusions , and he does so on the level of the very act of perception . When Don Quijote considers a barber 's basin to be the legendary Helmet of Mambrino in enchanted form , what he perceives is not a barber 's basin but a fabulous helmet that he has seized in battle and that is worthy of his own identity as a knight and champion of the tradition of high courage . So is an inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness of a steed , a flock of sheep an enemy army , a water mill a fortress , a rough peasant lass Dulcinea del Toboso , the Bachelor Sans=n Carrasco the Knight of Mirrors , etc . If they appear otherwise , Don Quijote thinks , it is because they are ? enchanted , ? i.e. , they have been transformed into deceitful sensory images . It is evident that Don Quijote 's tendency to see a world that is subject to being subverted by sinister forces , instead of a world of pre-given , neutral objectivity that is to be regarded with optimistic impartiality , is not due to a simple incapacity on his part , for Don Quijote is able to see what he alone sees and what others see as well . As a result , it becomes more difficult to dismiss his delusions as mere entertaining frivolity . Our attention naturally turns to the differences between Don Quijote 's perception of the world and that of everyone else in the novel , the differences between ? in Riley 's words ? poetic myth and historico-empirical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Quijote Cervantes explores the dual character of human nature and the ethical and aesthetic implications of the relationship between human being 's physiologically real and psychologically fantastic aspects . Per haps it is not too much to suggest that Cervantes introduced Don Quijote 's obsession with enchantment and the complex process whereby Don Quijote sees what is there yet what is not there to serve as a clue to how his novel can be seen to convey a meaning . The prominence of the enchantment motif alone ( it is the most frequent topic of discussion in the novel , being spoken of by Don Quijote and Sancho more than a hundred times Predmore 75 ) and the peculiarly esoteric manner in which Don Quijote regards empirical reality with suspicion because he considers ideal conceptions to be a basis for skepticism are themselves enough to imply that ideas on the subject of enchantment <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 21 <p> point to more than the fantastic and gratuitous delusions of a mind warped by romances of chivalry and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep thematic dimensions of the novel . Critics have long noted , like Riley , that enchantment itself is an important thematic motif in the Quijote , 2 <p> 2 Previous studies of enchantment in Don Quijote have not related it to theories of perception or knowledge nor attempted to interpret enchantment in broad , figurative terms as we do , by regarding it as a metaphor for epistemological realism . Actually , they have tended to be descriptions instead of interpretations . If Ortega y Gasset 's brief observations on windmills had touched on the subject of enchantment instead of being confined to illusion , they would be an exception in this regard . He sees Don Quijote 's ? abnormality ? to be the normal , human , cultural tendency to assign a sense to things regardless of their materiality ( pp. 143-44 ) . Castro does not explore the enchantment motif separately or analyze it in any detail . When he does refer to it , he sees it as a means Cervantes used to introduce the theme of the fallibility of the senses and the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as supporting the ambiguous and relativistic conception of truth that he considers fundamental to the novel as a whole ( pp. 83 , 390 ) . Spitzer , like Castro , sees enchantment as the condition for Don Quijote 's seeing things differently from others and , hence , as expressing the ? perspectivism ? advanced by Castro . He also sees Don Quijote 's tendency to substitute fantasies for a monotonous and limited reality as expressing a healthy and heroic , although unrealistic , rebellion against the established order ( pp. 306 , 292-93 ) . Navarro Gonzlez sees the concept of ? evil enchanters ? as functioning to allow quixotic belief to be sustained ( p. 278 ) . Likewise , Predmore characterizes enchantment in the Quijote as being the principle by which Don Quijote explains to himself the disturbing fact that people and things seem so often to be what they really are ; hence , it is a means of maintaining his illusions and of explaining that for which he has no explanation ( pp. 67-68 , 77 ) . Avalle-Arce , on the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's willfully created ideal vision of the world ( p. 374 ) . El Saffar regards enchantment as the means Don Quijote uses to protect what she terms his sanity as he becomes increasingly confused at his inability to rely on sense-perception and reason to explain the strange incidents that befall him ( p. 111 ) . Ihrie distinguishes between enchantment in Part I , where it expresses Don Quijote 's assurance that his mistaken sense perceptions are accurate , and Part II , where they are the means whereby he discounts accurate sense perceptions as being mistaken ( pp. 59-60 ) . Like Navarro-Gonzlez and Predmore , Mancing considers enchantment in the Quijote to be a way for Don Quijote to rationalize his defeats and thus to sustain his chivalric vision ( p. 46 ) . Williamson recognizes that Don Quijote 's madness does not involve a crude distortion of visual perception and sees his distortions ( presumably what Don Quijote would attribute to enchantment ) as ? a kind of perverse misreading of everyday situations caused by a desire to make them fit his chivalric obsession. ? Believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quijote seeks ? to identify the p. 22 romance potential concealed within the humdrum reality he is forced to live in so as to draw it out for others to see ? ( pp. 96-97 ) . Eisenberg notes that because of Don Quijote 's insistence that enchantment changes appearances , it is impossible to convince him that he is in error , just as it is impossible to determine whether what one sees is reality or the product of enchanters ' distortions ( pp. 171 , 173 ) . <p> 22 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> but studies of it have been mainly descriptive . The enchantment motif has not been the subject of serious analysis or interpretation on a philosophical plane , and the implications of exactly what Don Quijote himself thought about enchantment have been overlooked altogether . The usual interpretation of Don Quijote 's idea of enchantment is that its function is primarily practical : it is a means that Don Quijote uses both to render his world more fabulous , like the world of the chivalric romance , and to defend that fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems essentially accurate , but it would seem that the romances of chivalry provided no more to the enchantment motif than a point of departure . Richard Predmore , for example , has pointed out in his study on ? La funci=n del encantamiento en el mundo del Quijote ? ( 1955-56 ) that Cervantes 's use of enchantment in the novel is quite different from the part that it plays in the romances of chivalry . Not only is enchantment in the Quijote almost without exception the work of anonymous enchanters ( whereas enchanters are completely identified in the romances of chivalry ) , in the Quijote enchantment serves specifically to make it possible for characters ( Don Quijote and Sancho ) to maintain their illusions , to evade responsibility , and to provide explanations where rational explanations are lacking ( p. 77 ) . Predmore observes that for Don Quijote himself enchantment has the function of defending his illusions from the need to reconcile them with the real world and that they accomplish that end specifically by changing appearances ( pp. 66 , 77-78 ) . Perhaps criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchantment or to interpret enchantment in broad figurative terms ( even if it is sometimes interpreted thematically ) is another instance of what AmTrico Castro characterized in 1925 as criticism 's established tendency to take the view that Cervantes 's work is not problematic ( p. 15 ) . If a more ambitious study of enchantment in the Quijote were to prove revealing , it would certainly not be the first discovery of unexpected dimensions in <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 23 <p> what one critic has referred to as Don Quijote 's gigantesca locura ( gigantic madness ) .3 The bizarre , seemingly farcical character of Don Quijote 's behavior in relation to what he calls enchantment is certainly one of the most difficult features of that character to reconcile with an attempt to explain his thematic significance in serious terms . On the other hand , extravagant , quasi-grotesque motifs are not uncharacteristic of the manneristic literature of the High Renaissance . One thinks , for example , of the stark artificiality and archetypal , elegiac atmosphere of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? maverick ? intellectual , Neoplatonist influences . It is logical to associate the emergence of a doctrinaire subjective idealism in Renaissance literature with the vogue for Neoplatonism . Renaissance Neoplatonism is best known today as a somewhat localized if refreshing , secular moral idealism based on a spiritualized concept of sexual love . Actually , it was a source of a new , widespread independence of spirit and speculative rationalism , especially as it combined with nominalism and the voluntaristic teachings of St. Augustine . It was an entire metaphysical system , and it provided an alternative to the official , Aristotelian-scholastic tradition . What is often overlooked , however , is that whereas in the period prior to Renaissance humanistic learning a real knowledge of Aristotelian doctrines was restricted to members of the clergy , the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are a period of intense interest in Aristotle , many of whose works were becoming available in translation for the first time ( Bolgar 308-10 ) . Hence , there was also an interest in re-reading Aristotle and in establishing the points of contact between his teachings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La locura emblemtica en la segunda parte del Quijote , ? Cervantes and the Renaissance . Ed . Michael D. McGaha ( Easton , Pennsylvania : Juan de la Cuesta , 1980 ) , p. 106.4 See Kristeller , Studies , Chapter 4 , ? The Scholastic Background of Marsilio Ficino ? ( pp. 35-97 ) . Also , in Renaissance Thought Kristeller goes to considerable lengths to draw attention to modern scholarship 's fallacy of not recognizing the presence of a flourishing tradition of Aristotelianism throughout the Renaissance period ( pp. 33-47 , 50-57 , 61 , 114-16 ) , pointing out that Neoplatonism itself was a synthesis of Platonism , Aristotelianism , and stoicism ( p. 51 ) . He writes , ? We have learned through recent studies that the chief progress made during the latter fourteenth century in the fields of logic and natural philosophy was due to the Aristotelian , and more specifically , to the Occamist school at Paris and Oxford . During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , university instruction in the philosophical p. 24 disciplines continued everywhere to be based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy followed the Aristotelian tradition , used its terminology and method , discussed its problems , and composed commentaries and questions on Aristotle. ? Kristeller attributes the emphasis on the importance of Neoplatonism and the neglect of Aristotelianism to historians ' tendency to , like journalists , ? concentrate on news and to forget that there is a complex and broad situation which remained unaffected by the events of the moment ? ( p. 34 ) . In advancing the view that Platonist and Aristotelian influences coexist in Cervantes 's writing , we do not , however , wish to suggest that Renaissance humanists did not attack the Aristotelian-scholastic tradition . Many of them did ; on the other hand , Ficino did not ( see Kristeller , ? Florentine Platonism and Its Relations with Humanism and Scholasticism , ? referred to by him in The Philosophy of Marsilio Ficino , p. 14 ) , for Platonism and Aristotelianism coexist in his philosophy , as in Le=n Hebreo 's Dilogos de amor , ( see Kristeller The Philosophy of Marsilio Ficino 236 and Hebreo 314 ) . Also , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aquinas is incorrectly attributed to Aristotle . Hamlyn points out that in De anima the context of Aristotle 's discussion of sense-perception has been misinterpreted , since ( unlike that of Plato ) it is not epistemological but is intended to elucidate concepts of the philosophy of mind ( that the acquisition of intellectual knowledge , like sense-perception , is a process from potentiality to actuality : see Hamlyn 17-18 ) . Hamlyn 's observations would seem to provide additional evidence for the view that there is less of an antagonism between Plato and Aristotle on epistemological concerns than is commonly thought . <p> 24 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> thought bears evidence of widespread interest in Platonist and Aristotelian theories of knowledge and perception . That Cervantes was aware of those theories is generally accepted by Cervantes scholars , largely on the basis of a quotation from Book IV of La Galatea , where a character refers to ? that opinion of the one who said that the soul 's knowledge is the memory of what it already knows ? and ? the other , better opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tabula rasa ? ( ? el que dijo que el saber de nuestras almas era acordarse de lo que ya sabfan . . . el otro mejor parecer del que afirm= que nuestra alma era como una tabla rasa ? : p. 704 ) .5 A concept that was especially important to Platonism , with which it originated , but was also important to Aristotelianism is the concept that ideas do not exist only as mental constructs but that they have a real , though non-material , existence in the physical world . Ideas are what make sense objects ? real ? in the sense of intelligible , i.e. , objects of consciousness . In contrast to <p> 5 Some critics have felt that the preference expressed in this passage by the unnamed knight and friend of Darinto for the latter , Aristotelian theory over the Platonist theory can be identified with a preference on Cervantes 's part , but such a view is pure speculation . <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 25 <p> the modern , empiricist epistemological conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature viewed objectively as a causal mechanism , Plato and Aristotle both taught that knowledge requires transcending a mere awareness of sense-data , that to know is to have knowledge of ideas , or concepts , which are the intelligible forms of objects in the physical world . Whereas Plato maintained that there exists a separate , more truly real world of ideal , universal forms of which particular sense objects are imperfect reflections , Aristotle held that the objects of our senses have real , external , independent existence and that it is in knowing particular objects that we know the universal or ideal . The Aristotelian maintains that , in perceiving , the mind abstracts ideas from sense objects , in which they inhere . The Platonist sees ideas , or universals , as having an existence that is separate from particular objects , which are themselves instances of universal ideas : in perceiving the objects of the physical world the mind assigns ideas to them by subsuming sense impressions under concepts . Thus , for Plato the world that we know is a vast projection of universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to act on matter and organize a world in which our ideals and values are objectively real , but mind 's preeminence is secure because matter can not act upon mind or alter ideal being . The entire Platonist metaphysic can be seen as an elaborate means of emphasizing the creative and synthesizing capabilities of mind . Even in Aristotelianism the mind does not assume a passive role in the perception of objects but actively apprehends ideas or forms that are present in objects . However , what needs to be emphasized for purposes of the present study is that in both Plato and Aristotle knowledge depends on the conceptual activity of the mind and that in the Platonist theory of knowledge the mind not only assumes an active role but a creative role : by means of what Plato calls ? memory ? it supplies the concepts or memory-images that make sense objects intelligible ( Hamlyn 16 ) . We wish to suggest that Cervantes elaborated the enchantment motif in the Quijote in such a way as to make Don Quijote incarnate the Platonist concept of mind exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrates that creative process by first setting up in Don Quijote 's behavior the Neoplatonist , activist model of perception as an assigning of meaning on the basis of sense impressions . Cervantes then has Don Quijote greatly exaggerate the free activity whereby mind assigns to <p> 26 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> an object a concept that has ordinary descriptive reference by having Don Quijote first assign and then ( applying an Aristotelian principle ) abolish such a descriptive concept on the grounds that it is an illusion and finally proceed beyond the empirical realm altogether and , by projecting ideal values , replace the descriptive concept with another one , one that endows the object with mythopoeic significance . The process is rendered in vivid , dramatic terms by Don Quijote 's having the idea that sense impressions ( created by ? enchanters ? ) are deceitful illusions , or ? phantasms ? ? an idea taken from Aristotelian-Thomist epistemology . When the eccentric hidalgo claims , for example , that the barber 's basin he sees is the Helmet of Mambrino made by evil enchanters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing out to us the fundamental , dissenting , ? nonobservant ? aspect of the process whereby the creative mind , willfully turning its back on the ordinary descriptive concepts with which we refer to objects , creates a metaphorical language that gives them new meaning and that posits new , more valuable ways of looking at the world . The broadly comical incongruity of seeing an ordinary barber 's basin as a legendary helmet is a subtle means of acknowledging metaphor 's characteristic ? tension between semantic congruence and incongruence ? ( Ricoeur 146 ) and underscoring the ? deviant ? character of metaphorical language and of the creative faculty in general . The creative process as it is characterized by Cervantes is very similar to Gadamer 's idea of ? concept formation ? ( Weinsheimer 237-40 , Ricoeur 147 ) , referred to by Ricoeur in relation to his theory concerning the role of imagination in the creation of metaphor , which we shall discuss below . Don Quijote , himself an idea made real and a novel , highly suggestive metaphor , is , in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast in psychological terms . <p> * <p> * <p> * <p> When considered in the light of the Neoplatonist theory of knowledge , certain of Don Quijote 's attitudes vis-a-vis enchantment appear less paradoxical . In the Neoplatonist view , the ideal world of eternal essences , forms , or ? Ideas ? ? the intelligible world ? is concealed by the empirical world of appearances and change , the phenomenal world that can be known by the senses . Speaking to Sancho in the Sierra Morena mountains , Don Quijote <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 27 <p> says , ? There is a throng of enchanters always among us who change and switch everything and alter it according to their pleasure ? ( ? andan entre nosotros siempre una caterva de encantadores que todas nuestras cosas mudan y truecan , y las vuelven segn su gusto ? : I , 25 ) . In a world in which sense impressions are misleading , what , one may ask , could be the basis of certainty ? The answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quijote has ordered to declare that Dulcinea del Toboso , Empress of La Mancha , is the most beautiful maiden in the world protest that they can not pay homage to someone whom they have never seen , and Don Quijote says that if they saw her their confession would have no value : ? the essence of the matter is for you to believe , confess , affirm , swear , and maintain it without seeing her ? ( ? la importancia est en que sin verla lo habTis de creer , confesar , afirmar , jurar y defender ? : I , 4 ) . For Don Quijote what is real is what is true , but ? truth ? is not empirical knowledge , nor is it merely based on a non-rational fideism ; it is cognizance of the real value of a suprasensible ideal . He tells Sancho , ? For me it is sufficient to think and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is beautiful and chaste ? ( ? bstame a mf pensar y creer que la buena de Aldonza Lorenzo es hermosa y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the mere fantasy of a wish-fulfillment dream ? it is a function of an epistemological and ethical freedom from the claims of the sensuous or material , a matter of axiological priority . One could wonder whether Don Quijote 's censuring of empirical reality by claiming that it is mendacious and instead asserting the truth of the books of chivalry is not Cervantes 's way of parodically inverting the humanists ' practicalist intolerance of the books of chivalry on the grounds that they were ? mentirosos. ? 6 Following the Platonist model , Don Quijote draws from memory the ideas , or memory-images , with which he supplants ordinary descriptive concepts , memory here being the fund of images that Don Quijote has gathered from the romances of chivalry . Nor can material being alter Don Quijote 's fantasies , which ? seen in the Platonist perspective ? belong to the impervious order of ideal being . <p> The mechanism whereby Don Quijote misconstrues the contents of the physical world is not triggered by faulty sense perception but rather is conditioned by the combative aspirations of <p> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chivalry , as well as his discussion on pp. 13-27 . <p> 28 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> his moral will . He sees his mythical world as being under assault by forces that would debase it and trivialize it by imposing the banality of a literal empiricism conditioned purely by sense impressions , factuality , and practical interests . In Don Quijote 's view , sense impressions are something to be risen above ; they are not , we repeat , phenomena to which he is blind . When Sancho will not agree with his claim that he has been placed in a cage by enchanters , Don Quijote tells him confidently ( as though he were addressing superficial readers of the novel ) , ? You , Sancho , will see how you are mistaken in your understanding of my misfortune ? ( ? T , Sancho , vers c=mo te engaas en el conocimiento de mi desgracia ? : I , 48 ) . He does not deny that he sees himself in a cage . He says , ? I see myself caged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 48 ) . What he denies is that he must willingly accept the dictates of sense knowledge and be reconciled to them . He denies that the empirical fact should take precedence over a moral priority and that the mind 's capacity to project a different reality must be subordinated to natural necessity , a claim which he considers false and misleading , a malicious fabrication intended to confuse the moral sense by placing it under a spell . He says , <p> I know and am persuaded that I am enchanted , and that is sufficient for the safety of my conscience ; for I would be greatly burdened if I thought that I was not under a spell and allowed myself to be in this cage lazy and like a coward , defrauding those who are distressed and in need of the help I could give them ? ( ? yo sT y tengo para mf que voy encantado y esto me basta para la seguridad de mi conciencia ; que la formarfa muy grande si yo pensase que no estaba encantado y me dejase estar en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podrfa dar a muchos menesterosos y necesitados de mi ayuda : II , 49 ) . <p> In implying the existence of an antithetical relationship between the moral will and empirical fact , Don Quijote 's incongruous attitudes hint at the author 's suggestion that , in general , the enthusiasm and integrity of subjective motivation can depend , to some extent , on an artificial and even self-conscious denial of outward reality . Except towards the end of the novel , Don Quijote is invulnerable to depression because he refuses to take seriously those threats that a less heroic cast of mind might find intimidating . He is grandiose in his projections but modest in what he actually requires to satisfy his demands of life . The reason <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 29 <p> is that his truth is conative , based on the strivings of the will , and hence independent of the actual realization of values.7 The reality that Don Quijote opposes , that he sees as being perpetrated against him by his enemies the enchanters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a commonplace natural necessity that , when asserted in absolute terms , would obviate moral strivings by rendering them not just inviable but meaningless . As AmTrico Castro has pointed out , the Neoplatonist theory of perception was skeptical , rationalistic , relativistic , and antidogmatic ( pp. 82-90 ) in , we might add , much the same way that ? poststructuralist ? theories are today . Castro held that in writing the Quijote Cervantes was reacting against an authoritarian dogmatism that was based on the scholastic-empiricist claim that sense-perception plays a necessary role in providing us with reliable knowledge . In contrast , Castro maintained , Cervantes 's novel offers an innovative , prismatic vision of life 's complexity , of a world where reality is unstable and wavering and is full of uncertainties , deceitful appearances , and problematic differences of opinion and in which knowledge is relative , differing according to the point of view of the individual observer . Castro believed that for all his geniality , the stability of his moral vision , and notwithstanding the restrained character of his skepticism , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relativistic , and ambiguous . Not only is a basin a helmet , it is also a basin-helmet ( pp. 75-122 ) . Spitzer characterized what Castro called ? relativism ? as ? perspectivism. ? The Neoplatonism that these critics have perceived as underlying Cervantes 's outlook is not moral idealism but the speculative and critical rationalism of Neoplatonist epistemology . We wish to suggest that within that same , general Neoplatonist framework , Cervantes developed the enchantment motif originally furnished to him by the novels of chivalry and that he did so as a moral idealist as well . As we shall see , Cervantes added to his synthesis the concept of the phantasma , which comes from the Aristotelian theory of perception ? a concept that today we know as the principle of **31;60;TOOLONG reduction set forth by Husserl . Husserl intended that principle to be a means of suspending our ordinary awareness of objects in order to make <p> 7 On moral value-being 's independence of realizability in a volitional act , see Scheler 348-50 . <p> 30 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> possible a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fictional vehicle of the Neoplatonist theory of perception and introducing the Aristotelian-Thomist principle that sense-impressions , or phantasmata , are dream images , delusions , Cervantes elaborates the enchantment motif on a scale that leaves the materials he received from the novels of chivalry far behind . Indeed , it is hard to see how Cervantes could have relied on the romances of chivalry alone for the idea of an appearance that is illusory because of its limiting , material particularity and for the idea of rendering such an appearance significant , as Don Quijote does , by abstracting it from the conditions of concrete individuality and altering it in order to apprehend it in terms of a broader , more universal frame of reference . Plato had held that knowledge is always of the self-subsistent universal ; all we ever really know about the sensible world is our idea of it through judgement by the mind , since reality consists of mind , not matter . It was Aristotle who , in De anima , originally posited the view that sense-knowledge and intellectual knowledge are essentially distinct : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the latter has for its object the essence of material things . Intellect depends on sense-perception because forms have a being only in things . Hence , intellectual knowledge follows upon sensation . The active intellect makes sense representation , or ? phantasma , ? capable of being known in a universal , intellectual likeness through a process of abstraction ( De anima 431a-432a , pp. 139-45 ) . Thomas Aquinas also distinguished between a ) appearance , or ? phantasm , ? the sensory image that results from the body-sense experience of a material thing yet without our awareness of such a sensation ( i.e. without intelligibility , understanding ) ; b ) ? material intelligence , ? or sensing such an image only in its particularity , i.e. , passively and knowingly experiencing only the sensation of the individual image ; and c ) active apprehension of things in their universal aspects : ? dematerializing ? a thing so as to see beyond its particularity and understand it conceptually , spiritually ( Summa Theologica , Question 79 , articles 2-3 , pp. 149-57 ) .8 <p> 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neoplatonist theories of Bembo , Erasmus , and Castiglione ( pp. 85-90 ) . What evidence is there that Cervantes was familiar with Aristotelian-Thomist epistemological theories distinguishing between sense-experience and intelligibility and could have had them in mind when he elaborated Don Quijote 's ideas on the subject of enchantment ? In general , the premises of the p. 31 present study are consistent with Forcione 's thesis that through the figure of Don Quijote ( his ideas and actions ) , Cervantes sought ? the liberation of art from the mimetic theories that dominated the mainstream of literary theorizing of the sixteenth century ? ( p. 121 ) and that were based on a misreading of Aristotle 's Poetics ( pp. 45-48 , 346 ) . In the Poetics Aristotle distinguishes between a historical and factual truth ( the proper subject of historiography ) and an ideal , aesthetic truth ( the proper subject of poetry ) . Thus , even if Cervantes had not had access to the details of Aristotle 's ideas on epistemology , the concept of a creative mental activity that is independent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it is more than likely that Cervantes was well aware of the theories of perception of Aristotle and Aquinas . Whereas AmTrico Castro , for example , felt the need to document probable traces and definite evidence of Neoplatonic thought in Cervantes 's writings , in Renaissance Spain ? la filosoffa aristotTlica predomina ampliamente sobre la plat=nica ? ? ( ? Aristotelian philosophy predominates widely over Platonic philosophy ? : Fraile I , 231 ) . Aristotelianism was the official philosophy in sixteenth-century Spain ( Abelln 173 ) . It would have been difficult for Cervantes not to know about such theories , even if his knowledge came more from conversations than from reading . There can be no doubt that he was interested in the subject . Yet his knowledge may well have come from reading as well . There is a reference in the Quijote ( I , 47 ) to the Smulas by Gaspar Cardillo de Villapando , an important textbook in Spanish universities . The ? Smulas ? is not a discussion of De anima but a presentation of Aristotle 's theories in logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristotle 's De anima entitled Apologia Aristotelica adversus eos , qui aiunt sensisee animam cum corpore extingui published in Alcal in 1560 and in 1569 ( Solana 112-16 , Dfaz-Dfaz 146-47 , Abelln 176-79 ) . Yet the most famous commentator on Aristotle 's De anima was Pedro Martfnez Brea , who published his In libros tres Aristotelis De anima Commentarii in Signenza in 1575 . Let us recall that Castro ( p. 106 ) believes Cervantes to have had a good command of Latin . Martfnez de Brea ? seala las diferencias entre el apetito sensitivo , que s=lo atiende al tiempo presente , y otro intelectivo que atiende al presente , pasado y futuro ? ( ? points out the differences between the sensory inclination , which only notices the present , and the other , intellective inclination , which notices present , past and future ? : Abelln 179-80 ) . Even if Cervantes had not read or heard of the epistemological theories attributed directly to works by Aristotle , he was sure to have heard about or read Thomas Aquinas 's important elaboration . The sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Italy . The principal faculty positions in theology were reserved by universities ( even in Alcal de Henares ) for the teaching of Thomist doctrine . As Bell observes , at the time ? those obstinate questionings of sense and outward things were in the air of Europe ? ( p. 118 ) . Cervantes did not use philosophical terminology or explicitly broach the issues p. 32 discussed in this study : he used the language of fiction . As AmTrico Castro notes , ? Cervantes was not a philosopher , but dramatized in his works , especially in the Quijote , one of the central problems that caused unrest in modern thought in the dawn of the formation of the great systems ? ( p. 89 , my translation ) . With a perspective different from our own , Robert Felkel has published an interesting article in which he argues that Don Quijote 's ? madness ? is a paradigm of intellection 's failure due to deficiencies in sensory perception and the associated processes as they are described in Aristotelian-Thomist theories of perception ( ? Arist=teles , Santo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 31 <p> Thus , in Platonic and Aristotelian-Thomist epistemology , as for Don Quijote , immediately-given reality-phenomena , empirical reality as such , can not be the object of actual knowing . Aristotle and Aquinas held such phenomena to be given as <p> 32 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> meaningless appearances , or phantasms ( phantasmata ) , which must be rendered intelligible by the activity of the mind . If one sees Cervantes as having drawn on principles of Platonist , Aristotelian , and Thomist epistemology for the way he conceives details of Don Quijote 's actions and ideas in relation to enchantment , Cervantes 's specific adaptation of those theories would seem to have taken him well beyond the simple scheme of psychology based on bodily humors in Huarte de San Juan 's Examen de ingenios . Cervantes first devised a psychology corresponding to the concept of a knowledge of Forms that is actually antithetical to an empirical factualism and then broadened the scope of intelligibility to draw on ethically-charged poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic and ethical modes of apprehension as well.9 He then personified sense-impressions as malicious enchanters whose spells or ? enchantment ? ? manifested as a superstitious respect for empirical truth-claims ( a full endorsement of epistemological realism ) ? enslave their victims and make them believe in sensory images , in ? phantasms. ? Don Quijote sallies forth into the world of fiction as the iconoclast of **27;93;TOOLONG , empirical truth-claims to whose categorical ? malice ? eventually he himself heroically succumbs . Of course , whatever ? malicious ? distortions of reality Don Quijote imagines himself to experience he sees as being presented to him as illusions , so the reader may choose to remain on a literal level and dismiss them as meaningless fantasy . As Don Quijote himself states after wrecking the puppet show of Maese Pedro ( actually the fugitive GinTs de Pasamonte in disguise ) , ? These enchanters who pursue me merely place figures as they are before my eyes , and then they turn them into what they want them to be ? ( ? estos encantadores que me persiguen <p> 9 For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of how there is a series of aesthetic qualities that are bound to the ethical conduct of persons and are conditioned by it , see Hartmann 2 , 403-405 . <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 33 <p> no hacen sino ponerme las figuras como ellas son delante de los ojos , y luego me las mudan y truecan en las que ellos quieren ? : II , 26 , my emphasis ) . In Don Quijote 's view , the realities that he has perceived have been transformed into illusions , into elements of the mundane reality that everyone else sees . What can be seen to start out as a humorous probing of ? the way in which desire can loosen a person 's grasp on reality ? and then becomes a contest between an aesthetics based on empirical reality and an aesthetics that is based on illusion and validates the free play of the imagination ( Forcione 341 , 339-48 ) , assumes , for the non-literal-minded reader , the broad , allegorical dimensions of an epic struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist upon the validity of its claims and the right of a factual truth to repudiate those claims once and for all as idle fantasy . That same opposition shifts to the arena of reader response , as the reader is faced with a decision as to how to interpret the novel . The objects that Don Quijote substitutes for ordinary elements of everyday life are always values that he must struggle for or disvalues that he must struggle against . He considers to be in a state of ? enchantment ? and deceitful appearance that which has a finite utility value that is , relatively speaking , merely ? materially intelligible ? and has no bearing on moral aspirations . As a proponent of knightly heroism , Don Quijote is primarily concerned with the ethical struggle and character-values . For him empirical facts alone lack ? reality ? because they lack moral significance , a perspective , as we have seen , that is reminiscent of the Platonic distrust of sensory perceptions and of the Aristotelian-Thomist depreciation of sensory , ? material intelligence ? as the passive experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its inability to refer to anything beyond itself . Cervantes 's debt for Don Quijote 's belief that it is the ideal alone that is real would , we repeat , be to Plato , for whom the forms of things in the physical world subsist non-materially as expressions of a noumenal or intelligible world . Don Quijote ? artificially ? transforms ? material knowledge , ? expels the iconoclastic phantoms of a literal factuality , and liberates meaning by transforming objects , ? remaking reality ? in conformity to what he perceives to be the claims and predicative demands of universal moral interests . He ? connects the aesthetic vision with the seriousness of the ethical struggle ? ( Hartmann 2 , 328 ) by dematerializing things , suspending their posited reality , <p> 34 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> conferring upon them a poetically transcendent universality , and making them intelligible ? not only cognitively and passively , but with a new ethical impress , as factors in the creation of values . It is often impossible to know what conscious motives prompted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Don Quijote 's peculiar psychology on the subject of enchantment Cervantes may well have intended to encapsulate some of his own views on the nature of artistic creation . If Don Quijote 's idea of enchantment is emblematic of some of Cervantes 's ideas concerning art , the possible connection of the enchantment motif to the theories discussed would support the view developed by Castro , Forcione and others , that Cervantes regarded poetic art largely as a mode of apprehension and would suggest that he viewed aesthetics not merely as a science of forms but as a cognitive and epistemological domain as well . <p> * <p> * <p> * <p> One sign that philosophical inquiries into the essential nature of artistic creation are , in our own day , acknowledging the importance of epistemological issues is that some recent theories concerning the cognitive , semantic value of metaphor ( the central poetic figure ) address points similar to those discussed here . The most paradoxical element in Don Quijote 's concept of the way enchantment works is his self-conscious acceptance of the truth-value of perceptions that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be summed up in the words with which he tells Sancho quite candidly that the way he sees Dulcinea is the way he imagines her , whether it is the truth or not : <p> Don Quijote simply denies what is in his factual experience and replaces it with a cherished vision . As a guide to making decisions in everyday life , such a modus operandi must be impractical to say the least , as Don Quijote discovers . However , the mental <p> 12.1 ( 1992 ) <p> Implications in Quijote 's Idea of Enchantment <p> 35 <p> process that Paul Ricoeur considers to lie at the center of the poetic imagination is remarkably similar . Ricoeur 's theory incorporates Husserl 's principle of the phenomenological suspension of presuppositions about the nature of experience and what is distinctly reminiscent of Coleridge 's view that imaginative synthesis is preceded by a stage at which the fixed , definite character of images is dissolved . For Ricoeur imagination begins with the subject 's turning his back , as it were , on conventional modes of thought ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , ? for ? to imagine is to make oneself absent to the whole of the world ? ( p. 152 ) . Metaphor , specifically , is ? a deviant predication , ? a ? semantic impertinence ? ( p. 143 ) . Once imagination has succeeded in suspending the direct reference of thought and emotion to the objects of our ordinary discourse and the literal emotions of everyday life ( vs. poetic emotions ) , it performs its next task , that of applying synthetic insight to the projection of new possibilities of redescribing the world . ? Image as absence is the negative side of image as fiction , ? and symbolic systems have the power to remake reality ( pp. 155 , 152 , 145 ) . The question of whether it is possible to alter reality to some degree ? or even fundamentally , or if it is possible to create new reality ? by altering the way in which it is perceived ( the supposition that was so powerfully censured by Marx and Engels in their critique of Feuerbach ( German Ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picaresque , and what Lukcs refers to as ? realism , ? which is actually just more romantic than naturalism ) ? this question is what is ultimately at issue in Cervantes 's complex presentation of the way Don Quijote conceives of enchantment . As Mark Johnson notes of Ricoeur 's emphasis on the imagination 's role in the creation of meaning ( imagination 's semantic feature ) , <p> The underlying issue is whether ? reality ? is objectively given , so that , as knowers , we can only stand apart and comment on it , or whether we have a ? world ? only by virtue of having a language and system of value-laden concepts that make experience possible for us . This , as Ricoeur and many others note , is not a question limited to metaphor ? it is a fundamental ontological and epistemological issue ( p. 41 ) . <p> Johnson is aware that the way one judges the value of symbolic images ( and their associated emotions ) for making truth-claims will depend on the concept one has of truth : is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would exist even if <p> 36 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> there were no minds to be aware of it , or is ? truth ? the linguistic manifestation of cognitive processes that are experienced as we encounter our world ? not passively , but by means of projective acts influenced by our interests , purposes , values , beliefs , and language ? ? ( Johnson 41 ) Clearly the latter alternative , which is the nominalist view ? i.e. , that our means of formulating truths are mere names or vocal utterances without any corresponding realities ? assigns much greater scope and value to the free human will and creative imagination , which explains the prestige that theory enjoyed in Cervantes 's day as an element in the philosophy of nominalism . Nominalism differed from Thomism in being voluntaristic in the tradition of Augustinianism . In positing what today seems a distinctly ? Fichtean ? concept of subjective idealism emerging from the moral will , Cervantes was undoubtedly influenced by the nominalists , whose teachings were very much in vogue in sixteenth-century Spain . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought probably explains a good deal of the widespread interest in , for example , Derrida 's denial that subjective conceptions can define anything that has independent , real existence outside the mind and in the structuralist claim that social and cultural phenomena , like literary works , are semiotic systems whose elementary units are not objective facts but conventional relational elements , arbitrary signs.10 As Genette has observed , ? structuralism is not only a method ; it is also what Ernst Cassirer calls a ? general tendency <p> 10 In the concluding observations of his book The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas , Umberto Eco points out , in general terms , some of the connections between scholasticism and structuralism . Among his comments are the following : ? In fact the claim of Scholastic thought is that it does resolve the real into explanatory models ? except that these models are believed to be features of reality , not just constructs of the intellect . Still , in medieval disputes about universals , the opposition between nominalism and conceptualism was expressed in terms similar to those used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Structuralism would persevere to the end in denying an ontological significance to their epistemological models . At all events , both the Scholastics and the Structuralists engage in inquiries based upon the notion of universals . . . . It is not by chance that one of the most important issues in contemporary Structuralism is the investigation of linguistic universals . It matters little that these are universals of human psychology and are therefore brain structures , not Platonic universals . More important is the final outcome of this debate , namely the reaffirmation of an atemporality in the structures of the mind . . . ? ( pp. 217-18 ) .

Following the Neoplatonist teachings of Augustine , the emphasis on the superiority of the will over the intellect was powerfully reasserted in Europe by the nominalists . Nominalism emerged in the fourteenth century as a challenge to the dogmatic authority of philosophical ( ontological ) realism . It received a new impetus from the influence of Reform piety and entered Spain as a progressive force with the founding of the Universidad de Alcal de Henares in the early sixteenth century . As it developed , nominalism itself contributed to the forging of dogma , viz. , the doctrine of merit.11 Some critics in our own day would seem to consider the influence of linguistics in contemporary literary criticism to have followed a course that is comparable to the influence of nominalism . Emphasis on the view that truth is a function of language is seen as having fostered the attitude that the subject of language can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ? is never more than a linguistic formulation and a function of language 's inherent formal conventions : what Frederic Jameson has termed ? the prisonhouse of language ? and Terry Eagleton calls ? the poststructuralist dogma that we are prisoners of our own discourse ? ( Jameson passim and Eagleton 144 ) . For his part , Don Quijote , who has an unmistakable tendency to equate truth and language ( especially the language of fictional discourse ) , establishes himself from the outset as an opponent of literal , uninspired truth-claims and drab objectivity . He consciously defies the existence of a self-evident factuality . Cervantes the romanticist author ( he is a ? realist ? as well ) can be said to do likewise ; however , unlike Cervantes 's , Don Quijote 's heightened vision is categorical .

In a way , what Don Quijote claims is obviously ridiculous , but only if one tries to apply to him the standards of conventional modes of thought and refuses to accept the poetic imagination 's ? semantic impertinence , ? its deviant withdrawal from the objects of our ordinary discourse , for what it is .

When we laugh at Don Quijote 's delusions and , in our literal-mindedness , dismiss his behavior as mere folly , we commit the same error , which is also the error that structuralism and poststructuralism have objected to and , some would claim , sometimes even exemplified , viz. , thought 's formalistic tendency to carve out its own self-complacent niche in the intellectual environment , grow one-sided , and effect a quasi-mystical retreat from life 's complexity in the process .

Don Quijote 's lengthy disquisitions on the subject of knight-errantry , as he entrenches himself deeper and deeper in his signifying system , are , in addition to his visual fantasies , a noteworthy example .

Don Quijote 's compulsive cataloguing of ? facts ? that he has taken from the romances of chivalry tempts the reader to speculate that the derivation of poetic symbolism does not always entail the process that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an idea and then , as Goethe held ( Maxims No. 1113 , p. 693 ) , 12 into a suggestive image , but that it can also start with a metaphysics in the form of images and affects , or quasi-rational presuppositions born more of a suspension of reference to objective reality than of an impartial observation of it , and that it can then transfer those images into the form of a pseudo-non-fictional , rationalistic discourse that is simply a displaced form of fiction . If fiction can have an axiological basis , then it must be possible for positive thought to have a fictional basis as well ? at least , as Greimas maintains , in the human and social sciences.13 It was most likely Freud 's sensitivity to the inescapable importance of a conceptual framework with formal characteristics in organizing the immediate sensations of experience that prompted him to describe his own work as ? metapsychology. ? 14 An additional area , then , that the Quijote can be seen to address indirectly and somewhat ironically in association with the enchantment motif and that Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ los perros ? is the issue of the extent to which the literary dialogue , with its conventional claim to being universally edifying , has a didactic value that is necessarily relative to the frame of reference of its ( fictional ) speakers.15 Such a theme is , of course , not without broad implications . We are very <p> 12 Also see Adams 57.13 This principle is the basis of Greimas 's Narrative Semiotics and Cognitive Discourses , which analyzes the ? resemblances between the more or less abstract organization of discourse that claims to be scientific and the figurative forms of the narrative discourses of literature and myth ? ( p. 57 ) .14 See note 15 . Also , in regard to Freud , in his letter to Albert Einstein published under the title ? Why War ? ? Freud writes , ? It may perhaps seem to you as though our theories are a kind of mythology and , in the present case , not even an agreeable one . But does not every science come in the end to a kind of mythology like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Physics ? ? ( Freud 22 , 211 ) .15 Northrop Frye discusses the importance of a conceptual framework in science and of symposium and dialogue in Renaissance art in Anatomy 15 and 59 . <p> 40 <p> BRYANT L. CREEL <p> Cervantes <p> likely still discovering the extent to which our world and our relation to it would be unimaginable for us were they not organized in some sort of fictional framework . From this point of view a fundamental trait that fiction and real life could be seen to have in common is that the individuals who populate both can be thought of as metaphors in a vast creative fabric , and largely self-conceived metaphors at that . Thus regarded , poetic imagination assumes the character of a moral adventure , one that demands the exercise of free will and that is also not without risk . As Lessing observed , a heretic is a person who sees with his own eyes . One reason that the character Don Quijote has such rich metaphorical value is that he can be seen as both exercising a vital free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set of conventions ( sense-knowledge ) on the grounds that it is illusory in order to be able to embrace another set of conventions ( chivalric romanticism ) with an attitude of naive indifference to the problem of what is or is not illusory . In this sense his situation is comparable to that of the deconstructionist critic , who is unable to dispense with the conventions of the very logocentric language from which he wishes to disassociate himself . Just as a thinker without a language is inconceivable , so is a human being inconceivable without a fantasy world . So observes Francis Bacon : <p> Doth any man doubt , that , if there were taken from men 's minds vain opinions , flattering hopes , false valuations , imaginations , as one would , and the like vinum Daemonum ( as a Father called poetry ) , but it would leave the minds of a number of men poor shrunken things , full of melancholy and indisposition , and unpleasing to themselves ? 16 <p> The Quijote would seem to advance the proposition that healthy fictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result can be a crisis such as that which is presented in the ? Tale of Impertinent Curiosity. ? Don Quijote 's recurrent self-deceptions concerning the identity and intentions of others cause him to behave violently ; hence , they must eventually be dispelled . On the other hand , his idealization of Aldonza Lorenzo causes harm to no one . Sancho ? who eventually learns , under Don Quijote 's influence , to liberate his own poetic imagination ? playfully yet maliciously takes it upon himself to <p> contradict iconoclastically his companion 's illusions concerning the being whom Don Quijote describes as ? the only refuge of my hopes ? ( nico refugio de mis esperanzas : II , 29 ) . It is ironic that Sancho 's naturalistic description of the Dulcinea whom he claims to have spoken to when she was winnowing wheat in the barnyard is a fictional invention as well , yet for that profanation Sancho must make restitution in the form of three thousand three hundred lashes . While Sancho 's fictionalization of Aldonza Lorenzo may be less fanciful than Don Quijote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied that imagining that things can only be as they appear , that sense-impressions are an adequate basis for knowledge , is comparable to a delusion or a fantasy , to being under a ? spell , ? and it is implied that the ? enchanted , ? or fictional , aspect of such a one-sided epistemological realism ( of the assumption that the only reality attributable to objects of our knowledge is a reality of their own ) is that it is at once too naive and too cynical : too naive because it ignores its own partiality and , hence , its own fictional character , too cynical because it disregards the crucial importance of subjective factors for conceiving ways in which reality can be recast and improved . In Cervantes 's novel ( for all the pregnant and contradictory implications that one may wish to see in the circumstance ) it is the very incarnation of the quixotic vision himself , Don Quijote , who insists that what the general run of people think they see in the world around them is , in fact , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite frankly that what he claims to be true is what he imagines and wills to be true . One implication of that attitude on Don Quijote 's part could be that fiction is a fundamental ingredient in any perception of reality . It could also follow , both logically and from Don Quijote 's example , that once one accepts that fact one can aspire to build a reality on the fiction that is most inspired and most elevated . At that point the role of learning is not merely to justify empirical knowledge but to help provide a road to knowledge of a higher kind .

Ngo Dinh Diem 's government had American support as it struggled to consolidate its authority in the South , but in the spring of 1955 , its odds seemed so poor that the United States was seriously thinking of giving up on Diem and looking for other options . The situation soon improved , but the American commitment to Diem still did not seem ironclad . The " American Friends of Vietnam " ( AFV ) , dedicated to encouraging and strengthening that commitment , was formed at the end of 1955 . It was never a large or a really influential group , but its story , recounted in Joseph Morgan 's new book The Vietnam Lobby , makes a fascinating vignette of Cold War history . It is a revised version of Morgan 's doctoral dissertation ( Georgetown University , History , 1993 ) . <p> The AFV did not aspire to a mass membership . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strong government connections when it could . Members of both houses of Congress , and one Supreme Court justice , joined in the 1950s . General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel was chairman of the AFV until 1963 . General William J. Donovan ( head of the OSS during World War II ) was honorary chairman until 1957 . The organization then got along without an honorary chairman for several years , but in about 1966 Henry Cabot Lodge ( US Ambassador to Saigon and a power in the Republican Party--he had been Richard Nixon 's running mate in the 1960 presidential election ) and General Maxwell Taylor ( former US Ambassador to Saigon and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ) jointly became honorary chairmen ; they served well into the 1970s . <p> The members also included at various times scholars like Wesley Fishel , I. Milton Sacks , Robert Scalapino , George Tanham , and Frank Trager ; journalists like Robert Shaplen ; and businessmen , of whom the ones who played the largest role were probably Harold L. Oram , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States from 1955 to 1961 , and William F. Ward , a Wall Street executive who was chairman from 1968 to 1974 . <p> The AFV initially included anti-Communists from across the American political spectrum , not just conservatives but liberals like Senators John F. Kennedy and Mike Mansfield , and even Norman Thomas , head of the American Socialist Party . Joseph Buttinger , an Austrian immigrant who still held some of the socialist views of his youth , and who went to South Vietnam in 1954 to aid refugees from North Vietnam , had more than anyone else been the founder of the organization . By the mid to late 1960s the socialists and liberals had mostly dropped out , and the AFV shifted to the Right . <p> Joseph Morgan , a member of the Congregation of Christian Brothers and an assistant professor of history at Iona College , has done a great deal of work , both interviewing participants and tracking down records and letters in various libraries and archives , all well documented ; there are 31 pages of endnotes to the 160 pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan did could and should have supported a somewhat longer book . <p> Morgan argues , convincingly , that the American Friends of Vietnam did not have the impact on U.S. policy that some authors have ascribed to it . Its founders wanted to ensure that the Eisenhower administration made a firm commitment to Ngo Dinh Diem , but by the time the AFV actually got organized , the commitment had already been made . <p> The AFV might have had the opportunity to influence major decisions during the administration of John Kennedy , but it was crippled by internal divisions . Its members were convinced of the need to save South Vietnam from Communism , but most of them were coming reluctantly to the conclusion that Ngo Dinh Diem was misruling South Vietnam so badly that he had become a liability for the anti-Communist struggle . General O'Daniel , however , national chairman until September 1963 , supported Diem very strongly . The split prevented the AFV from exerting serious influence in any direction during 1963 , and the organization had essentially collapsed by mid 1964 . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalation of American military efforts and then , after President Johnson had indeed escalated , publicly endorsing what the president had done . The AFV 's calls for the United States to bomb North Vietnam apparently had no impact on the President 's decision to do so , but its support after the fact did have some effect , increasing public support for the U.S. military effort . For the next few years the AFV released statements , provided speakers to take the pro-war position in debates on the war , and so forth . The White House was grateful , and during 1965 gave the AFV some quiet help with its financial problems , by arranging introductions to wealthy donors . But by 1967 the White House , disappointed with the impact of the AFV on the public debate , had decided to encourage the establishment of a new group , the Citizens Committee for Peace and Freedom in Vietnam . The AFV hung on until the fall of Saigon , remaining a voice in the arguments over the war , but not a loud one . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to get along with one another , with the White House , and with the Republic of Vietnam and its ambassadors in Washington , provide fascinating and important insights into the politics of the Cold War and the Vietnam War . On these matters , while Morgan was not able to answer all the crucial questions ( he is for example uncertain of the AFV 's relations with the CIA ) , he seems to have presented all the important information he was able to find . <p> On the actual policy issues , the details of the message that the AFV presented to the American government and public , there are serious gaps . Morgan says much that is useful but could and should have said more . In the early 1970s , for example , one of the organization 's main efforts was a serial ( really a pamphlet series--the typical issue was a single article by a single author ) called Southeast Asian Perspectives . All Morgan has to say about the content is that the articles took a strong anti-Communist line , and generally backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Nixon 's opening to China . This reviewer , wanting a little more detail , checked a couple of issues and found one that predicted , partly on the basis of an exaggerated account of what had happened in North Vietnam in the mid 1950s , that if the Communists were to take South Vietnam , they would promptly launch a massive bloodbath ; " the minimum number of those to be butchered will exceed one million and could rise to several times that figure . " 1 A later issue took the story of what had happened in North Vietnam in the mid 1950s into greater detail , exaggerating by more than a factor of ten the number of people the Communists executed. 2 <p> The reviewer wonders : was there anyone in the AFV at this time who was embarrassed by these exaggerations ? Joseph Buttinger had known enough so he would have been embarrassed , but by 1972 he was long gone . It seems possible that the reason the AFV 's exaggerations about Communist atrocities in North Vietnam in the 1950s did not catch Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is that Morgan did not realize they were exaggerations . He does not seem to know as much about Vietnam , and the war there , as he does about events in the United States . <p> When had the AFV begun talking in such lurid terms about a Communist bloodbath in Vietnam ? Had it been doing so in 1965 ? Morgan in fact gives very little detail about the statements of AFV spokesmen in the debates that started in 1965 . He says they defended U.S. policy , but does not really say anything about the nature of the defense . <p> The addition of twenty or forty pages on such matters would greatly have strengthened this book , without stretching it to an unreasonable length . But we should be grateful for what we have ; if Joseph Morgan had not chosen to write this history of the American Friends of Vietnam , this reviewer doubts than anyone else would ever have written one as good . 69402 @qwx479402 
@@40786656 @786656/ <p> It is scarcely conceivable that a short farcical interlude , inspired by widely diffused folk tales , 3 could carry such an intellectual , and esthetic burden : the positive enterprise of inquiring into the nature of fiction and the creative act , and the negative enterprises of satirizing , on the one hand , mankind in general and , on the other , a specific social class and a specific political institution . And yet it is certain that all of this is present in El retablo de las maravillas . I have no intention of adding to this burden by proposing yet another interpretation ; rather I shall reveal more fully the ? stratagem ? of criticizing limpieza de sangre to which Asensio refers . Full disclosure of this stratagem will nevertheless show that the burden carried by Cervantes ' playlet is in fact much greater than we have imagined .

The villagers , ashamed at seeing nothing and fearful of betraying themselves to be New Christians , at first pretend that they see the various acts ; it is evident that they soon come to delude themselves into believing that they do see them . A stranger , a billeting officer , arrives , and frankly admits that he does not see the show . The spell of the swindlers ' fiction is not broken , however , for the villagers turn on the officer and mock him for being a New Christian . The entremTs ends with a brawl , as the tricksters congratulate themselves on the success of their deception : the next day they will make more money with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration , Chanfalla 's imaginary retable seems to confirm Covarrubias ' account of this kind of retablo : ? Algunos estrangeros suelen traer una caxa de tfteres , que representan alguna historia sagrada , y de allf les dieron el nombre de retablos. ? 4 But if El retablo de las maravillas as a whole belongs to Asensio 's ? tercera modalidad ? ( ? aliando la resea de personajes a una tenue , de cuando en cuando interrumpida acci=n que los encuadre , armoniza el retratismo y el movimiento hacia un desenlace ? ) , the interior duplication , Chanfalla 's nonshow , more closely resembles his second ( ? la pieza esttica , sin anTcdota , ni encadenamiento de sucesos ? ) .5 The retable purports to present , not ? alguna historia sagrada , ? but a discontinuous succession of discrete exhibits . Cervantes ' departure from the norm laid down by Covarrubias should alert us to the significance of his innovation . Let us consider the seemingly random events of Chanfalla 's imaginary show . First Chanfalla pretends to produce Samson in the act of demolishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally imaginary , but to economize on words I present them as if they really happened in the fiction . ) Samson is followed by ? el mesmo toro que mat= al ganapn en Salamanca ?

Next appear some mice , descended , as Chirinos observes , ? por lfnea recta de aquellos que se <p> criaron en el arca de NoT. ? 6 Then the fictional spectators are doused with a shower of water ? de la fuente que da origen y principio al rfo Jordn ? ( p. 178 ) . After this they are treated to some bears and lions . The last figure to come forth is a dancing girl , wrongly called Herodfas because she is really this lady 's daughter , Salome.7 The mayor 's nephew is dancing the lascivious saraband with the feigned Salome when the unfeigned quartermaster arrives to seek billets for his troops , thus putting a violent end to the performance of the puppet show . The deceptive show begins with a scene from the Old Testament and ends with one from the New Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salome , there is the fleeting reference to Noah 's ark and the supposed enactment of the rain of Jordan water . The sacred river belongs to both Testaments , being the place where Elisha caused Naaman to be cured of his leprosy ( II Kings 5 ) and where John baptized Jesus ( Matthew 3 , Mark 1 , Luke 3 ) . It serves as a transition between the Jewish start and the Christian end of the little show . Moreover , according to Chanfalla , who in this respect is following an ancient tradition , 8 the water of its source has the magical virtue of rejuvenating those it touches . Therefore , as a part of his retable , ? Toda mujer a quien tocare en el rostro , se le volver como de plata bruida , y a los hombres se les volvern las barbas como de oro ? ( p. 178 ) . The peasants ' reaction to this intelligence is interesting because it provides the clue to Cervantes ' ? stratagem. ?

This detail is clear evidence that the fictional spectators ' critical sense has been completely undermined by Chanfalla 's fiction : for Christian believers , whether ? Old ? or ?

Really ? is necessarily an ambiguous adverb in a discussion of the compounded fiction of this work . The fact is , as Marrast points out , that Cervantes intentionally substituted the name Herodfas for that of SalomT : ? ces ? vieux chrTtiens ? se ridiculisent un peu plus en ne la cette substitution de noms relevant pas , ajoutant l'ignorance a la sotte vanitT ? ( p. 1076 ) . But , as we shall see further on , the name of Herodias is actually called for by the play 's thematic sense.8 Marrast , p. 1075 .

Neither the text nor its editors explain why the men are so afraid of the prospect that their graying beards might turn golden . The answer surely is that , according to legend , Judas Iscariot had a red beard , a facial feature that by extension was identified with all traitors.10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be associated , however remotely , with the disciple who betrayed his Master . This hitherto enigmatic moment in El retablo de las maravillas opens our eyes to what the polar episodes have in common : they are classical examples of treachery . When Samson fell in love with Delilah , he was bewitched by a traitor . Each one of the lords of the Philistines offered her ? eleven hundred pieces of silver ? ( Judges 16.5 ) if she would discover for them the secret of Samson 's great strength , an offer that she accepted . Three times she asked Samson about the source of his might ; three times he lied to her , thereby himself betraying the love he felt for her . The fourth time , Delilah appealed to him through his love for her ; and Samson , ? his soul . . . vexed unto death , ? betrayed himself by revealing his holy secret : ? I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother 's womb : if I be shaven , then my strength will go from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any other man ? ( Judges 16.17 ) . Delilah then betrayed Samson to the Philistines . Only by the grace of God was he able one last time to summon his supernatural strength , destroying the temple , and killing both the Philistines and himself . It <p> is with this complex history of treachery that Chanfalla 's wonder show opens . Toward its close , Chirinos , who is narrating this part of the show , calls Salome ? la llamada Herodfas , cuyo baile alcanz= en premio la cabeza del Precursor de la vida ? ( p. 179 ) . According to Matthew ( 14.1-12 ) , the Precursor , John the Baptist , who had baptized Jesus in the river Jordan , was imprisoned by Herod the Tetrarch because John had declared it unlawful for Herod to have sexual relations with Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip . To please and avenge Herodias , Herod would have had John put to death had he not feared a revolt by the common people , who regarded John as a prophet . Taking matters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Herod to celebrate his birthday . Rashly Herod swore ? to give her whatsoever she would ask. ? ? And she , being before instructed of her mother , said , ? Give me here John Baptist 's head in a charger. ? ? An act of treachery thus brought about the saint 's death . The fake puppet show turns on cases of treachery in three Biblical contexts : Samson and Delilah , against one another ; Judas , against Christ ; and Herodias and Salome , against John the Baptist.11 If we now recall a Latinism used by Chirinos before the retable begins , we find ourselves in the presence of yet another case of Biblical treachery . Chirinos wants to know if her accomplice has collected in advance the fee for their services that Juan Castrado , the father of the bride , has agreed to pay . She asks : ? +Esta ya el dinero in corbona ? ? ? that is , ? in the treasury ? ( p. 175 ) . A more colloquial expression , such as en la talega ( ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but because we know that Chirinos has a propensity to Latin tags ( her ante omnia has already confused Benito Repollo p. 172 ) , we are not inclined to pay much attention to her pedantry . We should , however , take note of these words , for they refer us yet again to a treacherous act , once more to Judas ' betrayal of Christ . After betraying Jesus with a kiss , Judas repented , and tried to return to the chief priests and elders the thirty pieces of silver with which they had suborned him . He threw the coins onto the floor of the temple , left the place , and hanged himself . ? And the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said ? It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury Vulgate : ? in corbona ? , <p> 11 It is now clear that Cervantes introduced Herodias into his play rather than Salome because his theme of treachery required the agent of the betrayal rather than her accomplice to illustrate it . See note 7 above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retablo de las maravillas <p> 31 <p> because it is the price of blood ? ? ( Matthew 27.6 ) . They thereupon bought the legendary potter 's field with the money , to be a burial place for strangers . In using the Latin words , Chirinos is , then , alluding facetiously to the greatest treachery known to the history of Christendom . Because the entremFs called El retablo de las maravillas is essentially a farce , the grotesque comparison is morally acceptable : in such a context no one is likely to make a serious comparison between the betrayal of God and the betrayal on a minor scale ? an ? embuste ? ? of a village of stupid peasants . But these peasants are not so stupid that , to protect their own interests , they are incapable of pretending to see what they do not see . This initial attempt to deceive others quickly turns into self-deception , and eventually into hallucination . It is a hallucination created both by the statutes of limpieza de sangre and by the trickster Chanfalla.12 Chanfalla 's cruel trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villagers can vent their spleen . The scapegoat arrives in the figure of the quartermaster . When the Furrier sees not a couple of dancers but only one ? the mayor 's nephew but not Salome ? they all ( including the Governor , who has admitted in several asides that he can see no puppets and who is thus suffering no hallucination ) chant the most infamous words of betrayal in Christian history . <p> FURRIER . <p> +QuT diablos de doncella tengo de ver ? <p> CAPACHO . <p> Basta : de ex illis es . <p> GOBERNADOR . <p> De ex illis es , de ex illis es . <p> JUAN CASTRADO . <p> Dellos es , dellos el seor Furrier , dellos es . <p> ( p. 182 ) <p> They all taunt the Furrier with being ? one of them , ? a member of the despised and hated caste of New Christians . Just like in corbona , the phrase ex illis es sends us to the Biblical literature of treachery . It consists of the words with which , following Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Lord for the third time . <p> And after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them Vulgate : ? Vere et tu ex illis es ? ; for thy speech betrayeth thee . Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew ( Matthew 26.73-74 ) . <p> The interior duplication thus establishes the theme of treachery in some sacred contexts within a frame which refers to the double betrayal of Christ , voluntarily by Judas and involuntarily by Peter . We must ask why Cervantes insists so much on this horrendous theme . As we know , the conditions for seeing the retable are that the viewer be neither a bastard nor a New Christian : ? ninguno puede ver las cosas que en Tl el retablo se muestran , que tenga alguna raza de confeso , o no sea habido y procreado de sus padres de legftimo matrimonio ? ( pp. 171-72 ) . The disqualification by reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impure blood . Illegitimacy as an obstacle to vision is a legacy from the sources in European folklore that Cervantes draws on . Cervantes ' originality in his treatment of this subject is his adaptation of the international popular material to the racist situation in his own country . If a spectator is to see the show , he must be an Old Christian , with no trace of Jewish or Muslim blood in his ancestry . The dramatic fiction reflects a historical reality , which contended that there were two kinds of Christians : the qualified , who could be trusted with public office , the so-called Old Christians ; and the disqualified , who could not be trusted with public office , the so-called New Christians . But this apparent historical reality is in fact a historical fiction : whether Christians are good or bad ones , trustworthy or untrustworthy ones , depends not on their pedigree but on the sincerity and fervor of their faith . The division of believers into sheep and goats can be made only by God , who alone can penetrate a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to undertake to judge Christians on the basis of historical or genetic accidents is , beyond the shadow of a doubt , to offend God , to betray him . Through and beyond the cases of betrayal presented in the entremTs ? Samson betrayed by Delilah and betraying her ; John the Baptist , betrayed by Herodias and her daughter Salome ; Jesus , by Judas and Peter ? Cervantes points to the officially sanctioned blasphemy against God , betrayed by the Spanish state and the Spanish people . This is the full import of Cervantes ' stratagem that Asensio has discerned in El retablo de las maravillas . The political and religious judgment contained in the entremTs transcends the simple <p> 4 ( 1984 ) <p> Satire in El retablo de las maravillas <p> 33 <p> satire of the effects of limpieza de sangre that he and other critics have recognized : it goes so far as to accuse Spaniards of having betrayed their God by reason of their institutionalized racial prejudices . Paralleling this subtle denunciation of the statutes of clean blood is an analogous one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here limpieza de sangre is clearly ranged against ? limpieza de coraz=n. ? The verbal contrast enables one to see the impassable gulf that separates state religion from personal religion . The fact that , in its concern for purity of blood , the Spanish state has institutionalized the Christian religion has led to its perversion , which is a blasphemy , the fundamental denial and betrayal of the God in whose name the religion exists.14 <p> DUKE UNIVERSITY <p> 13Novelas ejemplares , ed . Harry Sieber ( Madrid : Ctedra , 1980 ) , I , 311 . Salomon , loc. cit. , notes the relevance of this passage to the entremTs.14 Some readers may object to my reading of the sense of the retable on the grounds that it ignores the presence in it of the bull , the mice , the lions , and the bears . Indeed , I do not think that the animals contribute to the theme of treachery . I am inclined to accept Molho 's interpretation of them as symbolizing male aggression ( pp. 206-10 ) . 
@@40786660 @786660/ <p> In a book based on an extraordinarily rich array of fascinating sources , including eighteenth-century Western European travelers ' accounts of trips to Eastern Europe , maps and atlases drawn at the time , and letters and literature of the Enlightenment about Eastern Europe ( ranging from personal accounts , to philosophical treatments , to pure fantasy ) , Larry Wolff has written a delightful , erudite , and useful work of intellectual history in which he sketches implications for later European political and social history . He has traced how Western Europeans came to view the continent of Europe as sharply divided into a Western and Eastern half , and to conceive of the latter as backward and uncivilized . <p> The concept of the underdeveloped East came into vogue just as travel to Eastern Europe was on the increase . Though the line of demarcation between East and West on the continent might vary with the individual and his or her grasp of geography or truth , wherever it fell in the mind of the writer or traveler , a great chasm opened and " Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , changeable : sometimes it was at the Don River , at other times further east at the Volga , and at other times , it was ( as now ) at the Urals . <p> Moreover , Wolff shows that the distinction between East and West did not arise by chance , but came about as the result of an intellectual agenda , related both to Western European ideological self-interest and to scholars ' and writers ' self-promotion . The invention of an Eastern Europe that was found to be seriously wanting had a great deal to do with the emergence of the concept of civilization and the reinvention of a " civilized " Western Europe that would suit--and be worthy of ? --the aspirations and tastes of the Enlightenment . <p> The East-West distinction was , Wolff points out , new . As late as the Renaissance , the division of Europe that dominated thought and thinkers was still that between the North and the South . " Just as a new center of the Enlightenment superseded the old centers of the Renaissance , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced to the east . East and west were suddenly defined by ' opposition and adjacency ' . " A straight line connected Paris to Poltava . <p> It was only in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment that the philosophes and others interested in affirming the superiority of Western Europe created a sense of difference from , and prejudices toward , Eastern Europe . This , Wolff opines , was later updated to accommodate new circumstances and reinforced the West 's decision to fight the Crimean War , the Germans ' and Austrians ' steady Drang nach Osten , the eastern campaigns of Nazi Germany , and the Iron Curtain of the Cold War . Even today , as the former Soviet satellites and Newly Independent States move toward the West and work to emulate aspects of Western capitalist development , the " scratches on our mind " ( to use a wonderful phrase that Harold Isaac applied to Westerners ' views of China ) , stemming from an old tradition of East-West cultural separation , still subtly govern our perspectives . <p> In emphasizing the false similarities , the philosophes judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the then evolving notion of " civilization . " The process of invention consisted not just of endowing real countries with mythic attributes , though much of that happened ; the greater work of invention lay in a " synthetic association " of peoples that drew on both fact and fiction to produce " a general rubric of eastern Europe .... " Wolff describes Eastern Europe as a " cultural construction ... of the Enlightenment . " <p> In point of fact , Eastern Europe was never a fictitious place . Both the countries and people on the eastern end of the European land mass were real and were worthy of visits and study . The journeys , however , seldom opened the minds of the travelers and study failed to reveal more than prejudices . The result of both was generally an attitude toward , and concept of , Eastern Europe that tied together very different countries and peoples through invented and generally unflattering similarities . Western writers concocted and presented to others as fact false linkages that turned Russia , Poland , Hungary , and the lands emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences of wealth , culture , language , religion , and history--into a single new entity characterized by a degree of barbarism . The invention gave the West its first model of underdevelopment . But there was hope ! Eastern Europe was generally not seen as totally lost to culture for all time but was low on the developmental scale and susceptible to improvement at the hands of the West . <p> The author shows how the ideological relation of the two Europes paralleled to a large degree the relationship between the Occident and the Orient , though in the case of Asia some writers professed to find , besides barbarism , sophisticated cultural and intellectual traits from which Western Europeans could benefit . Remoteness seemed to breed on occasion a kind of enchantment , but poor Eastern Europe suffered from its greater degree of proximity , accessibility and similarity to Western Europe . Western Europe was more comfortable with , and kinder to , East Asia and the Middle East which were harder to visit than to Eastern Europe , which many more travelers saw and experienced . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert . Voltaire , for example , never went to the Russia for which he had such hopes as a result of the reign of Catherine II . But he wrote on Peter the Great and helped to form many important people 's view of Russia . Diderot did visit St. Petersburg in 1773 and failed to get the reception for his ideas for improving the country that he had hoped . And perhaps more typical of the travelers of the time , a not at all young , upper middle class Parisian hostess of a well-attended salon , Mme. Geoffrin , went to Poland in 1766 to be the guest of the king , who had regularly come to her " at homes " while he was in Paris . <p> The book presents fascinating treatments of both travelers and armchair voyagers . It begins with the Count de Segur , a hero of the American Revolution , traveling across eastern Europe in 1784-85 to serve as the French ambassador to the court of St. Petersburg . Having left Prussia and entered Poland , he declared in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved back ten centuries " and had " left Europe entirely . " The book ends with an American adventurer , John Ledyard , who had traveled with Captain Cook and in 1788 was returning--east to west--from a solitary expedition to Siberia . He reported that he had not reached Europe until he was in Prussia . <p> But the chapters of the work best suggest the dimensions of the study . Chapter 1 , " Entering Eastern Europe ; Eighteenth-Century Travelers on the Frontier , " features the travels of the Count de Segur , mentioned above , William Coxe , who traveled in 1778-79 , and the Lady Mary Montagu . Eastern Europe was in effect discovered on the road to St. Petersburg or Constantinople . Chapter 2 , " Possessing Eastern Europe : Sexuality , Slavery and Corporal Punishment , " presents the travels of Casanova , Baron Francois de Tott , Joseph Marshall , and William Richardson . Chapter 3 , " Imagining Eastern Europe : Fiction , Fantasy and Vicarious Voyages , " focuses on non-travelers such as Voltaire , Lessing , Marat ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " Baron Munchausen , " the creation of Raspe , and the travelers Mozart ( on a concert tour ) , the Count d'Hauterive , Lady Elizabeth Craven , and the Prince de Ligne , who was privileged to journey with Catherine II of Russia on her inspection tour of the Crimea . <p> Chapter 4 , " Mapping Eastern Europe : Political Geography and Cultural Cartography , " shows that map making was often used as a vehicle for introducing information ( or prejudices ) and for annotating one 's observations . Geographical uncertainty fed the invention of Eastern Europe as the articles of the Encyclopedie demonstrate . And there were objective reasons for the uncertainty beyond subjectivity toward and ignorance of what was : Hungary was in the period reclaimed as a nation from the Turks ; Poland suffered three partitions , ultimately disappearing ; the Russian Empire grew ; and the Ottoman Empire steadily shrank . Geographical exploration was going on , fed by the interest of monarchs to know their own realms as well as those of neighbors <p> Chapter 5 , " Addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a demonstration of the power of mental mapping . Chapter 6 , " Addressing Eastern Europe , Part II : Rousseau 's Poland , " presents , inter alia , the account of the journey of Mme. Geoffrin , the house guest from hell of the last king of Poland . Chapter 7 , " Peopling Eastern Europe , Part I : Barbarians in Ancient History and Modern Anthropology " and chapter 8 , " Peopling Eastern Europe , Part II : The Evidence of Manners and the Measurements of Race , " discuss in part the fascination of Western Europeans at showing the Scythian or Tatar roots of Eastern European peoples , false ethnic and linguistic connections , and an inventiveness regarding everyone 's past . Gibbon 's low regard for eastern Europe is balanced by the kinder attitude of Herder , who saw Slavs as an underdeveloped , but " victimized people of peace and freedom . " The conclusion is an exciting piece that works to a large degree to tie together the various sections of the book . <p> As with many other good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times intrigued by the connections that are made between and among thinkers of the period under study and later events . Still , an element of doubt has to be allowed to creep in . What comes later , after all , does not always depend on what happened earlier . And what develops as the idee fixe of one period may be an outmoded notion at another , while earlier ideas may recur . Three questions immediately come to mind regarding the influence of the invention of Eastern Europe on recent history : <p> ( 1 ) Was the earlier North-South dichotomy entirely lost after the Enlightenment ? Or , did it continue and co-exist with the newer East-West division of Europe ? It is very arguable that strong divisions between northern and southern Europeans exist today and that , regrettably , there are strong northern prejudices against " mythic " characteristics of the mezzogiorno or south of Spain . Are they survivals from a time earlier than the Enlightenment ? <p> ( 2 ) Did the survival of negative Western attitudes toward Eastern European countries and peoples really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? After all , the goal of the Nazis was the conquest of all of Europe--and more . The East was one of the directions of march . Similarly , did the invention of an Eastern Europe so long ago in the age of the Enlightenment really affect the descent of the Iron Curtain ? Was this the reason that the West was unwilling to fight again , so shortly after a ruinous and exhausting war , to protect the Eastern European states from Stalin ? I venture to suggest that , with similar plausibility , one could construct a case that the attraction the West held for Russians from the time of Ivan the Terrible or Peter the Great was an influence on Stalin 's effort to keep moving his empire westward . <p> ( 3 ) Did not the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century " rehabilitate " Eastern European peoples , whose distinctive cultures , languages , and history suddenly became topics of study and interest in the West ? In many of the typologies of the nineteenth century , Eastern European peoples were the very ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to come , while the West--like an overripe plant--had already had its day . <p> ( 4 ) From where did the now prevalent idea of one Europe emerge ? Could it have arisen without the weakening long ago of the Enlightenment view of the eastern half of the continent ? <p> Whatever the answers to these questions , Larry Wolff has written a fascinating book that helps us to understand that the eighteenth-century concepts of humanity and brotherhood--the concepts that most of us were taught as characteristic of the age--had definite limitations . They stopped , for example , at that point where , in the mind of the visitor , writer or thinker , Eastern Europe began . <p> other permission , please contact H-Net@h-net.msu.edu. 
@@40786662 @786662/ <p> t is possible to divide and categorize the vast corpus of criticism devoted to Don Quijote according to specific areas of interest . James A. Parr , for example , in his recent study ( Don Quijote : An Anatomy of Subversive Discourse 1988 ) identifies several typical orientations toward Cervantes 's masterpiece , such as the Romantic and ? cautionary ? schools , both of which focus on the protagonist ; the ? perspectivist ? , which focuses on the problematic nature of ? reality ? ; and the aesthetic ( or narrative technique ) school ( 24 ) .1 Parr 's own orientation is admittedly aesthetic , that is , focused on ? completion of causal sequences , satisfaction of conventional expectations for irony and parody , and realization of . . . humor , burlesque , and incongruity ? ( 70 ) . One point I wish to emphasize in this essay has been made before , but is , I think , in need of constant restatement : that the various critical orientations mentioned by Parr in his remarkably perceptive and stimulating study are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such orientations as the perspectivist ( concerned with the represented <p> 1 The term ? cautionary school ? denotes the critical reaction against Romantic ( ? soft ? ) interpretations of Don Quijote . Perhaps the best-known example of the cautionary ( ? hard ? ) tradition is Anthony 's The Romantic Approach to Don Quixote ( 1977 ) . <p> 55 <p> 56 <p> CHARLES ORIEL <p> Cervantes <p> reality ) and the aesthetic ( concerned with the representing discourse ) often overlap and mutually reinforce one another . In chapter 4 ( ? Levels and Transgressions ? ) of his book , Parr utilizes GTrard Genette 's system of narrative levels to elucidate the embedded narratives of Don Quijote . The concept of ? narrative levels ? helps to clarify that ? shifting but sacred frontier between two worlds , the world in which one tells , the world of which one tells ? ( Narrative Discourse 236 ) . If I tell a tale , for example , the events that I relate ( the world of which I tell ) constitute the primary , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? intradiegetic ? or ? diegetic ? level.2 The immediate narrating situation , that is , the context that includes both myself as teller and my audience , is what Genette calls the ? extradiegetic ? level ( the world in which I tell ) . Finally , if one of the characters in my tale should become a narrator , the events that he or she relates would constitute the ? metadiegetic ? level of narrative . None of these terms is absolute ; rather , they are relational or functional ( 229 ) . A narrative may be considered metadiegetic only relative to a primary , intradiegetic narrative . What happens when the ostensibly ? sacred ? frontier between narrative levels , or even that between textual and extratextual reality , is transgressed or violated , as it blatantly is in so many ways in Don Quijote ? One such transgression occurs early on , during the inquisition and burning of Don Quijote 's books in chapter 6 of Part I , when a copy of Cervantes 's Galatea is found , and the priest remarks that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aos ha que es grande amigo mfo ese Cervantes , y sT que es ms versado en desdichas que en versos ? ( 120 ) .3 The conventional relation between creator and creation appears to have been violated , for , somehow , Cervantes and his early pastoral novel have been ? magically ? included in the represented ( intradiegetic ) world of Don Quijote , Part I. Another , even more blatant , violation is the inclusion of Don Quijote , Part I , within the represented world of Don Quijote , Part <p> 2 Genette uses the two terms interchangeably ( 228 ) . Despite the invariably relative nature of these terms , I shall ( for the sake of clarity , and following Parr ) use the term ? intradiegetic ? in this essay to refer specifically to the ? universe of the characters ? ( Anatomy 58 ) , that is , the basic level of narrative on which Don Quijote and Sancho have their adventures and interact with other characters.3 All quotations , except where indicated , are from Part I of the Murillo edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10.2 ( 1990 ) <p> Narrative Levels <p> 57 <p> II . At the beginning of the second Part , only a month after the events described in Part I have taken place , Don Quijote learns that a published edition of his exploits has already appeared and is currently enjoying a wide circulation and great popularity . John J. Allen has succinctly expressed the implications of this apparent paradox : ? Don Quixote , Part I , is the only specific object in the phenomenal world of Part II which exists literally , and lies ready at hand for our confirmation of its objective reality , yet it is precisely the presence of this book , Don Quixote , Part I , which violates the realistic terms of that world ? ( Hero or Fool I:79 ) . Such narrative transgressions ? examples of what Genette calls ? metalepsis ? ? obviously defy the logical expectations of most readers . Genette mentions Julio Cortzar 's short-story ? Continuidad de los Parques ? as an obvious example of metalepsis that is well known to Hispanists : ? the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel he is reading ? ( 234 ) . Metalepsis ultimately has a dizzying effect on the reader that radically unsettles his or her sense of reality : ? The most troubling thing about metalepsis indeed lies in this unacceptable and insistent hypothesis , that the extradiegetic is perhaps always diegetic , and that the narrator and his narratees ? you and I ? perhaps belong to some narrative ? ( 236 ) . As Genette reminds us , Borges was clearly interested in narrative transgressions of this type and made a similar observation : ? +Por quT nos inquieta que don Quijote sea lector del Quijote , y Hamlet , espectador de Hamlet ? Creo haber dado en la causa : tales inversiones sugieren que si los caracteres de una ficci=n pueden ser lectores o espectadores , nosotros , sus lectores o espectadores , podemos ser ficticios ? ( ? Magias parciales ? 105 ) . By so radically stretching and transgressing the limits of the reading process in this way , Don Quijote constitutes a relentless questioning of that very process : its conventions and its uses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quijote 's exhibiting and questioning of its own status and authority as fiction . Part I of Don Quijote offers a good many interpolated , metadiegetic narratives . Among the principal ones are Pedro the goatherd 's tale of Marcela and Gris=stomo ; Sancho 's tale of Lope Ruiz and Torralba ; Cardenio , Dorotea , and the Cautivo also relate their own stories . In addition to all of these , a fictional narrative , the ? Novela del curioso impertinente , ? is read aloud at the inn . One of the longer narratives is Cardenio 's , and it presents problems because it is not exclusively his . Not only is he not the only <p> 58 <p> CHARLES ORIEL <p> Cervantes <p> source for his story , but the story itself is fractured by the text 's presentation of it , and part of the reader 's task is , of course , to put the various pieces together . His story is , in part , that of other characters , whose lives and whose own narrations are radically interwoven with and affected by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely ? narration , nor can it ever be . The beginning of Cardenio 's involvement is presented in the following order : <p> 1 . <p> Having entered the Sierra Morena , Don Quijote and Sancho find a bag . <p> 2 . <p> In the bag : <p> a . DQ finds a book of writings . <p> b . Sancho finds some gold coins . <p> 3 . <p> DQ reads aloud from the book , at Sancho 's request . <p> 4 . <p> DQ and Sancho see a lone figure wandering through the mountains . <p> 5 . <p> DQ conjectures that he is the owner of the bag . <p> 6 . <p> DQ and Sancho go off to look for him . <p> 7 . <p> DQ and Sancho find a dead mule . <p> 8 . <p> DQ and Sancho run into a goatherd . <p> *9 . <p> The goatherd tells DQ and Sancho about a certain young man who has recently appeared wandering about in the mountains . <p> 10 . <p> The young man appears . <p> 11 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the young man 's request . <p> *12 . <p> The young man says that his name is Cardenio and proceeds to tell his story , at DQ 's request . <p> Cardenio experiences a spell of locura : he attacks his audience and runs off , leaving them badly beaten . <p> ( HIATUS : DQ remains in the Sierra Morena to do ? penance ? ; Sancho goes to deliver DQ 's letter to Dulcinea , and runs into the priest and the barber at the inn ; these three go to find DQ , in order to bring him back home ; as they approach the spot where DQ was last seen , Sancho goes off to look for him . ) <p> 16 . <p> The priest and the barber overhear someone reciting poetry . <p> 17 . <p> The priest and the barber approach him : it is Cardenio . <p> *18 . <p> Cardenio tells his story , at their request . <p> 10.2 ( 1990 ) <p> Narrative Levels <p> 59 <p> The striking characteristic of this listing is the ? fractured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruct Cardenio 's story piece by piece , as it is given to us . In Genette 's terminology , our sense of Cardenio is the result of a combination of both intradiegetic and metadiegetic elements . All the items in the above listing are obviously intradiegetic , i.e. , events that take place on the basic level of narrative . But items 9 , 12 , 13 , and 18 ( indicated by asterisks ) ? contain ? and give access to the metadiegetic level . These all shed light on Cardenio 's past , either remote or relatively recent . Cardenio 's story represents two essential motifs , discontinuity and change in perspective . The former is evident in the hiatus noted on the list ; just as Don Quijote 's own brand of locura interrupts Cardenio 's telling of his past , so do the knight-errant 's and Sancho 's adventures interrupt the process by which we , as readers , learn about Cardenio . Discontinuity also characterizes the fragmentary and metonymic process by which Don Quijote and Sancho , themselves , learn about Cardenio : literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his writings , all found in the bag ; then his mule ; then the unnamed goatherd 's words about a young man who has recently appeared there in the mountains ; finally , Cardenio himself ) . Once Cardenio has related his story to the priest and the barber , bringing both them and us up to his ? present ? ( after the ? hiatus ? noted above ) , his story continues for us on the intradiegetic level of narrative , when he plays a role in the intrigue devised by the priest to lure Don Quijote back home . ( This intrigue itself involves a further metadiegetic narration , namely , the story that Dorotea tells to Don Quijote in her role as Princess Micomicona . ) At this point , Cardenio 's involvement is interrupted by several episodes that appear to have little or no direct relation to him . These include the second encounter with AndrTs ( and Don Quijote 's metadiegetic narration of earlier events concerning him ) ; the arrival at the inn ; the reading aloud of the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that reading by doing battle with the ? giant ? / wineskins ; the completion of the reading of ? El curioso impertinente. ? Only after these events have occurred do Fernando and Luscinda appear at the inn , thereby enabling Cardenio ( along with Dorotea ) to take center-stage once again . Discontinuity is thus the result of a series of interruptions , both intradiegetic and metadiegetic . <p> 60 <p> CHARLES ORIEL <p> Cervantes <p> The text also presents Cardenio to us by way of a marked and persistent perspectivism , offering information about him from various points of view.4 We first learn about him through the eyes of Don Quijote and Sancho . This is a golden example of such perspectivism , for ( as we all know ) these two tend to see things very differently from one another . Upon finding Cardenio 's bag , Don Quijote 's interest centers on the book containing Cardenio 's writings ; Sancho , on the other hand , goes immediately for the gold coins . The importance of the distinction ? for this essay ? derives not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ? materiality ? ( although it is evident that these also play a role here ) , as from the simple perspectivist notion that ? reality ? is defined at least as much by the perceiving subject as by the perceived object . We first see Cardenio indirectly , then , through the divided vision of Don Quijote and Sancho , when they find his bag . Next , the unnamed goatherd relates all that he knows about Cardenio , including the latter 's earlier appearance there in the Sierra Morena and his treatment of ( and by ) the other shepherds . Cardenio then makes his first appearance and we see him as ? directly ? as we ever will , that is , by way of certain intermediaries ( some explicit , some inferred ) , such as the unnamed ? and reportedly unscrupulous ? Moorish translator of Cide Hamete 's historia or the dubious ? second author ? who reports at the beginning of chapter 9 that he found the manuscript . These intermediaries function as extradiegetic ? filters ? for all of the intradiegetic action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quijote , <p> 4 The ? perspectivist ? orientation toward Don Quijote has , of course , a long tradition that includes AmTrico Castro 's seminal El pensamiento de Cervantes ( 1925 ) and Leo Spitzer 's important essay , ? Linguistic Perspectivism in the Don Quijote ? ( 1948 ) . This orientation has found more recent expression in the work of such eminent critics as Joaqufn Casalduero , Manuel Durn , E. C. Riley , and John J. Allen , to name only a few.5 Many of these ? filters ? do not serve as actual narrators ; rather , they make themselves felt as inferred presences within the narrative voices that do effectively ? speak ? . One such presence is Cide Hamete ( although it is possible to argue that this status changes in the final chapter of Part II ) . Parr lists and discusses at some length these various ? narrative voices and presences ? ( 30-39 ) , describing them as intradiegetic . They are intradiegetic , of course , insofar as they are circumscribed by the extradiegetic level of what Parr calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are themselves extradiegetic insofar as they are exterior ( and provide ? access ? ) to the level of p. 61 narrative on which Don Quijote has his adventures : therein lies the functional or relative nature of these terms . It is finally ? begging the reader 's indulgence ? a matter of perspective . <p> 10.2 ( 1990 ) <p> Narrative Levels <p> 61 <p> Sancho , and the goatherd , we get ( as it were ) his own perspective on himself . When he later reappears , after the ? hiatus ? , we see him from the perspective of the priest and barber : along with them , we overhear his poetry without knowing that it is in fact Cardenio who is producing it ( 329-30 ) . Later on , the story told by Dorotea intersects with Cardenio 's tale ( by way of Fernando ) , so that we get , however limited , her perspective on him . Although her story is not Cardenio 's , and could not be , it has enough points of intersection with it to corroborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and completing the list of perspectives on Cardenio ? we see him ? directly ? once again , that is , mediated only by the extradiegetic filters noted above.6 Cardenio 's first encounter with the shepherds in the Sierra Morena constitutes a revealing and tangible example of this perspectivism , when we receive the same information from two sources , first from the goatherd and then from Cardenio himself . The goatherd reports to Don Quijote and Sancho that Cardenio ? pregunt=nos que cul parte desta sierra era la ms spera y escondida ; dijfmosle que era Tsta donde ahora estamos . . . ? ( 287 ) . Later , Cardenio relates the following to the priest and the barber : ? vine a parar a unos prados . . . y allf preguntT a unos ganaderos que hacia d=nde era lo ms spero destas sierras . DijTronme que hacia esta parte ? ( 341 ) . This sort of mutual corroboration of information occurs a good deal throughout the novel . Another example , one which combines the two motifs of discontinuity and perspectivism , occurs when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of digressions that his tale contains . The sense of discontinuity is made explicit to the point of self-reference , because Cardenio 's commentary is itself a digression from a digression . He stops himself in the middle of a hyperbolic description of Luscinda 's beauty in order to ask : <p> 6 These extradiegetic ? filters ? underlie the intradiegetic perspectives noted in this paragraph . One might speak here of ? horizontal ? perspectives ( the points of view of intradiegetic characters ) , as opposed to ? vertical ? perspectives of various degrees ( the actual and inferred points of view of the extradiegetic voices and presences ) . This distinction is admittedly problematic , however , for one of the most essential characteristics of Don Quijote 's narrative structure is precisely the simultaneous tracing and erasure of the borders between the intradiegetic and the extradiegetic , between the narrated event and the event of narrating . <p> The priest proceeds to reply to Cardenio , which is to say , he expresses his own point of view : ? A esto le respondi= el cura que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ les daba mucho gusto las menudencias que contaba , por ser tales , que merecfan no pasarse en silencio , y la mesma atenci=n que lo principal del cuento ? ( 338 ) . The priest 's comment illustrates not only the interwoven , digressive structure of Cardenio 's tale , but also that of Don Quijote , Part I , itself.7 The motif of narrative digression reappears at the beginning of chapter 28 , when , as if to comment upon the latest digression from the basic line of action and to anticipate those even longer ones which are to come ( ? El curioso impertinente ? and the Cautivo 's tale ) , the narrator intrudes in order to express an opinion , as well : <p> 7 The problem of artistic unity is , of course , at the heart of this exchange . The Cide Hamete of Part II apparently disagrees with Cardenio and the priest , for we are told that the Moorish historian believes that he deserves the praise of his readers precisely because he has refrained ( in the second Part ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I : ? pues se contiene y cierra en los estrechos lfmites de la narraci=n , teniendo habilidad , suficiencia y entendimiento para tratar del universo todo , pide que no se desprecie su trabajo , y se le den alabanzas , no por lo que escribe , sino por lo que ha dejado de escribir ? ( II : 367 ) . Cardenio 's narrative dilemma has a modern echo , among many others that come to mind , in the words of Todd Andrews , the narrator/protagonist of John Barth 's The Floating Opera ( 1956 ) : ? Good heavens , how does one write a novel ! I mean , how can anybody stick to the story , if he 's at all sensitive to the significances of things ? As for me , I see already that storytelling is n't my cup of tea : every new sentence I set down is full of figures and implications that I 'd love nothing better than to chase to their dens with you , but such chasing would involve new figures and new chases , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less ended , if I let my inclinations run unleashed ? ( 2 ) . <p> There is great irony and ambivalence ( not to mention potential contradiction ) in the use of the terms ? agradables y artificiosos y verdaderos ? to describe these narrative digressions , especially in relation to the ? verdadera historia , ? a phrase that is itself problematic . This passage brings immediately to mind those vital aesthetic problems ( historical versus poetic truth , artistic unity , verisimilitude ) that receive much fuller treatment in the later discussion between the canon and the priest ( chapters 47-48 ) concerning the status and reception of books of knighthood , and other related literary matters.8 The ? rastrillado , torcido y aspado hilo ? is perhaps the best summarizing image of this aesthetics of fragmented and discontinuous storytelling . Even more striking , however , and more relevant to this discussion , is the fact that we are presented with three different perspectives on the nature of digressions , all within a relatively short section of the novel . This multiplicity of point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters ) , in conjunction with the interruptive and fragmentary quality of his involvement , serves to effect a representation of ? reality ? that is based largely upon the terms of human perception : Cervantes 's novel may be called ? realistic ? not only in regard to the world it represents , but also in regard to the way it represents that world.9 The perspectivist orientation ( toward the represented reality ) and the aesthetic orientation ( toward the representing narrative mode ) are , as I said , mutually reinforcing . By evoking the intersubjectivity that is implicit in the three interrelated tales ( the goatherd ; Cardenio ; Dorotea ) and that which is implied by the multiple perspectives enumerated above , the novel also attempts to authorize its various discourses by substantiating their explicit claims to referential truth . In allowing each of the character/narrators and points of view to corroborate one another , the discourse of each is granted an authority that is normally reserved for ? true ? narrations . We have seen , for example , how Cardenio corroborates ? often very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Dorotea 's entire <p> 8 The basic study of this literary debate remains Chapter 3 of Alban Forcione 's masterful Cervantes , Aristotle , and the ? Persiles ? ( 1970 ) .9 This sense of ? realism ? is , of course , incessantly undermined by the novel 's many narrative transgressions ( as noted above ) . <p> 64 <p> CHARLES ORIEL <p> Cervantes <p> tale serves to corroborate ( although much less directly ) that of Cardenio.10 It is significant in this respect that Dorotea refers to her tale , once she has finished telling it , as ? la verdadera historia de mi tragedia ? ( 359 ) . She can do so truthfully because the events that she relates metadiegetically have , in fact , taken place within the represented world ( i.e. , on the basic , intradiegetic level ) of the novel . But this is certainly not the case with the tale she tells in her role as Princess Micomicona , when she takes part in the elaborate intrigue designed by the priest to lure Don Quijote back home . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she prefaces her made-up tale by referring to it as ? mi verdadera historia ? ( 373 ) . Even granting the ambivalence of the word historia in Spanish ( meaning both ? story ? and ? history ? ) , the term becomes problematic by virtue of what appears to be a logical contradiction : in one case , it denotes a narration of events that have ? actually ? occurred ; in the other case , a narration of events that have not . Perhaps one could offer the following justification : that Dorotea 's fictive narration has a certain amount of truth to it , for Princess Micomicona 's situation is in some sense analogous to Dorotea 's ; that the giant who threatens her kingdom is analogous to the ? evil ? side of Fernando and his ill-treatment of Dorotea , and so on . But this would require an imaginative leap from literal to figurative language on the part of the reader and would belie the use of the words ? verdadera historia ? to describe it . Or would it ? Such questions concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the very ambivalence of the term historia greatly encourages them , particularly in a work whose protagonist is so obviously a victim of precisely this type of confusion of levels and modes of discourse . This confusion is explicit in the often-quoted conversation between the priest and Juan Palomeque ( the innkeeper ) , just prior to the reading aloud of the ? Novela del curioso impertinente. ? The innkeeper is enamored of books of knighthood and , although he can not read , enjoys listening to them whenever the opportunity presents itself . After Palomeque demonstrates his enthusiasm for these books by naming some of their <p> 10 This does not prohibit the same intersubjectivity from functioning simultaneously in such a way as to subvert the authority of each of the individual discourses ? that is , by ? de-centering ? them , by presenting them in relation to one another . <p> 10.2 ( 1990 ) <p> Narrative Levels <p> 65 <p> better-known protagonists , Cardenio remarks that the innkeeper appears to believe that the events described in them have actually occurred . When the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Palomeque insists that if the books were not truthful , their printing and circulation would not be permitted : <p> Since this sort of confusion ? that does , indeed , ? quita el juicio ? and that explicitly questions the conventions and processes of reading ? is so central to Don Quijote , it seems appropriate at this point to broach that critical problem that was given one of its earliest and best-known articulations by Aristotle in his Poetics ( IX ) : the distinguishing of ? history ? from ? poetry ? or ? fiction ? .11 One fruitful way of thinking about such categories is suggested by Barbara Herrnstein Smith in On the Margins of Discourse . She distinguishes there between ? natural utterances ? and ? fictive discourse ? . ? Natural utterances ? are those ? that can be taken as someone 's saying something , somewhere , sometime , that is , as the verbal acts of real persons on particular occasions in response to particular sets of circumstances ? ( 15 ) . ? Fictive discourse ? , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically determinate and consists , rather , of ? artificial ? representations of natural utterances . In effect , ? nobody ? utters a fictive discourse . According to this scheme , a history must be regarded as a type of natural utterance : it is created by a real person , in response to real circumstances . We read history by a convention that , for practical purposes , allows us to identify the ? narrative voice ? with the real-life author . This is obviously not the case with fictive discourse . When we open up to chapter 1 of Don Quijote , there is nothing which permits us to assume that the narrative voice is that of Cervantes himself . Quite the contrary , in fact : one of the conventions by which we read and identify fictive discourses is that the narrator as well as his or her <p> 11 Perhaps the clearest introduction to the problematic relation between fiction and history in Don Quijote is Bruce Wardropper 's ? Don Quixote : Story or History ? ? ( 1965 ) . <p> 66 <p> CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been artificially created . We assume a distance or ? space ? between author and narrator , between creator and creation . This distance is explicit in autobiographical narratives , such as Lazarillo de Tormes , but implicit in ( so-called ) third-person narratives . Smith 's distinction between natural utterances and fictive discourse can be related to Genette 's system of narrative levels in the following way : history ( or any natural utterance ) functionally neutralizes the distinction between certain narrative levels . In Genette 's terms , we refer to the basic level of narrative as intradiegetic ; to the narrating situation as extradiegetic ; and to the situation of the author ( to take the terminology one step further ) as ? extra-extradiegetic ? .12 As a natural utterance , history theoretically ? collapses ? these levels into one . By tacit agreement , the reader of a history assumes that three realms ? the intradiegetic ( represented ) world within the text ; the extradiegetic world ( the narrating situation ) ; and the ? extra-extradiegetic ? world ( of the author and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? are , for practical purposes , all continuous . Now , against this argument , one might insist that there is a difference , in histories , between author and narrator , that there is a clear distinction to be made among all of the aforementioned levels . The answer to this objection is simply that the conventions by which we read such utterances as ? history ? do not allow this distinction to function . But it is altogether the other case with fictive discourse . It is precisely this distinction that allows for what might be called the ? functionality of fiction ? . The dear differentiation of various narrative levels and the often indeterminate relations among them allow fictive discourses to signify in ways that natural utterances can not . Fictive discourse inevitably implies a space , a relative indeterminacy , between the extradiegetic and the intradiegetic , between the intradiegetic and the metadiegetic . This ? space ? allows for a full functionality of figurative uses of language , of metaphor , of irony.13 It is a space that invites , indeed , demands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is what we call ? interpretation ? . <p> 12 I am , admittedly , taking liberties with Genette 's terms , when ? despite his explicit warning against doing so ( 230 ) ? I here extend their scope in order to apply them to extratextual reality . My goal in perpetrating this ? transgression ? is to establish as clearly as possible the relation between Genette 's and Smith 's terms.13 This is not to imply that examples of figurative language and/or irony are not to be found in a ? history ? . Obviously , they are . But such uses of p. 67 language in a ? history ? are ultimately subordinated to a structure that is not regarded as figurative . My claim for fictive discourse ( following Smith ) is that its structure is ultimately regarded as figurative . <p> 10.2 ( 1990 ) <p> Narrative Levels <p> 67 <p> As Smith has it : ? Poems and novels , as opposed to biographies and histories of the Civil War , are linguistic structures whose relation to the world is short-circuited ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? complete the connection ? , to infer a plausible yet equally fictive context for the fictive text ( 33 ) . It is in Don Quijote that this process of inference and interpretation may be seen in all its exuberance , because it is a text that specifically and self-reflexively exhibits its own status as fiction . It accomplishes this by way of two essential gestures . One is the extended game that it makes of pretending to be history . This pretense is so obvious and so consistently self-conscious that it effectively undermines any possibility of belief in the ostensible veracity of the ? historia. ? The various narrative transgressions noted above ( such as the inclusion of the author , Miguel de Cervantes , along with a multitude of implied writers and readers , within the intradiegetic level of narrative ) are means by which the novel points to the fictive nature of its own ? reality ? . The most important effect of this game of pretense and dizzying transgression is , finally , the parodic defamiliarization of the narrative authority of history . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As has often been noted , it parodies one of the supremely idealistic fictional forms that had been in vogue throughout the sixteenth century : the books of knighthood . At the same time , it constitutes a parody and , consequently , a questioning of the ostensible reality and authority of ( written or printed ) history itself . As Robert Alter has stated in Partial Magic , his brilliant study of the novel as a ? self conscious ? genre , ? the novel begins out of an erosion of belief in the written word and it begins with Cervantes ? ( 3 ; quoted by Parr 21 ) . Secondly , Don Quijote presents explicitly what is implicit in every fictive discourse : various extradiegetic levels of different degrees ? both actual and potential ? separate the real-life , historical Cervantes ( and his real-life , historical readers ) from the intradiegetic level of narrative on which Don Quijote and Sancho have their adventures . These extradiegetic levels may be inferred from all of the various intermediating ? voices and presences ? through which we , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 68 <p> CHARLES ORIEL <p> Cervantes <p> One of these narrative voices ? the so-called ? first author ? ? provides the material from chapter 1 until near the end of chapter 8 of Part I. At that point , we learn that this material has been mediated by a ? supernarrator ? ( Parr 9-11 ) , who refers to a ? second author , ? who ( in turn ) refers in chapter 9 to the old Arabic manuscript that is the source of all the succeeding material and that has been rendered into Spanish by an anonymous and reportedly unreliable Moorish translator . In the midst of this narrative labyrinth is that enigmatic historian , Cide Hamete Benengeli , who is , ostensibly , the ? source ? . But the obvious question ( of which Cide Hamete himself is a constant reminder ) has been begged and hangs inexorably over the entire rest of the novel : what other texts , authors , worlds , might lie behind him ? The distances and relationships among these various extradiegetic levels are ? spaces ? of indeterminacy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quixote 162 ) . It is this same indeterminacy which is both the process and the product of all fictive discourse . The basic , intradiegetic level of narrative in Don Quijote is irremediably encrusted ( from without ) by various and largely indeterminate levels of extradiegesis . In the same way , it is ? infected ? ( from within ) by various examples of metadiegetic narration ? some fictive , some not ? of which Cardenio 's story is only one example . Earlier , I noted two prominent characteristics of the novel 's presentation of Cardenio , namely , its fragmentary quality and its explicit perspectivism . These qualities are , of course , also prominent in the structure of Don Quijote as a whole , precisely by way of these same narrative levels . The ? reality ? of the Quijote is a fragmentary conglomerate of various narrative levels and perspectives , and the ways in which they may , potentially , be related . E. C. Riley emphasizes this idea in his Cervantes 's Theory of the Novel : ? there is in fact an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Englobed in Don Quixote , by allusion or by inference , are all the possible partial accounts of Don Quixote ? ( 219 ) . In his ? Introduction to the Quijote ? ( as well as in other essays ) , AmTrico Castro similarly notes the dynamic perspectivism that is the basis of Cervantes 's masterpiece : <p> The Quijote is founded on the supposition that the objects for which men strive , about which they think , and with which they live have a changing reality . They are lodged in no sure resting place : a thing seems to be this , but it may be who knows what . . . . The observer and what he observes do not <p> 10.2 ( 1990 ) <p> Narrative Levels <p> 69 <p> necessarily or even usually coincide in a manner acceptable as valid by other observers ( An Idea of History 115 ) . <p> Genette 's system of narrative levels ? representing an unabashedly aesthetic approach to narrative texts ? is implicitly related to this perspectivist orientation , for each of the embedded narrative levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distinction between ? history ? and ? fiction ? ( based upon Genette and Smith ) that I have discussed in this essay is by no means an absolute one . The important fact about these categories is that they are not inherent or formally implicit in any given discourse . Much like Genette 's terms for distinguishing narrative levels , they are functional , relative categories , which is to say that they distinguish , not types of texts , but ways of reading . In theory , we may read any given text as either a natural utterance or as fictive discourse.14 Novels , for example , may be read ( and have been read , as we all know ) as strictly historical , sociological , or biographical documents . But to do so is to limit drastically their possibilities of signification ; even further , it is to abolish their status as fictive discourses . For this reason and for many other more obvious ones , reading novels as though they were history can be a very dangerous enterprise , one which , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cause of his madness and the focus of the entire novel is the nature of reading itself : its conventions , its uses , its abuses . Cervantes 's novel provides us with a veritable map of both reading and misreading . An important effect , then , of putting into play the various narrative levels in Don Quijote is to unsettle the reader with a proliferation of narrative voices ( and implied points of view ) that both force and enable a suspension of judgment as to their authenticity and authority . For this reason , Cervantes 's masterpiece <p> 14 The deconstructionist point of view , for example , would insist upon the essentially fictive quality of all texts , regardless of their ostensibly ? fictive ? or ? natural ? status . In this regard , the deconstructionists ( as readers ) are at precisely the other end of the spectrum from Don Quijote and , say , Palomeque . The former represent a totally ? faithless ? reading of texts , a reading that is incessantly aware of the artificiality of all texts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , represent a totally ? faithful ? reading , one that is lacking in critical distance and that sees no difference between ? text ? and ? life ? . It is interesting ? and rather paradoxical ? to note that the deconstructionist view leads ( by a road coming from the opposite direction ) to the same conclusion , i.e. , that there is no difference between ? text ? and ? life ? , that there is literally ? nothing outside the text. ? <p> 70 <p> CHARLES ORIEL <p> Cervantes <p> is supremely ? dialogic ? , in all the Bakhtinian senses of that term . The discourses of Don Quijote are truly subversive ( and self-subverting ) , as Parr makes abundantly clear : ? one voice undermines its predecessor , subverting its authority , only to have the process reinforce itself in an infinite regress until all narrative authority , and implicitly the authority of the printed page itself , is called into question ? ( 9 ) . The universe of Don Quijote is a relational one , de-centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is that the ostensible reality or ? center ? of the novel ? what I have postulated throughout as the ? basic ? , intradiegetic level of narrative ? is both everywhere and nowhere : fragmented and diffused among a multitude of competing , mutually contradictory , and self-contradictory discourses . The reader is suspended among these various discourses : thrust ( at least in a strictly parodic sense ) into the same ? twilight zone ? as Don Quijote , ? Reader ? . And , while Genette 's and Smith 's systems may not help us see our way out of the delightful confusion that constitutes the Quijote ( and the modern novel ) , I believe they offer us theories by which we may more clearly articulate and examine the ways in which we are confused . Because Don Quijote represents the extreme of the confusion of various levels and various worlds , he is also thoroughly representative of the kinds of reality that we , as readers , experience .

It is an entertaining , dramatic , engaging and educational journey initially describing the condition of the " First West " ( chapter 2 ) from 1722-1772 .

" Here Jones tells of William 's efforts to home-school himself through studies ranging from Aristotle to Astronomy , world history and local woodland crafts . By the age of twenty-two , Clark entered the service of his country and remained so attended for the rest of his life ( p. 65 ) . Indeed , as Jones describes Clark 's military education , " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supplying one-quarter of the United State Army on the move through hostile territory " ( p. 75 ) . Such quartermaster skills would serve him well over his federal career . <p> Additionally , during this early period of his military career , Clark gained firsthand knowledge of not only the processes being administered to Native Americans by both the British and Americans ( British desires for trade , American for land control ) but also how to best maximize land control with people whose perceptions of private ownership were completely different from those of the growing American population . By the age of twenty-five , William Clark was committed to his federal , military career path ( p. 86 ) . <p> The eight-year period from 1795 to 1803 , leading to the Voyage of Discovery , constitutes chapter 4 , " Soldier and Citizen : 1795-1803 .

Cheerfully , Jones notes , Clark accepted Lewis 's invitation . <p> Chapter 5 , " ' Ocian in view ! O ! the joy ! ' : 1803-1806 , " is a short , succinct , exposition of the Lewis and Clark Expedition .

The importance of the journey is underscored with descriptions of Clark 's leadership abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both his party members and the fifty-some different Indian cultures the party encountered during its course . In this chapter the " stuff " that Clark has learned is put to the test and his success as an adaptive , innovative decision-maker is projected . <p> Throughout chapter 6 , " This Wild Country : 1806-1809 , " Clark 's life remains busy : he is appointed brigadier general of the territorial militia for the Louisiana Territory and principal U.S. Indian agent in St. Louis , becomes engaged to and marries Julia Hancock , and begins to feel the effects of poor administrative decisions made in Washington , D.C. His skills honed in exploration of the territory are put to test . His personal attributes as a member of the landed gentry are described in short order as having been " compelled to use the whip " ( p. 164 ) . Clark 's Virginia slave-holder-based heritage continued to maintain sway in the face of increased democratic changes in the western air . <p> Jones interjects excellently timed tidbits of reality to help readers appreciate nineteenth-century experiences of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes of the timeliness , or lack thereof , of written guidance for treaty-making with the various tribes in the trans-Mississippi region : " it still took forty-two days for a letter to reach St. Louis from Washington . " These interjections provide readers with a different sense of decision-making ; interpretation of orders becomes more fluid and the range of possibilities for event outcomes is magnified considerably . <p> Administrative stress began to take its toll on both Lewis and Clark . The differences between field and administrative command are accentuated in Jones ' writing . In the late summer of 1809 Lewis decided to go to Washington to raise needed capital as a result of decisions made to not honor payments made by Lewis beyond contracted amounts . This news had deadly impact on Lewis 's creditors who began to circle ever closer to him . Once again , land became the selling target for debts incurred ; like the Indians , he was using land as capital for debt reduction ( p. 176 ) . Along the way to Washington , tragedy struck Lewis . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . Clark learned of it after the fact and was devastated . <p> Over the next five years , as shown in chapter 5 , " Life without Lewis : 1809-1813 , " Clark engaged in the publishing of the Journals of the Voyage of Discovery , with Nicholas Biddle . He completed a magnificent map measuring some eight square feet which provided much-needed detail to the previously blank cartography of the Louisiana Purchase and the Voyage of Discovery . His genuine cartographic expertise demonstrated to all concerned that no easy route across the continent was to be found . During these interactions with Biddle , the vexing question of Clark 's official rank was discussed . Clark described his role as " equal in every point of view " but for Thomas Jefferson , Clark was a " loyal and successful second in command " ( p. 200 ) . <p> The War of 1812 fell upon the country , and the parallel wars with and among Indian populations exacerbated white populations ' fears and concerns regarding federal support . In the West , the major issues for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative changes originating from Louisiana 's statehood and Missouri 's designation as a second-class territorial government , the opportunities for rival politics to play out blossomed . In this military-oriented setting , Clark demonstrated his command abilities with not only the regular army and militias , but also with the Indian populations . <p> He was given responsibility for all Indian Office affairs as well as the territorial administration , in addition to the direct command of both territorial militias and the regular army of the United States ( pp. 212-213 ) . Jones aptly writes , " At the age of forty-two , William Clark had become the most powerful American in the West " ( p. 213 ) . <p> Chapter 8 , " Territorial Governor : 1813-1820 , " opens with the good news/bad news report of the publication of the two-volume history of the Lewis and Clark expedition .

Local citizens sought revenge for what were perceived as assaults without federal response while President Monroe ordered Clark to convene the " first great treaty council ever held west of the Mississippi " ( p. 226 ) . By the end of 1815 treaties had been sealed between the United States and the various tribes on the Upper Mississippi and the Great Plains ( p. 233 ) . In consequence to the ending of the War of 1812 , migration across the Mississippi exploded , creating more administrative problems for Clark as invading whites encroached upon tribal ground . <p> Jones ably describes the shifting ground upon which Clark struggled to maintain balance . Clark , recognizing the opportunity for personal gain as the white citizenry grew , developed partnerships for business ventures . He dealt with conflicting constituencies ( his Creole-based , Virginia-landed personal history and the newly emerging capitalist , mercantile groups ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians under his authority . Much of the chapter is given over to descriptions of the relocation of tribes across the Mississippi . The subject of how the land was acquired from western tribes to generate land for eastern relocatees is masterfully explained and interpreted . <p> Clark 's familial history and ties with " old " Virginia and Kentucky value systems created political difficulties for him in the pre-industrial Missourian political setting . Nonetheless , Clark 's abilities to negotiate sustained him as an administrator and he " all but single-handedly extinguished most of the Indian titles in two future states--Missouri and Arkansas--for a total of 51 million acres " ( p. 248 ) . <p> The chapter culminates with Missouri 's entry into the United States as a slave state and Clark 's sound defeat as gubernatorial candidate as well as the with death of his wife Julia . Jones explains the probable reasons for the shift in public attitude as perhaps more of a " referendum on the old territorial elite " ( p. 254 ) and closes noting that " At the age of fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects . As he had been so many times before , William Clark was ready to proceed on " ( p. 255 ) . <p> Chapter 9 , " ' The Red-Headed Chief ' : 1820-1829 " recounts Clark 's ability to adapt strengths to situation . This remarkable capacity , rectitude and the contentment of situation , which guided him throughout his lifelong career , re-emerged in his role as Superintendent of Indian Affairs . The Superintendent 's post was to protect the treaty rights of Native Americans . <p> Here , it seemed , Clark could concentrate on less conflicting sets of problems . Yet , even here , the role of Superintendent was conflicted from within . What were the territorial limits of the position ? Was the line drawn at the Missouri borders ?

@@40786669 @786669/ <p> Professor I. M. Lewis 's fifty-year-long observation of Somali society has left us with a bequest that is at once informative and insightful yet misleadingly stereotypical . This brief review points out the values of this problematic offering to those interested in the evolution of Somalia and , most importantly , the Somalis themselves . <p> By sheer seniority and quantity of production , there is a consensus among scholars of Somali society that Lewis , along with the late and acutely missed B. W. Andrzejewski , is a founding and durable member of Somali studies in the English-speaking world . This volume , perhaps more than any of his other works , captures his crucial contribution and influence , as well as underscores the severe limitations of his ouevre . Given the constraints of space , it is not possible to be comprehensive on either of the two accounts . Consequently , I will simply identify a few choice points that capture some of the credit and the liabilities . I will end with a comment on a sharp and accusatory assertion Lewis makes in the preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Somali is laid out in eleven chapters that start with the landscape and the structures of social life ; it concludes with the demise of the national state , the current time of dissolution , and the search for a new and workable post-Siyaad Barre existence . With the convenience of a portable volume , the work is typified by a highly compressed historical narrative . <p> Second , guided by the perspective of a social anthropologist , the framework that conditions , if not determines , the flow of analysis and , subsequently , the task of making meaning out of Somali lifeworlds is identity formation in the form of clan-belonging . This approach equips the reader with a seductive simplicity that ostensibly cuts quickly to the heart of what is at stake , no matter what other complexities might transpire . In short , to decipher any Somali context , a stranger need only ask the clan affiliations of the protagonists . <p> Third , A Modern History of the Somali gives particular attention to the evolution of the state and politics . This includes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various regimes and their policies . Fourth , Lewis presents pithy observations on the personality of the longest-serving ( over two decades ) president of the Somali Republic , General Mohammed Siyaad Barre . Fifth , Lewis puts forth an unequivocal indictment of the incompetence of the United Nations 's intervention in the early 1990s and the resultant waste of international resources . On the latter , he writes : <p> " Of the U.S. $1.6 billion allocated for UNOSOM 's military operations up to the end of 1993 , a mere 4 percent was estimated to enter the Somali economy , mostly to the benefit of warlords and other operators and entrepreneurs . Thus , this inequitable distribution of indirect foreign ' foreign aid ' was doubly destructive in the boost it gave to warlord activity . An even more disgraceful legacy of UNOSOM was the number of instances which later came to light of torture and human rights abuses by the U.N . contingent forces . " ( p. 280 ) <p> In terms of liabilities , the volume suffers from avoidable factual errors . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice the " four and a half million " that Lewis states in the first sentence of chapter 1 . Despite the 2002 updating , this estimate is way off the mark . The Ogaden War with Ethiopia did not take place in 1974 ( p. 300 ) , but in 1977-78 . The BBC Somali Service ceased to appoint a non-Somali speaker to monitor the " neutral news reporting " as early as the 1970s . Such a termination had little to do with saving money , and more with a growing professional integrity and competence of the Somali broadcasting staff . If there is a degeneration in this area , it is primarily part of the ramifications of the spread of the politics of decay in the late 1980s and subsequent civil strife . The May 31 , 2001 , " National Referendum " to " confirm Somaliland 's independence " was not " carefully prepared nor widely publicized " ( p. 302 ) . To the contrary , there was hardly any time and room for debate . More to the point , the process was intimidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically significant zone of the population ( particularly in the East ) refused to participate in both the referendum and the 2003 " presidential elections . " <p> Second , Lewis has always castigated non-anthropologists , with more venom towards fellow anthropologists with different approaches than his , for transgressing into what he deems to be his preserve . If that be the case , one must ask why Lewis has undertaken this project , an assignment , according to his rules of scholarly ownership , that must solely belong to historians . Moreover , Lewis 's history completely underplays the crueler and costlier colonial conquests , yet he goes out of his way to lambast , and rightly so , the corruption and ineptitude of the United Nations or Somali regimes . <p> Third , Lewis 's epistemology is monistic as well as static . This major deficiency amounts to one controlling factor , i.e. , clan--and an extravagant essentialization of the coexistence of primordiality and violence in Somali history ( pp. 263 and 308 ) . For a work that sets for itself the task of mapping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little attention paid to change . The exception is the appearance and departure of individuals in admittedly intriguing but episodic happenings . Those who care to avoid this liability may want to acquaint themselves with the useful and portable methodological instructions of Fernand Braudel . <p> Fourth , the volume makes no attempt to link up with the Africanist scholarly literature on such relevant topics as decolonization , state formation , and communal strife . In this context , Rwanda , Congo , Liberia , and Sierra Leone come to mind . Furthermore , African Studies is also rich in analysis on forms of personal rule and its implications for governance and the ordering of social existence . <p> Fifth , Lewis 's interpretations are curiously partisan . Here , for example , Siyaad Barre is excoriated for his dictatorial appetite , while Mohamed Ibrahim Egal , known across the Somali territory for his unmatched malfeasance and animus towards anyone more educated or competent , is handled with a soft touch , if not outright affirmation ( p. 284 ) . In addition , Lewis is so sold on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to hold on to their nationalist credo as cohorts driven by self-interest . On the other hand , chauvinistic regionalists bent on dismembering the Somali Republic are portrayed as honorable , and with the right cause to boot . But it was not always like this with Lewis 's work . Well into Siyaad Barre 's rule , Lewis produced essays that celebrated the new order and what he thought it portended . What is one to make of these drastically shifting optics ? <p> Sixth , a volume as ambitious in scope and transdisciplinarity as this can not afford to avoid engaging , and hopefully constructively , the growing literature in Somali Studies . The works of Lee Cassanelli , Abdi Ismail Samatar , Lidwien Kapteijns , Ali Jimale Ahmed , Peter Little , and Catherine Besteman , among others , are absent . This point is important when some of these writings starkly challenge the ontological ( units of reality ) assumptions , epistemological operation and evidence , and societal implications of Lewis 's own thinking . Here , one might opine that one effect of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unopposed profundity that characterized Lewis 's work for the better part of three decades . <p> Seventh , Lewis states in his preface : " Those who would impose their distorting Eurocentric ideological view of the world on Somali social phenomena , thus depriving them of originality and vitality are , in my view , engaged in an endeavor akin to racism " ( p. viii ) . On the surface , this assertion conveys the impression of a scholar protective of the autonomy of people he cares about . Moreover , there is always the present danger of a perspective hatched in one cultural time imperiously landing on a different other . On this account , the indictment is noted . But there is another , perhaps even more pernicious approach--that is , one that at once denies Somalis access to the experience and wisdom of the rest of the human race and , therefore , freezes Somalis into an exotic reality available only from the insights of a self-chosen guru . <p> To conclude , Somali society is enveloped by a complex contemporaneity whose pitiless coordinates seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of post-colonial rot is exemplified , and then compounded , by the death of the national state and the collateral pursuit of feral personal utilities--all in a context of generalized maldevelopment and diminished reality . Consequently , Lewis 's exclusive focus on a single and ostensibly eternal factor is incongruent with the methods and theories of social and historical studies . This volume , then , at its best , offers partial discernment ; and , at its lowest , betrays superficiality and obsolescence.

Ithaca : Cornell University Press , 1992. 289 pp . <p> With courage and conviction , FTlix Martfnez-Bonati takes on nearly the entire establishment of Cervantists from MenTndez Pelayo and Rodrfguez Marfn to Ortega y Gasset , AmTrico Castro , and most Cervantine scholars of today . Not that this is a broadside attack , nor is it an inimical one . With a nod toward those aspects with which critics have provided him with food for thought , Martfnez-Bonati makes it politely and definitely clear that the proper reading of Don Quixote has not yet been achieved . His aim is nothing less than to ? consider some very generalized points of confusion that obstruct the correct understanding of the Cervantine text ? ( 4 ) . If his theses are valid , he declares , his reading ? is the original reading , that of an educated contemporary of Cervantes . At the same time it is the best reading , forever prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems boastful , this is a modest claim ? ( 231 ) . Cervantists may be surprised to learn that there is no ? pensamiento de Cervantes ? in Don Quixote , that is , ? the thought of the Quixote is not the thought of Cervantes ' ( xiv ) ; that ? the philosophy ( including the literary theory ) present in the Cervantine work is insignificant ? ( 20 ) ; that ? the question whether the Quixote is the first modern novel , the prototype of the genre , can not be answered in the affirmative ? ( 64 ) ; that the <p> 102 <p> 14.1 ( 1994 ) <p> Review <p> 103 <p> ? Cervantine discourse ( except in occasional speeches by Don Quixote ) is never like the chivalric , not even when it introduces familiar motifs from books of chivalry ? ( 75 ) ; that ? the explicit theme of the evil of books of chivalry in the Quixote has to be understood as a superficial motif ? ( 16 ) . At times the author gets caught up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the reaction of Don Fernando and others to Dorotea 's story ( ? they wished it had lasted longer , such was the charm with which Dorotea described her sad experiences ? ) and Don Fernando 's reaction to the captive 's tale ( ? we should be glad if we could hear it all over again ? ) , Martfnez-Bonati calls our attention to ? these duplicities of a meta-poetic dimension , ? ? transregional speech acts ? ( 71 ) , and ? dislocated literary commentary ? ( 259 ) . Although I can not disagree with him , is all this nomenclature really necessary ? Does it not suffice to say that the characters , suffering from the boredom of their ( admittedly literary ) existence , find interest in the travails of others , much as devotees of escapist fiction , mystery stories , and horror movies are wont to do ? And do such reactions of supposedly rational people not mirror the protagonist 's own inability to separate art and reality ? Is this evident point made any clearer by the labels cited above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aristotelian norm of the absolute beginning ? by presenting Anselmo 's case ( ? El curioso impertinente ? ) as without cause . Anselmo 's ? tragic error is unmotivated ; nevertheless , to a penetrating intuition it is part of the unfathomable order of nature ? ( 206 ) . It sounds very erudite , yet I suggest a much simpler explanation . There is a cause , and it is the obsession with the loss of honor because of the possible actions of one 's wife , the essence of much of the Golden Age comedia . Cervantes ' position regarding the Lopean presentation of this theme is well known . Anselmo 's irrational behavior is in reality the product of his rational reductio ad absurdum of this concern . And we find it purposefully exaggerated in other psychotic cases in Cervantine writings , notably in El celoso extremeo and El viejo celoso . But this would argue for Cervantes ' thought to be found in his literary creations , something Martfnez-Bonati rejects ( although at one point he does indulge in biographical conjecture , admitting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for myself ? 212 ) . We read of ? the rigorous silence that is maintained in the work with respect to Don Quixote 's past . . . . All that we know of him and the others is what has occurred in these few months of his insanity . There are no recollections or narrative anticipations that go beyond this circumscription ? ( 97 ) . Yet we are then given a list of details ? isolated to be sure ? that do give us slight glimpses into the protagonist 's past , such as his having seen Aldonza Lorenzo and his boyhood fondness for the theater . But such instances , says Martfnez-Bonati , are related ? in the modality of uncertainty ? ( 97 ) , by which is meant a qualifier like ( ? according to what is understood ? ) . I leave aside the cumbersome nature of such phraseology , just as the author leaves aside other hints about the protagonist 's past , such as the reference <p> 104 <p> JOHN G. WEIGER <p> Cervantes <p> to his paternal grandmother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.49 ) , in which no uncertainty is suggested , though it is true that these are statements by Don Quixote himself ( which apparently is what disqualifies his assertion that he has not seen Aldonza as many as four times ) . But my quarrel is not with the veracity or uncertainty of these details . The fact is that such qualifiers abound in the Quixote , yet Martfnez-Bonati cites them only in references to the protagonist 's past or future in order to make the point that such exceptions to the norm ( of limiting the time frame to the events recounted in the book ) ? stand out and even surprise us , thereby confirming this design of almost chronicle-like closure ? ( 97 ) . I am not sure what is meant by ? almost chronicle-like , ? but although I agree with the general thrust of the argument here , the use of the ? modality of uncertainty ? to make the simple point is irrelevant unless all the many other statements like ? as far as what is believed ? are similarly scrutinized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two distinct works , we are told , in support of which Martfnez-Bonati cites Casalduero 's use of ? ? the 1605 Quixote ? and ? the 1615 Quixote ? ? ( 93 ) . What are we to conclude then , when Martfnez-Bonati himself refers to ? the 1605 book , ? ? the 1605 Quixote , ? and the ? 1605 work ? ( 106-107 ) ? Clearly , Martfnez-Bonati does not treat the two parts as distinct works . Though it is not inaccurate to say that Casalduero does , the use of these locutions , as in the cases of ? modality of uncertainty , ? amounts to the accommodation of a text to support a point of view . Martfnez-Bonati confuses the role of the narrator . At one point he speaks of the ? parodical posture of ? historian ? assumed by the fictional narrator ? ( 6 ) , thereby confusing the narrator and the fictional historian , Cide Hamete . He later corrects this view by declaring what most Cervantists understand quite well , namely that the narrator ? is in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not even a formal reason to call him Cide Hamete , since he quotes Cide Hamete 's words as those of another person ? ( 101-02 ) . At another point he refers to Don Quixote 's interment at the end of Part I , mentioned by the same narrator who ? makes the writer Cervantes a friend of the Curate , so that Don Quixote becomes a contemporary of the narrator ? ( 81 ) , erroneously equating the fictive narrator with the author of the 1585 Galatea . ( It is the inclusion of the historical Cervantes as a friend of the fictional curate that is at issue here . The narrator is not the author ? fictive or historical ? alluded to by the priest . The irony lies in the book 's inclusion in Don Quixote 's library ; the narrator here serves only to narrate that ? fact. ? ) It is also confusing , at least to me , how it is the narrator who ? makes Don Quixote learn about the publication and translation ? of Cide Hamete 's volume one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? narrator-author. ? Although he concedes that there is some inconsistent evolution in the characters , Martfnez-Bonati allows himself to be taken in by the fictive translator 's interjections in II.5 . Granted that Sancho has not been transformed <p> 14.1 ( 1994 ) <p> Review <p> 105 <p> from peasant to solon , his constant contact with Don Quixote 's stories can not help but have their effect . We already see in Part I how Don Quixote 's narrative not only captured Sancho 's imagination but , parallel to Don Quixote 's own path to madness , the story made Sancho so oblivious to his own circumstances that he forgot he had a wife and family ( I.21 ) . And in I.29 , Sancho is perfectly prepared to believe that his master can kill the giant that has aggrieved Princess Micomicona , though he does not believe that Don Quixote can deal with phantoms . ( Not to be missed is Sancho 's use of ? desfaga ? here . ) Yet Martfnez-Bonati insists that ? the characters of the protagonists remain essentially unchanged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 268 ; emphasis mine ) , though elsewhere he allows that ? Don Quixote and Sancho change considerably and inverisimilarly in physical aspect and in personality during the course of the work ? ( 102 ) . Why is it so difficult to believe that in a private conversation with his wife months later , Sancho will mimic his master 's way of talking ? And , as he himself says in that chapter , much of what he says is not of his own invention , ? for all that I mean to say are the judgments of the reverend father who preached in this town the past Lent , ? an explanation he also uses for one of his ? Solomonic ? judgments as governor . And if we are to credit the ? translator ? here , the entire chapter is apocryphal , yet in the very next chapter the narrator refers to Sancho 's wife as Teresa Cascajo , as she had insisted in that ? apocryphal ? chapter . Martfnez-Bonati is a fine reader of detail . He notes , for instance , that during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow focus is centered on the foreground , leaving Don Diego 's wife completely out of vision . If most of us are aware of this , how many will also have noticed that the range of vision , ? with no explanation , . . . even excludes Sancho ? ( 100 ) ? What this reviewer misses , however , is Martfnez-Bonati 's explanation of this exclusion . Similarly , reference is made to passages of ? silent irony , ? and we are told that ? there is a good example in I.21 ? ( 101 ) . Cervantists may be expected to recall this chapter 's content , but why not simply tell us ? If there is a reason to bring such matters to our attention , why are we not given the benefit of the author 's insight ? And why is it necessary to tell us , when citing a passage from Genesis , that Abraham was ? at that time called Abram ? ( 205 ) ? On the other hand , the author is very clear when he explains why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the inn following his stay in the Sierra Morena : not for psychological reasons pertaining to his character but for ? metapoetic reasons ? ( 235 ) . That is , he would simply be in the way of the conclusion of the stories that find their denouement at the inn . Here Martfnez-Bonati criticizes Howard Mancing 's reading as ? out of place. ? ( On an earlier occasion , he similarly labels Mancing 's assumption about the characterization of the priest ? out of place ? 87 . ) The same argument regarding Don Quixote 's disappearance at the inn is presented elsewhere in the volume to refute E.C . Riley 's ? one-dimensional ? and ? mistaken ? reading ( 58 ) . Martfnez-Bonati 's argument is coherent , particularly given the perspective applied to <p> 106 <p> JOHN G. WEIGER <p> Cervantes <p> his analysis , but it is unfortunate that at times the tone of such disagreements takes on the appearance of condescension : The volume ends with a nod to ? contemporary Cervantes scholarship , which owes a great deal to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This book is not intended to be a series of interpretations of the episodes of Don Quixote .

It is not an easy book to read , partly because of its heavy reliance on nomenclature , partly because of its complex sentences that are often marred by parenthetical commentary that tends to divert the reader 's focus . Nonetheless , it is an important book. ? Don Quixote ? and the Poetics of the Novel is a thought-provoking study .

@@40786672 @786672/ <p> Reviewed by Dave Pretty ( University of Colorado at Boulder ) Published on H-Russia ( February , 1998 ) <p> In the preface to this massive tome , Orlando Figes states that A People 's Tragedy is " the first attempt at a comprehensive history of the entire revolutionary period in a single volume " ( p. xv ) . In general , he has been as successful as anyone could be setting oneself such a herculean task . While there is much to argue with , Figes has done an admirable job of providing narrative force to a convoluted tale without obscuring the complex interactions of society , ideology , and nationality operating at every stage of the revolutionary process . His greatest achievement is a humanistic one : giving social forces , political change , and cultural ferment flesh and bones by focusing on the people who made and experienced the far too interesting times he describes . <p> Figes explicitly positions himself between the " politicized ' top-down ' histories " of the Cold War era and " the ' bottom-up ' approach so fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , " whom , he suggests , would state that " a people gets the rulers it deserves . " While that creates a straw man out of " revisionists " ( unfortunately , the other end of the spectrum needs no caricaturists , as one major figure 's reactions to this very volume attest ) , Figes heavily relies on the " rich and growing literature " by recent historians of Russian society who " have given us a much more complex and convincing picture of the relationship between the party and the people " in a revolution that " was as often shaped by local passions and interests " as by a centrally prescribed ideology . This book " is an attempt to synthesize this reappraisal and to push the argument one stage further , to show ... that what began as a people 's revolution contained the seeds of its own degeneration into violence and dictatorship . The same social forces which brought about the triumph of the Bolshevik regime became its main victims " ( p. xvi ) . <p> This does not fit perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victims of the revolution but protagonists in its tragedy ... a tragedy which they helped to make .

By 1921 , if not earlier , the revolution had come full circle , and a new autocracy had been imposed on Russia which in many ways resembled the old one " ( p. 808 ) . <p> The Road to Revolution <p> The first section of this book examines Russian state and society in the years leading up to 1905 . In these chapters , three traits present throughout the book first manifest themselves ( and which will be discussed at greater length below ) : despair at the cultural backwardness of the Russian people , a deep sympathy with those working to reform Russia along liberal lines , and a profound irritation , verging on anger , with those who ruled Russia . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the famine crisis of 1891 through the revolution of 1905 , the Stolypin regime and Duma system , and the years of the First World War . It is telling that Figes begins his account in 1891 , when for the first time the autocracy admitted its inability , without the aid of civil society , to cope with the famine disaster . Russians across the political spectrum responded ; this was " the moment when Russian society first became politically aware of itself and its powers ... and of the potential it had to govern itself " ( p. 162 ) . However , once the crisis was over , the regime refused to accommodate these civic strivings ; it is a leitmotif of this section that , as with the zemstvo movement , " as so often during its political downfall , the old regime chose repression instead of compromise and thus created the political hostility of the zemstvos " ( p. 164 ) . The promises of the October Manifesto would be reneged on , Stolypin 's attempts to create the social and constitutional bases for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and autocratic military incompetence , coupled with a reluctance to marshal the forces of society , so crippled the war effort that by the beginning of 1917 even the military leadership would welcome a change of regime . <p> This is a familiar story , but Figes tells it well . He is particularly good on what Stolypin set out to do , and why this was almost certainly a sisyphean task ; his one-paragraph comparison of Stolypin and Gorbachev ( p. 222 ) is as concise and persuasive as this reader has seen . Figes is adamant that by 1914 there was no hope that the tsarist system would ever reform itself and that the liberal solution was already largely discredited in the people 's eyes , and he seems to side with those who see Russia already on the eve of revolution in the summer of 1914 . <p> Most of the third section , on 1917 , concentrates on how the liberals who assumed state responsibility in February , and the moderate socialists who had real authority through the soviet executive , were both just as trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals ' belief in a nonintrusive and decentralized state prevented them from either violently repressing opposition or reining in the centrifugal flight of authority from Petrograd . The moderate socialists ' fear of counterrevolution , fear of violence , and dogmatic insistence on the necessity of a " bourgeois " phase prevented them at several moments--February , the April Crisis , the July Days , and following the Kornilov debacle--from taking power despite demands by their constituents that they do so . " In this way , " insists Figes , " they missed their chance to resolve the revolution in a democratic and socialist form " ( p. 331 ) . And both groups were suicidally disinclined to make a separate peace with the Central Powers and remove the single most important cause of unrest and instability . One must still ask , however , even if the moderate socialist parties had been able to meet the challenge of the April Theses and had given their support to soviet power , a quick and necessarily disadvantageous peace , and a radical and immediate land settlement , could they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polarization , and preserved the " revolution in a democratic and socialist form " ? One might only glance at Mexico during this same time period , where a revolution being fought by almost all sides in terms of liberalism produced a polity that could only begin to be called democratic at about the same time as Russia ( i.e. , in the 1990s ) . <p> In discussing how the Bolsheviks came to power , Figes recognizes that the Bolsheviks were the most popular party in the soviet movement , that the Second Congress of Soviets would certainly have voted for a transfer of power from the Provisional Government and replaced it with a government in which the Bolsheviks were the most important party , and that Lenin faced a great deal of opposition among Bolsheviks to his demand for an armed insurrection . Figes speculates that Lenin was adamant about seizing power before the soviet congress because he was afraid that he personally would be politically marginalized : the congress " would almost certainly " result in a coalition government , " a resounding political victory for Kamenev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would no doubt emerge as the central figure in such a coalition " ( p. 471 ) . While not beyond the realm of possibility , in order to take seriously a scenario in which Lenin is politically outmaneuvered by Kamenev--even if we are only talking about Lenin 's own fears , which the author does not make clear--one would have to see a lot more evidence and discussion than is presented here . <p> It is from this point on that many assertions become questionable and many arguments confusing , often contradicting evidence put forth elsewhere . For example , Figes presents the October 10 Central Committee meeting as a victory for Lenin , who " once again ... had managed to impose his will on the rest of its leaders " ( pp. 472-73 ) ; however , as his own evidence shows , no date was set for the insurrection , and the seizure of power took place pretty much according to the desires of those who felt that it should be carried out in the name of the soviets and timed to coincide with the congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support on October 10 ( p. 471 ) . Given this , can it really be said that Lenin imposed his will on what Figes himself recognizes was a fractious party , or did he rather have to settle for an ambiguous resolution that only clearly rejected the position of that supposed political threat , Kamenev ? <p> Humanizing History , Demonizing Leaders <p> To understand what in many ways is disappointing about Figes 's account after October 1917 , one must go back and look at what is perhaps the most successful aspect of this book . Along with a fine eye for the telling detail and illuminative anecdote , Figes is able to give the reader a sense of how the revolutionary era felt and what it meant to those who experienced it by following throughout the course of the book the lifepaths of a handful of Russians from various walks of life . These include important figures such as Maxim Gorky , Prince Georgii L'vov , and General Aleksei Brusilov , as well as the **30;122;TOOLONG Semen Kanatchikov , the peasant-activist Sergei Semenov , and the **43;154;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts , there are innumerable short sketches that much more often than not create three-dimensional , understandable characters that easily become flesh-and-blood realities in the reader 's eyes . <p> Of course , some of these characterizations are more successful than others . Figes clearly empathizes most with those who overcame backgrounds of either poverty or privilege to espouse humanistic or pluralistic values that if not liberal were at least liberalizing , especially Gorky , L'vov , Brusilov , and Semenov . These four are the real heroes of this book ( L'vov appears on 70 pages , Gorky on 118 ) ; it is largely through their eyes that the revolution is perceived . On the other hand , Kanatchikov , probably because of meager sources , barely exists between the introductory section on workers and the epilogue , while Os'kin 's personality never really takes shape , again probably due to the rote nature of Soviet-era autobiographies . <p> On the other hand , those who led Russia are in many ways the villains of the piece . Compared to Kerensky and Lenin , Figes gives a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , for all that it is rounded , any less scathing . Blinkered by an ideology that refused to countenance any diminution of his divinely ordained authority , Nicholas time and again ignored the need to reform as an alternative to revolution : " If there was a vacuum at the centre of the ruling system , then he was the empty space " ( p. 23 ) . Figes 's Kerensky is Hamlet as played by Rosencrantz or Guildenstern : a vainglorious buffoon strutting and fretting his hour upon a stage that was dissolving beneath his feet , unable to decide whether to exit stage left or stage right , and completely unaware that the audience was not laughing with him , but at him . The author clearly has too little patience with him to sufficiently explore his aims and motivations , and as a result many of his actions , especially from August through October , are not rendered fully comprehensible . <p> The weakest , least persuasive characterization in this book , however , is also the most important : Lenin . Figes sets this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing much to Lenin : he gave himself entirely to politics . There was no ' private Lenin ' behind the politician " ( p. 389 ) . There is only a " puritanical " ascetic with " philistine " attitudes given to intense " rages " directed at all who disagreed with him . He was monomaniacally devoted the cause of revolution and obtaining power , with a fine but , in Chernov 's phrase , " unilinear mind . " He also had no understanding of the Russian people , having lived abroad for most of the previous two decades ; Figes 's views of Lenin are encapsulated in a passage in which he quotes his favorite character in the morality play of revolution : " According to Gorky , it was this ignorance of everyday work , and the human suffering which it entailed , which had bred in Lenin a ' pitiless contempt , worthy of a nobleman , for the lives of the ordinary people ... Life in all its complexity is unknown to Lenin . He does not know the ordinary people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 386 ) . <p> How then to explain his ability , more than any other politician , to gauge , in his April Theses , which platform the common people would most likely embrace ? How does a man with a unilinear mind dance so deftly between October and Brest-Litovsk , between prodrazverstka and NEP ? Why does this Savonarola of the left tolerate a Gorky in his midst for so long ? How can a man whose only drive was for power find time during war and revolution for a fling with Inessa Armand ? <p> There is no room for ambiguity in Figes 's Lenin , but ambiguity there is . Figes himself recognizes that the " idea that the Bolshevik Party in 1917 was a monolithic organization tightly controlled by Lenin is a myth--a myth which used to be propagated by the Soviet establishment , and one which is still believed ( for quite different motives ) by right-wing historians in the West . " Lenin was often in the minority , and " if in the end he always got his way , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to his many political skills , including persuasion , tactful retreat and compromise , threats of resignation and ultimatums , demagogy and appeals to the rank and file " ( pp. 392-93 ) . But these skills do not seem to fit in with the Lenin we are given elsewhere : how can a monomaniac compromise so well , or a man separate from the people so often successfully appeal to the rank and file ? <p> It is testimony to Figes 's achievement in this book that the lack of dimension to the most important person in it is so jarring . It is as if an Ian Fleming villain had walked in and taken over a John Le Carre novel , a black-and-white stick figure dominating a historical canvas otherwise marked by breathtaking chiaroscuro . Figes is correct to reject the monolithic party of Soviet myth , taken whole into Western historiography , with the moral valuation changed from good to evil , at a time when we had few other sources . He has not , however , overcome the simplistic portrait of the revolution 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toggling of moral assessment , from hero to demon ; it remains just as iconic a representation , lacking depth and perspective . As a result , the last half of this book is permeated with a disconcerting and unresolved tension between what Figes the historian sees , and what Figes the moralist feels . <p> Tensions and Contradictions <p> This tension is in many ways most apparent in the discussion of the period between October 1917 and mid-1918 . To return to the events of October , while Figes is correct that the seizure of power was not a genuine revolution , he also shows that it was far from organized and had a sizeable social component that did not follow orders from the top . As in July , it was only after being pushed by popular actions-- " Despite Trotsky 's calls for discipline , it was hard to stop the defensive actions of the MRC Military Revolutionary Committee from spilling into a general offensive " ( p. 482 ) --that Lenin persuaded the party 's leadership to take control of a process already underway ( what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , when the Mensheviks and SRs walk out of the soviet congress , Figes states that " Lenin 's planned provocation--the pre-emptive seizure of power--had worked .... The path was now clear for the Bolshevik dictatorship , based on the Soviet , which Lenin had no doubt intended all along " ( p. 490 ) . How could Lenin be sure that the other parties would walk out ? Here , as elsewhere , Figes ascribes to Lenin an omniscience more reminiscent of the Soviet icon than of even a very good politician . And while Lenin almost certainly did want a Bolshevik dictatorship , here as--yet again--elsewhere , one can only wish Figes had provided the evidence that would have relieved him of the pressure of inserting a blustery " no doubt . " <p> On the whole , Figes builds Lenin into the determining factor of Soviet history . Speaking of the October revolution , he writes that " few historical events in the modern era better illustrate the decisive effect of an individual on the course of history . Without Lenin 's intervention it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It can not be denied that Lenin was the most important figure in Russian history in this century , but were his efforts more decisive in October than in April 1917 or March 1921 ? Was the October seizure of power in many ways just harvesting in the fall what had been sown in the spring when he persuaded his party to adopt what would become the only political platform enjoying any sympathy among the populace ? Figes does not prove that the Bolsheviks would not have been able to take control through the soviet apparatus . Would the moderate parties have been likely to stay in the congress even without the coup ? If they had , would they have stayed after the Left SR land decree was passed , as it undoubtedly would have been ? Once they left , would a Bolshevik-Left SR-Left Menshevik coalition have suffered any different a fate than the Bolshevik-Left SR coalition ? <p> Figes seems to believe that a broad coalition would have diluted Lenin 's power by allowing Kamenev and other moderate Bolsheviks to unite with other moderates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrays a Bolshevik party with an apparently institutional inability to oppose Lenin 's mercurial will : the Central Committee was " bullied " into censoring Kamenev ( p. 499 ) and the great leader 's resolutions " were usually passed without discussion , since few dared Lenin 's judgement " ( p. 504 ) . If the party was so browbeaten , why does Figes think that Kamenev could have brought enough Bolsheviks with him to construct an effective moderate coalition ? <p> These contradictions abound in Figes 's discussion of early 1918 . Referring to Brest-Litovsk , the author avers that " in his struggle over the treaty , as in his struggle for power itself , Lenin had always been uncompromising . There was no sacrifice he was not prepared to make for the consolidation of the revolution on his own terms " ( p. 550 ) . Yet was not Brest-Litovsk itself a compromise of epic proportions , in which land was traded for the practical political necessity of peace ? Did not Lenin himself later recognize it as a retreat when he used the term " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion when he certainly turned away from consolidating the revolution on his own terms ? Earlier in the negotiating process , did Lenin not retreat from his own positions and back Trotsky 's " neither peace nor war " stance until it proved itself useless ? Again , even though his evidence portrays a thoroughly flexible and adaptive politician , Figes 's thesis statements continue to posit the iconic " uncompromising " Lenin . <p> Neither does Figes discard the " omniscient " Lenin . According to Figes , Lenin allowed the social revolution to run its course , with peasants seizing land , workers taking control of factories , soldiers refusing to fight , and non-Russians declaring independence not because he sympathized with its aims , or even because as a better-than-average politician he realized that there was no way he could stand its path , but because " no doubt Lenin viewed all these movements as a means to destroy the old political system and thus clear the way for the establishment of his own party 's dictatorship . There is of course no proof of this--only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we know of his previous thoughts and actions . " Lenin tolerated the continued social revolution because it was destroying the structures of the old regime , and thus of any possible opposition . He supported workers ' control but " no doubt did so in the knowledge that it would lead to chaos and thus strengthen the need to return to centralized management methods under the party 's control " and " arguably always intended to construct the Red Army on conventional lines " ( pp. 503-4 , emphases added ) . Here is the great , all-seeing Il'ich cast in the granite of Soviet myth , but would it not be more accurate--if admittedly incongruous--to imagine Lenin in these months as a surfer , the only one on the beach skilled , reactive , and supple enough to ride out a wave that was not going to dissipate until it had come all the way into shore ? <p> Figes is superb in discussing the Whites , clearly , gracefully , and empathetically delineating their aims , motives , actions , strengths , weaknesses , and idiocies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political failure to address peasant concerns over land . For the Reds , there is no such empathy , and without empathy--not the same thing as sympathy , mind you--it is very difficult to write good history . <p> As mentioned above , Figes sees Lenin determined from the beginning to perfect a dictatorship . He makes straw men of those who believe that the exigencies of civil war helped determine the authoritarian evolution of the Soviet state by implying that they feel Lenin was " a libertarian at heart " ( p. 503 ) . But can one not believe the former without the latter ? Figes himself recognizes that in early 1918 there was no blueprint for dictatorship , that it was " only during the civil war , when they stressed the need for strict centralized control to mobilize the resources of the country , did the Bolsheviks plan the general structure of the party-state " ( p. 685 ) . He well describes how the egalitarian ethos of military organization lasted in the Red Army until well after it had proven its military ineffectiveness ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of nationalities , Figes recognizes that there was an unresolved issue , but that " during the civil war this question became lost in the exigencies of military struggle " ( p. 704 ) . Could this not have also happened with other aspects of Soviet rule ? And would any other regime that might have resulted from the Second Congress of Soviets have been able to deal with those exigencies in a less centralized manner ? Could a Martov or Kamenev regime have emerged from revolution and civil war if it had been any less authoritarian than , say , Carranza or Obregon ? Figes himself recognizes when discussing the briefly democratic White regimes in Samara and Omsk that in conditions of war and polarization , it was very difficult for a fragile democracy to survive , especially with need to recruit the best people for the bureaucracy , with the most dedicated activists dying at the front , and the urban base on which such a regime would depend shrinking in a demographic implosion . <p> Figes the historian and Figes the moralist clash most discordantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the need to use terror in order to ' defend the revolution , ' " and the order to arrest all SRs and take " bourgeois " hostages in September 1918 was " the signal for the start of the Red Terror " ; however , it " did not come out of the blue but was implict in the regime from the start . " And the " Bolsheviks were forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means " ( p. 630 ) . Lenin wanted terror , but they were " forced " to use it . The Red Terror began in September , but two " landmarks ... in the progress of the Terror " ( p. 632 ) were the Left SR uprising and the murder of the Romanovs , both of which occurred in July . He is very understanding of why the Volunteer army resorted to terror as early as the Ice March in February and March , where he calls the White Terror " a mirror image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. 563 ) . He seems to agree with Shulgin that the horrible pogroms of 1919-1920 " were a White revenge for the Red Terror " ( p. 677 ) . <p> On the other hand , while presenting the Red Terror as a tool of the Bolshevik leadership in creating its dictatorship , a tool which he says ( without citation ) resulted in the deaths of " certainly several hundred thousand " ( p. 649 ) , he is masterful in demonstrating how terror actually first erupted from below in a " mass terror " or " plebeian war on privilege " ( pp. 520-36 ) ; even the Cheka , which like much else was highly decentralized until late 1918 , seems more often to have taken its lead from local popular sentiment and not central fiat . This again raises the question of what was different under the Bolsheviks than any other regime resulting from 1917 ; if a regime had tried to control this terror , what measures could they have used other than a terror of their own ? And , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to exert this terror ? As Figes notes , one reason the Bolsheviks won was because " they were more systematic than the Whites in their use of terror and coercion to extract the necessary military resources " ( p. 668 ) . This leads to the question of whether any regime could have survived without the use of terror . <p> Figes 's feelings of moral revulsion toward the Bolshevik regime lead him time and again to ascribe the blackest motives to the Soviet leaders ' actions , even when his own evidence and , on more minor issues , arguments might suggest a greater admixture of gray . His very questionable assertion that the Soviet Union was an autocracy by 1923 and that the autocrat was already Stalin strikes one as almost designed to lend weight to his judgments against the Bolsheviks of 1917-24 by tarring them with the responsibility for the horrors of the 1930s. 1 <p> Agents or Victims ? <p> This is not , however , the only systemic weakness in this volume , nor is it the only one that colors its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book between Figes 's belief in the agency of the people , on one hand , and the determining role played by cultural and historical constraints . This seems very much the argument of someone who is both a populist and a liberal ; Figes assumes that the people must of course play a role , but , without the civic maturity that only participation in meaningful self-government within a system in whose stability they have a stake and which has provided them with education sufficient to act wisely on behalf of their own enlightened self-interest , " they could not rebuild a new system of their own . " While Figes himself recognizes that the Russian revolution was probably unprecedented in bringing common people to positions of power , for him this was one of the revolution 's major weaknesses : the Russian people , generally poorly educated , were prone to violence , resentful of all those more privileged or more intellectual than they , and willing to use the former to wreak revenge against the latter even if it served no constructive purpose , yet simultaneously were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were easily cowed by those in power . Figes describes a " hysterical " Putilov worker who was stared down by Chkheidze during the July Days as " powerless to resist , not because he lacked the guns , but because he lacked the will . Centuries of serfdom and subservience had not prepared him to stand up to his political masters--and in that lay the tragedy of the Russian people as a whole " ( p. 432 ) . Later , Figes contends that those from the lower classes who acquired authority under the Soviet regime " were not sufficiently educated to think freely for themselves or indeed to question the party leaders on abstract policy issues " ; such a person was a " good comrade who did what he was told and was content to leave all critical thinking to the Central Committee " ( pp. 692-93 ) . <p> In short , the Russian people lacked that delicate balance of emotional restraint and informed assertiveness produced by a civic education and an economically founded interest in stability characteristic of liberal societies , and were thus incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy of the Russian revolution for Figes lay not so much in how it turned out as in that it occurred in the first place ; it is certainly for this reason that over a third of the book is devoted to the factors that produced the February revolution and which rendered an illiberal outcome prohibitively probable . And high on the list of those factors is the peasant 's inclination to violence . <p> As one might expect from someone whose previous monograph was a very important study of the peasantry in the Volga region during the Civil War 2 , Figes is generally very comfortable and persuasive discussing the peasantry . He understands that peasants were not an undifferentiated gray mass but neither were they riven by class stratification ; the real divide tended to be generational . They were willing to change , but only after they had concrete proof of change 's efficacy . He insists on the existence of a peasant ideology ; rather than being only suited to play a destructive role in revolution , " during 1917-18 the peasants proved themselves quite capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of land relations and local trade to education and justice , and in so doing they often revealed a remarkable political sophistication , which did not well up from a moral vacuum " ( p. 98 ) . He also shows that violence played an important role in lower-class Russian life , and that it was this violence that welled up into terror in early 1918 . However , while he goes to great pains to demonstrate how various peasant practices reflected peasant beliefs and how peasant beliefs were often rational responses to the realities of peasant life--and here the reader of this review may detect the distinct whine of an axe being ground--he does not really recognize that violence could also have a rational or instrumental basis . <p> Relating some of the more gruesome punishments inflicted on horse thieves , Figes states that " it is difficult to say where this barbarism came from--whether it was the culture of the Russian peasants , or the harsh environment in which they lived , " but decides that it " was a cruelty made by history , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serfowners and by the state ( p. 96 ) . Thus , when this quotidian violence was freed from restraints in 1917 and 1918 , it was directed against the privileged as retribution . <p> However , was this solely revenge ? In an agrarian society where the margin of existence was usually very narrow , and which was , despite all its rulers ' pretentions , very undergoverned , peasants could not count on the state to protect them from those whose crimes could economically ruin an entire village . Thus , while minor crimes within the village were punished more leniently than the state would , crimes that threatened the community were punished with extravagant cruelty precisely because the aim was not to make the punishment fit the crime but to provide an example spectacular enough to give any other potential wrongdoers pause before trying something similar . While a spike up the rectum might seem barbarous to urbane city dwellers , it made perfectly good sense in the underpoliced countryside . <p> Figes recognizes this when discussing aspects of the mass terror : when the police and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations , including urban samosud , took their place . But Figes sees this evolving after October , as popular justice became less concerned with actual criminals than class warfare ; in people 's courts , cases were not decided on the legal merits but on whether defendants had uncalloused hands . Figes implies that this was merely retribution , but in placing this discussion in the chapter before he begins the civil war , he blurs the continued existence of dangers to a revolution that seemed to have very real enemies . Was this " looting the looters , " or assuring that the looters would not loot again ? Later , in the Civil War , were well-publicized tortures and policies of taking no prisoners--on all sides--merely gratuitous violence , or , in a struggle decided as much by desertion rates as anything else , good sense ? Figes assumes that violence is senseless ; he thus does not see the sense in it . <p> While Figes has a very good theoretical understanding of the ideological tenets and moral beliefs of the majority of the Russian population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tenets and beliefs . When discussing peasants in the abstract , as quoted above , he was able to praise the " remarkable political sophistication " with which peasant would put their belief system into practice in 1917 . On the other hand , by the time he reaches 1917 , this turns instead into the " anarchy and chaos " that occurs whenever Russian central state authority is removed ( p. 360 ) . He recognizes that while there is , as far as the people were concerned , an order within this anarchy and chaos , it is not the order that leads to the building of a mature Western , liberal state . Discussing both the prerevolutionary and post-Communist dumas , Figes suggests that Russians are " by nature especially ill-prepared for the disciplines of parliamentary practice .... Russian democracy can be rather like the Russians themselves : chaotic and disorganized " ( p. 218 ) . <p> Throughout this book , Figes deplores the cultural and political " backwardness " of Russians ; yet what this backwardness consisted of is very protean , changing shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is backward . Yet , as related above , part of their backwardness is a servile subservience that allows the Bolshevik leadership to control their flock . Figes knows that what he describes as backwardness is not a lack of culture ; he describes Russian peasant culture quite well . It is rather a lack of civic-minded , nation-oriented liberal culture : " Russia was too polarized , and the mass of its people too poorly educated , to sustain democratic institutions against enemies on both extremes .... The tragedy of the Russian Revolution was that the people were too weak politically to determine its outcome " ( p. 588 ) . It is no accident that the dominant voice of this volume is Maxim Gorky : a peasant that had made himself into a talented writer and intellectual force who very well understand the culture from which he had sprung but who hated it with the loathing of a second-generation immigrant . Figes despises the leaders who he feels betrayed their people for the purposes of their own ideological or personal agendas ; but he is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the liberal values that were ultimately their only hope . <p> It may be that contemporary concerns have shaped Figes 's account ; his last lines are an admonition against " liberal-democratic triumphalism " in the wake of 1989 and 1991 : " we must try to strengthen our democracy , both as a source of freedom and of social justice , lest the disadvantaged and the disillusioned reject it again . It is by no means a foregone conclusion that the emerging civil societies of the former Soviet bloc will seek to emulate the democratic model " ( p. 824 ) , especially with **30;199;TOOLONG able to condemn the inequalities caused by post-Soviet capitalism . Perhaps it is this fear that the Reds ( or worse ) might come back that causes Figes to so often one-dimensionally portray Lenin and the Bolshevik regime ; such apprehension for the future of the Russian people , however , would certainly be in keeping with the humanistic concerns that permeate this volume . <p> Mention must be made of one of the best things about this book , namely the 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutionary era in all its glory , its joy , its horror , and its humanity . Many are unforgettable , but to my mind the most remarkable is the last one : a wheelchair-bound Lenin in the summer of 1923 , his face , beard , and cap familiar from thousands of photographs and paintings , but his eyes wide with a searing but complicated pain . I find myself coming back to it time and again , and each time a different emotion seems prevalent : first the paralyzed fear of a deer caught in headlights , then the fury of a powerful man rendered impotent , at times a mute raging against the dying of the light . Whichever it is , if not all or more , one can only wish that the Lenin in Figes 's text had had a fraction of the complex humanity of the Lenin in this photograph . It is a testimony to the talents of Orlando Figes as a historian and a writer that most of the Russians he describes do . <p> Despite many weaknesses , 3 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is , without doubt , the best one-volume work covering the entire revolutionary era ; it does not diminish that accomplishment to note that this is not a field with a surfeit of competition . Figes does this through force of narrative , his skill in elucidating the complexities of the revolution clearly and ( mostly ) without caricature , and his ability through judicious anecdote and superb character studies in presenting history as something real that happens to--and is made by--real people . Unfortunately , the niche for this book is a rather limited one , since it assumes a great deal of previous knowledge and is far too long for at least undergraduate classroom use . It does not answer the two most glaring needs in the field , a one-volume book on 1917 suitable for lecture courses ( hopefully Rex Wade 's forthcoming work will fill this gap ) or a two-volume scholarly synthesis , discussing key issues of historiographical contention in a balanced and judicious manner , such as Abraham Ascher has provided for 1905 , or Alan Knight for Mexico ; in both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sixty years. 4 Nonetheless , the educated reader will find much enjoyment and illumination , and the specialist will find it both rich with intellectual stimulation and a veritable cornucopia of lecture fodder . <p> Notes <p> 1 . See p. 743 and note , where reference is made to what Stalin said in order to support an assertion about what Lenin believed . <p> 3 . A major shortcoming is Figes 's treatment of workers whom , in short , he just does not get . For example , he discusses Kanatchikov as typical of peasants who moved to the city , which " on the whole " made them more secular , more humanistic , and closer to the socialist intelligentsia , and led them to reject peasant culture ( p. 110 ) , while elsewhere he recognizes him as atypical , as a member of a " labour elite " ( p. 114 ) , who assimilated to the mores of a labor aristocracy that formed " this new working-class culture " ( p. 112 ) . Thus , once again , the iconic skilled metalworker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section , there is little sustained discussion of workers , and that is often contradictory . One brief example : citing Steve Smith , he presents workers ' control as an innovation of 1917 ( despite its force as a demand as early as 1905 ) that did not in any way imply rejection of state authority or of central planning ( 369 ) ; however , after October , he describes it as one of those forces of chaos and anarchy--implicitly , one would assume , a rejection of state control--that Lenin was supposedly allowing to operate unchecked until the old regime was destroyed . Figes 's great empathy for peasants does not seem to extend through the factory gates . One other weakness of note : there is very little on the non-Bolshevik socialist parties ; for example , there is no citation of Hildermeier , Melancon , or Rice on the SRs . <p> other permission , please contact H-Net@h-net.msu.edu.

( Cervantes , II 1982 , 1 , 23-42 ) , Javier Herrero has reviewed the studies of recent writers who have commented on Dulcinea . In doing so he reviews the debate between those critics who take the Romantic critical approach to Don Quixote and those who lean toward the anti-Romantic approach . He notes that pre-Spanish Civil War studies ( mostly taking the Romantic view ) are ? far more rhetorical than scholarly ? and that the trend toward a more scholarly approach ( mostly taking the anti-Romantic view ) begins with Alexander A. Parker , whose articles ? Don Quixote and the Relativity of Truth ? ( Dublin Review , 220 , 1947 , 28-37 ) and ? Fielding and the Structure of Don Quixote ? Bulletin of Hispanic Studies , 33 1956 , 1-16 ) ? initiated a direction of no-nonsense , irreverent reading of Don Quixote which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cervantes 's masterpiece ( 30-31 ) . ?

( Modern Language Review , 64 1969 , 312-26 ) and Anthony Close 's book The Romantic Approach <p> Either by the will of heaven or because of his melancholy , Don Quixote , we note , is taken by fever and dies . Cervantes remains , as ever , innocently , or perhaps deliberately , ambiguous . Since Heaven can have no part of this as the character 's death is literally ordained by the author , of what , then , does Don Quixote die ? We must suppose of a fever . But since the fever has been brought about and stayed by melancholy , with some logic we can insist that he dies of sadness and melancholy , as suggested by his doctor and friends . Cervantes 's vagueness , whether innocent or deliberate , does allow for such an assumption . This conclusion , which I believe is justly sustained , is one of the premises of the study herein presented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a recovery of body , one might think , and our hidalgo should then be able to go on to live a contented life in his new-found wisdom . He does not . As Alonso Quixano he still dies ; a death , one can conclude at this point , to be incongruous . The incongruity can be resolved , perhaps , in this manner : As Don Quixote becomes Alonso Quixano el Bueno , he can be made to reject the detestable books of chivalry ; he can be made to accept as error his having believed in the existence of knights errant ; he can be made to repent of this supposed error ; however , he obviously can not physically separate himself from his other self who is dying of fever caused by melancholy . The contrite Alonso Quixano , having been allowed to take upon himself the sins of his other self , Don Quixote , therefore dies ? I repeat , not by divine ordination , for the author is behind his death ? but because of Don Quixote 's ? tristezas ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of our character : Don Quixote provides the physical reason for the actual , dignified death while Alonso Quixano allows for deserved spiritual salvation . Cervantes , as usual , with incredible genius and with a remarkable expression of humanity and justice , succeeds in having it both ways . Alonso Quixano the Sane dies ? supposedly unaware , one is made to understand ? of the bitter disappointment , sadness and despair that is suffered by his counterpart , Don Quixote the Mad . I say ? supposedly unaware ? because in my belief his words to Sancho quite naturally , commonly interpreted as the expression of regret for his error ? taken in another way , can still reveal him to be as much a dreamer and idealist as his mad counterpart . As the novel ends , that schizophrenic part of the character which is Don Quixote , now purportedly put aside , still overwhelms that <p> 24 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> of Alonso Quixano . Cervantes himself writes ( II , 74 ) even after Alonso insists he is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lleg= el ltimo de don Quijote . . . ? and the clerk who has written the testament adds , a few lines later , ? que nunca habfa lefdo en ningn libro de caballerfas que algn caballero andante hubiese muerto en su lecho tan sosegadamente y tan cristiano como don Quijote. ? It is now Alonso who is being put aside , for he has merely provided a convenient and proper way to bring Don Quixote back to his senses in order to allow for an acceptable death in a Christian manner . Nevertheless , Alonso ? that other half of our character ? despite his denial , as expressed in his words to Sancho , can still be our would-be knight errant . His apparent , desperate , still unsatisfied desire ? not his belief shown to be in error ? that the ? Golden Age ? might exist again , seems enough to cast him , too , in the role of idealist , whether knights errant ever existed or not . As a second preliminary to my exposition , I proffer , then , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quixote or Alonso Quixano , 1 ) dies of melancholy , and 2 ) dies repentant , but still an idealist . If these two premises are found to be valid , we can think anew as to whether Don Quixote 's story is simply funny or something more than that , leading us back to Romantic views that have suffered such an intimidating barrage of criticism in the last three decades . In this paper I attempt to show how the conclusions posed can be supported , by commenting on the death ? the three deaths , as I am putting it ? of Don Quixote , which deaths become a major part of the controversy and a key to the determination of Cervantes 's thoughts as he finished his work Don Quixote 's death is mentioned three times in the novel : the first at the end of Part I , Chapter 52 ; the second after the episode of the Cave of Montesinos , II , 24 ; the last , of course , the explicit final death scene at the end of II , 74 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the author 's plans , changes which give us clues to his developing attitudes toward his protagonist . My quotations are from the eight volume Clsicos Castellanos ninth edition of Don Quijote de la Mancha by Francisco Rodrfguez Marfn ( Madrid , Espasa Calpe , 1969 ) . For the reader who may not possess this edition all quotations will be given simply by part and chapter . <p> I , 52 : Don Quixote is brought home in the cage , put to bed , and watched over by his niece and housekeeper , who are concerned that he may escape again . The author suggests that events turned out as feared . No account , we are told , has yet been found about Don Quixote 's third sally , except that tradition has it that he went to Saragossa and took part in some famous jousts in that city . A leaden box is found ? en la cual caja se habfan hallado unos pergaminos escritos con letras g=ticas , pero en versos castellanos , que contenfan muchas de sus hazaas y daban noticia de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Rocinante , de la fidelidad de Sancho Panza , y de la sepultura del mesmo don Quijote con diferentes epitafios y elogios de su vida y costumbres . . . ? The author goes on to say he asks no recompense for his efforts to find the rest of the story , and with a broad smile hopes his readers ? le den el mesmo crTdito que suelen dar los discretos los libros de caballerfas , que tan validos andan en el mundo. ? These tongue-in-cheek remarks are followed by burlesque epitaphs which supposedly had been placed on Don Quixote 's tomb , and sonnets to Dulcinea , Sancho , and Rocinante written by the ? academicians ? of Argamasilla . This first passing mention of the death of Don Quixote can not be more appropriate to the ending of Part I which , on its face , has been an uproariously funny tale about a gentleman who has gone off purporting to be a knight-errant . No cure , no recovery is suggested or hinted at . Don Quixote at some time in the past is reported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight is roundly mocked even in death , which death is befitting the entertaining parody Cervantes intended to write . No profound message or significance can be or should be attributed to Part I at this point in our reading . <p> DEATH TWO : DON QUIXOTE CONFESSES HE WAS PLAY-ACTING . <p> Part II opens with a visit by Don Quixote 's two friends , who find he is still mad and still believes in his mission . Sancho appears and tells what the townspeople are saying about the two of them . At one point Sancho makes this relevant comment : ? ? En lo que toca la valentfa , cortesfa , hazaas y asumpto de <p> 26 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> vuesa merced , hay diferentes opiniones : Unos dicen : ? Loco pero gracioso ? ; otros , ? Valiente , pero desgraciado ? ; otros , ? CortTs , pero impertinente . . . ( II , 2 ) . ? ? It is apparent that Cervantes did anticipate well in advance the variety of ways his work would or could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corroborate Cervantes 's multifaceted view of his story , as does Herrero 's quotation ? Los nios la manosean . . . ? After the episode of Camacho 's wedding we visit the cave of Montesinos , II , 22-23 . As Chapter 24 begins , Cide Hamete ponders over the veracity of Don Quixote 's cave tale : ? T , letor , pues eres prudente , juzga lo que te pareciere , que yo no debo ni puedo ms ; puesto que se tiene por cierto que al tiempo de su fin y muerte dicen que se retrat= della , y dijo que Tl la habfa inventado , por parecerle que convenfa y cuadraba bien con las aventuras que habfa lefdo en sus historias ( italics mine ) . ? Cervantes evidently had in mind here an ending in which Don Quixote would admit to play-acting in this and perhaps in other instances . There are places in the novel where one can infer this is happening . Don Quixote 's death , however it may have been next planned to come about , would then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been less vague and less comic than the first , but less dramatic than the last , probably leading to a denouement still fairly appropriate to the parody being written . A notable feature of this supposed second plan is that Don Quixote 's admission to pretense would have rung false . The reader will note that while Cide Hamete makes the above statement , Don Quixote himself seems to confirm it on one occasion ( II , 41 ) and deny it on another ( II , 52 ) . At first , as he speaks to Sancho after the ride on Clavileo , he does seem to suggest that he has invented the story , but in the second instance , as he questions Antonio Moreno 's magical head , he seems in doubt about the truth of the matter . Cervantes would seem to have forgotten what he had said earlier as Cide Hamete . More probably he is admitting in a subtle way to a coming change in his plan . It is of some significance that he toys with , but eventually discards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His knight 's stance ? his constancy , courage , wisdom , etc. ? was beginning to leave no room for falsehood or pretense . Don Quixote , heading for Saragossa , encounters Master Peter , takes a trip on the Ebro , and then meets the duke and the duchess . Throughout this next long series of ducal episodes Cervantes never loses momentum , never falters . Sancho is given instructions on how to disenchant Dulcinea , and he receives and <p> 9.2 ( 1989 ) <p> The Three Deaths of Don Quixote <p> 27 <p> rules his ? isle ? for some ten days . Finally , at the end of Chapter 57 , both take leave of the ducal pair . At this point in the novel a strange event occurs , causing the careful reader to pause and suspect that a significant change in Cervantes 's attitude toward his character has really occurred . It is likely that the idea for Death Two is definitely dropped here and a third and final version begins to take shape . <p> This is the first time Don Quixote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something is bothering him , it seems , because something is bothering the author . We sense that Don Quixote as the protagonist has , at least for the moment , stepped outside the structure of the parody . Nevertheless , the humor continues unabated . Next , Don Quixote is welcomed by the young Arcadians . In response to their hospitality he stands once again in the middle of the road ( as in I , 4 ) to challenge all comers . His fate this time is even worse : he and Sancho are trampled by bulls . Chapter 59 : Knight and squire rest . Sancho hesitates to eat , and Don Quixote in a plaintive speech both <p> 28 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> funny and unfunny , summarizes his ? accomplishments ? and failures as seen from his point of view . He is discouraged and in despair . Three times he mentions dying . Sancho is made to counter with ? ? Muera Marta , y muera harta ? ? and then , ? . . . y sepa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toca en querer desesperarse como vuesa merced . . . ? ? Don Quixote recovers a bit but then bemoans Sancho 's unwillingness to lash himself to disenchant Dulcinea , as ? Merlin ? had ordered back at the Duke 's palace . We now arrive at an inn and learn of the publication of Avellaneda 's false Don Quixote . This , all along , has obviously been the main reason for the change in tone noted since the departure from the duke 's palace : the emerging doubt in Don Quixote , his rising discouragement , the increasing sense of foreboding and pathos , all still nevertheless in juxtaposition with the humor . Cervantes , it would appear , has just had his first real look at Avellaneda 's work and is truly appalled and hurt . His protagonist has not only been plagiarized , but transformed and distorted , and his own person besmirched in an insulting and vulgar manner . Angrily he must determine to terminate his novel as soon as possible , and to make certain changes . The most important of these will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death which can not be that of a buffoon as in Part I nor that of a gentleman who admits to having merely played the role of knight-errant . Cervantes will ponder this decision carefully . The road now leads to Barcelona , instead of Saragossa . The humor is still lively , but Don Quixote becomes more and more a sorry and sorrowful figure . II , 60 : In desperation he is tempted to lash Sancho himself , but is ignominiously overpowered by his servant . II , 64 : On the beach Don Quixote is brought down in defeat by Sampson , just as the author had planned , in a brief but very powerful , climactic scene , a scene probably more dramatic now than Cervantes had originally imagined . Sampson , springing upon the downed knight cries : ? ? Vencido sois , caballero , y aun muerto , si no confesis las condiciones de nuestro desaffo. ? ? Then battered and stunned , without lifting his visor Don Quixote proclaimed in a low and feeble voice , as if he were speaking from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la ms hermosa mujer del mundo , y yo el ms desdichado caballero de la tierra , y no es bien que mi flaqueza defraude esta verdad . Aprieta , caballero , la lanza , y quftame la vida , pues me has quitado la honra. ? ? <p> 9.2 ( 1989 ) <p> The Three Deaths of Don Quixote <p> 29 <p> The scene is totally lacking in humor and also stands apart from the parody Cervantes has been writing . The anti-Romantics will of course insist that Don Quixote 's bold , unwavering words merely represent an imitation of the way in which a defeated , legendary knight would have responded . Don Quixote , they will say , is still being satirized as the butt of mockery in the parody . This is so , but now only in a very small way . The mockery has subsided , lost its conviction and force . Since the mention of Avellaneda 's Don Quixote ? as indicated in Chapter 59 , but known by the author at least by Chapter 57 ? Cervantes 's attitude toward his protagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , Cervantes is allowing him a measure of authenticity in recognition of the admirable and even noble qualities he really has , qualities now recognized clearly as they are compared to those of Avellaneda 's character . The remarks of all those critics who have stated that Cervantes in his Part II learns to appreciate , admire , and even love his character prove at this point to be well taken . Avellaneda is not only to be thanked for having prompted Cervantes to pick up and finish his novel , but for having made him see more clearly beyond the initial figure he had created , and beyond the figure of the play-acting ? hidalgo ? consciously imitating a knight-errant . After his defeat , Don Quixote remains for six days in bed , ? marrido , triste , pensativo y mal acondicionado . . . ? He hears of the rescue of Don Gregorio and is somewhat cheered saying : ? En verdad que estoy por decir que me holgara que hubiera sucedido todo al revTs , porque me obligara pasar en Berberfa , donde con la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sino cuantos cristianos cautivos hay en Berberfa . Pero , +quT digo , miserable ? +No soy yo el derribado ? . . . ? ? Fray Diego de Haedo in his work Topograffa e Historia General de Argel ( Madrid : La Sociedad de Bibli=filos Espaoles , 1927 ) , already written by 1605 but not published until 1612 , mentions Cervantes 's activities as a prisoner in Algeria saying ? que si al nimo , industrias y trazas de Miguel de Cervantes correspondiera la ventura , hoy fuera el dfa que Argel fuera de cristianos , porque no aspiraban a menos sus intentos ( xii ) . ? It is not illogical to suggest that , as Cervantes put the words spoken in the above quotation on Gregorio into Don Quixote 's mouth , he will have thought of his own youthful brashness in attempting to free Christian slaves in Algeria . We should be reminded of Don Quixote 's speech on liberty mentioned above , which certainly <p> 30 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> must have been prompted by Cervantes 's Algerian experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man is surely comparable to that of his madman . Don Quixote 's words may still be serving the purpose of humor , but the possibility of Cervantes 's identifying himself with his creation certainly now becomes more credible as we consider the author 's new perspective , sharpened mostly by Avellaneda , and consequent increasing respect and admiration for his protagonist . If the author here is making fun of Don Quixote , then he has to be making fun of his own youthful folly . The case that he is revealing his own suffering from disillusionment , particularly from this point on , is strengthened . II , 66 : Knight and squire leave Barcelona . Don Quixote makes a stirring speech , inspired by Virgil , as he gazes at the place where he had fallen : ? ? Aquf fuT Troya ! Aquf mi desdicha , y no mi cobardfa , se llev= mis alcanzadas glorias ; aquf us= la fortuna conmigo de sus vueltas y revueltas ; aquf se escurecieron mis hazaas ; aquf , finalmente , cay= mi ventura para jams levantarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to be funny . What glory has Don Quixote won ? What exploits have been eclipsed ? However , if we allow ourselves to take his part in the drama developing quite apart from the parody , we see that sadness and despair are now growing logically and inevitably within him , foreboding and perhaps even an awareness of his coming demise , already being planned by the creator of his ? history ? and sensed by him , the character created . Don Quixote is now truly sad , no matter how much the fool he is being made to appear to be . Sancho attempts to cheer him . Don Quixote then speaks of Fortune and the saying that every man is the architect of his own destiny . ? ? Yo lo he sido de la mfa ; pero no con la prudencia necesaria , y asf me han salido al gallarfn mis presunciones . . . ? ? J. J. Allen in his sequel monograph Don Quixote : Hero or Fool ? Part II ( Gainesville , University Presses of Florida , 1979 ) uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the error of his ways . Allen , in his praiseworthy attempt to define Don Quixote as hero , quotes him as saying : ? My presumptuousness has brought me to a sorry end ( 32 ) . ? And then : ? Both Sancho and Don Quixote , then , have lived through a process beginning with pride and presumption and a consequent unawareness of their limitations , moving toward self-discovery through suffering and culminating in confession and repentance . . . ( 34 ) ? But Don <p> 9.2 ( 1989 ) <p> The Three Deaths of Don Quixote <p> 31 <p> Quixote is not here admitting to the error of his ways , not making a confession , and not repenting , as suggested by Allen . The first phrase selected by him is out of context . It reads ? ? . . . asf me han salido al gallarfn mis presunciones ; pues debiera pensar que al poderoso grandor del caballo del de la Blanca Luna no podfa resistir la flaqueza de Rocinante. ? ? Don Quixote ends the statement in this way : ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tener en nuestra tierra el ao del noviciado , con cuyo encerramiento cobraremos virtud nueva para volver al nunca de mf olvidado ejercicio de las armas. ? ? Don Quixote is clearly not confessing to any errors here ; no self-discovery has taken place . He is telling us , indirectly , that the next time ( if there ever is a next time ) he charges a ? Knight of the White Moon ? he may not be mounted on a Rocinante , but hopefully on a Bucephalus or a Babieca . He has apparently at this point not given up any of his ideals . The knight is still madly determined and constant to his lady , and Cervantes is still attempting to write within the bounds of his parody . In this same chapter ( 66 ) Tosilos appears again and talks with Sancho . ? ? Sin duda este tu amo , Sancho amigo , debe ser un loco. ? ? ? ? +C=mo debe ? ? respondi= Sancho . ? No debe nada a nadie ; que todo lo paga , y ms , cuando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most relevant . Don Quixote 's madness has not only passed for coin with characters like the duke , the duchess , and Antonio Moreno , but for the author himself who is probably more and more aware that he , through the other characters in the novel , has been and is yet mocking ( for coin ) a well-meaning , admirable , and even noble figure . II , 68 : Don Quixote and Sancho are trampled by hogs . ? DTjalos estar , amigo ; que esta afrenta es pena de mi pecado , y justo castigo del cielo es que un caballero andante vencido le coman adivas , y le piquen avispas , y le hollen puercos. ? ? Note that Don Quixote 's ? sin ? is that he has been conquered , not that he has been presumptuous . Again he is not confessing to errors . He then sings a madrigal , and the author , still writing his funny book , tells us ? Cada verso dTstos acompaaba con muchos suspiros y no pocas lgrimas , bien como aquel cuyo coraz=n gemfa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Dulcinea. ? ? The word ? gemfa ? here appears in the indicative , suggesting that Cervantes , though understanding that most of his readers will be expecting funny situations , may here be beginning to allow , through the humor , some notice of his knight 's <p> 32 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> grief . We are then taken back to the duke 's palace for another playful skit with Altisidora . II , 71 : Sancho finally agrees to whip himself for money . The idea and the scene are preposterously funny , and yet when Don Quixote , anxiously awaiting the moment of Dulcinea 's disenchantment , thinks that Sancho is suffering pain , he shows himself magnanimously concerned about his friend 's welfare and stops the whipping . A curiously sane and gracious act committed in the midst of what is ? or at least is supposed to be ? another hilarious scene . Again coupled to the comedy , the knight 's generous heart is revealed , another sign that the author is now very much in sympathy with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposedly , is still satirizing . Our pair next arrives at an inn , which Don Quixote takes to be an inn and not a castle , we are reminded , ? que despuTs que le vencieron , con ms juicio en todas las cosas discurrfa , como agora se dir. ? Cervantes is preparing us for Don Quixote 's recovery . II , 72 : We meet Don Alvaro Tarfe who is asked to sign a certificate avowing our knight is the real Don Quixote . They travel on their way back to their village and Sancho , without fanfare , completes his whipping : ? Aquel dfa y aquella noche caminaron sin sucederles cosa digna de contarse , si no fuT que en ella acab= Sancho su tarea , de que qued= don Quijote contento sobremodo , y esperaba el dfa , por ver si en el camino topaba ya desencantada Dulcinea su seora ; y siguiendo su camino , no topaba mujer ninguna que no iba reconocer si era Dulcinea del Toboso , teniendo por infalible no poder mentir las promesas de Merlfn. ? ? So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the hill , and when they made out their village below , Sancho fell on his knees and cried : ? ? Abre los ojos , deseada patria , y mira que vuelve a ti Sancho Panza tu hijo , si no muy rico , muy bien azotado . Abre los brazos , y recibe tambiTn tu hijo don Quijote , que si viene vencido de los brazos ajenos , viene vencedor de sf mismo ; que , segn Tl me ha dicho , es el mayor vencimiento que desearse puede. ? ? ? ? DTjate desas sandeces ? dijo don Quijote , ? y vamos con pie derecho entrar en nuestro lugar , donde daremos vado nuestras imaginaciones , y la traza que en la pastoral vida pensamos ejercitar. ? ? Despite previous signs of doubt and discouragement , Don Quixote shows himself still ready to give play to his imagination . Almost autonomously , it seems , he is staving off the fate decreed by his creator . <p> 9.2 ( 1989 ) <p> The Three Deaths of Don Quixote <p> 33 <p> Professor Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized his errors , confessed his sins , and become repentant . He then states also that this repentance is ratified by ? epiphany ? at the moment knight and squire reach the top of the hill before their village ( Don Quixote : Hero or Fool ? Part II , 34 ) . Again this does not seem to me to be the case . Despite the author 's mention that Don Quixote 's judgment is becoming sounder , Don Quixote clings to his ideals until his last moments . His acts ? his extravagant behavior ? may be changing , but not his aims , his ideals . Sancho 's speech is essentially a humorous one which his master refers to as ? sandeces ? . What self-discovery has taken place ? In what way has Don Quixote conquered himself up to this point ? He has blamed his defeat on misjudging Rocinante 's strength , and up to the moment they climb the hill full of hopes and expectations he is still searching for his Dulcinea . There is , in reality , no epiphany at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insofar as his ideals are concerned , and his love for Dulcinea remains as constant as it was when he responded to the threat of the Knight of the White Moon : ? Aprieta , caballero , la lanza y quftame la vida . . . ? This is crucial , I believe , in determining just what Don Quixote rejects on his death bed . Allen is in part misled by Sancho , who in turn seems to be made to anticipate something the author has in mind but has yet to carry out . A show of repentance does not really come until Don Quixote lies on his death bed . Though Cervantes , now just pages from his ending , insists Don Quixote 's judgment is improving , strangely enough we see very little of this . The strength of Don Quixote 's beliefs and his desire to return to the profession he can never forget is evidently so powerful that it carries him through what I consider to be weak and therefore unconvincing attempts to show he is regaining his senses , that is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Indeed , the continuing strength of his beliefs is such as to make one think that Cervantes himself , who has come to admire and defend his character ? perhaps now even identify with him ? is formulating an ending that now may be against his own inclinations . II , 73 : Two incidents occur as they enter the village , and Don Quixote takes these as omens he will never see his Dulcinea . Now he loses what strength he has left to believe in his ideal in an earthly sense . Death , by mandate of his creator , the author , has placed her cold hand on his shoulder . His concerns now <p> 34 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> must turn to those of the spirit and his relationship with the creator of all men . Sancho again tries to cheer him up . When they speak of the plan to turn shepherds , Don Quixote one last time wistfully insists that his imaginary lady shepherdess will be Dulcinea . II , 74 : Don Quixote becomes i 'll . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Master Nicols , the curate , Sampson Carrasco , the doctor , and Sancho are all convinced he is dying of melancholy . Cervantes himself , it would seem , has gradually come to accept the idea that his knight is suffering real grief , and now he is going to allow Don Quixote to die of that same grief . Thus , as we reach the end of the book , the parody , which has lasted a good one hundred twenty chapters , ends abruptly . Don Quixote , who has , particularly since Chapter 58 , gradually become a different person , steps outside of the parody transformed from buffoon to credible , disillusioned idealist , by virtue of his genuine grief over his failures . Cervantes has fully noted , acknowledged , and accepted the humanity and worth of his mad knight , and in the end he is no longer asking us to laugh at him , for he himself has stopped doing so . As already suggested , it is probable that , on the occasion just noted , as he prompted us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , he himself had already stopped laughing . Now the author-sponsored ? recovery ? takes place . Don Quixote awakens from a coma , declares his mind cleared , and disparages those detestable books of chivalry , the cause of the obscuration of his mind . ? ? Yo me siento , Sobrina , a punto de muerte ; querrfa hacerla de tal modo que diese entender que no habfa sido mi vida tan mala , que dejase renombre de loco ; que puesto que lo he sido , no querrfa confirmar esta verdad en mi muerte. ? ? Cervantes wants the world to know that his creation was a good man . He has let him roam the plains of La Mancha and the mountains of the Sierra Morena as a ? madman ? , but he will not allow him now to die as such . We remember Sampson 's earlier statement made to Thomas Cecial : ? La diferencia que hay entre esos dos locos es que el que lo es por fuerza lo ser siempre ; y el que lo es de grado lo dejar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? However clinically insane Don Quixote may have appeared ? so many critics have insisted upon this ? his madness has simply served for entertainment , ? passed for coin ? , and , apparently because of its supposed negative , ? sinful ? implications , has to be and is easily denied at the end of the story . One <p> 9.2 ( 1989 ) <p> The Three Deaths of Don Quixote <p> 35 <p> should be reminded here that for a greater part of Part II , Cervantes evidently dwelled on the possibility of having his knight confess on his death bed ( Death II ) that he had only been imitating the knight-errant . A Don Quixote finally , as in the beginning , acknowledged as mad prompted the drastic turnabout seen in Death III , the return to sanity by the rejection of those books which had brought on madness . Don Quixote , now looking to the salvation of his soul , refuses to listen to his friends who urge him ? ? Calle , por su vida , vuelva en sf , y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquf , ? replic= don Quijote , ? que han sido verdaderos en mi dao , los ha de volver mi muerte , con ayuda del cielo , en mi provecho ( II , 74 ) . ? ? Contritely repenting of his errors , his ? sins ? ? here we must suppose he refers to his madcap adventures as well as the ordinary sins of man ? he avows his death now will bring salvation . Then , Don Quixote makes his confession and draws his will . Tirant the White , too , had died a proper Christian death and willed his enormous wealth to relatives and friends . Don Quixote remembers the paltry sum he owes to Sancho and adds , giving it all to his former squire ? ? . . . ser bien poco , y buen provecho le haga ; y si como estando loco fuf parte para darle el gobierno de la fnsula , pudiera agora , estando cuerdo , darle el de un reino , se le diera , porque la sencillez de su condicfon y fidelidad de su trato lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amigo , de la ocasion que te he dado de parecer loco como yo , haciTndote caer en el error en que yo he cafdo , de que hubo y hay caballeros andantes en el mundo. ? ? Sancho pleads tearfully that he ( Don Quixote/Alonso Quixano ) not die just like that , finished off by his own melancholy . ? ? . . . quiz tras de alguna mata hallaremos la seora Dulcinea desencantada , que no haya ms que ver ( II , 74 ) . ? ? This highly emotional exchange between Don Quixote and Sancho is surely the most moving and at the same time the most revealing of the novel . It indicates to us the only ? error ? to which Don Quixote , now Alonso Quixano the Good , is finally going to admit : believing that there were and still are knights errant in the world . This statement is of the utmost importance to us now . Whenever it is suggested that Don Quixote does not reject the ideals of chivalry but only some of the silly and badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is untenable . ? The aims , ? stresses Close , ? like the acts , are a madly <p> 36 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> literal mimicry of the stereotype behaviour of the heroes of chivalric romance . In other words , the aims ( like the acts ) are presented as parody ? ( ? ? Don Quixote ? and the Intentionalist Fallacy , ? British Journal of Aesthetics , 12 ( Winter , 1972 , 19-39 , 37 ) . Close 's contention can perhaps be considered valid , but only until one gets to the end of the novel , where the structure of the parody crumbles . Alonso Quixano 's admission to the error of believing is not rendered in a sorrowful , regretful tone just because he realizes he has been foolish and has misled Sancho , but also , we may have good reason to suspect , because learning that knights-errant do not exist in his time and have never existed has saddened him . I call attention to Sancho 's remarks in response to those of his master which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as the repentant Alonso Quixano who has rejected the foolish romances ? is still dying of melancholy . The mockery and parody would seem to end here with the ideals ? the aims ? of chivalry now become , I submit , a real and accepted part of the dying Alonso 's being , since they are still a part of the dying Don Quixote 's being . One need not be convinced , in any case , that this interpretation is acceptable . In the end , whether we are dealing with a mad Don Quixote or a sane Alonso Quixano , the sadness is equally great and significant , and in either case , as suggested in this study , this sadness leads to death by melancholy . Cervantes has acquiesced in and ratified the grief shared by these two half personages and so thus ceased at this point to deride their aims , their ideals . The implications here are tremendous . Standing behind either saddened character is the author himself , also , we can presume , having wanted to believe ? shown by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about Don Quixote 's final , unfunny , gracious death ? Death Three ? and evidently , in these last pages , just as disillusioned , despite his forced attempt at humor , as ever any of the Romantics will have thought him to be . Has he not , after all , himself been mocked as a physical cripple , if not a mental one , by one who has maliciously suggested that his proudest moment , Lepanto , has ceased to exist , as well ? Has he not been tempted to consider his youthful efforts to rescue Christian slaves in Algeria just as foolish as Don Quixote 's desire to do the same ? Cervantes , like Don Quixote , has apparently fought his last battle , and he , too , ? just as disillusioned as his protagonist ? is ready to surrender and even die . For the two of them , their rest is no longer to be the ? the bloody fray ? , el pelear , but the tranquility of the ultimate Arcadia or Utopia , Heaven . <p> 9.2 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 <p> Sancho , on the other hand , despite his faults , being very much alive , wanting to live , and also wanting to believe , is still ready to believe , and so he half-believes half-hopes he and his beloved master shall find Dulcinea one day behind some bush . The idea that Sancho has been quixotizado , rejected even by Allen , does regain strength here . Victor Hugo 's comment quoted by Russell as ? sticking to the mind ? ( despite , Russell says , its lack of validity ) could not be more a propos here : ? ? One might suspect the Spanish author of having attempted to mock ideals , but that was a defect more apparent than real . If one looked carefully it would be seen that the smile was accompanied by a tear ( Russell , 98 ) . ? ? The tear Hugo speaks of , of course , is not one shed by our saddened knight who has shed many , but one shed by his creator . The trouble is that one has to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Part II to the deeply moving scene of Death Three ? to find that tear . In this way , all attempts , rhetorical or scholarly , to find surface sublimity in the Romantic sense throughout most of Cervantes 's novel would seem doomed to failure . Borrowing the expression ? simulacra of sublimity ? from Anthony Close 's ? Don Quixote 's love for Dulcinea : a Study in Cervantine Irony ? referred to by Herrero ( 33 ) , I argue , along with Close , that , on the question of Don Quixote 's sublime madness or love for Dulcinea , one does find but ? simulacra of sublimity ? ? until , I now insist , one gets to the very last chapters , or even the last pages of the book , as suggested here . Alonso Quixano 's search for the knight errant and the chivalric ideal is tied to Don Quixote 's search for Dulcinea , his ideal , and Don Quixote 's constancy which is evidenced in moments of doubt ( II , 58 ) , of defeat ( II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of charity ( II , 71 ) , and even of hope ( II , 72 ) , can not be impugned . In these last moments sublimity can be found amply enough , though it will still be found juxtaposed to humor . Professor Herrero may wish to reject this view in the same way he rejects the anti-Romantic view that the novel is totally funny , thus reducing Don Quixote 's role to that of a buffoon . Suggesting that Don Quixote is a buffoon up to II , 58 does not seem to be much help in supporting the stand of the Romantics or the Humanists . However , this objection , too , I believe , can be resolved . It happens that the sadness , the disillusionment now strongly pinpointed at the end of Part II , casts a dark pall back over the entire work , and it is this indirect influence , this double exposure that allows for seeing double , for the seeing of sublimity <p> 38 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> along with comedy even in Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested we take to see the tear , but the look in retrospect strongly colored by the emotional impact of the novel 's last scenes . Cervantes , whose Lepantine pride has been certainly wounded by the plagiarist and who may very well indeed have shed that tear for this and other reasons , after looking back over his work , could himself have found some of his funniest scenes become sublime . The potential for sublimity was there from the beginning . Because of this powerful , dual view , his entire great novel can rightly be considered in retrospect ? and is justly so by many ? simultaneously funny and sublime . Don Quixote continues with his will and threatens to disinherit his niece if she marries a fellow who even knows what books of chivalry are . He then rails against Avellaneda and his book : ? . . . cuan encarecidamente ser pueda , perdone la ocasi=n que sin yo pensarlo le di de haber escrito tantos y tan grandes disparates como en ella escribe ; porque parto desta vida con escrpulo de haberle dado motivo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than gentle , continues . Don Quixote falls into a faint . The house is in a turmoil . His end comes and the priest asks the clerk to write out a death certificate ? para quitar la ocasfon de que algn otro autor que Cide Hamete Benengeli le resucitase falsamente . . . ? There appears then Sampson 's epitaph , a fairly complimentary one , nothing like the burlesque ones which appeared at the end of Part I , at Death One . The last page contains another diatribe against Avellaneda and an empty sounding but logically necessary restatement of the author 's originally declared intention , ? de poner en aborrecimiento de los hombres las fingidas y disparatadas historias de los libros de caballerfas , que por las de mi verdadero don Quijote van ya tropezando , y han de caer del todo , sin duda alguna . Vale. ? Cervantes barely manages to stabilize the structure of his parody ? at least to add to its humor ? long enough to end his book . After Don Quixote speaks those last sad , well-known lines ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antao no hay pjaros hogao . . . ? those which come from his lips then are not his ? that is , in his character ? but really the author 's , whose always gracious humor is now marred by bitter rancor . The dying Don Quixote/Alonso Quixano we have come to know could hardly express his ? horror ? of books of chivalry when he had <p> 9.2 ( 1989 ) <p> The Three Deaths of Don Quixote <p> 39 <p> wanted all along so strongly for the noble knight-errant to exist . At the end of I , 52 , Cervantes had laughingly joked about these romances , ? so highly valued ? , and now , angrily , he rails against them hoping to arouse ? contempt ? for them . After all , they too , have served him a good purpose , have ? passed for coin ? . It is not the lies of these books that have aggravated , and even enfuriated him , but the lies and mockery of Alonso Fernndez de Avellaneda , the plagiarist and slanderer who has hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of Lepanto , the last mainstay of his pride . Don Quixote here has merely served as Cervantes 's spokesman as he , the author , wearily brings his supposed potboiler to a literarily and commercially acceptable close . If Don Quixote is to be called a hero , it is not because , after painful suffering , he has discovered himself , as suggested by Professor Allen , whose efforts are deserving of praise , but because ? according to the conclusions one can draw above ? in the Romantic , existentialist , or humanistic sense , he actually does epitomize man 's idealistic struggle ? a struggle considered banal and futile by some ? to make the world a better place , to better his life and that of his neighbor , to see life , as humanists so often put it , ? as it ought to be. ? Plato himself , who is not to be accused of banality , tells us : ? We are discussing no trivial matter , but how we ought to live ( Republic 352d , quoted by Richard Mervyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press , 1952 , 151 ) . ? Cervantes was not unfamiliar with this concept , as he shows in his novel , and was actually a proponent of it . In II , 3 , when Don Quixote insists that ? ? las acciones que ni mudan ni alteran la verdad de la historia no hay para quT escribirlas , si han de redundar en menosprecio del seor de la historia , ? ? Sampson responds : ? ? Asf es , pero uno es escribir como poeta , y otro como historiador : el poeta puede contar = cantar las cosas , no como fueron , sino como debfan ser ; y el historiador las ha de escribir , no como debfan ser , sino como fueron , sin aadir ni quitar la verdad cosa alguna. ? ? Later , in speaking to Sancho about the value of plays , Don Quixote asserts ? ? todos son instrumentos de hacer un gran bien la repblica , poniTndonos un espejo cada paso delante , donde se veen al vivo las acciones de la vida humana , y ninguna comparaci=n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y lo que habemos de ser como las comedias y los comediantes ( II , 12 ) . ? ? Since Cervantes was writing a work in the form of a ? history ? ( a funny history at that ) , <p> 40 <p> A. G. LO R+ <p> Cervantes <p> he playfully felt ? though he allowed his own strong-willed character to object ? under no obligation at first to relate things as they ought to have been , thus relieving himself of the responsibility of doing so had he been writing in a serious vein . However , as the funny history ? the parody ? comes to an aborted end with the tacit acceptance of the goodness , idealism and even nobility of Don Quixote/Alonso Quixano , the author then finds himself back in the realm of ? poetry ? , obligated to support and he does ? the very ideals which he has purportedly been mocking . The turnabout is contradictory , but explainable in the light of Cervantes 's changed attitude toward his protagonist , for whom he in the end expresses such sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is , of course , not the only cause for it . Cervantes , undeniably a very moral man , has all along ? despite his humorous approach and all the business about Don Quixote 's belief in giants and enchanters , and all the slap-stick bumps and broken legs ? strongly inferred that his creation , too , is a very moral , decent being . This is the underlying cause of the final , inevitable transformation which is merely triggered by the plagiarist . Don Quixote 's heroism , I reiterate , stems simply but legitimately from his unwavering faith in his ideals and the struggle he puts up to defend and achieve these . I refer to Professor Herrero 's article once more to make one last observation . ? Dulcinea , ? he says , ? is at the heart of recent controversies on the meaning of the Quixote . . . ? ? From the Romantic movement , the criticism of the nineteenth and a great part of the twentieth century inherited the conception of Dulcinea as the embodiment of Don Quixote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , qualities which denoted a spiritual greatness which stood symbolically for the essence of the Spanish soul . . . ( 24 ) ? If , as the result of my study or the result of any other study , Don Quixote can be validly considered a legitimate hero in the Romantic or humanistic sense , then it follows that Dulcinea remains as the ? embodiment of Don Quixote 's idealism , ? etc . This has been difficult to see because , though Cervantes gradually changed his attitude toward his would-be knight , he did continue , albeit haltingly , with his parody . However , for the parody to have rung true , and to have lasted to the end , Don Quixote should have remained the character he was in Part I , where his behavior unmistakably befitted the satire intended . Don <p> 9.2 ( 1989 ) <p> The Three Deaths of Don Quixote <p> 41 <p> Quixote 's final display of grief stems , we have seen , from his defeat and his failure to achieve his ideal , Dulcinea . Alonso Quixano grieves too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exist and then learning that they do not and have not ever existed . As one they die , indeed , for the same reasons . In this manner Dulcinea literally and legitimately survives as Don Quixote 's ideal , and figuratively even as Alonso Quixano 's ideal . It is , then , but a short step here to ? spiritual greatness ? which has been interpreted , as stated by Herrero , to stand for the ? essence of the Spanish soul. ? Anglo-Saxon anti-Romantics ( Herrero uses the expression ) may find this symbolism unwarranted , as may indeed some Hispanic or other critics , but such an idea should seem more acceptable to us now that it can be shown clearly , I believe , that Cervantes 's attitude towards Don Quixote does change from derisive to laudatory at the end of his work , as he tacitly admits Don Quixote 's idealism as legitimate and deserving of praise . If he does not offer a stronger , unmistakable display of this , it is probably because it was madness that was selling his potboiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years later . Cervantes 's ultimate willingness to see actual grief as the reason for the death of his brain child , speaks , as I have said , of his own thwarted idealism . The third and final death he devises for Don Quixote is , aside from all the other things suggested , at once an apology and a tribute . He is atoning for having mistreated him , used him for ? coin ? . Just as Don Quixote turns to Sancho to say ? Pardon me , friend , that I have caused you to appear mad like me , making you fall into the same sort of error as myself , the belief that there were and still are knights-errant in the world , ? one can easily imagine Miguel de Cervantes turning to his creation to say : ? Pardon me , dear friend , that I made you appear mad , for if there ever were knights-errant in this world , you had the soul to have been one of them. ? The author 's deliberate , final accolade bestowed after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his new title to Part II in which the word ? Hidalgo ? is dropped and another put in its place : El Ingenioso ?

@@40786675 @786675/ <p> " The Baha'i Church of Calabar , West Africa : The Problem of Levels in Religious History <p> Anthony A. Lee <p> Beyond Growth <p> Inevitably , the history of the first years of the Baha'i Faith in West Africa will be written and understood , especially within the Baha'i community , as the story of how the religion spread and grew in this part of the world from the time of its introduction in the early 1950s by American , Iranian , and African pioneers . The missionary histories of the spread of any religion are usually written in terms of the growth of the Faith , the expansion of the number of believers , and the ultimate triumph of the church--either presently or in the distant future . <p> Groves 's classic four-volume work The Planting of Christianity in Africa(1) certainly takes this approach . Even Hastings , ( 2 ) while paying more attention to political and sociological factors , finds his central concern in the growth of the church . Etherington and Ranger have complained about the narrowness of this kind of church history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to make their way to the center of missionary history . <p> Such an approach is to be expected . The growth of the Baha'i community was , after all , impressive during its first several years of development in West Africa . But , I maintain that this approach to its history will obscure more than it illumines . The history of the arrival of Baha'is , Baha'i ideas , and Baha'i religious identity on the West African scene is--as with all human history--extremely complex . The events and activities associated with it were highly varied , and even contradictory . Certainly , growth and expansion were a part of that history . The various Baha'i pioneers who traveled to West Africa came there with the idea of the expansion of the Faith in mind . And in some cases this expansion was achieved . But that is not all that happened : nor is it necessarily even the most important thing that happened . The whole of this history simply can not be encompassed or explained by notions of growth and decline , success and failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of growth will , in fact , obscure most of the historical events associated with the Baha'i Faith in its early years . It will obscure all of the interesting ones . <p> Philosophically speaking , the number of historical " events " associated with any time period is infinite , and so the vast majority of them deserve to be obscured and forgotten , anyway . No one really wants to know the details of every conversation that Valerie Wilson had with her neighbors or exactly what Enoch Olinga had for breakfast each morning , seven days a week . Nonetheless , it might be well to remind ourselves that most of the daily activities of these Baha'i pioneers did not result in conversions and had no relationship to " growth " in any form . <p> But , beyond that banal and obvious fact , a history written in terms of the success of various Baha'i teaching plans and the conversion of Africans to the message of the Baha'i pioneers will overlook the importance of the initiatives and ideas of those very converts--which , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actively offered ; it was also actively received . In fact , it is clear that where the Baha'i Faith was able to find large numbers of converts rapidly , this was always as a result of African initiative . It is only where the converts themselves were able ( usually only for short periods ) to seize control of the message , the teaching work , and the organizational structure of the Baha'i religion--and shape it to the needs of an African society--that expansion was achieved . In such cases , it is my view that it is this reshaping of the message that is the really important part of the history we want to study , and not the numbers of converts . <p> Thirdly , a focus on growth and expansion also ignores , and implicitly denies , changes in the content of the Baha'i message as it spread through West Africa and the uniqueness of the community that was constructed as a result of that growth . Such a focus undermines the very question of the meaning of the new religion to the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted , and their own contributions to this identity . Of course , these are precisely the questions that I am most interested in answering . Questions which can not be approached at all with reference only to issues of growth and expansion . <p> LEVELS AND DISCONTINUITIES <p> Thomas C. Holt , in a fascinating article , has recently raised what he has called " the levels problem " of history. ( 3 ) For Holt , this is the inevitable dilemma of the historian who wants to make sense out of the events of the past . He regards this as " the problem of establishing the continuity between behavioral explanations sited at the individual level of human experience and those at the level of society and social forces . " ( 4 ) That is , it is the problem of connecting , in some meaningful way , the everyday acts of individual human beings ( that actually make up the material of history ) with the larger historical trends which are seen by historians as having been produced and reproduced by these acts ( and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course , Holt is primarily concerned with how race and racism came to be reproduced in American society , and through American history . But his admonition that the historian must remain aware of the " subtile interaction between various levels and terrains of human experience " is a universal one. ( 5 ) He proposes an approach that will bridge the ( usually neglected ) gap between the global view and the local , the societal explanation and the individual 's behavior . While it might be said , for example , that the Baha'i community grew in West Africa , what exactly does this mean at the level of everyday experience ? for the pioneers ? for the converts ? <p> I will take Holt 's point one step further , moreover , and suggest that the historian must also face the problem of exploring the discontinuities which exist in the " terrains of human experience . " Not , I might add , for the purpose of integrating all the contradictory bits into one grand scheme of things--but precisely to remind us that our grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every historian to make sense of the everyday events of the past , and equally his task to acknowledge the contradictory events and behaviors which might otherwise be lost or obscured by his analysis . <p> This concern with the discontinuities of history , as it is written , has been brought most forcefully to the attention of scholars by Michel Foucault in a number of important volumes. ( 6 ) Foucault 's profound critique of the conventional understanding of Western history has thoroughly undermined a self-assured reliance on any master narrative for a field or topic of history . His interrogation of Western history reveals " two great discontinuities " in the assumptions which lay at the base of Western culture. ( 7 ) Though Foucault himself forcefully denied that he was concerned with discontinuity per se and claimed to be bewildered by this interpretation of his work , ( 8 ) nonetheless his insight into the deep breaks in European history represents at least the necessary starting point for his larger work . By noticing those events which are made discontinuous by a master narrative , Foucault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an ordered understanding of history even possible . <p> This chapter is devoted to just such an discontinuous event , or chain of events , the establishment of the Baha'i Church of Calabar in 1955-56 . Here was an independent church based on Baha'i teachings which was established wholly without connection to any Baha'i pioneer , and which existed without communication with any Baha'i in the world , outside of its own congregation , for the duration of its short existence . Nonetheless , for a short time , it succeeded in capturing the interest , the participation , and the allegiance of virtually all of the Cameroonian men on one large palm plantation in eastern Nigeria . <p> The church was established , flourished , and then collapsed ( as the result of a dispute between its founders ) after several months of regular services , utterly unrecognized and unknown to the Baha'i pioneers and to the international Baha'i community . It left no converts to count as a part of the Baha'i " expansion . " However , as we will see , an examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious needs and attitudes of some African converts , their understanding and reworking of the Baha'i message , and their approach to Baha'i identity . These insights can be usefully applied to other Baha'i conversions in the region , and indeed provide a much-needed contrast to the usual historical paradigm of Baha'i expansion . <p> This instance provides us with a rare and remarkable phenomenon : We are provided with virtually a laboratory model of a purely African Baha'i Faith , separated and developed without in influences of the larger Baha'i community . The church was established purely out of African initiative , without the direction or guidance of foreign believers . The result was a successful independent church . <p> A NEW CHURCH IS FOUNDED ( 9 ) <p> The Baha'i Church of Calabar was organized in June of 1955 by Oscar Njang and Peter Oban-Itchi , neither of whom were Baha'is . Nor were they in contact with any Baha'is at the time that they founded the church . We do not have a full description of the activities of the church , but its services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Paris Talks : Addresses given by Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1991-1912. ( 10 ) It was clearly conceived of as an independent Christian church , but it maintained a distinct Baha'i identity . <p> The church was founded on the initiative and oratorical skills of Oscar Njang , a Cameroonian and a Presbyterian of the Basel Mission , who had left his home country to escape the demands of his extended family and community and had come , quite by accident , to Calabar to look for work . There he happened upon Peter Oban-Itchi , a friend ( perhaps a distant relative ) of his from the Cameroons. ( 11 ) Oban-Itchi offered him a job as a supervisor on a palm plantation , the Kalaru Estates , and Njang accepted . <p> About a week later , Oban-Itchi went off for a weekend trip to another plantation to visit a Cameroonian friend , Michael Nkamato . When he returned , he mentioned to Njang that he had seen a religious book there and had read something in it that " resembled Njang 's character . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit disturbed . He replied that the Bible was the only religious book that he recognized and that he had never read of anyone in the Bible who resembled him in character . He asked that Oban-Itchi bring the book to him the next week . <p> When Njang saw the book , Paris Talks , he says that he was immediately impressed by two things . One was a photograph of Abdu'l-Baha that is reproduced as the frontispiece of the book . This was the first thing that he saw when he opened the book , and it apparently affected him deeply . He says that he stared at the photograph for about ten minutes . The image seems to have reminded him of the face of one of the respected elders in Njang 's home village , a man who would settle land disputes among his people . <p> The other thing that impressed him was the text of the book itself . He read a little and was drawn to the teachings he found there because he felt that they justified the way he had led his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that his family had often chided him for his generosity , saying that one day he would be a poor man , " if I scatter all my things--giving , giving . " Now he felt that he had been doing God 's will all along and that his generous ways were a matter of religious duty . His willingness to help people and his trust of strangers had not been in vain . He looked up from the book and said to Oban-Itchi , " I will teach this Faith . " <p> There is little doubt that the passages in Paris Talks that Oban-Itchi had noticed and that impressed Njang so much were read from the first address of Abdu'l-Baha which is reproduced in the book , entitled " The Duty of Kindness and Sympathy Towards Strangers and Foreigners . " ( 12 ) The talk begins : <p> When a man turns his face to God he finds sunshine everywhere . All men are his brothers . Let not conventionality cause you to seem cold and unsympathetic when you meet strange people from other countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being evil-doers , thieves and boors . You think it necessary to be very careful , not to expose yourselves to the risk of making acquaintance with such , possibly , undesirable people . <p> I ask you not to think only of yourselves . Be kind to the strangers , whether come they from Turkey , Japan , Persia , China , or any other country in the world . <p> Help to make them feel at home ; find out where they are staying , ask if you may render them any service ; try to make their lives a little happier . <p> In this way , even if , sometimes , what you at first suspected should be true , still go out of your way to be kind to them--this kindness will help them to become better . <p> After all , why should any foreign people be treated as strangers ? <p> Let those who meet you know , without your proclaiming the fact , that you are indeed a Baha'i . <p> Put into practice the Teaching of Baha'u'llah , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing friendship in words alone , let your heart burn with loving kindness for all who may cross your path . . . . <p> When you meet . . . a stranger , speak to him as to a friend ; if he seems to be lonely try to help him , give him of your willing service ; if he be sad console him , if poor succour him , if oppressed rescue him , if in misery comfort him . In so doing you will manifest that not in words only , but in deed and in truth , you think of all men as your brothers . <p> Njang and Oban-Itchi decided to organize a new church on the Kalaru Estates . There were already two Christian services being offered in the community hall on the plantation . From 8:00 to 10:00 a.m. on Sundays there was a service in the Ifik language , and from 10:00 to 12:00 a.m. there was a Catholic service in Igbo . There was no service available in English to minister to the religious needs of the many English-speaking Cameroonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christians among them , would have been Presbyterians from the Basel Mission . So , Njang and Oban-Itchi decided to offer a Baha'i service in English ( probably from 12:00 to 2:00 p.m. ) to be based on Paris Talks . To announce their decision , they used the plantation drum to call all of the workers living there to a general meeting . <p> These events raise a number of issues , all of which have important implications for the study of the Baha'i Faith in West Africa . Foremost among these is the vantage point which we have , as a result of the independent nature of this Baha'i church , to examine the specific points of contact which allowed Oscar Njang and Peter Oban-Itchi to adopt a Baha'i identity without being taught by a Baha'i pioneer . <p> The bridge to the new religion , according to Njang 's narrative , consisted of three specific points of fascination which attracted him to the Baha'i teachings--the photograph of ' Abdu'l-Baha , the passage on hospitality from Paris Talks , and the ( unstated ) fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how widely these issues diverge from the standard presentation of the Baha'i teachings which was used by ( American ) Baha'i pioneers at the time . <p> Njang was initially attracted to the photograph of ' Abdu'l-Baha which he saw when he opened the book Paris Talks . The photo is a portrait which shows only the head and shoulders of ' Abdu'l-Baha , and elderly man with a full white beard wearing a white turban and a traditional Middle Eastern cloak . ( See photo . ) He looks directly into the camera and is smiling slightly . The photo is a poor reproduction in the 1951 British Edition of the book , which is undoubtedly the edition which Njang saw . The reproduction is dark with high contrast , and it might appear ( especially in an African context ) that ' Abdu'l-Baha 's skin is extremely dark . <p> Njang says that he was fascinated by the photograph because it reminded him of an elder in his village who would hear land disputes . This was a respected figure of his childhood who would hear such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of whether Njang was , at first , under the impression that ' Abdu'l-Baha was a black man . This may have been the first point of correspondence between Njang and the Baha'i Faith . It is possible that Njang was willing to accept the Baha'i teachings because he saw them as part of an African religion , or at least an independent African church . <p> Beyond this , of course , Njang felt that his own character was justified by the passages in the book which extol hospitality and kindness to strangers . Oban-Itchi had first suggested that such a religion might be suited to Njang , because of his generosity . He was right , since it was this aspect of the Baha'i religion which initially convinced Njang to set up the Baha'i Church of Calabar . <p> Finally , the presentation of the Baha'i religion in an English book suited Njang 's needs at the time . There were no Christian services in English for the many Cameroonian workers on the Kalaru plantation . These would have been Presbyterians from the Basel Mission who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church in their home country . The Efik and Igbo services obviously appealed to specific ethnic allegiances on the plantation . A church in English would appeal particularly to the Cameroonian Presbyterians , and in that sense it became an expression of ethnic identity also . <p> Peter Oban-Itchi apparently expected to act as the leading figure in the new church , since his position on the plantation was superior to Njang 's . He conducted the initial service , reading from Paris Talks , and talking about the Baha'i teachings . Then there were questions from the congregation : One man asked why it was that some people die as children , some die as young people , and some others do not die until they are old . <p> Apparently , Oban-Itchi did not have a satisfactory answer to this question , and Njang came to the front of the room to address the congregation . He told a parable : Suppose that the overseer of the plantation would give a letter to three men . One letter is to be delivered to a nearby village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third letter has to be taken to a far distant destination . Which one of these messengers will return to the plantation first , Njang asked . The worker who carried the letter to the village nearby would return after a few minutes ; the other messenger would take a few hours ; and the third messenger would not return until nightfall . But , they are all carrying out the instructions of the overseer , and he is equally pleased with each of them . Njang went on to explain that God is like the overseer and that each person dies after the mission that God has given to him is complete . <p> This short sermon drew an immediate response from the congregation , there were applause and handshakes all around . Njang 's answer and his rhetorical abilities seem to have carried the day , winning the approval of those who were present . Oban-Itchi , at that point , asked Njang to lead the congregation , since his parable had been so satisfying . But later , Oban-Itchi became suspicious that his friend may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the congregation in order to capture the leadership of the church . <p> Baha'i services on the Kalaru Estates continued to be held every Sunday for several months . They were attended regularly by about 50 or 60 men . There are no detailed descriptions of the order of the service , though each Sunday was devoted to a different chapter of Paris Talks . It appears that the meetings consisted of readings from that book and a sermon or lecture delivered by Njang . His recollections of the services make no mention of any ritual , music , or even prayer--though these may all have been involved . <p> In any case , it appears from Njang 's descriptions that the services were Christian in character . The congregation clearly understood itself to be a new Christian denomination based on the Baha'i teachings--an independent church . At one point , Njang and Oban-Itchi discussed what form of baptism their church should administer . <p> THE COLLAPSE OF THE CHURCH <p> Eventually , Oscar Njang and Peter Oban-Itchi , the two church leaders , quarreled . Njang received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plantation . Oban-Itchi complained to the European owner of the plantation about this , and his complaint was the source of the dispute . Soon , the two men could not be in the same room together without arguing . So , Njang was transferred to the palm oil mill in Akpabeyo . He left the Kalaru Estates in February of 1956 . <p> Since Njang had been the leader of the services in Calabar , his transfer disrupted the church . Oban-Itchi seems to have tried to continue the services , but he was not a popular speaker . The church soon collapsed when attendance at the Sunday meetings fell off . <p> Njang had left his copy of Paris Talks in Calabar when he departed for Akpabeyo . The book actually belonged to Enoch Olinga . It had only been borrowed by Michael Nkamato and was being used by the new church without Olinga 's knowledge . However , Olinga 's address was written in the book , and now Oban-Itchi wrote to him , telling him about the Baha'i activities in Calabar and the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Njang 's success as a Baha'i leader and of his transfer to Akpabeyo . <p> Njang apparently had no intention of continuing his Baha'i activities in Akpabeyo . He remained a Christian , however . He says that he began attending the services of the Church of Christ during the first few weeks after his arrival there . Much to his astonishment , he then received a letter from Olinga expounding the Baha'i religion . The letter urged him to continue his Baha'i teaching . " If you are a Baha'i , " the letter said , " wherever you go you have to teach the Baha'i Faith . " <p> Njang showed this letter to the evangelist of the church he was attending , but he was accused of following a false prophet . Now dependent on Olinga for all information about the Baha'i Faith , with no Baha'i book to fall back on and apparently no longer willing to rely on ad-hoc interpretations , Njang wrote to Olinga in the Cameroons . He received in return a four-page letter which defended the Baha'i Faith from the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Akpabeyo and attempted to repeat his success in Calabar by forming a Baha'i congregation from its members , making a determined effort to split the church . Only five churchmen followed him . <p> When he wrote to Olinga to inform him of these five new followers , Olinga sent him the standard declaration forms used for Baha'i enrollment . He recalls that his instructions were : " Oscar , first declare yourself . Then declare these people . " Njang recalls that he laughed when he read the letter . He remarked to one of the new Baha'is how funny it was that , all the time he had been doing these many things for his new religion , he himself had not been a member ! <p> NJANG 'S PARABLE <p> Oscar Njang was unable to repeat his first teaching success by establishing a Baha'i church in Akpabeyo . This raises the question of what allowed him to be so successful on the Kalaru estates , in the first instance . While personal fascination with the photograph of ' Abdu'l-Baha and appreciation of the Baha'i teachings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings , the interest and allegiance of the other Cameroonian men on the Kalaru plantation to the Baha'i Church is another matter . The initial popularity of the Baha'i services seems to have been sparked by the parable that Njang told at the first meeting of the church in response to a question about death . Therefore , it might be useful to look at the implications of this parable more closely . What would have caused this story to resonate so effectively with large numbers of foreign laborers that it could insure ( at least the beginnings of ) a new church on the Kalaru Estates ? <p> Primary factors in the success of Njang 's short sermon were , of course , that it was delivered in English and that it was decidedly Christian in character . Njang 's parable closely resembles in structure the gospel parable of Jesus concerning the laborers in the vineyard. ( 14 ) In the New Testament version , Jesus compares the kingdom of heaven to a householder who hires men to work his fields--some in the morning , some during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the same wage for their labor. ( 15 ) The identical moral--of the justice of God 's judgment despite apparent disparities--is being drawn out in both parables . It is not hard to imagine why the Christian men on the plantation would have found Njang 's sermon familiar and appealing . <p> However , distinctly African concerns are also at play in Njang 's parable . In fact , it would not be an exaggeration to say that Njang has recast Jesus 's parable of the laborers in the vineyard in an African mold. ( 16 ) The question of the explanation of premature death is a central one in most African philosophy and occupies a great deal of thought and speculation in African cosmologies . I would suggest that it corresponds to similar European concerns about the problem of evil or the Christian preoccupation with salvation . <p> African views of the world , at least in most societies , has no difficulty accounting for death per se . It is the nature of things that one should be born into the world , should grow up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join one 's ancestors in the spirit world . That is all good . But , African philosophy generally finds premature death to be a problem that requires explanation . The death of a child or a young mother , for instance , indicates that the natural order of the universe has been disturbed . Something has gone wrong , and it must be set right. ( 17 ) <p> Classic African explanations for premature death include belief in witchcraft . This explanation for early death postulates that one has been harmed by the anger , the evil thoughts , or the envy of a living person . Witchcraft is universally regarded as evil in all African societies . The anger of ancestors or the displeasure of lesser gods and spirits are also explanations that can account for premature death , which is always regarded as an affront to the natural order of things. ( 18 ) <p> Therefore , it is significant that one of the questions that arose during Njang 's and Oban-Itchi 's original meeting would concern the disquiet that African societies so often feel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional African explanations for this issue and directly rejects the traditional notion that premature death represents an evil and disordered intervention in God 's plan for things . Njang 's parable focuses on the command of God , eschews reference to any lesser being , and specifically makes no reference to witches as a cause of death . All death results from the will of God himself and is part of his plan . <p> Robin Horton , in a celebrated exchange with Humphrey Fisher argued that the large-scale conversion of Africans to Christianity and Islam in the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries can be partially explained by the transfer of significance ( and life experience ) from the microcosm to the macrocosm. ( 19 ) Horton proposes a two-tiered model of African traditional cosmology , which is admittedly an oversimplification , but nonetheless useful for purposes of analysis . In this model , the lesser spirits and beings of African religions are associated with family , village , clan , and the local landscape--the microcosm of daily life . While these same religions recognize a supreme being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the macrocosm . <p> Horton suggests that , especially in the nineteenth century , as the importance of the macrocosm to African life expanded--through state formation , the movement of people , long-distance trade , foreign conquest , colonial rule , and so forth--the adaptive potential of the largely underdeveloped African concept of a supreme God was actualized . The minor spirits came to be regarded as less important , in retreat , or even positively evil ; while the supreme God was now seen to play a more active role in African life . As people were forced by circumstance to leave their local areas and live outside the traditional microcosm , the lesser spirits became irrelevant . <p> Using this model , Horton suggests that " acceptance of Islam and Christianity in Africa is due as much to development of the traditional cosmology in response to other features of the modern situation as it is to the activities of the missionaries . " ( 20 ) In this sense , Horton 's theory rejects the notion that even large-scale conversions to monotheistic religions represent the rejection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam are regarded as " catalysts , " that is , stimulators and accelerators of religious change--of a religious conversion which was " in the air " anyway , for purely indigenous reasons. ( 21 ) The traditional local spirits that are of such immediate and constant concern in village life , no longer provide the explanations that are needed when the wider world ( the macrocosm ) intrudes . But African religions , in this theory , can always call upon the ( traditionally distant and otiose ) High God as a means of explaining these new events . Horton maintains that they did. ( 22 ) <p> Njang 's parable , with its uncompromising focus on God as the cause of all death , insists on the overwhelming significance of the macrocosmic forces of the universe . The microcosm of lesser gods and spirits , witches , and even ancestors is ignored altogether . According to Horton 's schema , this approach would represent a statement that the lower tier of African cosmology is of no importance , and perhaps has even disappeared as a religious category . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the modern world and conversion to Christianity and Islam in Africa had already helped this process along considerably by the 1950s . Surely , God was known and was already important in African thought before Njang told his parable . But for those men working far from home on the Kalaru Estates , cut off from local networks and even local churches , the insignificance of the micro-spirit world must have seemed especially obvious . The appeal of Njang 's sermon may have been precisely its willingness to discard the microcosm completely--even more completely than most African Christians would have done while living under normal circumstances with family and relations within their home communities--in favor of a conversion to rigid monotheism . <p> If this is true , then the Baha'i Church that Njang and Oban-Itchi founded would have represented a real conversion even for the Christians among the congregation . Certainly , the two founders of the church regarded it as such , feeling that they had truly changed religions . That significant numbers of other men were willing to follow them indicates that the change met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baha'i services were , in Nigeria , utterly dependent on the world beyond their kinship and ethnic networks for work , money , and survival . Their conversion to the Baha'i Church may have been , among other things , a conversion to the exclusive significance of the macrocosm in their spiritual lives , as well . <p> FROM CHURCH TO SECT <p> The success of Njang 's efforts in Calabar , I have suggested above , can be attributed in large measure to the power of Baha'i teachings and Baha'i identity to capture the imagination of Africans who were newly experiencing the importance of the macrocosm in their lives . If this is true , then the question must immediately arise of why Njang was unable to repeat his conversion success in Akpabuyo . Why did n't he go on to organize a successful Baha'i church there and attract a congregation of believers , as he had before ? <p> Both Njang and Oban-Ichi remained Baha'is after the collapse of their church . They went on to form the first local Spiritual Assembly of Nigeria in Calabar in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nigeria and later as an Auxiliary Board in that country . Oban-Itchi also remained a Baha'i for the rest of his life . However , neither of them ever again was able to form a Baha'i church or accomplish the significant number of conversions to the Baha'i Faith that they had initially . <p> Certainly , Njang in Akpabeyo no longer had access to the book Paris Talks , which had become the basis of church services on the Kalaru Estates . But , undoubtedly , he could have reclaimed the book or obtained other Baha'i literature , especially after beginning a correspondence with Enoch Olinga . <p> There is also the fact that Njang tells us that he had no intention of continuing his Baha'i activities once he moved to Akpabeyo . Finding the need for religious observance , he joined the Church of Christ there. ( 23 ) But , after receiving his first letter from Olinga , Njang reaffirmed his commitment to a Baha'i identity . His lapse of faith lasted only a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Baha'i group in his new location . <p> The practical situation that Njang faced in Akpabeyo was certainly different . The services of the Church of Christ were in English , and so the need for Christian services in English on this plantation would not have been as keenly felt as on the Kalaru Estates , where there had been none . He faced a rival evangelist who would soon preach against him . He did not enjoy the same friendship with a company headman that his acquaintance with Oban-Itchi had afforded him . <p> However , the explanation for the now few number of converts which Njang could find , it seems to me , lies more in understanding the nature of the international Baha'i community to which he was now attached than with any differences in the local conditions that he faced . It seems that , in coming into contact with Olinga and the Baha'i community of West Africa , Njang and Oban-Itchi were themselves converted from their own Baha'i Church to a more primitive and demanding Baha'i " circle " of disciples , more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Baha'i Faith as a closed " circle , " rather than an open " ecclesiastical body , " is what rendered the repetition of the success of the Baha'i Church of Calabar impossible in Akpabeyo , and even in Calabar itself . <p> Joachim Wach , in his classic Sociology of Religion , suggests a three-phase model for the historical development of the great religions. ( 24 ) He illustrates his model with evidence drawn from various religious traditions , including the Baha'i Faith . Wach proposes that the founded religions begin with an initial phase during which their teachings are established by an individual through the force of his own charisma . This individual becomes the center of a " circle " of disciples who are personally attached to him . This " circle " represents the entire body of believers . <p> After the death of the founder , a new phase in the development of the religion begins during which the " circle " is transformed into a new kind of organization which Wach termed the " brotherhood . " Whereas during the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered on him alone , after his departure the teachings must be carried on by his close disciples . Typically , only believers who have known the founder personally and were members of the original " circle " will achieve positions of leadership in the " brotherhood " phase of the religion 's growth . But these new leaders will reorganize and reinterpret the prophet 's work--seniority and direct contact with the prophet 's charisma becoming the sources of their authority . <p> This " brotherhood " must , of course , gradually disintegrate ; and the third phase of the religion 's development is marked by its slow transformation into an " ecclesiastical body , " or a church . This last stage represents the full routinization of the founder 's charisma , during which the teachings , the rituals , and the authority of the church and its functionaries become formalized . <p> Margit Warburg , using the example of the establishment of the Baha'i Faith in Denmark , has demonstrated the value of Wach 's model to the understanding of the spread of an existing religion into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same three phases of " circle , " " brotherhood , " and " ecclesiastical body " can be seen , over a much shorter period of time , to have characterized the history of the Baha'i Faith in Denmark . Introduced in 1947 , by two women--American pioneers who played the role of " founders " --the Baha'i community was initially established as a " circle " of believers centered around them . The community experienced a painful reorganization into a " brotherhood " after the pioneers left the country in 1951 , and then later began its development toward routinized organization and formal hierarchy--developments which are still in process today . <p> Warburg finds major structural similarities between the founding of a new religion by a prophet , as described by Wach , and its subsequent introduction into a new area of the world by the first missionaries . At least three characteristics are nearly identical : <p> 1 . The religion was previously unknown in a particular area to the public at large ; <p> 2 . The founder and/or the first missionaries hold a monopoly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new converts , the founder and/or first missionaries are undisputed religious authorities. ( 26 ) <p> Warburg is careful to clarify that this comparison of founder and first missionaries is valid only from an academic , sociological perspective . It does not represent the point of view of the missionaries themselves , who would regard the two situations as fundamentally different . Such a comparison would also be rejected by the adherents of the religion , since naturally they would regard their prophet as beyond comparison to later missionaries , and might even be offended by such an idea . <p> Nonetheless , Warburg usefully suggests that : <p> This structural similarity between the two situations means that the missionary 's position in the religious community is similar to that of the founder , both enjoying a special status among the believers . Both are sole mediators of religious knowledge directly from superior authority . The relation between the missionary(ies) and the first converts will be a structural parallel to the founder 's relation to his first disciples , because both the founder and the missionary act as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Wach 's terminology , this type of organization is called a " circle . " This concept , therefore , will also be applicable to a situation where a missionizing religion is first introduced into a new area. ( 27 ) <p> I would propose that these structural conditions apply to the introduction of the Baha'i Faith into the Cameroons and Eastern Nigeria , with Enoch Olinga playing the role of the first missionary who attracted a circle of believers around himself . The Baha'i Church of Calabar , on the other hand , exhibited no such characteristics . It was initiated by Njang and Oban-Itchi as an ecclesiastical body in the tradition of Protestant Christianity , and it saw itself not as a founding " circle " but as a new church . As such , this church was free to attract an immediate attendance to its services of a large number of worshippers who were familiar with that tradition . <p> After Njang 's move to Akpabeyo and Oban-Itchi 's failure to maintain the church in Calabar , both men eventually turned to Olinga as the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was already established as the center of a new " circle , " and they--in effect--became his " disciples " ( in a structural sense ) . This created a situation which was entirely distinct from their previous presentation of the Baha'i Faith as a church . As a " circle " the Baha'i religion would have much less appeal to large numbers of Christian men in West Africa than would a church . <p> Although Warburg is not concerned with this aspect of his analysis , Wach--in proposing his model for the development of founded religions--has noted the different levels of demand and commitment required of believers at the different stages of " circle , " " brotherhood , " and church . Membership in the original " circle " requires " a complete break with the ordinary pursuits of life and a radical change in social and religious relationships . Ties of family and kinship and loyalties of various kinds are at least temporarily relaxed or severed . " ( 28 ) The " circle " demands intense bonds of solidarity among the believers , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything behind to follow the new religion and adopt " a revised attitude toward the nature of ultimate truth as well as toward the world and its inhabitants . " They adopt a new identity and should expect to suffer hardships , suffering , persecution , and even martyrdom. ( 29 ) <p> This approach to religion very much characterized the demands and expectations of the Baha'i pioneers in West Africa toward their converts during the first years of its growth there . The very first converts in Cameroon were almost immediately asked to leave friends , family , and fellow believers behind , and to scatter as pioneers to various parts of the region . As we have seen , many of them did just that. ( 30 ) <p> By the time the religion develops into a church , Wach observes , these expectations are relaxed--at least for the majority of believers . A " double standard of perfection " distinguishes the " clergy " from the " laity . " Most members of the church pursue their lives in an ordinary way within a stable , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with Olinga , I would suggest that Njang and Oban-Itchi found their conception of the Baha'i religion changed from the assumption that it was a church among other Christian churches to the realization that it was--at least in Cameroons--conceived as a " circle . " Olinga 's first letters to Njang do not instruct him to form a Baha'i church in Akpabeyo that might duplicate the success he had achieved in Calabar , it should be noted . Olinga 's first instructions were to have all of the Baha'is in Akpabeyo " declare " their faith and register their names as members of a new religion . This declaration procedure , however normal in the Baha'i world , was unfamiliar to Njang , as it would have been to his new converts . Certainly , this was an act that implied a radical change in religious identity . It was this new concept which effectively brought a halt to Njang 's Baha'i church project and connected him to the wider international Baha'i community which conceived of itself quite differently . <p> CONCLUSIONS <p> So , what are the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa in the 1950s , in effect , a Baha'i Faith without the Baha'is ? What can we learn from the brief life of the Baha'i Church of Calabar ? <p> Certainly , the first thing that is obvious is the enormous role which the initiative of African converts played in the establishment of the Baha'i Faith in West Africa . In the Calabar case , the Baha'i teachings alone were extremely effective in establishing a substantial following of converts without any effort whatsoever being made by foreign Baha'is . Conceived , of course , as a Christian teaching , the Baha'i message alone had enormous appeal to West Africans--quite independently of its missionaries . Such appeal implies , not only the persuasiveness of the message itself , but more importantly the readiness of Africans to adopt it on their own initiative . As an independent Christian church , which is how it was recognized and reworked in Calabar , the Baha'i Faith was an extremely successful movement . <p> Second , we may note that the points of attraction to the Baha'i message from an African perspective were quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of ' Abdu'l-Baha , the Baha'i teachings on hospitality , the English translation of Baha'i texts , and an unorthodox ( 32 ) explanation of the cause of premature death were the elements which allowed a bridge to large-scale conversion in Calabar . The usual elements of Baha'i teaching--the concept of progressive revelation , the Baha'i principles , claims for a new prophet , call to a new religious age--were absent . <p> One point of conversion between the conventional Baha'i message and the Calabar doctrine , however , may have been agreement on the overwhelming significance of the macrocosm to the life of its converts . This may have been expressed in the form of a strict monotheism in the new Baha'i church which would have marked the arrival of the modern world in West Africa and the end of the traditional , village order . For the larger Baha'i world , this idea would be understood as the fundamental Baha'i belief in the unity of humanity , the oneness and wholeness of the human race . <p> And again , the Baha'is of Calabar and the Baha'is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common experience of conversion to a new Faith , though a Faith with deep roots in their old tradition . Insofar as the Calabar Baha'is experienced their Baha'i services as a move beyond the Basel Mission to a post-Christian religion--in some sense , a post-colonial religion , they shared this experience of conversion and renewal with every other Baha'i in the world . <p> Finally , and perhaps most importantly , our laboratory experiment indicates clearly that the conception of the Baha'i Faith as a closed " circle " of believers , believers who are expected to break with the past and pursue the promulgation of the religion at any cost to themselves , failed to attract large numbers of converts in West Africa . On the other hand , the presentation of the Baha'i Faith as a new Christian church with a fresh message for its followers was enormously effective . The initial success of Njang and Oban-Itchi is organizing a Baha'i Church stands as an important counter-example to their very limited success in finding converts to the Baha'i Faith once they were converted to Enoch Olinga 's circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of foreign pioneers in establishing the Baha'i community in other parts of Africa . <p> ( 9 ) All the factual information concerning the Baha'i Church of Calabar that is presented in this chapter is taken from two taped interviews with Oscar Njang : one recorded on June 27 , 1981 by Don Addison in Ikot Uba Village , Cross River State , Nigeria ; the other recorded in January 1992 by ? ? ? , the Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nigeria ( and apparently with an audience at a Baha'i meeting ) in Lagos . <p> ( 13 ) Cf. Matt 20:1-19 , the parable of the laborers in the vineyard . Njang would have been intimately familiar with this parable from his mission training . The resonance of his speech is largely drawn from the familiarity of the parable which is now turned to suit African theological concerns . See below <p> ( 14 ) Matt. 20:1-19 . <p> ( 15 ) Presumably meaning that late-comer converts to Christianity will have the same status as early believers--both in this world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not maintaining that the parable was necessarily original to Njang . He may easily have heard this explanation of death during his years of mission education and simply repeated it here . The parable does appear to have been new to the other men on the plantation who may have heard it for the first time at the Baha'i service , but possibly it was just familiar . There is no question that it was satisfying as a response to the question of premature death . <p> ( 22 ) For a critique of Horton 's model ( beyond Fisher 's reply , which was effectively dismissed by Horton 's second Africa article in 1975 ) , see Andr Droogers , " From waste-making to recycling : A plea for an eclectic use of models in the study of religious change , " in Theoretical Explorations in African Religions , ed. by Wim van Binsbergen and Matthew Schoffeleers ( London : KPI , 1985 ) pp. 116-19 . <p> ( 23 ) It should be observed that this was not the Presbyterian church in which he had been educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underscores , perhaps , the flexibility of Christian observance among the working men on the palm plantations in Nigeria . <p> ( 29 ) Ibid. , p. 136 . These kinds of demands and expectations certainly characterized the Baha'i community in the United States during the 1950s and , to a much lesser extent , continue to characterize it today . <p> ( 30 ) This refers to early chapters in the ( proposed ) dissertation that discuss how the early Baha'is in Cameroon were urged to pioneer almost immediately during the first year of the Ten Year World Crusade . <p> ( 31 ) Wach , Sociology of Religion , p. 144 . <p> ( 32 ) Unorthodox from a Baha'i point of view , that is . And only in the sense that Njang 's parable can not be found in official Baha'i texts . 
@@40786678 @786678/ <p> Reviewed by Eyal Ben-Ari ( Department of Sociology and Anthropology , The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) Published on H-War ( July , 2004 ) <p> The Yom Kippur War : Still Relevant After all These Years <p> This volume is a reprinted edition of a book originally published in 1975 . In it , Chaim Herzog , an Israeli general and later President of the State of Israel , provides what is still very much the authoritative account of what Israelis call the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and the Arabs call the War of Ramadan . The coordinated attack that began on the sixth of October in 1973 ( Yom Kippur--the holiest day in the Jewish calendar ) was initiated and carried out by Egypt and Syria in the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights respectively . The attack , which took the Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ) totally by surprise , was the outcome of a grave intelligence mistake that almost caused the destruction of Israel . The war lasted for three weeks and represents one of the largest and most intense armor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a turning point in Middle East history since it demonstrated Israel ? s vulnerability , proved Syria and Egypt ? s military power , and set the base for the peace accords later signed between Israel and Egypt , and the peace talks that were held between Israel and Syria . <p> Issued on the thirtieth anniversary of this conflict , the book includes a new introduction written by Brigadier General Michael Herzog , the author ? s son and a serving officer in the IDF . This introduction provides some insights about the author , emphasizes the importance of the book , and draws some of the wider lessons it bears for modern military adventures . The book itself is based on interviews with Israeli leaders and IDF officers and soldiers ( although there is no comprehensive list of them ) , tours of battlefields , and studies and publications ( including a small number of Egyptian ones ) already published by the mid-seventies . It contains a number of maps and illustrations that trace out the strategic situation of Israel and the tactical moves of the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main actors and some of the battlefields of the conflict . Throughout the book the author ? s vast experience as a military commander and political commentator are used in order to illuminate the experience of the war . Herzog strives to provide a balanced view of the war by using material not only from Israeli records but also from Arab reports and commentary . Given that the author had very good access to Israeli material and given the rather secretive nature of the Egyptian and ( especially ) Syrian regimes , the book provides more details about the Israeli side of the conflict . <p> Herzog ? s analysis begins by tracing out the broad geo-political situation in the Middle-East and the build-up of the Egyptian and Syrian forces before the war . Along these lines , the first chapters trace out the process that Egyptian President Anwar Sadat began in 1971 when he raised the possibility of a peace agreement with Israel should it return all the territories it had occupied in the 1967 Six Days ' War . When no progress was made , Sadat threatened war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and a half . During 1972 and 1973 Sadat initiated a concerted diplomatic offensive among a number of states around the world to win support for his cause . At the same time , he petitioned the Soviet Union to pressure the United States and provide his country with more offensive weapons and military wares with which to cross the Suez Canal . Since the Soviet leadership was more interested in detente with the United States than in confrontation in the Middle East , it rejected Sadat 's demands . In response , he expelled approximately 20,000 ( mainly military ) Soviet advisers from Egypt . <p> While this was going on , as Herzog shows , the Arab forces studied Israel ? s weaknesses and eventually surprised it by making it divide its forces between two theaters ( the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights ) . Syria and Egypt also devoted resources to developing ( on the basis of Soviet military advice ) anti-aircraft and anti-tank umbrellas which were designed to force Israel to commit to an extended battle that would wear down its forces . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership faced upon the beginning of the hostilities , and underscores Israel ? s intelligence failure that was the outcome of smugness and underestimation of the Arab enemy and its capabilities and goals . Indeed , as Herzog ( and later a long line of scholars and commentators ) contends , this failure lay in the extraordinary military success of the Israelis in the Six Days ' War of 1967 and the ways in which they explained away the developing power of Egypt and Syria . The intelligence failure has not only fueled debates over the years but been at the base of the complete revamping of Israel ? s military intelligence services . <p> The following chapters of the book then show how , when thrust into defensive operations in two theaters , Israel mobilized its reserves and eventually repulsed the invaders . After providing riveting accounts of the war ? s major battles Herzog explains how the fighting was subsequently carried into Syrian and Egyptian territory . During the second and third weeks of the war , the two Arab states began to be supplied by sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immediate ceasefire and hoped for a decisive Arab victory . As a result , however , the United States belatedly began its own airlift to Israel . At the end of the war , Egypt and Syria were saved from defeat through the intervention of the United Nations . The achievements of Syria and Egypt led to a restoration of national pride and to the peace accords signed between Israel and Egypt a few years later . As Herzog explains , the full scale military excursion into the Sinai Peninsula was planned by Sadat to proceed only a few kilometers into the Sinai and thus to provide a ? prod ? towards the beginning of diplomatic efforts . <p> To what kind of readership does the volume appeal ? Written in a clear and flowing style , Herzog has produced a book that will be of interest to anyone concerned with Middle-East affairs . Because it successfully mixes analyses of tactical and strategic issues , it provides an excellent introduction to the war and its long-term ramifications . Readers more interested in the tactical aspects of the conflict will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Golan Heights , as well as the methods used by Arab forces to counter Israel 's advantage in rapid mobile armor . The book also discusses stories of individual Israeli commanders and gives a firsthand account of several of their personal experiences . Intelligence specialists will find a valuable lesson regardiing how to interpret indications and warnings , understanding the elaborate deception plan concocted by the Egyptians and Syrians prior to the start of hostilities and the weaknesses of what Israelis call the ? conception ? : the erroneous understanding of the Arab states and their capabilities and intentions . <p> Does the book stand the test of time ? My answer is that it most certainly does . Herzog ? s sketch of the broad contours of the war has not been superseded . No less importantly , the lessons that Herzog ? s account raises about more general aspects of contemporary militaries still hold . While I have mentioned Israel ? s intelligence failure that led to the complete overhaul of Israel ? s military intelligence services , the book carries other lessons . First , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? weaker ? parties to a conflict to utilize the strengths of the stronger parties . It is in this light , for instance , that one may understand how Syria and Egypt realized the effectiveness of Israel ? s Air Force and began to emphasize the development of air defense systems and ground-to-ground missiles . In a related manner , both Arab parties understood the speed with which IDF reserves could mobilize to answer their attacks and designed a plan to give the Israelis little time for effective mobilization . Finally , the Arab plan also capitalized on the amount of infantry at their disposal and equipped them with antitank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades to counter Israel 's reliance on mobile armor with relatively small numbers of infantry . These points later led to the development of the joint-force air-land battle and the understanding ( on the part of Israeli military leaders ) of the value of waging war in a synergic manner . A few years later , these understandings led to the establishment of the Israel Ground Forces Command , a first step towards the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this is a point made by Michael Herzog in his introduction , the ultimate success of the IDF in the Yom Kippur War and the growing gap between Israel and its Arab neighbors in military terms intensified the search for what may be termed the ? power of the weak. ? This power now expresses itself in such low-tech means as suicide bombers or guerrilla warfare in order to counter Israel ? s unquestioned military superiority . Third , within Israel , the October 1973 war intensified the debate about the future of Israel 's control over the 1967 territories . Some groups interpreted the war as further evidence of the need to populate and strengthen these areas for security and strategic reasons , and as a result , Israeli settlements in the areas occupied by Israel in 1967 increased . <p> How does the book compare with more recent volumes published about the war ? A variety of works have developed our understanding of the Yom Kippur War in different directions . First a plethora of much more focused memoirs and biographies--on both the Israeli and Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual perspectives on the war and inclusively provide a detailed picture of the various issues that Herzog analyzes or raises in his volume . As such , they seem to fill in the broad sketch lines that Herzog provides in his volume . Second , two new books , both by journalists , have recently been written with the aim of offering a general overview of the conflict . They thus provide a good reference point from which to judge the Herzog volume. 2 The first volume published in Hebrew by Ronen Bergman and Gil Meltzer presents more details and particular descriptions about the war--such as soldiers ? and generals ? voices and opinions--but does very little in the way of offering an extended analysis of the conflict . The second tome , by Abraham Rabinovitch , has been published in English and also contains many personal stories and additional information about the battles of the war . While this book does not impart any new insights about the conflict , the author was able to include greater detail about the long term effects of the war . Third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the social and individual implications of the war. 3 These studies are much more academic and as a consequence are more focused on such issues as the life-stories of Israeli veterans of the Yom-Kippur War , the implications of the conflict for civil-military relations , or the psychology of combat . <p> To conclude , Herzog ? s volume is still very much a required classic on the subject .

Yet the inquirer who approaches the extant literature of Persia expecting to find any comprehensive systems of thought , like those of Kapila or Kant , will have to turn back disappointed , though deeply impressed by the wonderful intellectual subtlety displayed therein . It seems to me that the Persian mind is rather impatient of detail , and consequently destitute of that organising faculty which gradually works out a system of ideas , by interpreting the fundamental principles with reference to the ordinary facts of observation . The subtle Brahman sees the inner unity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former endeavours to discover it in all the aspects of human experience , and illustrates its hidden presence in the concrete in various ways , the latter appears to be satisfied with a bare universality , and does not attempt to verify the richness of its inner content . The butterfly imagination of the Persian , flies half-inebriated as it were , from flower to flower , and seems to be incapable of reviewing the garden as a whole . For this reason , his deepest thoughts and emotions find expression mostly in disconnected verses ( Ghazal ) , which reveal all the subtlety of his artistic soul . The Hindu , while admitting , like the Persian , the <p> x <p> necessity of a higher source of knowledge , yet calmly moves from experience to experience , mercilessly dissecting them , and forcing them to yield their underlying universality . In fact the Persian is only half-conscious of Metaphysics . as a system of thought ; his Brahman brother , on the other hand , is fully alive to the need of presenting his theory in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this mental difference between the two nations is clear . In the one case we have only partially worked out systems of thought ; in the other case , the awful sublimity of the searching Vedanta . The student of Islamic Mysticism who is anxious to see an all-embracing exposition of the principle of Unity , must look up the heavy volumes of the Andalusian Ibn al-Arabi , whose profound teaching stands in strange contrast with the dry-as-dust Islam of his countrymen . The results , however , of the intellectual activity of the different branches of the great Aryan family are strikingly similar . The outcome of all Idealistic speculation in India is Buddha , in Persia Bahaullah , and in the west Schopenhauer whose system , in Hegelian language , is the marriage of free oriental universality with occidental determinateness . <p> But the history of Persian thought presents a phenomenon peculiar to itself . In Persia , due perhaps to Semitic influences , philosophical speculation has indissolubly associated itself with religion , and thinkers in new lines of thought have almost always been founders of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , we see pure Philosophy severed from religion by the Neo-Platonic Aristotelians of Islam , but the severance was only a transient phenomenon . Greek philosophy , though an exotic plant in the soil of Persia , eventually became an integral part of Persian thought ; and later thinkers , critics as well as advocates of Greek wisdom , talked in the philosophical language of Aristotle and Plato , and were mostly influenced by religious pre-suppositions . It is necessary to bear this fact in mind in order to gain a thorough understanding of post-Islamic Persian thought . <p> The object of this investigation is , as will appear , to prepare a ground-work for a future history of Persian Metaphysics . Original thought can not be expected in a review , the object of which is purely historical ; yet I venture to claim some consideration for the following two points ; - ( a ) I have endeavoured to trace the logical continuity of Persia in thought , which I have tried to interpret in the language of modern Philosophy . This , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) I have discussed the subject of Sufism in a more scientific manner , and have attempted to bring out the intellectual conditions which necessitated such a phenomenon . In opposition , therefore , to the generally accepted view I have tried to maintain that Sufiism is a necessary product of the play of various intellectual and moral forces which would necessarily awaken the slumbering soul to a higher ideal of life . <p> xii <p> Owing to my ignorance of Zend , my knowledge of Zoroaster is merely second-hand . As regards the second part of my work , I have been able to look up the original Persian and Arabic manuscripts as well as many printed works connected with my investigation . I give below the names of Arabic and Persian manuscripts from which I have drawn most of the material utilized here . The method of transliteration adopted is the one recognised by the Royal Asiatic Society . <p> To Zoroaster - the ancient sage of Iran - must always be assigned the first place in the intellectual history of Iranian Aryans who , wearied of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when the Vedic Hymns were still being com-posed in the plains of Central Asia . This new mode of life and the consequent stability of the institution of property among the settlers , made them hated by other Aryan tribes who had not yet shaken off their original nomadic habits , and occasionally plundered their more civilised kinsmen . Thus grew up the conflict between the two modes of life which found its earliest expression in the denunciation of the deities of each other - the Devas and the Ahuras . It was , really the beginning of a long individualising process which gradually severed the Iranian branch from other Aryan tribes , and finally manifested itself in the religious system of Zoroaster ( 1 ) the <p> 1 Some European scholars have held Zoroaster to be nothing more than a mythical personage . But since the publication of Professor Jackson 's admirable Life of Zoroaster , the Iranian Prophet has , I believe , finally got out of the ordeal of modern criticism . <p> 4 <p> great prophet of Iran who lived and taught in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern oriental research we see ancient Iranians -divided between two camps-partisans of the powers of good , and partisans of the powers of evil when the great sage joins their furious contest , and with his moral enthusiasm stamps out once for all the worship of demons as well as the intolerable ritual of the Magian priesthood . It is , however , beside our purpose to trace the origin and growth of Zoroaster 's religious system . Our object , in so far as the present investigation is concerned , is to glance at the metaphysical side of his revelation . We , therefore , wish to fix our attention on the sacred trinity of philosophy - God , Man and Nature . <p> Geiger , in his " Civilisation of Eastern Iranians in Ancient Times " , points out that Zoroaster inherited two fundamental principles from his Aryan ancestry : - ( 1 . ) There is law in Nature . ( 2 . ) There is conflict in Nature . It is the observation of law and conflict in the vast panorama of being that constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was to reconcile the existence of evil with the eternal goodness of God . His predecessors worshipped a plurality of good spirits all of which he reduced to a unity and called it Ahuramazda . On the other hand he reduced all the powers of evil to a similar unity and called it Druj-Ahriman . Thus by a process of unification he arrived at two fundamental principles which , as Haug shows , he <p> 5 <p> looked upon not as two independent activities , but as two parts or rather aspects of the same Primary Being . Dr. Haug , therefore , holds that the Prophet of ancient Iran was theologically a monotheist and philosophically a dualist(1) . But to maintain that there are " twin " ( 2 ) spirits - creators of reality and nonreality - and at the same time to hold that these two spirits are united in the Supreme Being , ( 3 ) is virtually to say that the principle of evil constitutes a part of the very essence of God ; and the conflict between good and evil is nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , an inherent weakness in his attempt to reconcile theological monotheism with philosophical dualism , and the result was a schism among the prophet 's followers . The Zendiks ( 4 ) whom Dr. Haug calls heretics , but who were , I believe , decidedly more consistent than their opponents , maintained the independence of the two original spirits from each other , while the Magi upheld their unity . The upholders of unity endeavoured , in various ways , to meet the Zendiks ; but the very fact that they tried different phrases and expressions to express the unity of the " Primal Twins " , indicates dissatisfaction with their own philosophical explanations , and the strength <p> 1 . Essays , p. 303.2 . " In the beginning there was a pair of twins , two spirits , each of a peculiar activity . " Yas . XXX . I3 . " The more beneficial of my spirits has produced , by speaking it , the whole rightful creation . " Yas . XIX. 9.4 . The following verse from Bundahish Chap . 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( the two principles ) there was empty space , that is what they call " air " in which is now their meeting . " <p> 6 <p> of their opponent 's position . Shahrastani ( 1 ) describes briefly the different explanations of the Magi . The Zarwanians look upon Light and Darkness as the sons of Infinite Time . The Kiyumarthiyya hold that the original principle was Light which was afraid of a hostile power , and it was this thought of an adversary mixed with fear that led to the birth of Darkness . Another branch of Zarwanians maintain that the original principle doubted concerning something and this doubt produced Ahriman . Ibn Hazm ( 2 ) speaks of another sect who explained the principle of Darkness as the obscuration of a part of the fundamental principle of Light itself . Whether the philosophical dualism of Zoroaster can be reconciled with his monotheism or not , it is unquestionable that , from a metaphysical standpoint he has made a profound suggestion in regard to the ultimate nature of reality . The idea seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Shahrastani : ed . Cureton , London , 1846 , pp-182-185 . <p> 2 . Ibn Hazm - Kitab al-Milal w'al-Nihal : ed . Cairo , Vol . Il , p. 34.3 . In connection with the influence of Zoroastrian ideas on Ancient Greek thought , the following statement made by Erdmann is noteworthy , though Lawrence Mills ( American journal of Philology , Vol. 22 ) regards such influence as improbable : - " The fact that the handmaids of this force , which he ( Heraclitus ) calls the seed of all that happens and the measure of all order , are entitled the " tongues " has probably been slightly ascribed to the influence of the Persian Magi . On the other hand he connects himself with his country 's mythology , not indeed without a change of exegesis when he places Apollo and Dionysus beside Zeus , i.e. The ultimate fire , as the two aspects of his nature " . History of Philosophy , Vol. 1 , p. 50 . It is , perhaps , owing to this doubtful influence of Zoroastrianism on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History of the Problems of Philosophy , Vol . IT , p. 147 ) looks upon Zoroaster as a precursor of Hegel . <p> 7 <p> as early Christian Gnostic speculation , and through the latter , some aspects of modern Western thought ( 1 ) . As a thinker he is worthy of great respect not , only because he approached the problem of objective multiplicity in a philosophical spirit , but also because he endeavoured , having been led to metaphysical dualism , to reduce his Primary Duality to higher unity . He seems to have perceived , what the mystic shoemaker of Germany perceived long after him , that the diversity of nature could not be explained with postulating a principle of negativity or self differentiation in the very nature of God . His immediate successors did not , however , quite realise the deep significance of their master 's suggestions but we shall see , as we advance , how Zoroaster 's idea finds a more spiritualised expression in some of the aspects of later Persian thought . <p> Of Zoroastrian influence on Pythagoras , Erdmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; are put above the even , has been emphasised by Gladisch in his comparison of the Pythagorian with the Chinese doctrine , and the fact , moreover , that among the oppositions we find those of light and darkness , good and evil , has induced many , in ancient and modern times , to suppose that they were borrowed from Zoroastrianism . " Vol. 1 , p. 33 . <p> 1 . Among modern English thinkers Mr. Bradley arrives at a conclusion similar to that of Zoroaster . Discussing the Ethical significance of Bradley 's Philosophy , Prof. Sorley says : - " Mr. Bradley , like Green , has faith in an eternal reality which might be called spiritual , inasmuch as it is not material ; like Green , he looks upon man 's moral activity as an appearance-what Green calls a reproduction-of this eternal reality . But under this general agreement there lies a world of difference . fie refuses by the use of the term self-conscious , to liken his Absolute to the personality of man , and he brings out the consequence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil equally with the good in man and in the world are appearances of the Absolute " . Recent Tendencies in Ethics , pp. 100-101 . <p> 8 <p> Turning now to his Cosmology , his dualism leads him to bifurcate , as it were , the whole universe in two departments of being - reality i.e. the sum of good creations flowing from the creative activity the beneficial spirit , and non-reality ( 1 ) i.e. the sum all evil creations Proceeding from the hostile spirit . The original conflict of the two spirits is manifested in the opposing forces of nature , which , therefore presents a continual struggle between the Powers of good and the powers of Evil . But it should be remembered that nothing intervenes between the original spirits and their respective creations . Things are good and bad because they proceed from good or bad creative agencies , in their own nature they are quite indifferent . Zoroaster 's conception of creation is fundamentally different from that Of Plato and Schopenhauer to whom spheres of empirical reality reflect non-temporal or temporal ideas which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are , according to Zoroaster , only two categories of existence , and the history of the universe is nothing more than a progressive conflict between the forces failing -respectively under these categories . We are , like other things Partakers of this struggle , and it is our duty to range ourselves on the side of Light which will eventually prevail completely and vanquish the spirit of Darkness , The metaphysics <p> 1 . This should not be confounded with Plato 's non-being . To Zoroaster all forms of existence Proceeding from the creative agency of the spirit of darkness are unreal - because , considering the final triumph of the spirit of Light , they have a temporary existence only . <p> 9 <p> of the Iranian Prophet , like that of Plato , passes on into Ethics , and it is in the peculiarity of the Ethical aspect of his thought that the influence of his social environment is most apparent . Zoroaster 's view of the destiny of the soul is very simple . The soul , according to him , is a creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) afterwards maintained . It had a beginning in time , but can attain to everlasting life by fighting against Evil in the earthly scene of its activity . It is free to choose between the only two courses of action-good and evil ; and besides the power of choice the spirit of Light has endowed it with the following , faculties : <p> 1 . . Mithraism was a phase Of Zoroastrianism which spread over the Roman world in the second century . The partisans of Mithra. worshipped the sun whom they locked upon as the great advocate of Light . They held the human soul to be a part of God , and maintained that the observance of a mysterious cult could bring about the soul 's union with God . Their doctrine of the soul , its ascent towards God by torturing the body and finally passing through the sphere of Aether and becoming pure fire , offers some resemblance with views entertained by some schools of Persian Sufism.2 .

The Place of good words . 3 . The Place of good works . 4 . The Place of Eternal Glory ( 2 ) - Where the <p> as models according to which things are fashioned . Plato 's ideas , moreover , are eternal , non-temporal and non-spatial .

The sufi Cosmology has a similar doctrine concerning the different stages of existence through which the soul has to pass in its journey heavenward . They enumerate the following five Planes ; but their definition of the character of each plane is slightly different : <p> 1 . The world of body ( Nasut ) .2 .

MANI ( 1 ) AND MAZDAK ( 2 ) <p> We have seen Zoroaster 's solution of the problem of diversity , and the theological or rather philosophical controversy which split up the Zoroastrian Church . The half-Persian Mani - " the founder of Godless community " as Christians styled him afterwards - agrees with those Zoroastrians who held their approaches Prophet 's doctrine in its naked form , and approaches the question in a spirit thoroughly materialistic . Originally Persian , his father emigrated from Hamadan to Babylonia where Mani was born in 215 <p> 4 . The Plane of Emotional Nature.5 . The Plane of Thought.6 . The Plane of Spiritual soul-Reason.7 . The Plane of Pure Spirit . <p> or 216 A.D. - the time when Buddhistic Missionaries were beginning to preach Nirvana to the country of Zoroaster . The eclectic character of the religious system of Mani , its bold extension of the Christian idea of redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ground for an ascetic life , that the world is essentially evil , made it a real power which influenced not only Eastern and Western Christian thought ( 1 ) , but has also left some dim marks on the -development of metaphysical speculation in Persia . Leaving the discussion of the sources ( 2 ) of Mani 's religious system to the orientalist , we proceed to describe and finally to determine the philosophical value of his doctrine of the origin of the Phenomenal Universe . The Paganising gnostic , as Erdmann calls him , teaches that the variety of things springs from the <p> 1 " If I see aright , five different conceptions can be distinguished for the period about 400 A.D. First we have the Manichaean which insinuated its way in the darkness , but was widely extended even among the clergy " . ( Harnack 's " History of Christian Dogma , " Vol.V , p.56 ) . " From the anti-Manichaean controversy sprang the desire to conceive all God 's attributes as identical i.e. the interest in the indivisibility of God " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . Some Eastern sources of information about Mani 's Philosophy ( e.g. Ephraim Syrus mentioned by Prof. A. A. Bevan in his Introduction to the Hymn of the Soul ) tell us that he was a disciple of Bardesanes , the Syrian gnostic . The learned author of al-Fihrist " , however , mentions some books which Mani wrote against the followers of the Syrian gnostic . Burkitt , in his lectures on Early Eastern Christianity , gives a free translation of Bardesanes ' De Fato , the spirit of which I understand , is fully Christian , and thoroughly opposed to the teaching of Mani . Ibn Hazm , however , in his Kitab al-Milal w'al-Nihal ( Vol. 11 , p. 36 ) says , " Both agreed in other respects , except that Manibelieved darkness to be a living principle . " <p> 13 <p> mixture of two eternal Principles - Light and Darkness - which are separate from and independent of each other . The Principle of Light connotes ten ideas - Gentleness , Knowledge , Understanding , Mystery , Insight , Love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principle of Darkness connotes five eternal ideas - Mistiness , Heat , Fire , Venom , Darkness . Along with these two primordial principles and connected with each , Mani recognises the eternity of space and earth , each connoting respectively the ideas of knowledge , understanding , mystery , insight , breath , air , water , light and fire . In darkness - the feminine Principle in Nature - were hidden the elements of evil which , in the course of time , concentrated and resulted in the composition , so to speak , of the hideous - looking Devil - the principle of factivity . This first-born child of the fiery womb of darkness attacked the domain of the King of Light who , in order to ward off his malicious onslaught , created the Primal man . A serious conflict ensued between the two creatures , and resulted in the complete vanquishment of the Primal man . The evil one , then , succeeded in mixing together the five elements of darkness with the five elements of light . Thereupon the ruler of the domain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of these mixed elements with a view to free the atoms of light from their imprisonment . But the reason why darkness was the first to attack light , is that the latter , being in its essence good , could not proceed to start the <p> 14 <p> process of admixture which was essentially harmful to itself . The attitude of Mani 's Cosmology , therefore , to the Christian doctrine of Redemption is similar to that of Hegelian Cosmology to the doctrine of the Trinity . To him redemption is a physical process and all procreation , because it protracts the imprisonment of light , is contrary to the aim and object of the Universe . The imprisoned atoms of light are continually set free from darkness which is thrown down in the unfathomable ditch round the Universe . The liberated light , however , passes on to the sun and the moon whence it is carried by angels to the region of light - the eternal home of the King of Paradise - " Pid i vazargii " - Father of greatness . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) He rejects the Zoroastrian hypothesis of creative agencies to explain the problem of objective existence . Taking a thoroughly materialistic view of the question , he ascribes the phenomenal universe to the Mixture of two independent , eternal principles , one of which ( darkness ) is not only a part of the universe - stuff , but also the source wherein activity resides , as it were , slumbering , and starts up into being when the favourable moment arrives . The essential idea of his cosmology , therefore , has a curious resemblance <p> 1 It is interesting to compare Mani 's Philosophy of Nature with the Chinese notion of Creation , according to which all that exists flows from the Union of Yin and Yang . But the Chinese reduced the6e two principles to a higher unity : - Tai Keih . To Mani such a reduction was not possible ; since he could not conceive that things of opposite nature could proceed from the same principle . <p> 15 <p> with that of the great Hindu thinker Kapila , who accounts for the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ie. Sattwa ( goodness ) , Tamas ( darkness ) , and Rajas ( motion or passion ) which mix together to form Nature , when the equilibrium of the primordial matter ( Prakriti ) is upset . Of the various solutions ' of the problem of diversity which the Vedantist solved by postulating the mysterious power of " Maya " , and Leibniz , long afterwards , explained by his doctrine of the Identity of Indiscernibles , Mani 's solution , though childish , must find a place in the historical development of philosophical ideas . Its philosophical value may be insignificant ; but one thing is certain , ie. Mani was the first to venture the suggestion that the Universe is due to the activity of the Devil , and hence essentially evil - a proposition which seems to me to be the only logical justification of a system which preaches renunciation as the guiding principle of life . In our own times , Schopenhauer has been led to the same conclusion ; <p> 1 . Thomas Aquinas states and criticises Mani 's contrariety of Primal agents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of evil would seek.But all things seek their own **27;231;TOOLONG : Even a principle of evil would seek its own self-preservation. ( b ) What all things seek is good.But self-preservation is what all things seek.Therefore : Self-preservation is good , But a principle of evil would seek its own **27;260;TOOLONG : A principle of evil would seek some good--which shows that it is self-contradictory. - God and His Creatures , Book 11 , p. 105 . Rickabys Tr . <p> 16 <p> though , unlike Mani , he supposes the principle of objectification or individuation - " the sinful bent " of the will to life - to exist in the very nature of the Primal Will and not independent of it . <p> Turning now to the remarkable socialist of ancient Persia , Mazdak . This early prophet of communism appeared during the reign of Anushirwan the just ( 531-578 A.D. ) , and marked another dualistic reaction against the prevailing Zarwanian doctrine ( 1 ) . Mazdak , like Mani , taught that the diversity of things springs from the mixture of two independent , eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Darkness ) . But he differs from his predecessor in holding that the fact of their mixture as well as their final separation , are quite accidental , and not at all the result of choice . Mazdak 's God is endowed with sensation , and has four principal energies in his eternal presence-power of discrimination , memory , understanding and bliss . These four energies have four personal manifestations who , assisted by four other persons , superintend the course of the Universe . Variety in things and men is due to the various combinations of the original principles . But the most characteristic feature of the Mazdakite teaching is its communism , which is evidently an inference from the cosmopolitan spirit of Mani 's Philosophy . All men , said Mazdak , are equal ; and the notion of individual property was introduced by the hostile demons whose object is to turn God 's <p> Universe into a scene of endless misery . It is chiefly this aspect of Mazdak 's teaching that was most shocking to the Zoroastrian conscience , and finally brought about the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to have miraculously made the sacred Fire talk , and bear witness to the truth of his mission . <p> 3 . RETROSPECT <p> We have seen some of the aspects of Pre-Islamic Persian thought ; though , owing to our ignorance of the tendencies of Sassanide thought , and of the political , social , and intellectual conditions that determined its evolution , we have not been able fully to trace the continuity of ideas . Nations as well as individuals , in their intellectual history , begin with the objective . Although the moral fervour of Zoroaster gave a spiritual tone to his theory of the origin of things , yet the net result of this period of Persian speculation is nothing more than a materialistic dualism . The principle of Unity as a philosophical ground of all that exists , is but dimly perceived at this stage of intellectual evolution in Persia . The controversy among the followers of Zoroaster indicates that the movement towards a monistic conception of the Universe had begun ; but we have , unfortunately , no , evidence to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know that in the 6th century A.D. , Diogenes , Simplicius and other Neo- <p> 18 <p> Platonic thinkers were drivenby the persecution of Justinian , to take refuge in the court of the tolerant Anushirwan This great monarch , moreover , had several works translated for him from Sanskrit and Greek , but we have no historical evidence to show how far these events actually influenced the course of Persian thought . Let us , therefore , pass on to the advent of Islam in Persia , which completely shattered the old order of things , and brought to the thinking mind the new concept of an uncompromising monotheism as well as the Greek dualism of God and matter , as distinguished from the purely Persian dualism of God and Devil . <p> 19 <p> PART II <p> GREEK DUALISM <p> 20 <p> CHAPTER II <p> THE NEO-PLATONIC ARISTOTELIANS OF PERSIA <p> With the Arab conquest of Persia , a new era begins in the history of Persian thought . But the warlike sons of sandy Arabia whose swords terminated , at Nahawand , the political independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the converted Zoroastrian . <p> The political revolution brought about by the Arab conquest marks the beginning of interaction between the Aryan and the Semitic , and we find that the Persian , though he let 's the surface of his life become largely semitised , quietly converts Islam to his own Aryan habits of thought . In the West the sober Hellenic intellect interpreted another Semitic religion - Christianity ; and the results of interpretation in both cases are strikingly similar . In each case the aim of the interpreting intellect is to soften the extreme rigidity of an absolute law imposed on the individual from without ; in one word it is an endeavour to internalise the external . This process of transformation began with the study of Greek thought which , though combined with other causes , hindered the growth of native speculation , yet marked a transition from the purely objective attitude of Pre-Islamic Persian Philosophy to the subjective attitude of later <p> 22 <p> thinkers . It is , I believe , largely due to the influence of foreign thought that the old monistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8th century , assumed a much more spiritual aspect ; and , in its later development , revivified and spiritualised the old Iranian dualism of Light and Darkness . The fact , therefore , that Greek thought roused into fresh life the subtle Persian intellect , and largely contributed to , and was finally assimilated by the general course of intellectual evolution in Persia , justifies us in briefly running over , even though at the risk of repetition , the systems of the Persian Neo-Platonists who , as such , deserve very little attention in a history of purely Persian thought . It must , however , be remembered that Greek wisdom flowed towards the Moslem east through Harran and Syria . The Syrians took up the latest Greek speculation i.e. Neo-Platonism and transmitted to the Moslem what they believed to be the real philosophy of Aristotle . It is surprising that Mohammedan Philosophers , Arabs as well as Persians , continued wrangling over what they believed to be the real teaching of Aristotle and Plato , and it never occurred to them that for a thorough comprehension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . So great was their ignorance that an epitomised translation of the Enneads of Plotinus was accepted as " Theology of Aristotle . " It took them centuries to arrive at a clear conception of the two great masters of Greek thought ; and it is doubtful whether they ever completely understood <p> 23 <p> them . Avicenna is certainly clearer and more original than Al-Farabi and Ibn Maskawaih ; and the Andelusian Averroes , though he is nearer to Aristotle than any of his predecessors , is yet far from a complete grasp of Aristotle 's Philosophy . It would , however , be unjust to accuse them of servile imitation . The history of their speculation is one continuous attempt to wade through a hopeless mass of absurdities that careless translators of Greek Philosophy had introduced . They had largely to rethink the Philosophies of Aristotle and Plato . Their commentaries constitute , so to speak , an effort at discovery , not exposition . The very circumstances which left them no time to think out independent systems of thought , point to a subtle mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that patient industry had gradually to eliminate , and thus to window out truth from falsehood . With these preliminary remarks we proceed to consider Persian students of Greek Philosophy individually . <p> 1 . IBN MASKAWAIH ( d. 1030 ) <p> Passing overthe names of Sarakhsi , Farabi who <p> 1 . Dr. Boer , in his Philosophy of Islam , gives a full account of the Philosophy of Al-Farabi and Avicenna ; but his account of Ibn Maskawaih 's Philosophy is restricted to the Ethical teaching of that Philosopher . I have given here his metaphysical views which are decidedly more systematic than those of al-Farabi . Instead of repeating Avicenna 's Neo-Platonism I have briefly stated what I believe to be his original contribution to the thought of his country . <p> 2 . Sarakhsi died in 899 A.D. He was a disciple of the Arabian Philosopher Al-Kindi His works , unfortunately , have not reached us . <p> 24 <p> was a Turk , and the Physician Razi ( d. 932 A.D. ) who true to his Persian habits of thought , looked upon light as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , space and time , we come to the illustrious name of Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ya'qub , commonly known as Ibn Maskawaih - the treasurer of the Buwaihid Sultan Adaduddaula - one of the most eminent theistic thinkers , physicians , , moralists and historians of Persia . I give below a brief account of his system from his well-known work Al Fauz al-Asghar , published in Beirut . <p> 1 . The existence of the ultimate principle <p> Here Ibn Maskawaih follows Aristotle , and reproduces his argument based on the fact of physical motion . All bodies have the inseparable property of motion which covers all forms of change , and does not proceed from the nature of bodies themselves . Motion , therefore , demands an external source of prime mover . The supposition that motion may constitute the very essence of bodies , is contradicted by experience . Man , for instance , has the power of free movement ; but , on the supposition , different parts of his body must continue to move even after they are severed from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at a cause which , itself immovable , moves everything else . The immobility of the Primal cause is essential ; for the supposition of motion in the Primal cause would necessitate infinite regress , which is absurd . <p> 25 <p> The immovable mover is one . A multiplicity of original movers must imply something common in their nature , so that they might be brought under the same category . It must also imply some point of difference in order to distinguish them from each other . But this partial identity and difference necessitate composition in their respective essences ; and , composition , being a form of motion , can not , as we have shown , exist in the first cause of motion . The prime mover again is eternal and immaterial . Since transition from non-existence to existence is a form of motion ; and since matter is always subject to some kind of motion , it follows that a thing which is not eternal , or is , in any way , associated with matter , must be in motion . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sensations , which are gradually transformed into perceptions . The earlier stages of intellection are completely conditioned by the presence of external reality . But the progress of knowledge means to be able to think without being conditioned by matter . Thought begins with matter , but its object is to gradually free itself from the primary condition of its own possibility . A higher stage , therefore , is reached in imagination - the power to reproduce and retain in the mind the copy or image of a thing without reference to the external objectivity of the thing itself . In the formation of concepts thought reaches a still higher stage in point <p> 26 <p> of freedom from materiality ; though the concept , in so far as it is the result of comparison and assimilation of percepts , can not be regarded as having completely freed itself from the gross cause or sensations . But the fact that conception is based on perception , should not lead us to ignore the great difference between the nature of the concept and the percept . The individual ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the knowledge founded on mere perception . The knowledge of individuals , therefore , lacks the element of permanence . The universal ( concept ) , on the other hand , is not affected by the law of change . Individuals change ; the universal remains intact . It is the essence of matter to submit to the law of change : the freer a thing is from matter , the less liable it is to change . God , therefore , being absolutely free from matter , is absolutely changeless ; and it is His complete freedom from materiality that makes our conception of Him difficult or impossible . The object of all philosophical training is to develop the power of " ideation " or contemplation on pure concepts , in order that constant practice might make possible the conception of the absolutely immaterial . <p> 3 . How the one creates the many <p> Inthis connection it is necessary , for the sake of clearness , to divide Ibn Maskawaih 's investigations into two parts : - <p> ( a ) That the ultimate agent or cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , hold <p> 27 <p> the eternity of matter , and attribute form to the creative activity of God . It is , however , admitted that when matter passes from one form into another form , the previous form becomes absolutely non-existent . For if it does not become absolutely non-existent , it must either pass of f into some other body , or continue to exist in the same body . The first alternative is contradicted by every-day experience . If we transform a ball of wax into a solid square , the original rotundity of the ball does not pass off into some other body . The second alternative is also impossible ; for it would necessitate the conclusion that two contradictory forms e.g. , circularity and length , can exist in the same body . It , therefore , follows that the original form passes into absolute non-existence , when the new form comes into being . This argument proves conclusively that attributes i.e. form , colour etc. , come into being from pure nothing . In order to understand that the substance is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following propositions : - 1 . The analysis of matter results in a number of different elements , the diversity of which is reduced to one simple element . 2 . Form and matter are inseparable : no change in matter can annihilate form . <p> From these two propositions , Ibn Maskawaih concludes that the substance had a beginning in time . Matter like form must have begun to exist ; since the eternity of matter necessitates the eternity of form which , as we have seen , can not be regarded as eternal . <p> 28 <p> ( b ) The process of creation.What is the cause of this immense diversity which meets us on all sides ? How could the many be created by one ? When , says the Philosopher , one cause produces a number of different effects , their multiplicity may depend on any of the following reasons : 1 . The cause may have various powers . Man , for instance , being a combination of various elements and powers , may be the cause of various actions . 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . <p> 3 . The cause may work upon a variety of material . <p> None of these propositions can be true of the nature of the ultimate cause - God . That he possesses various powers , distinct from one another , is manifestly absurd ; since his nature does not admit of composition . If he is supposed to have employed different means to produce diversity , who is the creator of these means ? If these means are due to the creative agency of some cause other than the ultimate cause , there would be a plurality of ultimate causes . If , on the other hand , the Ultimate Cause himself created these means , he must have required other means to create these means . The third proposition is also inadmissible as a conception of the creative act . The many can not flow from the causal action of one agent . It , therefore , follows that we have only one way out , of the difficulty - that the ultimate cause created only , one thing which led to the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual Neo-Platonic , emanations gradually growing grosser and grosser until we reach the primordial elements , which combine and recombine to evolve higher and higher forms of life . Shibli thus sums up Ibn Maskawaih 's theory of evolution ( 1 ) : <p> " The combination of primary substances producedthe mineral kingdom , the lowest form of life . A higher stage of evolution is reached in the vegetable - kingdom . The first to appear is spontaneous grass ; then plants and various kinds of trees , some of which touch the border-land of animal kingdom , in so far as they manifest certain animal characteristics . Intermediary between the vegetable kingdom and the animal kingdom there is a certain form of life which is neither animal nor vegetable , but shares the characteristics of both ( e.g. , coral ) . The first step beyond this intermediary stage of life , is the development of the power of movement , and the sense of touch in tiny worms which crawl upon the earth , The sense of touch , owing to the process of differentiation , develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of higher animals in which intelligence begins to manifest itself in an ascending scale . Humanity is touched in the ape which undergoes further development , and gradually develops erect stature and power of understanding similar to man . Here animality ends and humanity begins . " <p> 4 . The soul <p> In order to understand whether the soul has an independent existence , we should examine the nature <p> 1 . Maulana Shibli , Ilm al Kalam , p. 141 . ( Haidarabad ) . <p> 30 <p> of human knowledge . It is the essential property of matter that it can not assume two different forms simultaneously . To transform a silver spoon into a silver glass , it is necessary that the spoon-form as such should cease to exist . This property is common to all bodies , and a body that locks it can not be regarded as , a body . Now when we examine the nature of perception , we see that there is a principle in man which , in so far as it is able to know more than one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many different forms , simultaneously . This principle can not be matter , since it lacks the fundamental property of matter . The essence of the soul consists in the power of perceiving a number of objects at one and the same moment of time . But it may be objected that the soul-principle may be either material in its essence , or a function of matter . There are , however , reasons to show that the soul can not bea function of matter . <p> ( a ) A thing which assumes different forms and states , can not itself be one of those forms and states . A body which receives different colours should be , in its own nature , colourless . The soul , in its perception of external objects , assumes , as it were , various forms and states ; it , therefore , can not be regarded as one of those forms . Ibn Maskawaih seems to give no countenance to the contemporary Faculty-Psychology ; to him different mental states are various transformations <p> of the soul itself . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be beyond the sphere of change , some permanent substratum which is the foundation of personal identity . <p> 31 <p> Having shown that the soul can not be regarded as a function of matter , Ibn Maskawaih proceeds to prove that it is essentially immaterial . Some of his <p> arguments may be noticed : <p> 1 . The senses , after they have perceived a strongstimulus , can not , for a certain amount of time , perceive a weaker stimulus . It is , however , quite different with the mental act of cognition . 2 . When we reflect on an abstruse subject , we endeavour to completely shut our eyes to the objects around us , which we regard as so many hindrances in the way of spiritual activity . If the soul is material in its essence , it need not , in order to secure unimpeded activity , escape from the world of matter . <p> 3 . The perception of a strong stimulus weakens , and sometimes injures the sense . The intellect , on the other hand , grows in strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Physical weakness due to old age , does not , affect mental vigour . <p> 5 . The soul can conceive certain propositions which have no connection with the sense-data . The senses , for instance , can not perceive that two contradictories can not exist together . 6 . There is a certain power in us which rules , over physical organs , corrects sense-errors , and unifies all knowledge . This unifying principle which reflects over the material brought before it through the sense-channel , and , weighing the evidence of each sense , decides the character of <p> 32 <p> rival statements , must itself stand above the sphere of matter . <p> The combined force of these considerations , says Ibn Maskawaih , conclusively establishes the truth of the proposition - that the soul is essentially immaterial . The immateriality of the soul signifies its immortality ; since mortality is a characteristic of the material . <p> 2 . AVICENNA ( d. 1037 ) <p> Amongthe early Persian Philosophers , Avicenna alone attempted to construct his own system of thought . His work , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has also come down to us. a fragment ( 1 ) in which the Philosopher has expressed his views on the universal operation of the force of love in nature . It is something like the contour of a system , and it is quite probable that ideas expressed therein were afterwards fully worked out . Avicenna defines " Love " as the appreciation of Beauty ; and from the standpoint of this definition he explains that there are three categories of being : <p> 1 . Things that are at the highest point of perfection . 2 . Things that are at the lowest point of perfection . 3 . Things that stand between the two poles of perfection . But the third category has no real existence ; since there are things that have already attained the acme of perfection , and there are others <p> 1 . This fragment on love is preserved in the collected works of Avicenna in the British Museum Library and has been edited by N. A. F. Mehren . ( Leiden , 1894 ) . <p> 33 <p> still progressing towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's movement towards beauty which , according to Avicenna , is identical with perfection . Beneath the visible evolution of forms is the force of love which actualises all striving , movement , progress . Things are so constituted that they hate non-existence , and love the joy of individuality in various forms . The indeterminate matter , dead in itself , assumes or more properly , is made to assume by the inner force of love , various forms , and rises higher and higher in the scale of beauty . The operation of this ultimate force , in the physical plane , can thus be indicated : <p> 1 . Inanimate objects are combinations of form , matter and quality . Owing to the working of this mysterious Power , quality sticks to its subject or substance ; and form embraces indeterminate matter force of love , rises from which , impelled by the mighty force of love , rises from form to form . 2 . The tendency of the force of love is to centralise itself . In the vegetable kingdom it attains a higher degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unity of action which it attains afterwards . The processes of the vegetative soul are : - <p> ( a ) Assimilation . ( b ) Growth . ( c ) Reproduction . <p> These processes , however , are nothing more than so many manifestations of love . Assimilation indi- <p> 34 <p> cates attraction and transformation of what is external into what is internal . Growth is love of achieving more and more harmony of parts ; and reproduction means perpetuation of the kind , which is only another phase of love . <p> 3 . In the animal kingdom , the various operations of the force of love are still more unified . It does preserve the vegetable instinct of acting in different , directions ; but there is also the development of temperament which is a step towards more unified activity . In man this tendency towards unification manifests itself in self-consciousness . The same force - of " natural or constitutional love , " is working in the life of beings higher than man . All things are moving towards the first Beloved - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided by its nearness to , or distance from , this ultimate principle . <p> As a physician , however , Avicenna is especially interested in the nature of the Soul . In his times , moreover , the doctrine of metempsychosis was getting more and more popular . He , therefore , discusses the nature of the soul , with a view to show the falsity of this doctrine . It is difficult , he says , to define the soul ; since it manifests different powers and tendencies different planes of being . His view of the ' various powers of the soul can be thus represented : <p> ( b ) As directed to one object - The soul of the spheres which continue in one uniform , motion . In his fragment on " Nafs " ( soul ) Avicenna endeavours to show that a material accompaniment is notnecessary to the soul . It is not through the instrumentality of the body , or some power of the body , that the soul conceives or imagines ; since if the soul necessarily requires a physical medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different body in order to conceive the body attached to itself . Moreover , the fact that the soul is immediately self conscious of itself through itself - conclusively shows that in its essence the soul is quite independent of any physical accompaniment . The doctrine of metempsychosis implies , also , individual pre-existence . But <p> 36 <p> supposing that the soul did exist before the body , it must have existed either as one or as many . The multiplicity of bodies is due to the multiplicity of material forms , and does not indicate the multiplicity of souls . On the other hand , if it existed as one , the ignorance or knowledge of A must mean the ignorance , or knowledge of B ; since the soul is one in both . These categories , therefore , can not be applied to the soul . The truth is , says Avicenna , that body and soul are contiguous to each other , but quite opposite in their respective essences . The disintegration of the body does not necessitate the annihilation of the soul . Dissolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of simple , indivisible , ideal substances . Avicenna , then denies pre-existence , and endeavours to show the possibility of disembodied conscious life beyond the grave . We have run over the work of the early Persian Neo-Platonists among whom , as we have seen , - Avicenna alone learned to think for himself . Of the generations of his disciples - Behmenyar , Abu'l-Ma'mum of Isfahan , Masumi , Abu'l-Abbas , Ibn Tahir ( 1 ) - who carried on their master 's Philosophy , we need not speak . So powerful was the spell of Avicenna 's personality that , even long after it had been removed , any amplification or modification of his views was considered to be an unpardonable crime . The old Iranian idea of the dualism of Light and Darkness does not act as a determining factor in the <p> 1 . Al-Baihaqi , fol.28a et seqq . <p> 37 <p> progress of Neo-Platonic ideas in Persia , which borrowed independent life for a time , and eventually merged their separate existence in the general current , of Persian speculation . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so far as they contributed to the strength and expansion of that monistic tendency , which manifested itself early in the Church of Zoroaster ; and , though for a time hindered by the theological controversies of Islam , burst out with redoubled force in later times , to extend its titanic grasp to all the previous intellectual , achievements of the land of its birth . <p> 38 <p> CHAPTER III <p> THE RISE AND FALL OF RATIONALISM IN ISLAM <p> I. THE METAPHYSICS OF RATIONALISM - <p> MATERIALISM <p> The Persian mind , having adjusted itself to the new Political environment , soon reasserts its innate freedom , and begins to retire from the field of : objectivity , in order that it may come back to itself and reflect upon the material achieved in its journey out of its own inwardness . With the study of Greek thought , the spirit which was almost lost in the concrete , begins to reflect and realise itself as the arbiter of truth . Subjectivity asserts itself , and endeavours to supplant all outward authority . Such a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the epoch of rationalism , scepticism , mysticism , heresy - forms in which the human mind , swayed by the growing force of subjectivity , rejects all external standards of truth . And so we find the epoch under consideration . <p> The period of Umayyad dominance is taken up , with the process of co-mingling and adjustment to new conditions of life ; but with the rise of the Abbasid Dynasty and the study of Greek Philosophy , the pent-up intellectual force of Persia bursts out <p> 39 <p> again , and exhibits wonderful activity in all the , departments of thought and action . The fresh intellectual vigour imparted by the assimilation of , Greek Philosophy , which was studied with great avidity , led immediately to a critical examination of Islamic Monotheism . Theology , enlivened by religious fervour , learned to talk the language of Philosophy , earlier than cold reason began to seek a retired corner , away from the noise of controversy , in order to construct a consistent theory of things . In the first half of the 8th Century we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theologian Hasan of Basra - starting Mutazilaism ( Rationalism ) - that most interesting movement which engaged some of the subtlest minds of Persia , and finally exhausted its force in the keen metaphysical controversies of Baghdadand Basra . The famous city of Basra had become , owing to its commercial situation , the play-ground of various forces - Greek Philosophy , Scepticism , Christianity , Buddhistic ideas , Manichaeism ( 1 ) which furnished ample spiritual food to the inquiring mind of the time , and formed the intellectual environment of Islamic Rationalism . What Spitta calls the Syrian period of Muhammadan History is not characterised with metaphysical subtleties . With the advent of the Persian Period , however , Muhammadan students of Greek Philosophy began <p> ( 1 ) During the Abbasid Period there were many who secretly held Manichaen opinions . See Fihrist , Leipzig 1871 , p. 338 ; See also Al-Mutazila , ed. by T. W. Arnold , Leipzig 1902 , p. 27 , where the author speaks of a controversy between Abu'l-Hudhail and Salih the Dualist . See also MacDonald 's Muslim Theology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their religion , and the Mutazil thinkers ( 1 ) , gradually drifted into metaphysics with which alone we are concerned here . It is not our object to trace the history of the Mutazila Kalam ; for present purposes it will be sufficient if we briefly reveal the metaphysical implications of the Mutazila view of Islam . The conception of God , and the theory of matter , therefore , are the only aspects of Rationalism which we propose to discuss here . <p> His conception of the unity of God at which the Mutazila eventually arrived by a subtle dialectic is one of the fundamental points in which he differs , from the Orthodox Muhammaden . Gods attributes according to his view , can not be said to inhere in Him ; they form the very essence of His nature . The Mutazila , therefore , denies the separate reality of divine attributes , and declares their absolute identity with the abstract divine Principle . " God " , says . <p> 1 . The Mutazilas belonged to various nationalities , and many ofthem were Persians either by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of the sect - was a Persian ( Browne , Lit . His. , Vol. 1 , p. 281 ) . Von Kremer , however , traces their origin to the theological controversies of the Umayyad period . Mutazilaism was not an essentially Persian movement ; but it is true , as Prof. Browne observes ( Lit . His. , Vol , 1 , p. 283 ) that Shiite and Qadari tenets , indeed , often went together , and the Shiite doctrine current in Persia at the present day is in many respects Mutazilite , while Hasan Al-Ashari , the great opponent of the Mutazilite , is by the Shi'ites held in horror . It may also be added that some of the greater representatives of the Mutazila opinion were abi'as by religion , e.g. Abu'l-Hudhail ( Al-Mutazila , ed. by T. W. Arnold , p. 28 ' . On the other band many of the followers of Al-Ashari were Persians ( See extracts from Ibn Asakir ed . Mehren ) , so that it does not seem to be quite justifiable to describe the Asharite mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abul-Hudhail , " is knowing , all-Powerful , living ; and His knowledge , power and life constitute His very essence ( dhat ) " ( 1 ) in order to explain the pure unity of God Joseph Al-Basir(2) lays down the following five principles : - <p> ( 1 ) The necessary supposition of atom and , accident . ( 2 ) The necessary suppostion of a creator . ( 3 ) The necessary suppose of the conditions ( Ahwal ) of God . ( 4 ) The rejection of those attributeswhich do not benefit Allah ( 5 ) The unity of God in spite of the plurality of His attributes . <p> This conception of unity underwent further modifications ; until in the hands of Muammar an Abu Hashim it became a mere abstract possibility about which nothing could be predicated . We can not , he says , predicate knowledge of God ( 3 ) , for His knowledge must be of something in Himself . The first necessitates the identity of subject and object which is absurd ; the second implicates duality in the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) disciples of Nazzam , however , recognised this duality in holding that the original creators are two God <p> the eternal principle ; and the word of God - Jesus Christ - the contingent principle . But more fully to bring out the element of truth in the second alternative suggested by Muammar , was reserved , as we shall see , for later Sufi thinkers of Persia . It is , therefore , clear that some of the rationalists almost unconsciously touched - the outer fringe of later pantheism for which , in a sense , they prepared the way , not only by their definition of God , but also by their common effort to internalise the rigid externality of absolute law . But the most important contribution of the advocates of Rationalism to purely metaphysical speculation , is their explanation of matter , which their opponents - the Asharite - afterwards modified to fit in with their own views of the nature of God . The interest of Nazzam chiefly consisted in the exclusion of all arbitrariness from the orderly course of nature ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define Will in a purely negative manner(2) . Though the Rationalist thinkers did not want to abandon the idea of a Personal Will , yet they endeavoured to find - a deeper ground for the independence of individual natural phenomena . And this ground they found in matter itself . Nazzam taught the infinite divisibility of matter , and obliterated the distinction between substance and accident ( 3 ) . Existence was regarded as a quality super-imposed by God on the pre-existing material atoms which would have been incapable <p> of perception without this quality . Muhammad Ibn Uthman , one of the Mutazila Shafiis , says Ibn Hazm ( 1 ) maintained that the non-existent ( atom in its pre-existential state ) is a body in that state ; only that in its pre-existential condition it is neither in motion , nor at rest , nor is it said to be created . Substance , then , is a collection of qualities - taste , odour . colour - which , in themselves , are nothing more than . material potentialities . The soul , too , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are meremental motions . Creation is only the actualisation of preexisting potentialities ( 2 ) ( Tafra ) . The individuality of a thing which is defined as " that of which something can be predicated " ( 3 ) is not an essential factor in its notion . The collection of things we call the Universe , is externalised or perceptible reality which could , so , to speak , exist independent of all perceptibility . The object of these metaphysical subtleties is purely theological . God , to the Rationalist , is an absolute unity which can , in no sense , admit of plurality , and could thus exist without the perceptible plurality - the Universe . The activity of God , then , consists only in making , the atom perceptible . The properties of the atom flow from its own nature . A stone thrown up falls . down on account of its own indwelling property ( 4 ) . God , says Al-Attar of Basra and Bishr ibn al Mu'tamir , <p> did not create colour , length , breadth , taste or smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of things in the Universe is not known to God ( 2 ) . Bishr ibn al-Mu'tamir further explained the properties of bodies by what he called " Tawallud " - interaction of bodies(3) . Thus it is clear that the Rationalists were philosophically materialists , and theologically deists . <p> To them substance and atom are identical , and they define substance as a space-filling atom which , besides the quality of filling space , has a certain direction , force and existence forming its very essence as an actuality . In shape it is squarelike ; for if it is supposed to be circular , combination of different atoms would not be possible(4) . There is , however , great difference of opinion among the exponents of atomism in regard to the nature of the atom . Some hold that atoms are all similar to each other ; while Abu'l-Qasim of Balkh regards them as similar as well as dissimilar . When we say that two things are similar to each other , we do not necessarily mean that they are similar in all their attributes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atom . He holds that the atom had a beginning in time ; but that it can not be completely annihilated . The attribute of " Baqa " ( continued existence ) , he says , does <p> not give to its subject a new attribute other than ' existence ; and the continuity of existence is not an additional attribute at all . The divine activity created the atom as well as its continued existence . Abu'l-Qasim , however , admits that some atoms may not have been created for continued existence . He denies also the existence of any intervening space between different atoms , and holds , unlike other representatives of the school , that the essence or atom ( Mahiyyat ) , could not remain essence in a state of non-existence . To advocate the opposite is a contradiction in terms . To say that the essence ( which is essence because of the attribute of existence ) could remain essence in a state of non-existence , is to say that the existent could remain existent in a state of non-existence . It is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dealt a serious blow to the Rationalist theory of matter . <p> 2 . CONTEMPORARY MOVEMENTS OF THOUGHT <p> Side by side with the development of Mutazilaism we see , as is natural in a period of great intellectual activity , many other tendencies of thought manifesting themselves in the philosophical and religious circles of Islam . Let us notice them briefly - <p> 1 . Scepticism . The tendency towards scepticism was the natural consequence of the purely dialectic method of Rationalism . Men such as Ibn Ashras and Al-Jahiz , who apparently belonged to the Rationalist camp , were really sceptics . The <p> 46 <p> standpoint of Al-Jahiz who inclined to deistic naturalism ( 1 ) , is that of a cultured man of the time , and not of a professional theologian . In him is noticeable also a reaction against the metaphysical hairsplitting of his predecessors , and a desire to widen the pale of theology for the sake of the illiterate who are incapable of reflecting on articles of faith . <p> 2 . Sufiism - an appeal to a higher source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more deepened and antischolastic in contrast to the dry intellectualism of the Asharite . We shall consider this interesting movement in the following chapter . 3 . The revival of authority - Ismailianism - a movement characteristically Persian which , instead of repudiating freethought , endeavours to come to an understanding with it . Though this movement seems to have no connection with the theological controversies of the time , yet its connection with freethought is fundamental . The similarity between the methods , practised by the Ismailian missionaries and those of the partisans of the association called Ikhwan-al-Safa - Brethren of Purity - suggests some sort of secret relation between the two institutions . Whatever may be the motive of those who started this movement , its significance as an intellectual phenomenon should not be lost sight of . The multiplicity of philosophical and religious views - a necessary consequence of speculative activity - is <p> 1 . Macdonald 's Muslim Theology , p. 161 . <p> 47 <p> apt to invoke forces which operate against this , religiously speaking , dangerous multiplicity . In the 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sceptical inquiry concerning the nature of matter , and finding its last - word in Pantheism . Schleiermacher appeals to Faith as opposed to Reason , Jacobi points to a source of knowledge higher than reason , while Comte abandons all metaphysical inquiry , and limits all knowledge to sensuous perception . De Maistre and Schlegel , on the other hand , find a resting place in the authority of an absolutely infallible Pope . The advocates of the doctrine of Imamat think in the same strain as De Maistre ; but it is curious that the Ismailians , while making this doctrine the basis of their Church , permitted free play to all sorts of thinking . <p> The Ismailia movement then is one aspect of the persistent battle ( 1 ) which the intellectually independent Persian waged against the religious and political ideals of Islam , Originally a branch of the Shiite religion , the Ismailia sect assumed quite a cosmopolitan character with Abdulla ibn Maiman - the probable progenitor of the Fatimid Caliphs of Egypt - who died about the same time when Al-Ashari , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious man imagined a vast scheme in which he weaved together innumerable threads of various hues , resulting <p> 1 Ibn Hazm in his Kitab al-Milal , looks upon the heretical sects of Persia as a continuous struggle against the Arab power which the cunning Persian attempted to shake off by these peaceful means . See Von Kremer 's Geschichte der herrschenden Ideen des Islams , pp. 10 , 11 , where this learned Arab historian of Cordova is quoted at length . <p> 48 <p> in a cleverly constructed equivocation , charming tot the Persian mind for its mysterious character and misty Pythagorean Philosophy . Like the Association of the Brethren of Purity , he made an attempt , under the pious cloak of the doctrine of Imamat ( Authority ) , to synthesise all the dominating ideas of the time . Greek Philosophy , Christianity , Rationalism , Sufiism , Manichaeism , Persian heresies , and above all the idea of reincarnation , all came forward to contribute their respective shares to the boldly conceived Ismailian whole , the various aspects of which were to be gradually revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever Incarnating Universal Reason - according to the intellectual development of the age in which he incarnated himself . In the Ismallian movement , Freethought , apprehending the collapse of its ever widening structure , seeks to rest upon a stable basis , , and , by a strange irony of fate , is led to find it in the very idea which is revolting to its whole being . Barren authority , though still apt to reassert herself at times , adopts this unclaimed child , and thus permits herself to assimilate all knowledge past , present and future . <p> The unfortunate connection , however , of this movement with the politics of the time , has misled many a scholar . They see in it ( Macdonald , for instance ) nothing more than a powerful conspiracy to , uproot the political power of the Arab from Persia . They have denounced the Ismallian Church which counted among its followers some of the best heads and sincerest hearts , as a mere clique of dark murderers <p> 49 <p> who were ever watching for a possible victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these people , the most barbarous persecutions which drove them to pay red-handed fanaticism in the same coin . Assassinations for religious purposes were considered unobjectionable , and even perhaps lawful among the whole Semite race . As late as the latter half of the 16th Century , the Pope of Rome could approve such a dreadful slaughter as the massacre of St. Bartholomew . That assassination , even though actuated by religious zeal , is still a crime , is a purely modern idea ; and justice demands that we should not judge older generations with our own standards of right and wrong . A great religious movement which shook to its very foundations the structure of a vast empire , and , having successfully passed through the varied ordeals of moral reproach , calumny and persecution , stood up for centuries as a champion of Science and Philosophy , could not have entirely rested on the frail basis of a political conspiracy of a mere local and temporary character . Ismailianism , in spite of its almost entire loss of original vitality , still dominates . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persia , Central Asia , Syria and Africa ; while the last expression of Persian thought - Babism - is essentially Ismailian in its character . <p> To return , however , to the Philosophy of the sect . From the later Rationalists they borrowed their conception of Divinity . God , or the ultimate principle of existence , they teach , has no attribute . His nature admits of no predication . When we predicate the <p> 50 <p> attribute of power to Him , we only mean that He is the giver of power ; when we predicate eternity , we indicate the eternity of what the Qur'an calls " Amr " ( word of God ) as distinguished from the " Khalq " - ( creation of God ) which is contingent . In His nature all contradictions melt away , and from Him flow all opposites . Thus they considered themselves to have solved the problem which had troubled the mind of Zoroaster and his followers . <p> In order to find an answer to the question , " What is plurality ? " the Ismailia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one only one can proceed " . But the one which proceeds is not something completely different from which it proceeds . It is really the Primal one transformed . The Primal Unity , therefore , transformed itself into the First Intellect ( Universal Reason ) ; and then , by means of this transformation of itself , created the Universal soul which , impelled by its nature to perfectly identify itself with the original source , felt the necessity of motion , and consequently of a body possessing the power of motion . In order to achieve its end , the soul created the heavens moving in circular motion according to its direction . It also created the elements which mixed together , and formed the visible Universe - the scene of plurality through which it endeavours to pass with a view to come back to the original source . The individual soul is an epitome of the whole Universe which exists only for its progressive education . The Universal <p> 51 <p> Reason incarnates itself from time to time , in the personality of the " Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understanding , and gradually guides it through the scene of plurality to , the world of eternal unity . When the Universal soul reaches its goal , or rather returns to its own deep being , the process of disintegration ensues . " Particles constituting the Universe fall off from each other those of goodness go to truth ( God ) which symbolises , unity ; those of evil go to untruth ( Devil ) which symbolises diversity " ( 1 ) . This is but briefly the Ismailian Philosophy - a mixture , as Sharastani remarks , of Philosophical and Manichaean ideas which , by gradually arousing the slumbering spirit of scepticism , they administered , as it were , in doses to the initiated , and finally brought them to that stage of spiritual emancipation where solemn ritual drops off , and dogmatic religion appears to be nothing more than a systematic arrangement of useful falsehoods . <p> The Ismailian doctrine is the first attempt to amalgamate contemporary Philosophy with a really Persian view of the Universe , and to restate Islam , in reference to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method which was afterwards adopted by Sufiism With them the Zoroastrian Ahriman ( Devil ) is not the malignant creator of evil things but it is a principle which violates the eternal unity , and breaks it up into visible diversity . The <p> ' Sharastani : Cureton 's ed : p. 149 . <p> 52 <p> idea that some principle of difference in the nature of the ultimate existence must be postulated in order to account for empirical diversity , underwent further modifications ; until in the Hurufi sect ( an offshoot of the Ismailia ) , in the 14th Century , it touched contemporary Sufiism on the one hand , and Christian Trinity on the other . The " Be " maintained the Hurufis , is the eternal word of God , which , itself uncreated , leads to further creation - the word externalised . " But for the ' word ' the recognition of the essence of Divinity would have been impossible ; since Divinity is beyond the reach of sense perception " ( 1 ) . The ' word ' , therefore , became flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manifest the Father . The whole Universe is the manifestation of God 's ' word ' , in which He is immanent ( 3 ) . Every sound in the Universe is within God , every atom is singing the song of eternity ( 4 ) ; all is life . Those who want to discover the ultimate reality of things , let them seek " the named " through the Name ( 5 ) , which at once conceals and reveals its subject . <p> 3 . REACTION AGAINST THE ASHARITE RATIONALISM <p> Patronised by the early Caliphs of the House of Abbas , Rationalism continued to flourish in the intellectual centres of the Islamic world ; until , in the first half of the 9th Century , it met the powerful <p> Orthodox reaction which found a very energetic leader in Al-Ashari ( b. 873 A. D. ) who studied under Rationalist teachers only to demolish , by their own methods , the edifice they had so laboriously built . He was a pupil of Al-Jubba'i ( 1 ) - the representative of the younger school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which eventually terminated their friendly relations , and led the pupil to bid farewell to the Mutazila camp . " The fact " , says Spitta , " that Al-Ashari was so thoroughly a child of his time with the successive currents of which he let himself go , makes him , in another relation , an important figure to us . In him , as in any other , are clearly reflected the various tendencies of this politically as well as religiously interesting period ; and we seldom - find ourselves in a position to weigh the power of the orthodox confession and the Mutazilite speculation , the child-like helpless manner of the one , the immaturity and imperfection of the other , so completely as in the life of this man who was orthodox as a boy and a Mutazila as a young man " ( 3 ) . The Mutazila speculation ( e.g. Al-Jahiz ) tended to be absolutely unfettered , and in some cases led to a merely negative attitude of thought . The movement initiated by Al-Ashari was an attempt not only to purge Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but also to harmonize the religious consciousness with the religious thought of Islam . Rationalism was an attempt to measure reality by reason alone ; it implied the identity of the spheres of religion and philosophy , and strove to express faith in the form of concepts or terms of pure thought . It ignored the facts of human nature , and tended to disintegrate the solidarity of the Islamic Church . Hence the reaction . The orthodox reaction led by the Asharite then was , in reality , nothing more than the transfer of dialectic method to the defence of the authority of Divine Revelation . In opposition to the Rationalists , they maintained the doctrine of the Attributes of God ; and , as regards the Free Will controversy , they adopted a course lying midway between the extreme fatalism of the old school , and the extreme libertarianism of the Rationalists . They teach that the power of choice as well as all human actions are created by God ; and that man has been given the power of acquiring ( 1 ) the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his violent attack on philosophy was strenuously opposed by Tusi and Qutb al-Din , does away with the idea of " acquisition " , and openly maintains the doctrine of necessity in his commentary on the Qur'an . The Mataridiyya another school of anti-rationalist theology , founded by Abu Mansur Mataridi a native of Matarid in the environs of Samarqand - went back to the old <p> 1 . Shahrastani-ed . Cureton , p. 69 . <p> 55 <p> rationalist Position , and taught in opposition to the Asharite , that man has absolute control over his activity ; and that his power affects the very nature of his actions . Al-Ashari 's interest was purely theological ; but it was impossible to harmonise reason and revelation without making reference to the ultimate nature of reality . Baqilani ( 1 ) , therefore , made use of some purely metaphysical propositions ( that substance is an individual unity ; that quality can not exist in quality ; that perfect vacuum is possible ) in his theological investigation , and thus gave the school a metaphysical foundation which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , dwell upon their defence of orthodox beliefs ( e.g. , that the Qur'an is uncreated ; that the visibility of God is possible etc. ) ; but we shall endeavour to pick up the elements of metaphysical thoughiin their theological controversies . In order to meet contemporary philosophers on their own ground , they could not dispense with philosophising ; hence willingly or unwillingly they had to develop a theory of knowledge peculiar to themselves . God , according to the Asharite , is the ultimate necessary existence which " carries its attributes in its own being " ( 2 ) , and whose existence ( wujud ) and essence ( Mahiyyat ) are identical . Besides the argument from the contingent character of motion they <p> used the following arguments to prove the existence of this ultimate principle : ( 1 ) All bodies , they argue , are one in so far as the phenomenal fact of their existence is concerned . But in spite of this unity , their qualities are different and even opposed to each other . We are , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their empirical divergence . ( 2 ) Every contingent being needs a cause to account for its existence . The universe is contingent ; therefore it must have a cause ; and that cause is God . That the Universe is contingent , they proved in the following manner . All that exists in the Universe is either substance or quality . The contingence of quality is evident , and the contingence of substance , follows from the fact that no substance could exist apart from qualities . The contingence of quality necessitates the contingence of substance ; otherwise the eternity of substance would necessitate the eternity of quality . In order fully to appreciate the value of this argument , it is necessary to understand the Asharite theory of knowledge . To answer the question , " What is a thing ? " they subjected to a searching criticism the Aristotelian categories of thought , and arrived at the conclusion that bodies have no properties in themselves ( 1 ) . They made no distinction of secondary and primary qualities of a body , and reduced all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them a mere , accident without which the substance could not exist . They used the word substance or atom with a vague implication of externality ; but their criticism , . actuated by a pious desire to defend the idea of divine creation , reduced the Universe to a mere show of ordered subjectivities which , as they maintained like Berkeley , found their ultimate explanation in the Will of God . In his examination of human knowledge , regarded as a product and not merely a process , Kant stopped at the idea of " Ding an sich " but the Asharite endeavoured to penetrate further , and maintained , against the contemporary Agnostic-Realism , that the so-called underlying essence existed only in so far as it was brought in relation to the knowing subject . Their atomism , therefore , approaches that of Lotze ( 1 ) who , in spite of his desire to save external reality , ended in its complete reduction to ideality . But like Lotze they could not believe their atoms to be the inner working of the Infinite Primal Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The necessary consequence of their analysis of matter is a thorough going idealism like that of Berkeley ; but perhaps their instinctive realism combined with the force of atomistic tradition , still compels them to use <p> 1 " Lotze is an atomist. but he does not conceive the atoms , themselvesas material ; for extension , like all other sensuous qualities is explained through the reciprocal action of atoms ; they themselves , therefore , can not possess this quality . Like life and like all empirical qualities , the sensuous fact of extension is due to the co-operation of points of force , which , in time , must be conceived as starting points of the inner working of the Infinite Primal Being " . Hoffding Vol . II , p. 516 . Ed. note : Lotze would now be translitered Lao Tzu . <p> 58 <p> the word " atom " " by which they endeavour to give something like a realistic colouring to their idealism . The interest of dogmatic theology drove them to maintain towards pure Philosophy an attitude of criticism which taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own . <p> But a more important and philosophically more significant aspect of the Asharite Metaphysics , is their attitude towards the Law of Causation ( 1 ) . Just as they repudiated all the principles of optics ( 2 ) in order to show , in opposition to the Rationalists , that God could be visible in spite of His being unextended , so with a view to defend the possibility of miracles , they rejected the idea of causation altogether . The orthodox believed in miracles as well as in the Universal Law of Causation ; but they maintained that , at the time of manifesting a miracle , God suspended the operation of this law . The Asharite , however , starting with the supposition that cause and effect must be similar , could not share the orthodox view , and taught that the idea of power is meaningless , and that we know nothing but floating impressions , the phenomenal order of which is determined by God . Any account of the Asharite metaphysics would be incomplete without a notice of the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many orthodox theologians , will always be looked <p> upon as one of the greatest personalities of Islam . This sceptic of powerful ability anticipated Descartes ( 1 ) in his philosophical method ; and , " seven hundred years before Hume cut the bond of causality with the edge of his dialectic " ( 2 ) . He was the first to write a systematic refutation of philosophy , and completely to , annihilate that dread of intellectualism which had characterised the orthodox . It was chiefly his , influence that made men study dogma and metaphysics together , and eventually led to a system of education which produced such men as Shahrastani , Al-Razi and Al-Ishraqi.The following passage indicates his attitude as a thinker : <p> " From my childhood I was inclined to think out things for myself . The result of this attitude was that I revolted against authority ; and all the beliefs that had fixed themselves in my mind from childhood lost their original importance . I thought that such beliefs based on mere authority were equally entertained by Jews , Christians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . For instance , it is self-evident that ten is greater than three . If a person , however , endeavours to prove the contrary by an appeal to his power of turning a stick into a snake , the performance would indeed be wonderful , though it can not touch the certainty of <p> 1 " If Al-Ghazali 's work on the Revivication of the sciences of religion has so remarkable a resemblance to the Discourse sur la methode of Descartes , that had any translation of it existed in the days of Descartes everyone would have cried against the plagiarism- " ( Lewes 's History of Philosophy : Vol . II , p. 50 ) .2 . Journal of the American Oriental Society , Vol. 20 , p. 103 . <p> 60 <p> the proposition in question " ( 1 ) . He examined afterwards , all the various claimants of " Certain Knowledge " and finally found it in Sufiism . With their view of the nature of substance , the Asharite , rigid monotheists as they were , could not safely discuss the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , and to this day it is difficult to define , with accuracy , his view of the nature of God . In him , like Borger and Solger in Germany , Sufi pantheism and the Asharite - dogma of personality appear to harmonise together , a reconciliation which makes it difficult to say whether he was a Pantheist , or a Personal Pantheist of the type of Lotze . The soul , according to Al-Ghazali , perceives things . But perception as an attribute can exist only in a substance or essence which is absolutely free from all the attributes of body . In his Al-Madnun ( 2 ) , he explains why the Prophet declined to reveal the nature of the soul . There are , he says , two kinds of men ; ordinary men and thinkers . The former , who look upon materiality as a condition of existence , can not conceive an immaterial substance . The latter are led , by their logic , to a conception of the soul which sweeps away all difference between God and the individual soul . Al-Ghazali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry , and preferred silence as to the ultimate nature of the soul . <p> He is generally included among the Asharite . But strictly speaking he is not an Asharite ; though he , admitted that the Asharite . Asharite mode of thought was excellent for the masses . " He held " , says Shibli ( Ilm al-Kalam , p. 66 ) , " that the secret of faith could not be revealed ; for this reason he encouraged exposition of the Asharite theology , and took good care in persuading his immediate disciples not to publish the results of his private reflection . " Such an attitude towards the Asharite theology , combined with his , constant use of philosophical language , could not but lead to suspicion . Ibn Jauzi , QadiIyad , and other famous theologians of the orthodox school , publicly denounced him as one of the " misguided " ; and Iyad went even so far as to order the destruction of all his philosophical and theological writings that existed in Spain . <p> It is , therefore , clear that while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced divinity to a bare indefinable universality , the antirationalist movement , though it preserved the dogma of personality , destroyed the external reality of nature . In spite of Nazzam 's theory of " Atomic objectification " ( 1 ) , the atom of the Rationalist possesses an independent objective reality ; that of the Asharite is a fleeting moment of Divine Will . The one saves nature , and tends to do away with the God of Theology ; the other sacrifices nature to save God as conceived by the orthodox . <p> The God-intoxicated Sufi who stands aloof from the theological controversies of the age , saves and spiritualises both the aspects of existence , and looks upon the whole Universe as the self-revelation of God - a higher notion which synthesises the opposite extremes of his predecessors . " Wooden-legged " Rationalism , as the Sufi called it , speaks its last word in the sceptic Al-Ghazali , whose restless soul , after long and hopeless wanderings in the desolate sands of dry intellectualism , found its final halting place in the still deep of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of a higher source of knowledge than merely to defend the dogma of Islamic Theology , and , therefore , marks the quiet victory of Sufiism over all the rival speculative tendencies of the time . <p> Al-Ghazali 's positive contribution to the Philosophy of his country , however , is found in his little book - Mishkatal-Anwar -where he starts with the Quranic verse , " God is the light of heavens and earth " and instinctively returns to the Iranian idea , which was soon to find a vigorous expounder in Al-Ishraqi . Light , he teaches in this book , is the only real existence ; and there is no darkness greater than non-existence . But the essence of Light is manifestation : " it is attributed to manifestation which is a relation " ( 1 ) . The Universe was created out of darkness on which God sprinkled ( 2 ) his own light , and made its <p> 1 Mishkatal-Anwar , fol. 3a.2 In support of this view Al-Ghazali quotes a tradition of the Prophet , Ibid. fol. 10a . <p> 63 <p> different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less light . As bodies differ from one another in being dark , obscure , illuminated or illuminating , so men are differentiated from one another . ' There are some who illuminate other human beings ; and , for this reason , the Prophet is named " The Burning Lamp " in the Qur'an . <p> The physical eye sees only the external manifestation of the Absolute or Real Light . There is an internal eye in the heart of man which , unlike the physical eye , sees itself as other things , an eye which goes beyond the finite , and pierces the veil of manifestation . These thoughts are merely germs , which developed and fructified in Al-Ishraqi 's " Philosophy of Illumination " - Hikmatal-Ishraq . Such is the Asharite Philosophy . <p> One great theological result of this reaction was that , it checked the growth of freethought which tended to dissolve the solidarity of the Church , We . are , however , concerned more with the purely intellectual results of the Asharite mode of thought , and these are mainly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of Greek Philosophy as we shall see presently . ( 2 ) In the beginning of the 10th Century , when the Asharite had almost completely demolished the stronghold of Rationalism , we see a tendency towards what may be called Persian Positivism . <p> 64 <p> Al-Biruni ( 1 ) ( d. 1048 ) and Ibn Haitham ( 1 ) ( d. 1038 ) who anticipated modern empirical Psychology in recognising what is , called reaction-time , gave up all inquiry concerning the nature of the supersensual , and maintained a prudent silence about religious matters . Such a state of things could have existed , but could not have been logically justified before Al-Ashari . <p> 1 He ( Al-Biruni ) quotes with approval the following , as the teaching of the adherents of Aryabhatta : It is enough for us to knowthat which is lighted up by the sun 's rays . Whatever lies beyond , though it should be of immeasurable extent , we can not make use of ; for what the sunbeam does not reach , the senses do not perceive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From this we gather what Al-Biruni 's Philosophy was : only sense-perceptions , knit together by a logical intelligence , yield sure knowledge . ( Boer 's Philosophy in Islam p. 146 ) . <p> 2 " Moreover truth for him ( Ibn Haitham ) was only that which , was presented as material for the faculties of sense . perception , and . which received it from the understanding , being thus the logically , elaborated perception " . ( Boer 's Philosophy in Islam , p. 150 ) . <p> 65 <p> CHAPTER IV <p> CONTROVERSY BETWEEN IDEALISM AND REALISM <p> The Asharite denial of Aristotle 's Prima Materia , and their views concerning the nature of space , time and causation , awakened that irrepressible spirit of controversy which , for centuries , divided the camp of Muhammedan thinkers , and eventually exhausted its vigor in the merely verbal subtleties of schools . The publication of Najm al-Din Al-Katibi 's ( a follower of Aristotle whose disciples were called Philosophers as distinguished from scholastic theologians ) Hikmat al-Ain - " Philosophy of Essence " , greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host of Asharite as well as other idealist thinkers . I shall consider in order the principal points on which the two schools differed from each other . <p> A. The Nature of the Essence <p> We have seen that the Asharite theory of knowledge drove them to hold that individual essences , of various things are quite different from each other , and are determined in each case by the ultimate cause God . They denied the existence of an ever-changing . primary stuff common to all things , and maintained against the Rationalists that existence constitutes the <p> 66 <p> very being of the essence . To them , therefore , essence and existence are identical . They argued that the Judgment , " Man is animal " , is possible only on the ground of a fundamental difference between the subject and the predicate ; since their identity would make the judgment nugatory , and complete difference would make the predication false . It is , therefore , necessary to postulate an external cause to determine the various forms of existence . Their opponents , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they maintain that all the various forms , of existence , in so far as their essence is concerned , are identical - all being limitations of one Primary substance . The followers of Aristotle met the difficulty suggestedby the possibility of synthetic predication , by advocating the possibility of compound essences . Such a judgment as " Man is animal " , they maintained , is true ; because man is an essence composed of two essences , animality and humanity . This , retorted the Asharite , can not stand criticism . If you say that the essence of man and animal is the same , you in other words hold that the essence of the whole is the same as that of the part . But this proposition is absurd ; since if the essence of the compound is the same as that of its constituents , the compound will have to be regarded as one being having two essences or existences . It is obvious that the whole controversy turns on the question whether existence is a mere idea or something objectively real . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it exists only in relation <p> 67 <p> to us ( Asharite position ) ; or that it is an essence existing quite independently of us ( Realist position ) ? We shall briefly indicate the arguments of either side . The Realist argued as follows : ( 1 ) The conception of my existence is something immediate or intuitive . The thought " I exist " is a " concept " , and my body being an element of this " concept " , it follows that my body is intuitively known as something real . If the knowledge of the existent is not immediate , the fact of its perception would require a process of thought which , as we know , it does not . The Asharite Al-Razi admits that the concept of existence is immediate ; but he regards the judgment " The concept of existence is immediate " - as merely a matter of acquisition . Muhammad ibn Mubarak Bukhari , on the other hand , says that the whole argument of the realist proceeds on the assumption that the concept of my existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) . If , says he , we admit that the concept of my existence is immediate , abstract existence can not be regarded as a constitutive element of this conception . And if the realist maintains that the perception of a particular object is immediate , we admit the truth of what he says ; but it would not follow , as he is anxious to establish , that the so-called underlying essence is immediately known as objectively real . The realist argument , moreover , demands that the mind ought not to be able to conceive the predication of qualities to <p> 1 Muhammad ibn Mubarak 's Commentary on Hikmat al-Ain , fol. 5a . <p> 68 <p> things . We can not conceive , " snow is white " , because whiteness , being a part of this immediate judgment , must also be immediately known without any predication . Mulla Muhammad Hashim Husaini remarks ( 1 ) that this reasoning is erroneous . The mind in the act of predicating whiteness of snow is working on a purely ideal existence - the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the qualities are mere facets or aspects . Husaini , moreover , anticipates Hamilton , and differs from other realists in holding that the so-called unknowable essence of the object is also immediately known . The object , he says , is immediately perceived as one ( 2 ) . We do not successively perceive the various aspects of what happens to be the objects of our perception . <p> 2 ) The idealist , says the realist , reduces all quality to mere subjective relations . His argument leads him to deny the underlyingessence of things , and to look upon them as entirely heterogeneous collections of qualities , the essence of which consists merely in the phenomenal fact of their perception . In spite of his belief in the complete heterogeneity of things , he applies the word existence to all things - a tacit admission that there is some essence common to all the various forms of existence . Abu'l-Hasan al-Ashari replies that this application is only a verbal convenience , and is not meant to indicate the so-called internal homogeneity of things . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must mean , according to the realist , that the existence of a thing either constitutes its very essence , or it is something superadded to the under-lying essence of the thing . The first supposition is a virtual admission as to the homogeneity of things ; since we can not maintain that existence peculiar to one thing is fundamentally different from existence peculiar to another . The supposition that existence is something superadded to the essence of a thing leads to an absurdity ; since in this case the essence will have to be regarded as something distinct from existence ; and the denial of essence ( with the Asharite ) would blot out the distinction between existence and non-existence . Moreover , what was the essence before existence was superadded to it ? We must not say that the essence was ready to receive existence before it actually did receive it ; since this statement would imply that the essence was non-existence before it received existence . Likewise the statement that the essence has the power of receiving the quality of non-existence , implies the absurdity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as forming a part of the essence . But if it forms a part of the essence , the latter will have to be regarded as a compound . If , on the other hand , existence is external to the essence , it must be something contingent because of its dependence on something other than itself . Now everything contingent must have a cause . If this cause is the essence itself , it would follow that the essence existed before it existed ; since the cause must precede the effect in the fact of existence . If , however , the cause of existence <p> 70 <p> is something other than the essence , it follows that the existence of God also must be explained by some cause other than the essence of God - an absurd conclusion which turns the necessary into the contingent . ( 1 ) This argument of the realist is based on a complete misunderstanding of the idealist position . He does not see that the idealist never regarded the fact of existence as something superadded to the essence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essence . The essence , says ibn Mubarak , ( 2 ) is the cause of existence without being chronologically before it . The existence of the essence constitutes its very being ; it is not dependent for it on something other than itself . <p> The truth is that both sides are far from a true theory of knowledge . The agnostic realist , who holds that behind the phenomenal qualities of a thing , there is an essence operating as their cause , is guilty of a glaring contradiction . He holds that underlying the thing there is an unknowable essence or substratum which is known to exist . The Asharite idealist , on the other hand , misunderstands the process of knowledge . He ignores the mental activity involved in the act of knowledge ; and looks upon perceptions as mere presentations which are determined , as he says , by God . But if the order of presentations requires a cause to account for it , why should not that cause be sought in the original constitution of matter as Locke did ? Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibn Mubarak 's Commentary , fol. 8b.2.Ibid , fol. 9a . <p> 71 <p> passive perception or awareness of what is presented , leads to certain inadmissible conclusions which the Asharite never thought of : ( a ) They did not see that their purely subjective conception of knowledge swept away all possibility of error . If the existence of a thing is merely the fact of its being presented , there is no reason why it should be recognised as different from what it actually is . <p> ( b ) They did not see that on their theory of knowledge , our fellow-beings , like other elements of the physical order , would have no higher reality than mere states of my consciousness . ( c ) If knowledge is a mere receptivity of presentations , God , who , as cause of presentations , is active in regard to the act of our knowledge , must not be aware of our presentations . From the Asharite point of view this conclusion is fatal to their whole position . They can not say that presentations , on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God 's consciousness . <p> Another question connected with the nature of the essence is , whether it is caused or uncaused . The followers of Aristotle , or philosophers as they are generally called by their opponents , hold that the underlying essence of things is uncaused . The Asharitehold the opposite view . Essence , says the Aristotelian , can not be acted upon by any external agent . ( 1 ) Al Katib argues that if , for instance , the essence of humanity had resulted from the operation of an <p> 1 . Ibn Mubarak 's Commentary , fol. 20a . <p> 72 <p> external activity , doubt as to its being the real essence of humanity would have been possible . As a matter of fact we never entertain such a doubt ; it follows therefore . that the essence is not due to the activity of an agency external to itself . The idealist starts with the realist distinction of essence and existence , and argues that the realist line of argument would lead to the absurd proposition - that man is uncaused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realist , as a combination of two uncaused essences - existence and humanity . <p> B. The Nature of Knowledge <p> The followers of Aristotle , true to their position as to the independent objective reality of the essence , define knowledge as " receiving images of external things " . ( 1 ) It is possible to conceive , they argue , an object which is externally unreal , and to which other qualities can be attributed . But when we attribute to it the quality of existence , actual existence is necessitated ; since the affirmation of the quality of a thing is a part of the affirmation of that thing . If , therefore , the predication of existence does not necessitate actual objective existence of the thing , we are driven to deny externality altogether , and to hold that the thing exists in the mind as a mere idea . But the affirmation of a thing , says Ibn Mubarak , constitutes the very existence of the thing . The idealist makes no such distinction as affirmation and existence . To infer from the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument that the thing must be regarded as existing in the mind , is unjustifiable . " Ideal " existence follows , only from the denial of externality which the Asharite do not deny ; since they hold that knowledge is a relation between the knower and the known which is. known as external . Al-Katibi 's proposition that if the thing does not exist as external existence , it must exist . as ideal or mental existence , is self-contradictory , since , . on his principles , everything that exists in idea exists in externality ( 1 ) . <p> C. The Nature of Non-existence <p> Al-Katabiexplains and criticises the proposition , maintained by contemporary philosophers generally " That the existent is good , and the non-existent is evil " . ( 2 ) The fact of murder , he says , is not evil because the murderer had the power of committing such a thing ; or because the instrument of murder had the power of cutting ; or because the neck of the murdered had the capacity of being cut asunder . It is evil because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is non-existential , and not existential like the conditions indicated above . But in order to show that evil is non-existence , we should make an inductive inquiry , and examine all the various cases of evil . A. perfect induction , however , is impossible , and an incomplete induction can not prove the point . Al-Katibi , therefore , rejects this proposition , and holds <p> 1 Ibid. fol. 11b.2 Ibid. fol. 14a . <p> 74 <p> the " non-existence is absolute nothing(1) " The possible essences , according to him , are not lying fixed in space waiting for the attribute of existence ; otherwise fixity in space would have to be regarded as possessing no existence . But his critics hold that this argument is true only on the supposition that fixity in space and existence are identical . Fixity in externality , says Ibn Mubarak , is a conception wider than existence . All existence is external , but all that is external is not necessarily existent . <p> The interest of the Asharite in the dogma of the Resurrection - the possibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate the apparently absurd proposition that " non-existence or nothing is something " . They argued that , since we make judgments about the non-existent , it is , therefore , known ; and the fact of its knowability indicates that " the nothing " is not absolutely nothing . The knowable is a case of affirmation and the non-existent being knowable , is a case of affirmation ( 2 ) . Al-Katibi denies the truth of the Major . Impossible things , he says , are known , yet they do not externally exist , Al-Razi criticises this argument accusing Al-Katibi of the ignorance of the fact that the ' essence ' exists in the mind , and yet is known as external . Al-Katibi supposes that the knowledge of a thing necessitates its existence as an independent objective reality . Moreover it should be remembered that the Asharite discriminate between <p> positive and existent on the one hand , and non-existent and negative on the other . They say that all existent is positive , but the converse of this proposition is not true . There is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absolutely no relation between the positive and the negative . We do not say , . as Al-Katibi holds , that the impossible is non-existent ; , we say that the impossible is only negative . Substances. which do exist are something positive . As regards the . attribute which can not be conceived as existing apart from the substance , it is neither existent nor non-existent , but something between the two . Briefly the Asharite position is as follows : <p> " A thing has a proof of its existence or not . If not , it is called negative . If it has a proof of its , existence , it is either substance or attribute . If it is. substance and has the attribute of existence or nonexistence ( i.e. it is perceived or not ) it is existent or non-existent accordingly . If it is attribute , it is neither existent nor non-existent " . ( 1 ) <p> 1 . Ibn Mubarak 's Commentary , fol. 15b . <p> 76 <p> CHAPTER VSUFIISM <p> 1 . THE ORIGIN AND QURANIC JUSTIFICATION OF SUFIISM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriental scholarship to trace the chain of influences . Such a procedure has certainly great historical value , provided it does not make us ignore the fundamental fact , that the human mind possesses an independent individuality , and , acting on its own initiative , can gradually evolve out of itself , truths which may have been anticipated by other minds ages ago . No idea can seize a people 's soul unless , in some sense , it is the people 's own . External influences may wake it up from its deep unconscious slumber ; but they can not - , so to speak , create it out of nothing . Much has been written about the origin of Persian Suifiism ; and , in almost all cases , explorers of this . most interesting field of research have exercised their ingenuity in discovering the various channels through which the basic ideas of Sufiism might have travelled - from one place to another . They seem completely to have ignored the principle , that the full significance of a phenomenon in the intellectual evolution of a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preexisting intellectual , political , and social conditions <p> 77 <p> which alone make its existence inevitable . Von Kremer and Dozy derive Persian Sufiism from the Indian Vedanta ; Merx and Mr. Nicholson derive it from Neo-Platonism ; while Professor Browne once regarded it as Aryan reaction against an unemotional Semitic religion . It appears to me , however , that these theories have been worked out under the influence of a notion of causation which is essentially false . That a fixed quantity A is the cause of , or produces another fixed quantity B , is a proposition which , though convenient for scientific purposes , is apt to damage all inquiry , in so far as it leads us completely to ignore the innumerable conditions lying at the back of a phenomenon . It would , for instance , be an historical , error to say that the dissolution of the Roman Empire was due to the barbarian invasions . The statement completely ignores other forces of a different character that tended to split up the political unity of the Empire . To describe the advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman Empire which could have assimilated , as it actually did to a certain extent , the so-called cause , is a procedure that no logic would justify . Let us , therefore , in the light of a truer theory of causation , enumerate the principal political , social , and intellectual conditions of Islamic life about the end of the 8th and the first half of the 9th Century when , properly speaking , the Sufi ideal of life came into existence , to be soon followed by a philosophical justification of that ideal . <p> ( 1 . ) When we study the history of the time , we find it to be a time of more or less political unrest . <p> 78 <p> The latter half of the 8th Century presents , besides the political revolution which resulted in the overthrow of the Umayyads ( 749 A.D. ) , persecutions of Zendiks , and revolts of Persian heretics ( Sindbah 755-6 ; Ustadhis 766-8 ; the veiled prophet of Khurasan 777-80 ) who , working on the credulity of the people , cloaked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guise of religious ideas . Later on in the beginning of the 9th Century we find the sons of Harun ( Ma'man and Amin ) engaged in a terrible conflict for political supremacy ; and still later , we see the Golden Age of Islamic literature seriously disturbed by the persistent revolt of the Mazdakite Babak ( 816-838 ) . The early years of Ma'mun 's reign present another social phenomenon of great political significance - the Shu'ubiyya controversy ( 815 ) , which progresses with the rise and establishment of independent Persian families , the Tahirid ( 820 ) , the Saffarid ( 868 ) , and the Samanid Dynasty ( 874 ) . It is , therefore , the combined force of these and other conditions of a similar nature that contributed to drive away spirits of devotional character from the scene of continual unrest to the blissful peace of an everdeepening contemplative life . The Semitic character of the life and thought of these early Muhammadan ascetics is gradually followed by a large hearted pantheism of a more or less Aryan stamp , the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressing political independence of Persia . <p> ( 2 . ) The sceptical tendencies of Islamic Rationalism <p> 79 <p> which found an early expression in the poems of Bashshar ibn Burd - the blind Persian sceptic who deified fire , and scoffed at all non-Persian modes of thought . The germs of Scepticism latent in Rationalism ultimately necessitated an appeal to a super , intellectual source of knowledge which asserted itself in the Risala of Al-Qushairi ( 986 ) . In our own times - the negative results of Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason drove Jacobi and Schleiermacher to base faith on the feeling of the reality of the ideal ; and to the 19th Century sceptic Wordsworth uncovered that mysterious state of mind " in which we grow all spirit and see into the life of things " . <p> ( 3 . ) The unemotional piety of the various schools of Islam - the Hanafite ( Abu Hanifa d. 767 ) , the Shafiite ( Al-Shafi'i d. 820 ) , the Malikite ( Al-Malik d. 795 ) , and the anthropomorphic Hambalite ( Ibn Hambal d. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ruled the masses after the death of Al-Ma'mun . <p> ( 4 . ) The religious discussions among the representatives of various creeds encouraged by Al-Ma'mun , and especially the bitter theological controversy between the Asharites and the advocates of Rationalism which tended not only to confine religion within the narrow limits of schools , but also stirred up the spirit to rise above all petty sectarian wrangling . <p> ( 5 . ) The gradual softening of religious fervency due to the rationalistic tendency of the early Abbasid period , and the rapid growth of wealth which tended <p> 80 <p> to produce moral laxity and indifference to religious life in the upper circles of Islam . ( 6 ) The presence of Christianity as a working ideal of life . It was , however , principally the actual life of the Christian hermit rather than his religious ideas , that exercised the greatest fascination over the minds of early Islamic saints whose complete unworldliness , though extremely charming in itself , is , I believe , quite contrary to the spirit of Islam . <p> Such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combined action of the above conditions that we should look for the origin and development of Sufiistic ideas . Given these conditions and the Persian mind with an almost innate tendency towards monism , the whole phenomenon of the birth and growth of Sufiism is explained.If we nowstudy the principal pre-existing conditions of Neo-Platonism , we find that similar conditions produced similar results . The barbarian raids which were soon to reduce Emperors of the Palace to Emperors of the Camp , assumed a more serious aspect about the middle of the Third Century . Plotinus himself speaks of the political unrest of his time in one of his letters to Flaccus(1) . ' When he looked round himself in Alexandria , his birthplace , he noticed signs of growing toleration and indifferentism towards <p> 1 " Tidings have reached us that Valerian has been defeated , and is now in the bands of Sapor. the threats of Franks and Allemanni , of Goths and Persians , are alike terrible by turns to our degenerateRome . " ( Plotinus to Flaccus ; quoted by Vaughan in his Half-hours with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Later on in Rome which had become , so to say , a pantheon of different nations , he found a similar want of seriousness in life , a similar laxity of character in the upper classes of society . In more learned circles philosophy was studied as a branch of literature rather than f or its own sake ; and Sextus Empiricus , provoked by Antiochus 's tendency to fuse scepticism and Stoicism was teaching the old unmixed scepticism of Pyrrho - that intellectual despair which drove Plotinus to find truth in a revelation above thought itself . Above all , the hard unsentimental character of Stoic morality , and the loving piety of the followers of Christ who , undaunted by long and fierce persecutions , were preaching the message of peace and love to the whole Roman world , necessitated a restatement of pagan thought in a way that might revivify the older ideals of life , and suit the new spiritual requirements of the people . But the ethical force of Christianity was too great for Neo-Platonism which , on account of its more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , and was consequently inaccessible to the rude barbarian who , being influenced by the actual life of the persecuted Christian adopted Christianity , and settled down to construct new empires out of the ruins of the old . In Persia the influence of culture - contacts and <p> 1 The element of ecstacy which could have appealed to some minds , was thrown into the background by the later teachers of Neo-Platonism , so that it became a mere system of thought having no human interest . Says Whittaker : " The mystical ecstacy was not found by the later teachers of the school easier to attain , but more difficult ; and the tendency became more and more to regard it as all but unattainable on eirth . " Neo-Platonism , p. 101 . <p> 82 <p> cross-fertilisation of ideas created in certain minds a vague desire to realise a similar restatement of Islam , which gradually assimilated Christian ideals as well as ; Christian Gnostic speculation , and found a firm foundation in the Qur'an . The flower of Greek Thought faded away before the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's invective could not touch the freshness of the Persian rose . The one was completely swept away by the flood of barbarian invasions ; the other , unaffected by the ' Tartar revolution , still holds its own.This extraordinary vitality of the Sufi restatement of Islam , however , is explained when we reflect on the all-embracing structure of Sufiism . The Semitic formula of salvation can be briefly stated inthe words , " Transform your will " - which signifies that the Semite looks upon will as the essence of the human soul . The Indian Vedantist , on the other hand , teaches that all pain is due to our mistaken attitude towards the Universe . He , therefore , commands us to transform our understanding implying thereby that the essential nature of man consists in thought , not activity or will . But the Sufi holds that the mere transformation of will or understanding will not bring peace ; we should bring about the transformation of both by a complete transformation of feeling , of which will and understanding are only specialised forms . His message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget your own individuality in doing good to Says Rumi : " To win other people 's hearts <p> 83 <p> is the greatest pilgrimage ; and one heartis worth more than a thousand Kabahs . Kabah is a mere cottage of Abraham ; but the heart is the very home of God . " But this formula demands a why and a how - a metaphysical justification of the ideal in order to satisfy the understanding ; and rules of action in order to guide the will . Sufiism furnishes both . Semitic religion is a code of strict rules of conduct ; the Indian Vedanta. on the other hand , is a cold system of thought . Sufiism avoids their incomplete psychology , and attempts to synthesise both the Semitic and the Aryanformulas in the higher category of Love . On the one hand it assimilates the Buddhistic idea of Nirvana ( Fana - Annihilation ) , and seeks to build a metaphysical system in the light of this idea ; on the other hand it does not disconnect itself from Islam , and finds the justification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geographical position of its home , it stands midway between the Semitic and the Aryan , assimilating ideas from both sides , and giving them the stamp of its own individuality which , on the whole , is more Aryan than Semitic in character . It would , therefore , beevident that the secret of the vitality of Sufiism is the complete view of human nature upon which it is based . It has survived orthodox persecutions and political revolutions , because it appeals to human nature in its entirety ; and , while it concentrates its interest chiefly in a lifeof self-denial , it allows free play to the speculative tendency as well . <p> 84 <p> I will now briefly indicate how Sufi writers justify their views from the Quranic standpoint . There is no historical evidence to show that the Prophet of Arabia actually communicated certain esoteric doctrines to Ali or Abu Bakr . The Sufi however , contends that the Prophet had an esoteric teaching - " wisdom " - as distinguished from the teaching contained in the Book , and he brings forward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sent a prophet to you from among yourselves who reads our verses to you , purifies you , teaches you the Book and the Wisdom , and teaches you what you did not know before(1) . " He holds that " the wisdom " spoken of in the verse , is something not incorporated in the teaching of the Book which , as the Prophet repeatedly declared , had been taught by several prophets before him . If , he says , the wisdom is included in the Book , the word " Wisdom " in the verse would be redundant . It can , I think , be easily shown that in the Qur'an , as well as in the authenticated traditions , there are germs of Sufi doctrine which , owing to the thoroughly practical genius of the Arabs , could not develop and fructify in Arabia , but which grew up into a distinct doctrine when they found favourable circumstances in alien soils . The Qur'an thus defines the Muslims : " Those who believe in the Unseen , establish daily prayer , and spend out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question arises as to the what and the where of the <p> 1 . Sura 2 v. 146. 2 . Sura 2 v. 2 . <p> 85 <p> Unseen . The Qur'an replies that the Unseen is in your own soul - " And in the earth there are signs to those who believe , and in yourself , - what ! do you not then see ( 1 ) " And again - " We are nigher to him ( man ) than his own jugular vein(2) . " Similarly the Holy Book teaches that the essential nature of the Unseen is pure light - " God is the light of heavens earth(3) . " As regards the question whether this Primal Light is personal , the Qur'an , in spite of many expressions signifying personality , declares in a few words - " There is nothing like him(4) . " <p> These are some of the chief verses out of which the various Sufi commentators develop pantheistic views of the Universe . They enumerate the following four stages of spiritual training through which the soul - the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the soul is the order or reason of God(5). " ) has to pass , if it desires to rise above the common herd , and realise its union or identity with the ultimate source of all things : <p> ( 1 ) Belief in the Unseen . <p> ( 2 ) Search after the Unseen . The spirit of inquiry leaves its slumber by observing the marvellous phenomena of nature . " Look at the camel how it is created ; the skies how they are exalted ; the mountains how they are unshakeably fixed ( 6 ) . " <p> ( 3 ) The knowledge of the Unseen . This comes , as we have indicated above , by looking into the depths of our own soul . <p> ( 4 ) The Realisation . This results , according to the higher Sufiism from the constant practice of Justice and Charity - " Verily God bids you do justice and good , and give to kindred ( their due ) , and He forbids you to sin , and do wrong , and oppress(1) " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sufi fraternities ( e.g. Naqshbandi ) devised , or rather borrowed(2) from the Indian Vedantist , other means of bringing about this Realisation . They taught , imitating the Hindu doctrine of Kundalini , that there are six great centres of light of various colours in the body of man . It is the object of the Sufi to make them move , or to use the technical word , " current " , by certain methods of meditation , and eventually to realise , amidst the apparent diversity of colours , the fundamental colourless light which makes everything visible , and is itself invisible . The continual movement of these centres of light through the body , and the final realisation of their identity , which results from putting the atoms of the body into definite courses of motion by slow repetition of the <p> 1 . Sura 16 : v. 92.2 . " Weber makes the following statement on the authority of Lassen : - " Al-Biruni translated Patanjali 's work into Arabic at the beginning of the 11th Century , and also , it would appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents of these works does not harmonise with the Sanskrit originals . " History of Indian Literature , p 239 . <p> 87 <p> various names of God and other mysterious expressions , illuminates the whole body of the Safi ; and the perception of the same illumination in the external world completely extinguishes the sense of " otherness " . The fact that these methods were known to the Persian Sufis misled Von Kremer , who ascribed the whole phenomenon of Sufiism to the influence of Vedantic ideas . Such methods of . contemplation are quite un-Islamic in character , and the higher Sufis do not attach any importance to them . <p> 2 . ASPECTS OF SUFI METAPHYSICS <p> Let us now return to the various schools , or rather the various aspects , of Sufi Metaphysics . A , careful investigation of Sufi literature shows that Sufiism has looked at the Ultimate Reality from three standpoints which , in fact , do not exclude but , complement each other . Some Sufis conceive the essential nature of reality as self-conscious will , others beauty , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowledge . There are , therefore , three aspects of Safi thought : <p> A. Reality as Self-conscious Will <p> The first in historical order is that represented by Shaqiq Balkhi Ibrahim Adham , Rabi'a , and others.This school conceives the Ultimate Reality as " Will " , and the Universe a finite activity of that will , It isessentially monotheistic and consequently more <p> 88 <p> Semitic in character . It is not the desire of Knowledge which dominates the ideal of the Sufis of this school , but the characteristic features of their life are piety , unworldliness , and an intense longing for God due to the consciousness of sin . Their object is not to philosophise , but principally to work out a certain ideal of life . From our standpoint , therefore , they are not of much importance . <p> B. Reality as Beauty <p> In the beginning of the 9th Century Ma'ruf Karkhi defined Sufiism as " Apprehension of Divine realities(1) " - a definition which marks the movement from Faith to Knowledge . But the method of apprehending the ultimate reality was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century . The teachers of this school adopted the Neo-Platonic idea of creation by intermediary agencies ; and though this idea lingered in the minds of Sufi writers for a long time , yet their Pantheism led them to abandon the Emanation theory altogether . Like Avicenna they looked upon the Ultimate Reality as " Eternal Beauty " , whose very nature consists in seeing its own " face " reflected in the Universe-mirror . The Universe , therefore , became to them a reflected image of the " Eternal Beauty " , and not an emanation as the Neo-Platonists had taught . The cause of creation , says Mir Sayyid Sharif , is the manifestation of Beauty , <p> and the first creation is Love . The realisation of this Beauty is brought about by universal love , which the innate Zoroastrian instinct of the Persian Sufi loved to define as " the Sacred Fire which burns up everything other than God . " Says Rumi : <p> As a direct consequence of such a view of the Universe , we have the idea of impersonal absorption which first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic feature of the later development of this school . The growth of this idea may have been influenced by Hindu pilgrims travelling through Persia to the Buddhistic temple still existing at Baku. ( 2 ) The school became wildly pantheistic in Husain Mansur who , in the true spirit of the Indian Vedantist , cried out , " I am God " - Aham Brahma asmi . <p> 1 . Mathnavi , Jalal al Din Rumi , with Bahral Ulum 's Commentary . Lucknow ( India ) , 1877 , p. 9.2 . As regards the progress of Buddhism , Geiger says : - " We know that in the period after Alexander , Buddhism was powerful in Eastern Iran , and that it counted its confessors as far as Tabaristan . It is especially certain that many Buddhistic priests were found in Bactria . This state of things , which began perhaps in the Ist Century before Christ , lasted till the 7th Century A. D. , when the appearance of Islamism alone cut short the development of Buddhism in Kabul and Bactria , and it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Zarathushtra legend in the form in which it is presented to us by Daqiq , Civilisation of Eastern Iranians , Vol. 11 , p. 170 . <p> 90 <p> The Ultimate Reality or Eternal Beauty , according to the Sufis of this school , is infinite in the sense that " it is absolutely free from the limitations of beginning , end , right , left , above , and below(1) . " Theof essence and attribute does not exist in the Infinite- " Substance and quality are really identical(2) . " We have indicated above that nature is the mirror of the Absolute Existence . But according to Nasafi , there are two kinds of mirrors(3) ( a ) That which shows merely a reflected image - is external nature . <p> ( b ) That which shows the real essence - this is man who is a limitation of the Absolute , and erroneously thinks himself to be an independent entity . <p> " 0 Derwish ! " says Nasafi , " dost thou think that thy existence is independent of God ? This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful parable(5) . The fishes in a certain tank realised that - they lived , moved , and had their being in water , but felt that they were quite ignorant of the real nature of what constituted the very source of their life . They resorted to a wiser fish in a great river , and the philosopher-fish addressed them thus : " O you who endeavour to unite the knot ( of being ) ! You are born in union , yet die in the thought of an unreal separation . Thirsty on the <p> All feeling of separation , therefore , is ignorance ; and all " otherness " is a mere appearance , a dream , a shadow - a differentiation born of relation essential to the self -recognition of the Absolute . The great prophet of this school is " the excellent Rumi " , as Hegel calls him . He took up the old Neo-Platonic idea of the Universal Soul working through the various spheres of being , and expressed it in a way so modernin spirit that Clodd introduces the passage in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this famous passage in order to show how successfully the poet anticipates the modern concept of evolution , which he regarded as the realistic side of his Idealism . <p> First man appeared in the class of inorganic things , Next he passed therefrom into that of plants . For years he lived as one of the plants , Remembering nought of his inorganic state so different ; And when he passed from the vegetive to the animal state , He had no remembrance of his state as a plant , Except the inclination he felt to the world of plants , Especially at the time of spring and sweet flowers ; Like the inclination of infants towards their mothers , Which know not the cause of their inclination to the breast . Again the great Creator as you know , Drew man out of the animal into the human state . Thus man passed from one order of nature to another , Till he became wise and knowing and strong as he is now . Of his first soul be has now no remembrance , And he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book IV ) . <p> It would now be instructive if we compare this . <p> 92 <p> aspect of Sufi thought with the fundamental ideas of Neo-Platonism . The God of Neo-Platonism is immanent as well as transcendant . " As being the cause of all things , it is everywhere . As being other than all things , it is nowhere . If it were only ' everywhere ' , and not also ' nowhere ' , it would beall things(1) . " The Sufi , however , tersely says that God is all things . The Neo-Platonist allows a certain permanence or fixity to matter(2) ; but the Sufis of the school in question regard all empirical experience as a kind of dreaming . Life in limitation , they say , is asleep ; death brings the awakening . It is , however , the doctrine of Impersonal Immortality - " genuinely Eastern in spirit " - which distinguishes this school from Neo-Platonism . " Its ( Arabian Philosophy ) distinctive doctrine " , says Whittaker , " of an Impersonal immortality of the general human intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , essentially original . " The above brief exposition shows that there are three basic ideas of this mode of thought : ( a ) That the Ultimate Reality is knowable through a supersensual state of consciousness ; ( b ) That the Ultimate Reality is impersonal ; ( c ) That the Ultimate Reality is one . <p> Corresponding to these ideas we have : ( a ) The Agnostic reaction as manifested in the poet Umar Khayyam ( 12th Century ) who cried out <p> And saints who in the mosque sad vigils keep , Are lost at sea alike , and find no shore , <p> One only wakes , all others are asleep . <p> ( b ) The monotheistic reaction of Ibn Taimiyya and his followers in the 13th Century . ( c ) The Pluralistic reaction of Wahid Mahmud ( 1 ) in the 13th Century . <p> Speaking from a purely philosophical standpoint , the last movement is most interesting . The history of Thought illustrates the operation of certain general laws of progress which are true of the intellectual annals of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pluralism of Herbart ; while the pantheism of Spinoza called forth the monadism of Leibniz . The operation of the same law led Wahid Mahmud to deny the truth of contemporary monism , and declare that Reality is not one , but many . Long before Leibniz he taught that the Universe is a combination of what he called " Afrad " - essential units , or simple atoms which have existed from all eternity , and are endowed with life . The law of the Universe is an ascending perfection of elemental matter , continually passing from lower to higher forms determined by the kind of food which the fundamental units assimilate . Each period of his cosmogony comprises 8,000 years , and after eight such <p> 1 Dabistan , Chap . 8 . <p> 94 <p> periods the world is decomposed , and the units re-combine to construct a new universe . Wahid Mahmud succeeded in founding a sect which was cruelly persecuted , and finally stamped out of existence by Shah Abbas . It is said that the poet Hafiz of Shiraz believed in the tenets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The third great school of Sufiism conceives Reality as essentially Light or Thought , the , very nature of which demands something to be thought or illuminated . While the preceding school abandoned Neo-Platonism , this school transformed it into new systems . There are , however , two aspects of the metaphysics of this school . The one is genuinely Persian in spirit , the other is chiefly influenced by Christian modes of thought . Both agree in holding that the fact of empirical diversity necessitates a principle of difference in the nature of the Ultimate Reality . I now proceed to consider them in their historical order . <p> 1 . REALITY AS LIGHT - AL-ISHRAQI <p> Return to Persian Dualism <p> The application of Greek dialectic to Islamic Theology aroused that spirit of critical examination which began with Al-Ashari , and found its completest expression in the scepticism of Al-Ghazali . Even among the Rationalists there were some more critical minds - such as Nazzam - whose attitude towards <p> 95 <p> Greek Philosophy was not one of servile submission - but of independent criticism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barakat , and Al-Amidi , carried on a persistent attack on the whole fabric of Greek Philosophy ; while Abu Sa'id Sairafi , Qadi Abd al-Jabbar , Abul Ma'ali , Abul Qasim , and finally the acute Ibn Taimiyya , actuated by similar theological motives , continued to expose the inherent weakness of Greek Logic . In their criticism of Greek Philosophy , these thinkers were supplemented by some of the more learned Sufis , such as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi , who endeavoured to substantiate the helplessness of pure reason by his refutation of Greek thought in a work entitled " The Unveiling of Greek Absurdities " . The Asharite reaction against Rationalism resulted not only in the development of a system of metaphysics most modern in some of its aspects , but also in completely breaking asunder the worn out fetters of intellectual thraldom . Erdmann ( 1 ) seems to think that the speculative spirit among the Muslims exhausted itself with Al-Farabi and Avicenna , and that after them Philosophy became bankrupt in passing over into scepticism and mysticism . Evidently he ignores the Muslim criticism of Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and a genuine Persian reconstruction on the other . ' That a system of thoroughly Persian character might be possible , the destruction of foreign thought , or rather the weakening of its hold on the mind , was <p> 1 Vol. 1 , p. 367 . <p> 96 <p> indispensable . The Asharite and other defenders of Islamic Dogma completed the destruction ; Al-Ishraqi - the child of emancipation - came forward to build a new edifice of thought ; though , in his process of reconstruction , he did not entirely repudiate the older material . His is the genuine Persian brain which , undaunted by the threats of narrow-minded authority , asserts its right of free independent speculation . In his philosophy the old Iranian tradition , which had found only a partial expression in the writings of the physician Al-Razi , Al-Ghazali and the Ismailia sect , endeavours to come to a final understanding with the philosophy of his predecessors and the theology of Islam . Shaikh Shahabal Din Suhrawardi , known as Shaikhal IshraqMaqtul was born about the middle of the 12th Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the commentator Al-Razi - and , while still a youth , stood unrivalled as a thinker in the whole Islamic world . His great admirer Al-Malik al-Zahir - the son of Sultan Salah-al-Din - invited him to Aleppo , where the youthful philosopher expounded his independent opinions in a way that aroused the bitter jealousy of contemporary theologians . These hired slaves of bloodthirsty Dogmatism , which , conscious of its inherent weakness , has always managed to keep brute force behind its back , wrote to Sultan Salah-al-Din , that the Shaikh 's teaching was a danger to Islam , and that it was necessary , in the interest of the Faith , to nip the evil in the bud . The Sultan consented ; and there , at the early <p> 97 <p> age of 36 , the young Persian thinker calmly met the blow which madehim a martyr of truth , and immortalised his name for ever . Murderers have passed away , but the philosophy , the price of which was paid in blood , still lives , and attracts many an earnest seeker after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ishraqi Philosophy are his intellectual independence , the skill with which he weaves his materials into a systematic whole , and above all his faithfulness to the philosophic traditions of his country . In many fundamental points he differs from Plato , and freely criticises Aristotle whose philosophy he looks upon as a mere preparation for his own system of thought.Nothing escapes his criticism . Even the logic of Aristotle he subjects to a searching examination , and shows the hollowness of some of its doctrines . Definition , for instance , is genus plus differentia , according to Aristotle . But Al-Ishraqi holds that the distinctive attribute of the thing defined , which can not be predicated of any other thing , will bring us no knowledge of the thing . We define " horse " as a neighing animal . Now we understand animality , because we know many animals in which this attribute exists ; but it is impossible to understand the attribute " neighing " , since it is found nowhere except in the thing defined.The ordinary definition of horse , therefore , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aristotelian definition , as a scientific principle is quite useless . This criticism leads the Shaikh to a standpoint very similar to <p> 98 <p> that of Bosanquet who defines definition as " Sum- mation of qualities " . The Shaikh holds that a true definition would enumerate all the attributes which , taken collectively , exist nowhere except in the thing defined , though they may individually exist in other things . <p> But let us turn to his system of metaphysics , and estimate the worth of his contribution to the thought of his country . In order fully to comprehend the purely intellectual side of Transcendental Philosophy , the student , says the Shaikh , must be thoroughly acquainted with Aristotelian Philosophy , Logic , Mathematics , and Sufiism . His mind should be completely free from the taint of prejudice and sin , so that he may gradually develop that inner sense , which verifies and corrects what intellect understands only as theory . Unaided reason is untrustworthy ; it must always be supplemented by " Dhauq " - the mysterious perception of the essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless soul , and disarms Scepticism for ever . We are , however , concerned with the purely speculative side of this spiritual experience - the results of the inner perception as formulated and systematised by discursive thought . Let us , therefore , examine the various aspects of the Ishraqi Philosophy - Ontology , Cosmology , and Psychology . <p> Ontology <p> The ultimate principle of all existence is " Nur-i Qahir " - the Primal Absolute Light whose essential <p> 99 <p> nature consists in perpetual illumination . " Nothing is more visible than light , and visibility does not stand in need of any definition(1) . " The essence of Light , therefore , is manifestation . For if manifestation is an attribute superadded to light , it would follow that in itself light possesses no visibility , and becomes visible only through something else visible in itself ; and from this again follows the absurd consequence , that something other than light is more visible than light . The Primal Light , therefore , has no reason of its , existence beyond itself . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possible The not-light " ( darkness ) is not something distinct proceeding from an independent source . It is an error of the representatives of the Magian religion to suppose that Light and Darkness are two distinct realities created by two distinct creative agencies . The ancient philosophers of Persia were not dualists like the Zoroastrian priests who , on the ground of the principle that the one can not cause to emanate from itself more than one , assigned two independent sources to Light and Darkness . The relation between them is not that of contrariety ; but of existence and non-existence . The affirmation of Light necessarily posits its own negation - Darkness , which it must illuminate in order to be itself . This Primordial Light is the source of all motion . But its motion is not change of place ; it is due to the love of illumination which constitutes its very essence , and stirs it up , as it were , to quicken all things into life , by <p> pouring out its own rays into their being . The number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intenser brightness become , in their turn , the sources of other illuminations ; and the scale of brightness gradually descends to illuminations too faint to beget other illuminations . All these illuminations are mediums , or in the language of Theology , angels through whom the infinite varieties of being receive life and sustenance from the Primal Light . The followers of Aristotle erroneously restricted the number of original Intellects to ten . They likewise erred in enumerating the categories of thought . The possibilities of the Primal Light are infinite ; and the Universe , with all its variety , is only a partial expression of the infinitude behind it . The categories of Aristotle , therefore , are only relatively true . It is impossible for humanthought to comprehend , within its tiny grasp , all the infinite variety of ideas according to which the Primal Light does or may illuminate that which is not light . We can , however , discriminate between the following two illuminations of the original Light : ( 1 ) The Abstract Light ( e.g. , Intellect , Universal as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never becomes the attribute of anything other than itself ( Substance ) . From it proceed all the various forms of partly-conscious , conscious , or self-conscious light , differing from one another in the amount of lustre , which is determined by their comparative nearness or <p> 101 <p> distance from the ultimate source of their being . The individual intellect or soul is only a fainter copy , or a more distant reflection of the Primal Light . The Abstract Light knows itself through itself , and does not stand in need of a non-ego to reveal its own , existence to itself . Consciousness or self-knowledge , therefore , is the very essence of Abstract light , as distinguished from the negation of light . <p> ( 2 ) The Accidental light ( Attribute ) - the light that has a form , and is capable of becoming an attribute of something other than itself ( e.g. , the light of the stars , or the visibility of other bodies ) . The Accidental light , or more properly sensible light , is a distant reflection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has lost the intensity , or substance-character of its parent . The process of continuous reflection is really a softening process ; successive illuminations gradually lose their intensity until , in the chain of reflections , we reach certain less intense illuminations which entirely lose their independent character , and can not exist except in association with something else . These illuminations form the Accidental light - the attribute which has no independent existence . The relation , therefore , between the Accidental and the Abstract light is that of cause and effect . The effect , however , is not something quite from its cause ; it is a transformation , or a weaker form of the supposed cause itself . Anything other than the Abstract light ( e.g. , the nature of the illuminated body itself ) can not be the cause of the <p> 102 <p> Accidental light ; since the latter , being merely contingent and consequently capable of being negatived , can be taken away from bodies without affecting their character . If the essence , or nature of the illuminated body , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of disillumination could not have been possible . We can not conceive an inactive cause ( 1 ) . <p> It is now obvious that Shaikh al-Ishraqagrees with the Asharite thinkers in holding that there is no such thing as the Prima Materia of Aristotle ; though he recognises the existence of a necessary negation of Light-Darkness , the object of illumination . He further agrees with them in teaching the relativity of all categories except Substance and Quality . But he corrects their theory of knowledge , in so far as he recognises an active element in human knowledge . Our relation with the objects of our knowledge is not merely a passive relation ; . the individual soul , being itself an illumination , illuminates the object in the act of knowledge . The Universe to him is one great process of active illumination ; but , from a purely intellectual standpoint , this illumination is only a partial expression of the infinitude of the Primal Light , which may illuminate according to other laws not known to us . The categories of thought are infinite ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , from the standpoint of discursive thought , is not far from modern Humanism . <p> 1 Sh.An : fol . It b . <p> 103 <p> Cosmology <p> All that is " not-light " is , what the Ishraqi thinkers call , " Absolute quantity " , or " Absolute matter " . It is only another aspect of the affirmation . of light , and not an independent principle , as the followers of Aristotle erroneously hold . The experimental fact of the transformation of the primary elements into one another points to this fundamental Absolute matter which , with its various degrees of grossness , constitutes the various spheres of material being . The absolute ground of all things , then , is divided into two kinds : ( 1 ) That which is beyond space - the obscure Substance or atoms ( essences of the Asharite ) . ( 2 ) That which is necessarily in space-forms of darkness , e.g. , weight , smell , taste , etc . <p> The combination of these two particularises the Absolute matter . A material body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated by the Abstract light . But what is the cause of the various forms of darkness ? These , like the forms of light , owe their existence to the Abstract light , the different illuminations of which cause diversity in the spheres of being . The forms , which make bodies differ from one another , do not exist in the nature of the Absolute matter . The Absolute and the Absolute matter being identical , if these forms do exist in the essence of the Absolute matter , all bodies would be identical in regard to the <p> 104 <p> forms of darkness . This , however , is contradicted bydaily experience . The cause of the forms of darkness , therefore , is not the Absolute matter . And as the difference of forms can not be assigned to any other cause , it follows that they are due to the various illuminations of the Abstract Light . Forms of light and darkness both owe their existence to the Abstract Light . The third element of a material body - the obscure atom or essence - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . The body as a whole , therefore , is completely dependent on the Primal Light . The whole Universe is really a continuous series of circles of existence , all depending on the original Light . Those nearer to the source receive more illumination than those more distant . All varieties of existence in each circle , and the circles themselves , are illuminated through an infinite number of medium-illuminations , which preserve some forms of existence by the help of " conscious light " ( as in the case of man , animal and plant ) , and some without it ( as in the case of minerals and primary elements ) . The immense panorama of diversity which we call the Universe , is , therefore , a vast shadow of the infinite variety in intensity of direct or indirect illuminations and rays of the Primary Light . Things are , so to speak , fed by their respective illuminations to which they constantly move , with a lover 's passion , in order to drink more and more of the original fountain of Light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different planes of being are as follow : <p> 105 <p> The Plane 1 . The Plane of Intellects -of Primal the parent of the heavens.Light. 2 . The Plane of the Soul. 3 . The Plane of Form . <p> Having briefly indicated the general nature of Being , we now proceed to a more detailed examination of the world-process . All that is not-light is divided into : <p> ( 1 ) Eternal , e. g. , Intellects , Souls of heavenly bodies , heavens , simple elements , time , motion . ( 2 ) Contingent , e.g. , Compounds of various elements . The motion of the heavens is eternal , and makes up the various cycles of the Universe . It is due to the intense longing of the heaven-soul to receive illumination from the source of all light . The matter of which the heavens are constructed is completely free from the operation of chemical processes , incidental to the grosser forms of the not-light . Every heaven has its own matter peculiar to it alone . Likewise the heavens differ from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is explained by the fact that the beloved , or the sustaining <p> 106 <p> illumination , is different in each case . Motion is only an aspect of time . It is the summing up of the elements of time , which , as externalised , is motion . The distinction of past , present , and future is made only for the sake of convenience , and does not exist in the nature of time(1) . We can not conceive the beginning of time ; for the supposed beginning would be a point of time itself . Time and motion , therefore , are both eternal . There are three primordial elements - water , earth , and wind . Fire , according to the Ishraqis , is only burning wind . The combinations of these elements , under various heavenly influences , assume various forms - fluidity , gaseousness , solidity . This transformation of the original elements constitutes the process of " making and un making " which pervades the entire sphere of the not-light , raising the different f orms of existence higher and higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . All the phenomena of nature - rain , clouds , thunder , meteors - are the various workings of this immanent principle of motion , and are explained by the direct or indirect operation of the Primal Light on things , which differ from one another in their capacity of receiving more or less illumination . The Universe , in one word , is a petrified desire ; a crystallised longing after light . But is it eternal ? The Universe is a manifestation of the illuminative Power which constitutes the <p> 1 Sh . An . fol. 34a . <p> 107 <p> essential nature of the Primal Light , In so far , therefore , as it is a manifestation , it is only a dependent being , and consequently not eternal . But in another sense it is eternal . All the different spheres of being exist by the illuminations and rays of the Eternal light . There are some illuminations which are directly eternal ; while there are other fainter ones , the appearance of which depends on the combination of other illuminations and rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sense as the existence of the pre-existing parent illuminations . The existence of colour , for instance , is contingent in comparison to that of the ray , which manifests colour when a dark body is brought before an illuminating body . The Universe , therefore , though contingent as manifestation , is eternal by the eternal character of its source . Those who hold the non-eternity of the Universe argue on the assumption of the possibility of a complete induction . Their argument proceeds in the following manner : <p> ( 1 ) Everyone of the Abyssinians is black ; therefore all Abyssinians are black . ( 2 ) Every motion began at a definite moment ; therefore all motion must begin so . But this mode of argumentation is vicious . It is quite impossible to state the major . One can not collect all the Abyssinians past , present , and future , at one particular moment of time . Such a Universal , therefore , is impossible . Hence from the examination <p> 108 <p> of individual Abyssinians , or particular instances of motion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash to infer that all Abyssinians are black , or all motion had a beginning in time . <p> Psychology <p> Motion and light are not concomitant in the case of bodies of a lower order . A piece of stone , f or instance , though illuminated and hence visible , is not endowed with self-initiated movement . As we rise , however , in the scale of being , we find higher bodies , or organisms in which motion and light are associated together . The abstract illumination finds its best dwelling place in man . But the question arises whether the individual abstract illumination which we call the human soul , did or did not exist before its physical accompaniment . The founder of Ishraqi Philosophy follows Avicenna in connection with this question , and uses the same arguments to show that the individual abstract illuminations can not be held to have pre-existed , as so many units of light . The material categories of one and many can not be applied to the abstract illumination which , in its essential nature , is neither one nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various degrees of illuminational receptivity in its material accompaniments . The relation between the abstract illumination , or soul and body , is not that of cause and effect ; the bond of union between them is love . The body which longs for illumination , receives it through <p> 109 <p> the soul ; since its nature does not permit a direct communication between the source of light and itself . But the soul can not transmit the directly received light to the dark solid body which , considering its attributes , stands on the opposite pole of being . In order to be related to each other , they require a medium between them , something standing midway between light and darkness . This medium is the animal soul - a hot , fine , transparent vapour which has its principal seat in the left cavity of the heart , but also circulates in all parts of the body . It is because of the partial identity of the animal soul with light that , in dark nights , land-animals run towards the burning fire ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful sight of the moon . The ideal of man , therefore , is to rise higher and higher in the scale of being , and to receive more and more illumination which gradually brings complete freedom from the world of forms . But how is this ideal to be realised ? By knowledge and action . It is the transformation of both understanding and will , the union of action and contemplation , that actualises the highest ideal of man . Change your attitude towards the Universe , and adopt the line of conduct necessitated by the change . Let us briefly consider these means of realisation : <p> ( a ) Knowledge . When the Abstract illumination associates itself with a higher organism , it works out its development by the operation of certain faculties - the powers of light , and the powers of darkness . The former <p> 110 <p> are the five external senses , and the five internal senses - sensorium , conception , imagination , understanding , and memory ; the latter are the powers of growth , digestion , etc . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One faculty can be the source of all operations ( 1 ) . " There is only one power in the middle of the brain , though it receives different names from different standpoints . The mind is a unity which , for the sake of convenience , is regarded as multiplicity . The power residing in the middle of the brain must be distinguished from the abstract illumination which constitutes the real essence of man . The philosopher of illumination appears to draw a distinction between the active mind and the essentially inactive soul ; yet he teaches that , in some mysterious way , all the various faculties are connected with the soul . <p> The most original point in his psychology of intellection , however , is his theory of vision ( 2 ) . The ray of light which is supposed to come out of the eye must be either substance or quality . If quality , it can not be transmitted from one substance ( eye ) to another substance ( visible body ) . If , on the other hand , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its inherent nature . Conscious movement would make it an animal perceiving other things , The perceiver in this case wouldbe the ray , not man . if the movement of the ray is an attribute of its nature , there is no reason why its movement should <p> 1 . Sh . An . fol. 57 b.2 . Sh . An . fol. 60 b . <p> 111 <p> be peculiar to one direction , and not to all . The ray of light , therefore , can not be regarded as coming out of the eye . The followers of Aristotle hold that in the process of vision images of objects are printed on the eye . This view is also erroneous ; since images of big things can not be printed on a small space . The truth is that when a thing comes before the eye , an illumination takes place , and the mind sees the object through that illumination . When there is no veil between the object and the normal sight , and the mind is ready to perceive , the act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things . " All vision is illumination ; and we see things in God " . Berkley explained the relativity of our sight-perceptions with a view to show that the ultimate ground of all ideas is God . The Ishraqi Philosopher has the same object in view , though his theory of vision is not so much an explanation of the sight-process as a new way of looking at the fact of vision . <p> Besides sense and reason , however , there is another source of knowledge called " Dhauq " - the inner perception which reveals non-temporal and non-spatial planes of being . The study of philosophy , or the habit of reflecting on pure concepts , combined with the practice of virtue , leads to the upbringing of this mysterious sense , which corroborates and corrects the conclusions of intellect . <p> ( b ) Action . Man as an active being has the following motive powers : <p> 112 <p> ( a ) Reason or the Angelic soul - the source of intelligence , discrimination , and love of knowledge . ( b ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominance , and ambition . <p> ( c ) The animal soul which is the source of lust , hunger and sexual passion . <p> The first leads to wisdom ; the second and third , if controlled by reason , lead respectively to bravery and chastity . The harmonious use of all results in the virtue of justice . The possibility of spiritual progress by virtue , shows that this world is the best possible world . Things as existent are neither good nor bad . It is misuse or limited standpoint that makes them so . Still the fact of evil can not be denied . Evil does exist ; but it is far less in amount than good . It is peculiar only to a part of the world of darkness ; while there are other parts of the Universe which are quite free from the taint of evil . The sceptic who attributes . the existence of evil to the creative agency of God , presupposes resemblance between human and divine action , and does not see that nothing existent is free in his sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creator of evil in the same sense as we regard some forms of human activity as the cause of evil(1) . <p> It is , then , by the union of knowledge and virtue that the soul frees itself from the world of darkness . As we know more and more of the nature of things , we are brought closer and closer to the world of light ; <p> 1 . Sh . An . fol. 92b . <p> 113 <p> and the love of that world becomes more and more intense . The stages of spiritual development are infinite , since the degrees of love are infinite . The principal stages , however , are as follows : ( 1 ) The stage of " I " . In this stage feeling of personality is most predominant , and the spring of human action is generally selfishness . <p> ( 2 ) The stage of " Thou art not Complete absorption in one 's own deep self to the entire forgetfulness of everything external . <p> ( 3 ) The stage of " I am not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ( 4 ) The stage of " Thou art " The absolute negation of " I " , and the affirmation of " Thou " , which means complete resignation to the will of God . ( 5 ) The stage of " Iam not ; and Thou art not " . The complete negation of both the terms of thought - the state of cosmic consciousness . Each stage is marked by more or less intense illuminations , which are accompanied by some indescribable sounds . Death does not put an end to the spiritual progress of the soul . The individual souls , after death , are not unified into one Soul , but continue different from each other in proportion to the illumination they received during their companionship with physical organisms . The Philosopher of illumination anticipates Leibniz 's doctrine of the Identity of Indiscernibles , and holds that no two souls can be completely similar to each other(1) . <p> 1 Sh . An . fol. 82 . <p> 114 <p> When the material machinery which it adopts for the purpose of acquiring gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another body determined by the experiences of the previous life ; and rises higher and higher in the different spheres of being , adopting forms peculiar to those spheres , until it reaches its destination - the state of absolute negation . Some souls probably come back to this world in order to make up their deficiencies ( 1 ) . The doctrine of transmigration can not be proved or disproved from a purely logical standpoint ; though it is a probable hypothesis to account for the future destiny of the soul . All souls are thus constantly journeying towards their common source , which calls back the whole Universe when this journey is over , and starts another cycle of being to reproduce , in almost all respects , the history of the preceding cycles . <p> Such is the philosophy of the great Persian martyr . He is , properly speaking , the first Persian systematiser who recognises the elements of truth in all the aspects of Persian speculation , and skilfully synthesises them in his own system . He is a pantheist in so far as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal existence(2) . To him , unlike some of his Sufi predecessors , the world is something real , and the human soul a distinct individuality . With the orthodox theologian , he maintains that the ultimate cause of every phenomenon , is the Absolute Light <p> 1 . Sh . An . fol. 87 b. 2 . Sh . An . fol. 81 b . <p> 115 <p> whose illumination forms the very essence of the universe . In his psychology he follows Avicenna , but his treatment of this branch of study is more systematic and more empirical . As an ethical philosopher , he is a follower of Aristotle whose doctrine of the mean he explains and illustrates with great thoroughness . Above all he modifies and transforms the traditional Neo-Platonism , into a thoroughly Persian system of thought which , not only approaches Plato , but also spiritualises the old Persian Dualism .. No Persian thinker is more alive to the necessity of explaining all the aspects of objective existence in. reference to his fundamental principles . He constantly appeals to experience , and endeavours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of illumination . In his system objectivity , which was completely swallowed up by the exceedingly subjective character of extreme pantheism , claims its due again , and , having been subjected to a detailed examination , finds a comprehensive explanation . No wonder then that this acute thinker succeeded in founding a system of thought , which has always exercised the greatest fascination over minds - uniting speculation and emotion in perfect harmony . The narrow-mindedness of his contemporaries gave him the title of " Maqtul " ( the killed one ) , signifying that he was not to be regarded as " Shahid " ( Martyr ) ; but succeeding generations of Sufis and philosophers have always given him the profoundest veneration . <p> I may here notice a less spiritual form of the <p> 116 <p> Ishraqi mode of thought . Nasafi(1) describes a phase of Sufi thought which reverted to the old materialistic dualism of Mani . The advocates of this view hold that light and darkness are essential to each other . They are , in reality , two rivers which mix with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diversity of things . The ideal of human action is freedom from the taint of darkness ; and the freedom of light from darkness means the self-consciousness of light as light . <p> 2 . REALITY AS THOUGHT - AL-JILI <p> Al-Jili was born in 767 A.H. , as he himself says in one of his verses , and died in 811 A.H . He was not a prolific writer like Shaikh Muhy al-Din ibn Arabi whose mode of thought seems to have greatly influenced his teaching . He combined in himself poetical imagination and philosophical genius , but his poetry is no more than a vehicle for his mystical and metaphysical doctrines . Among other books he wrote a commentary on Shaikh Muhy al-Din ibn Arabi 's al-Futuhat al-Makkiya , a commentary on Bismillah , and the famous work Insan al-Kamil , ( printed in Cairo ) . <p> Essence pure and simple , he says , is the thing to which names and attributes are given , whether it is existent actually or ideally . The existent is of two species : <p> The Essence of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can express it , for it is beyond all relation and knowledge is relation . The intellect flying through the fathomless empty space pierces through the veil of names and attributes , traverses the vasty sphere of time , enters the domain of the nonexistent and f inds the Essence of Pure Thought to be an existence which is non-existence - a sum of contradictions(1) . It has two ( accidents ) ; eternal life in all past time and eternal life in all future time . It has two ( qualities ) , God and creation . It has two ( definitions ) , uncreatableness and creatableness . It has two names , God and man . It has two faces , the manifested ( this world ) and the unmanifested ( the next world ) . It has two effects , necessity and possibility , It has two points of view ; from the first it is non-existent for itself but existent for what is not itself ; from the second it is existent for itself and non-existent for what is not itself . Name , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the mind , presents it in the imagination and keeps it in the memory . It is the outside or the husk , as it were , of the named ; while the named is the inside or the pith . Some names do not exist in reality but exist in name only as " Anqa " <p> 1 Insan al-Kamil , Vol. 1 , p. 10 . <p> 118 <p> ( a fabulous bird ) . It is a name the object of which does not exist in reality . just as " Anqa " is absolutely non-existent , so God is absolutely present , although He can not be touched and seen . The " ' Anqa " exists only in idea while the object of the name " Allah " exists in reality and can be known like " Anqa " only through its names and attributes . The name is a mirror which reveals all the secrets of the Absolute Being ; it is a light through the agency of which God sees Himself - Al-Jili here approaches the Ismailia view that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand this passage we should bear in mind the three stages of the development of Pure Being , enumerated by him . He holds that the Absolute existence or Pure Being , when it leaves its absoluteness undergoes three stages : - ( 1 ) Oneness . ( 2 ) He-ness. ( 3 ) I-ness . In the first stage there is an absence of all attributes and relations , yet it is called one , and , therefore , oneness marks one step away from the absoluteness . In the second stage Pure Being is set free from all manifestation , while the third stage , I-ness , is nothing but an external manifestation of the He-ness ; or , as Hegel would say , it is the self-diremption of God . This third stage is the sphere of the name Allah ; here the darkness of Pure Being is illuminated , nature comes to the front , the Absolute Being has become conscious . He says further that the name Allah is the stuff of all the perfections of the different phases of Divinity , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pure Being , all that is the result of Divine self-diremption was potentially contained within the titanic grasp of this name which , in the third stage of the development , objectified itself , became a mirror in which God reflected Himself , and thus by its crystallisation dispelled all the gloom of the Absolute Being . In correspondence with these three stages of the absolute development , the perfect man has three stages of spiritual training . But in his case the process of development must be the reverse ; because his is the process of ascent , while the Absolute Being had undergone essentially a process of descent . In the first stage of his spiritual progress he meditates on the name , studies nature on which it is sealed ; in the second stage he steps into the sphere of the Attribute , and in the third stage enters the sphere of the Essence . It is here that he becomes the Perfect Man ; his eye becomes the eye of God , his word the word of God and his life the life of God - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the life of things " . To turn now to the nature of the attribute . His views on this most interesting question are very important , because it is here that his doctrine fundamentally differs from Hindu Idealism . He defines attribute as an agency which gives us a knowledge of the state of things(1) . Elsewhere he says that this distinction of attribute from the underlying reality is <p> 1 . Insan aI-Kamil ; Vol. 1 , p. 22 . <p> 120 <p> tenable only in the sphere of the manifested , because here every attribute is regarded as the other of the reality in which it is supposed to inhere . This otherness is due to the existence of combination and disintegration in the sphere of the manifested . But the distinction is untenable in the domain of the unmanifested , because there is no combination or disintegration there . It should be observed how widely he differs from the advocates of the Doctrine of " Maya " . He believes that the material world has real existence ; it is the outward husk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the less real . The cause of the phenomenal world , according to him , is not a real entity hidden behind the sum of attributes , but it is a conception furnished by the mind so that there may be no difficulty in understanding the material world . Berkeley and Fichte will so far agree with our author , but his view leads him to the most characteristically Hegelian doctrine identity of thought and being . In the thirty-seventh chapter of the second volume of Insan al-Kamil , he clearly says that idea is the stuff of which this universe is made ; thought , idea , notion is the material of the structure of nature . While laying stress on this doctrine he says , " Dost thou not look to thine own belief ? Where is the reality in which the so-called Divine attributes inhere ? It is but the idea " ( 1 ) Hence nature is nothing but a crystallised idea . He gives his hearty assent to the results <p> 1 . Insan al-Kamil , Vol II , p. 26 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , unlike him , he makes this very idea the essence of the Universe . Kant 's Ding an sich to him is a pure nonentity ; there is nothing behind the collection of attributes . The attributes are the real things , the material world is but the objectification of the Absolute Being ; it is the other self of the Absoluteanother which owes its existence to the principle of difference in the nature of the Absolute itself . Nature is the idea of God , a something necessary for His knowledge of Himself . While Hegel calls his doctrine the identity of thought and being , Al-Jili calls it the identity of attribute and reality . It should be noted that the author 's phrase , " world of attributes " , which he uses for the material world is slightly misleading . What he really holds is that the distinction of attribute and reality is merely phenomenal , and does not at all exist in the nature of things . It is useful , because it facilitates our understanding of the world around us , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that Al-Jili recognises the truth of Empirical Idealism only tentatively , and does not admit the absoluteness of the distinction . These remarks should not lead us to understand that Al-Jili does not believe in the objective reality of the thing in itself . He does believe in it , but then he advocates its unity , and says that the material world is the thing in itself ; it is the " other " , the external expression of the thing in itself . The Ding an sich and its external expression or the production of its self-diremption , are really indentical. though we discriminate between them in order to facilitate our understanding of the <p> 122 <p> universe . If they are not identical , he says , how could one manifest the other ? In one word , he means by Ding an sich , the Pure , the Absolute Being , and seeks it through its manifestation or external expression . He says that as long as we do not realise the identity of attribute and reality , the material world or the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine is brought home to us the veil is removed ; we see the Essence itself everywhere , and find that all the attributes are but ourselves . Nature then appears in her true light ; all otherness is removed and we are one with her The aching prick of curiosity ceases , and the inquisitive attitude of our minds in replaced by a state of philosophic calm . To the person who has realised this identity , discoveries of science bring no new information , and religion with her role of supernatural authority has nothing to say . This is the spiritual emancipation . <p> Let us now see how he classifies the different , divine names and attributes which have received expression in nature or crystallised Divinity . His ' classification is as follows . <p> ( 1 ) The names and attributes of God as He is in Himself ( Allah , The One , The Odd , The Light , The Truth , The Pure , The Living ) . ( 2 ) The names and attributes of God as the source of all glory ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) The names and attributes of God as all Perfection ( The Creator , The Benefactor , The First , The Last ) . <p> 123 <p> ( 4 ) The names and attributes of God as all Beauty ( The Uncreatable , The Painter , The Merciful , . The Origin of all ) . Each of these names and attributes has its own particular effect by which it illuminates the soul of the perfect man and Nature . How these illuminations take place , and how they reach the soul is not explained by Al-jili . His silence about these matters throws into more relief the mystical portion of his views and implies the necessity of spiritual Directorship . <p> Before considering Al-Jili 's views of particular Divine Names and Attributes , we should note that his conception of God , implied in the above classification , is very similar to that of Schleiermacher . While the German theologian reduces all the divine attributes to one single attribute of Power , our author sees the danger of advancing a God free from all attributes , yet recognises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that His attributes " are nothing more than views of Him from different human standpoints , the various appearances which the one changeless cause presents to our finite intelligence according as we look at it from different sides of the spiritual landscape ( 1 ) . " In His absolute existence He is beyond the limitation of names and attributes , but when He externalises Himself , when He leaves His absoluteness , when nature is born , names and attributes appear sealed on her very fabric . <p> 1 . Matheson 's Aids to the Study of German Theology , p. 43 . <p> 124 <p> We now proceed to consider what he teaches about particular Divine Names and Attributes . The first Essential Name is Allah ( Divinity ) which means the sum of all the realities of existence with their respective order in that sum . This name is applied to God as the only necessary existence . Divinity being the highest manifestation of Pure Being , the difference between them is that the latter is visible to the eye , but its where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , itself is invisible . By the very fact of her being crystallised divinity , Nature is not the real divinity ; hence Divinity is invisible , and its traces in the form of Nature are visible to the eye . Divinity , as the author illustrates , is water ; nature is crystallised water or ice ; but ice is not water . The Essence is visible to the eye , ( another proof of our author 's Natural Realism or Absolute Idealism ) although all its attributes are not known to us . Even its attributes are not known as they are in themselves , their shadows or effects only are known . For instance , charity itself is unknown , only its effect or the fact of giving to the poor , is known and seen . This is due to the attributes being incorporated in the very nature of the Essence . If the expression of the attributes in its real nature had been possible , its separation from the Essence would have been possible also . But there are some other Essential Names of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oneness marks the first step of Pure Thought from the darkness of Cecity ( the internal or the original Maya of the Vedanta ) to the light <p> 125 <p> of manifestation . Although this movement is not attended with any external manifestations , yet it sums up all of them under its hollow universality . Look at a wall , says the author , you see the whole wall ; but you can not see the individual pieces of the material that contribute to its formation . The wall is a unity - but a unity which comprehends diversity , so Pure Being is a unity but a unity which is the soul diversity . <p> The third movement of the Absolute Being is Simple Oneness - a step attended with external manifestation . The Absolute Oneness is free from all particular names and attributes . The Oneness Simple takes on names and attributes , but there is no distinction between these attributes , one is the essence of the other . Divinity is similar to Simple Oneness , but its names and attributes are distinguished from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third step , or as Hegel would say , Voyage of the Being , has another appellation ( Mercy ) . The First Mercy , the author says , is the evolution of the Universe from Himself and the manifestation of His own self <p> 1 This would seem very much like the idea of the phenomenal Brahma of the Vedanta . The Personal Creator or the Prajipati of the Vedanta makes the third step of the Absolute Being or the Noumenal Brahma . Al-Jili seems to admit two kinds of Brahma--with or without qualities like the Samkara and Badarayana . To him the process of creation is essentially a lowering of the Absolute Thought , which is Asat , in so far as it is absolute , and Sat , in so far as it is manifested and hence limited . Nowithstanding this Absolute Monism , he inclines to a view similar to that of Ramanuja . He seems to admit the reality of the individual soul and seems to imply , unlike Samkara , that Iswara and His worship are necessary even after the attainment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the result of His own self-diremption . Al-Jili makes this point clearer by an instance . He says that nature is frozen water and God is water . The real name of nature is God ( Allah ) ; ice or condensed water is merely a borrowed appellation . Elsewhere he calls water the origin of knowledge , intellect , understanding , thought and idea . This instance leads him to guard against the error of looking upon God as immanent in nature , or running through the sphere of material existence . He says that immanence implies disparity of being ; God is not immanent because He is Himself the existence . Eternal existence is the other self of God , it is the light through which He sees Himself . As the originator of an idea is existent in that idea , so God is present in nature . The difference between God and man , as one may say , is that His ideas materialise themselves , ours do not . It will be remembered here that Hegel would use the same line of argument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute of Mercy is closely connected with the attribute of Providence . He defines it as the sum of all that existence stands in need of . Plants are supplied with water through the force of this name . The natural philosopher would express the same thing differently ; he would speak of the same phenomena as resulting from the activity of a certain force of nature ; Al-Jili would call it a manifestation of Providence ; but , unlike the natural philosopher , <p> 127 <p> he would not advocate the unknowability of that force . He would say that there is nothing behind it , it is the Absolute Being itself . <p> We have now finished all the essential names and attributes of God , and proceed to examine the nature of what existed before all things . The Arabian Prophet , says Al-Jili , was once questioned about the place of God before creation . He said that God , before the creation , existed in " Ama " ( Blindness ) . It is the nature of this Blindness or primal darkness which we now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the word translated into modern phraseology would be " The Unconsciousness " . This single word impresses upon us the foresightedness with which he anticipates metaphysical doctrines of modem Germany . He says that the Unconsciousness is the reality of all realities ; it is the Pure Being without any descending movement ; it is free from the attributes of God and creation ; it does not stand in need of any name or quality , because it is beyond the sphere of relation . It is distinguished from the Absolute Oneness because the latter name is applied to the Pure Being in its process of coming down towards manifestation . It should , however , be remembered that when we speak of the priority of God and posteriority of creation , our words must not be understood as implying time ; for there can be no duration of time or separateness between God and His creation . Time , continuity in space and time , are themselves creations , and how can a piece of creation intervene between God and <p> 128 <p> Hiscreation . Hence our words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this sphere of thought , should not be construed to imply time or space . The real thing is beyond the grasp of human conceptions ; no category of material existence can be applicable to it ; because , as Kant would say , the laws of phenomena can not be spoken of as obtaining in the sphere of noumena . <p> We have already noticed that man in his progress towards perfection has three stages : the first is the meditation of the name which the author calls the illumination of names . He remarks that " When God illuminates a certain man by the light of His names , the man is destroyed under the dazzling splendour of that name ; and " when thou calleth God , the call is responded to by the man " . The effect of this illumination would be , in Schopenhauer 's language , the destruction of the individual will , yet it must not be confounded with physical death , because the individual goes on living and moving like the spinning wheel , as Kapila would say , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the individual cries out in pantheistic mood : - She was I and I was she and there was none to separate us ( 1 ) . " <p> The second stage of the spiritual training is what he calls the illumination of the Attribute . This illumination makes the perfect man receive the attributes of God in their real nature in proportion to the power of receptivity possessed by him - a fact <p> 1 . Insan al Kamil , Vol . I , p.40 . <p> 129 <p> which classifies men according to the magnitude of this light resulting from the illumination . Some men receive illumination from the divine attribute of Life , and thus participate in the soul of the Universe . The effect of this light is soaring in the air , walking on water , changing the magnitude of things ( as Christ so often did ) . In this wise the perfect man receives illumination from all the Divine attributes , crosses the sphere of the name and the attribute , and steps into the domain of the Essence - Absolute Existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being , when it leaves its absoluteness , has three voyages to undergo , each voyage being a process of particularisation of the bare universality of the Absolute Essence . Each of these three movements appears under a new Essential Name which has its own peculiar illuminating . effect upon the human soul , Here is the end of our author 's spiritual ethics ; man has become perfect , he has amalgamated himself with the Absolute Being , or has learnt what Hegel calls The Absolute Philosophy . " He becomes the paragon of perfection , the object of worship , the preserver of the Universe ( 1 ) " . He is the point where Man-ness and God-ness become one , and result in the birth of the god-man . <p> How the perfect man reaches this height of spiritual development , the author does not tell us ; . but he says that at every stage he has a peculiar experience in which there is not even a trace of doubt or agitation . The instrument of this experience <p> 1 Insan at-Kamil , Vol. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Qalb ( heart ) , a word very difficult of definition . He gives a very mystical diagram of the Qalb , and explains it by saying that it is the eye which sees the names , the attributes and the Absolute Being successively . It owes its existence to a mysterious combination of soul and mind ; and becomes by its very nature the organ for the recognition of the ultimate realities of existence . All that the " heart " , or the source of what the Vedanta calls the Higher Knowledge , reveals , is not seen by the individual as something separate from and heterogeneous to himself ; what is shown to him through this agency is his own reality , his own deep being . This characteristic of the agency differentiates it from the intellect , the object of which is always different and . separate from the individual exercising that faculty . But the spiritual experience , according to the Sufis of this school , is not permanent ; moments of spiritual vision , says Matthew Arnold(1) , can not be at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of his own being , who has realised himself as . god-man ; but when that particular spiritual realisation . is over , man is man and God is God . Had the experience been permanent , a great moral force would have been lost and society overturned . <p> Let us now sum up Al-Jili 's Doctrine of the Trinity . We have seen the three movements of the Absolute Being , or the first three categories of Pure <p> 1 . " We can not kindle when we will . The fire which in the heart resides " <p> 131 <p> Being ; we have also seen that the third movement is , attended with external manifestation , which is the self-diremption of the Essence into God and man .. This separation makes a gap which is filled by theperfect man , who shares in both the Divine and the human attributes . He holds that the perfect man is the preserver of the Universe ; hence in his view , , the appearance of the perfect man is a necessary condition for the continuation of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the god-man , the Absolute Being which has left its absoluteness , returns into itself ; and , but for the god-man , it could not have done so ; for then there would have been no nature , and consequently no light through which God could have seen Himself . The light through the agency of which God sees Himself is due to the principle of difference in the nature of the Absolute Being itself . He recognises this principle in the following verses : <p> If you say that God is one , you are right ; <p> but if you say that He is two , this is also true . If you say no , but He is three , you are right , forthis is the real nature of man. ( 1 ) The perfect man , then , is the joining link . On the one hand he receives illumination from all the Essential names , on the other hand all Divine attributes reappear in him . These attributes are : <p> 1 . Independent life or existence . <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 132 <p> 2 . Knowledge which is a form of life , as he proves from a verse from the Qur'an , 3 . Will - the principle of particularisation , or the manifestation of Being . He defines it as the illumination of the knowledge of God according to the requirements of the Essence ; hence it is a particular form of knowledge . It has nine manifestations , all of which are different names for love ; the last is the love in which the lover and the beloved , the knower and the known merge into each other , and become identical . This form of love , he says , is the Absolute Essence ; as Christianity teaches , God is love . He guards here , against the error of looking upon the individual act of will as uncaused . Only the act of the universal will is uncaused ; hence he implies the Hegelian Doctrine of Freedom , and holds that the acts of man are both free and determined . 4 . Power , which expresses itself in self-diremption , i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position that the Universe existed before the creation in the knowledge of God . He says , this would imply that God did not create it out of nothing , and holds that the Universe , before its existence as an idea , existed in the self of God . <p> 5 . The word or the reflected being . Every possibility is the word of God ; hence nature is the materialisation of the word of God . It has different names - the tangible word , the sum of the realities of man , the arrangement of the Divinity , the spread of <p> 133 <p> Oneness , the expression of the Unknown , the phases of Beauty , the trace of names and attributes , and the object of God 's knowledge . 6 . The Power of hearing the inaudible . 7 . The Power of seeing the invisible . 8 . Beauty - that which seems least beautiful in nature ( the reflected beauty ) is in its real existence , beauty . Evil is only relative , it has no real existence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beauty in its intensity . 10 . Perfection , which is the unknowable essence of God and therefore Unlimited and Infinite . <p> 134 <p> CHAPTER VI <p> LATER PERSIAN THOUGHT <p> Under the rude Tartar invaders of Persia , who , could have no sympathy with independent thought , there could be no progress of ideas . Sufiism , owing to its association with religion , went on systematising old and evolving new ideas . But philosophy properwas distasteful to the Tartar . Even the development of Islamic law suffered a check ; since the Hanafite law was the acme of human reason to the Tartar , , and further subtleties of legal interpretation were disagreeable to his brain . Old schools of thought lost their solidarity , and many thinkers left their native country to find more favourable conditions elsewhere . In the 16th Century we find Persian Aristotelians - Dastur Isfahani , Hir Bud , Munir and Kamran - travelling in India . where the Emperor Akbar was drawing upon Zoroastrianism to form a new faith for himself and his courtiers , who were mostly Persians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persia until the 17th Century , when the acute Mulla Sadra of Shiraz upheld his philosophical system . with all the vigour of his powerful logic . With Mulla Sadra Reality is all things , yet is none of them , and true knowledge consists in the identity of the subject and the object . De Gobineau thinks <p> 135 <p> that the philosophy of Sadra is a mere revival of Avicennaism . He , however , ignores the fact that Mulla Sadra 's doctrine of the identity of subject and object constitutes the final step which the Persian intellect took towards complete monism . It is , moreover , the Philosophy of Sadra which is the source of the metaphysics of early Babism . But the movement towards Platonism is best illustrated in Mulla Hadi of Sabzwar , who flourished in the 18th Century , and is believed by his countrymen to be the greatest of modern Persian thinkers . As a specimen of comparatively recent Persian speculation , I may briefly notice here the views of this great . thinker , as set forth in his Asrar al-Hikam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his philosophical teaching reveals three fundamental conceptions which are indissolubly associated with the Post-Islamic Persian thought : <p> 1 . The idea of the Absolute Unity of the Real which is described as " Light " . <p> 2 . The idea of evolution which is dimly visible in Zoroaster 's doctrine of the destiny of the human soul , and receives further expansion and systematisation by Persian Neo-Platonists and Sufi thinkers . <p> 3 . The idea of a medium between the Absolute Real and the not-Real . <p> It is highly interesting to note how the Persian mind gradually got rid of the Emanation theory of Neo-Platonism , and reached a purer notion of Plato 's <p> 136 <p> Philosophy . The Arab Muhammadans of Spain , by a similar process of elimination , reached through the same medium ( Neo-Platonism ) a truer conception of the Philosophy of Aristotle-a fact which illustrates the genius of the two races . Lewes , in his Biographical History of Philosophy , remarks that the Arabs eagerly took up the study of Aristotle , simply because Plato was not presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Arab genius was thoroughly practical ; hence Plato 's philosophy would have been distasteful to them even if it had been presented in its true light . Of the systems of Greek philosophy , Neo-Platonism , I believe , was the only one which was presented in its completeness to the Muslim world ; yet patient critical research led the Arab from Plotinus to Aristotle , and the Persian to Plato . This is singularly illustrated in the Philosophy of Mulla Hadi , who recognises no Emanations , and approaches the Platonic conception of the Real . He illustrates , moreover , how philosophical speculation in Persia , as in all countries where Physical Science either does not exist or is not studied , is finally absorbed by religion . The " Essence " , i.e. , the metaphysical cause as distinguished from the scientific cause , which means the sum of antecedent conditions , must gradually be transformed into " Personal Will " ( cause , in a religious sense ) in the absence of any other notion of cause . And this is , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . <p> 137 <p> Let us now turn to Mulla Hadi 's system o thought . He teaches that Reason has two aspects ( a ) Theoretical , the object of which is Philosophy and Mathematics ; ( b ) Practical , the object of which is Domestic Economy , Politics , etc . Philosophy proper comprises the knowledge of the beginning of things , the end of things , and the knowledge of the Self . It also includes the knowledge of the law of God - which is identical with religion . In order to understand the origin of things , we should subject to a searching analysis the various phenomena of the Universe . Such an analysis reveals that there are three original principles(1) . <p> 1 ) The Real-Light . <p> 2 ) The Shadow . <p> 3 ) The not-Real - Darkness . <p> The Real is absolute , and necessary as distinguished from the " Shadow " , which is relative and contingent . In its nature it is absolutely good ; and the proposition , that it is good , is self-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are actualised by the Real , are open to both existence or nonexistence , and the possibilities of their existence or non-existence are exactly equal . It , therefore , follows that the Real which actualises the potential is notitself non-existence ; since non-existence operating on non-existence can not produce actuality(3) . Mulla Hadi , in his conception of the Real as the <p> 1 . Asrar al-Hikam : p. 6.2 . Ibid. p. 8.3 . Ibid. p. 8 . <p> 138 <p> operator , modifies Plato 's statical conception of the Universe , and , following Aristotle , looks upon his Real as the immovable source and the object of all motion . " All things in the Universe " , he says , " love perfection , and are moving towards their final ends - minerals towards vegetables , vegetables towards animals , and animals towards man . And observe how man passes through all these stages in the mother 's womb(1) . " The mover as mover is either the source or the object of motion or both . In any case the mover must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all movers must be themselves movable , leads to infinite regress - which must stop at the immovable mover , the source and the final object of all motion . The Real , moreover , is a pure unity ; f or if there is a plurality of Reals , one would limit the other . The Real as creator also can not be conceived as more than one ; since a plurality of creators would mean a plurality of worlds which must be circular touching one another , and this again implies vacuum which is impossible(2) . Regarded as an essence , therefore , the Real is one . But it is also many , from a different standpoint . It is life , power , love ; though we can not say that these qualities inhere in it - they are it , and it is them . Unity does not mean oneness , its essence consists in the " dropping of all relations " . Unlike the Sufis and other thinkers , Mulla Hadi holds and tries to show <p> 1 . Asrar al- Hikam : p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplicity is not inconsistent with belief in unity ; since the visible " many " is nothing more than a manifestation of the names and attributes of the Real . These attributes are the various forms of " Knowledge " which constitutes the very essence of the Real . To speak , however , of the attributes of the Real is only a verbal convenience ; since " defining , the Real is applying the category of number to it " - an absurd process which endeavours to bring the unrelated into the sphere of the related . The Universe , with all its variety , is the shadow of the various names and attributes of the Real or the Absolute Light . It is Reality unfolded , the " Be " , or the word of Light(1) . Visible multiplicity is the illumination of . Darkness , or the actualisation of Nothing . Things are different because we see them , as it were , through glasses of different colours the Ideas . In this connection Hadi approvingly quotes the poet Jami who has given the most beautiful poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be thus translated : <p> " The ideas are glasses of various colours in which the Sun of Reality reflects itself , and makes itself visible through them according as they are red , yellow or blue(2) . " <p> In his Psychology be mostly follows Avicenna , but his treatment of the subject is more thorough and systematic . He classifies the soul in the following manner : <p> The external senses are taste , touch , smell , hearing and sight . The sound exists outside the ear , and not inside as some thinkers have held . For if it does not exist outside the ear , it is not possible to perceive its direction and distance . Hearing and sight . are superior to other senses , and sight is superior to hearing ; since : <p> ( 1 ) The eye can perceive distant things . ( 2 ) Its perception is light , which is the best of all <p> ( 3 ) The construction of the eye is more complicated and delicate than that of the ear . ( 4 ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of hearing resemble non , existence . <p> The internal sensesare as follow : ( 1 ) The Common Sense - the tablet of the mind.It is like the Prime Minister of the mind sending out <p> 141 <p> five spies ( external senses ) to bring in news from the external world . When we say " this white thing is sweet " , we perceive whiteness and sweetness by sight and taste , respectively , but that both the attributes exist in the same thing is decided by the Common Sense . The line made by a falling drop , so far as the eye is concerned , is nothing but the drop . But what is the line which we see ? To account for such a phenomenon , says Hadi , it is necessary to postulate another sense which perceives the lengthening of the falling drop into a line . ( 2 ) The faculty which preserves the perceptions of the Common Sense - images and not ideas like the memory . The judgment that whiteness and sweetness exist in the same thing is completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve the image of the subject , Common Sense can not perceive the predicate. ( 3 ) The power which perceives individual ideas sheep thinks of the enmity of the wolf , and runs away from him . Some forms of life lack this power , e.g. , the moth which hurls itself against the candle-flame. ( 4 ) Memory - the preserver of ideas . ( 5 ) The power of combining images and ideas , , e.g. , the winged man . When this faculty works under the guidance of the power which perceives individual ideas , it is called Imagination ; when it works under the control of Intellect , it is called Conception . <p> But it is the spirit which distinguishes man from , other animals . This essence of humanity is a <p> 142 <p> " unity " , not oneness It perceives the Universal by itself , and the particular through the external and the internal senses . It is the shadow of the Absolute Light , and like it manifests itself in various ways - comprehending multiplicity in its unity . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former is non-temporal and non-spatial ; hence it is changeless , and has the power of judging the visible multiplicity . In sleep the spirit uses the " ideal body " which functions like the physical body ; in waking life it uses the ordinary physical body . It follows , therefore , that the spirit stands in need of neither , and uses both at will . Hadl does not follow Plato in his doctrine of transmigration , the different forms of which he refutes at length . The spirit to him is immortal , and reaches its original home - Absolute Light - by the gradual perfection of its faculties . The various stages of the development of reason are as follows : <p> ( a ) Theoretical or Pure Reason <p> Ist Potential Reason . <p> 2nd Perception of self-evident propositions . <p> 3rd Actual Reason . <p> 4th Perception of universal concepts . <p> ( b ) Practical Reason <p> Ist External Purification . <p> 2nd Internal Purification . <p> 3rd Formation of various habits . 4th Union with God . <p> Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally shares in the eternity of the <p> 143 <p> Absolute Light by losing itself in its universality . " In itself non-existent , but existent in the eternal Friend : how wonderful that it is and is not at the same time . " But is the spirit free to choose its course ? Hadi criticises the Rationalists for their setting up man as an independent creator of evil , and accuses them of what he calls " veiled dualism " . He holds that every object has two sides bright " side , and " dark " side . Things are combinations of light and darkness . All good flows from the side of light ; , evil proceeds from darkness . Man , therefore , is both free and determined . <p> But all the various lines of Persian thought once more find a synthesis in that great religious movement of Modern Persia - Babism or Bahaism , which began as a Shiah sect , with Mirza Ali Muhammad Bab of Shiraz ( b. 1820 ) , and became less and less Islamic in character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosophy of this wonderful sect must be sought in the Shiahsect of the Shaikhis , the founder of which , Shaikh Ahmad , was an enthusiastic student of Mulla Sadra 's Philosophy , on which he hadwritten several commentaries . This sect differed from the ordinary Shiahs in holding that belief in an ever present Medium between the absent Imam ( the 12th Head of the Church , whose manifestation is anxiously expected by the Shiahs ) , and the Church is a fundamental principle of the Shi'ah religion . Shaikh Ahmad claimed to be such a Medium ; and when , after the death of the second <p> 144 <p> Shaikhi Medium - Haji Kazim - the Shaikhis were anxiously expecting the manifestation of the new Medium , Mirza Ali Muhammad Bab , who had attended the lectures of Haji Kazim at Karbala , proclaimed himself the expected Medium , and many Shaikhis accepted him . <p> The young Persian seer looks upon Reality as an essence which brooks no distinction of substance and attribute . The first bounty or self-expansion of the Ultimate Essence , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known " , the " known " is the essence of " knowledge " ; " knowledge " is " will " ; and " will " is " love " . Thus from Mulla Sadra 's identity of the known and the knower , he passes to his conception of the Real as Will and Love . This Primal Love , which he regards as the essence of the Real , is the cause of the manifestation of the Universe which is nothing more than the self-expansion of Love . The word creation , with him , does not mean creation out of nothing ; since , as the Shaikhis maintain , the word , creator is not peculiarly applicable to God alone . The Quranic verse , that " God is the best of creators(1) " , implies that there are other self-manifesting beings like God . <p> After the execution of Ali Muhammad Bab , Bahaullah , one of his principal disciples who were collectively called " The First Unity " , took up the mission , and proclaimed himself the originator of the new dispensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. 14 . <p> 145 <p> tion the Bab had foretold . He freed the doctrine of his master from its literalistic mysticism , and presented it in a more perfected and systematised form The Absolute Reality , according to him , is not a person ; it is an eternal living Essence , to which we apply the epithets Truth and Love only because these are the highest conceptions known to us . The Living , Essence manifests itself through the Universe with the object of creating in itself atoms or centres of consciousness , which as Dr. McTaggart would say , constitute a further determination of the Hegelian Absolute . In each of these undifferentiated , simple centres of consciousness , there is hidden a ray of the Absolute Light itself , and the perfection of the spirit consists in gradually actualising , by contact with the individualising principle - matter , its emotional and intellectual possibilities , and thus discovering its own deep being - the ray of eternal Love which is concealed by its union with consciousness . The essence of man , therefore , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love - the source of all impulse to noble and unselfish action , which constitutes the real man . The influence of Mulla Sadra 's doctrine of the incorporeality of Imagination is here apparent . Reason , which stands higher than Imagination in the scale of evolution , is not a necessary condition , according to Mulla Sadra , of immortality . In all forms of life there is an immortal spiritual part , the ray of Eternal Love , which has no necessary connection with self-consciousness or reason , and survives after the death of the body . Salvation , then , which to <p> 146 <p> Buddha consists in the starving out of the mind-atoms by extinguishing desire , to Bahaullah lies in the discovery of the essence of love which is hidden in the atoms of consciousness themselves(1) . Both , however , agree that after death thoughts and characters of men remain , subject to other forces of a similar character , in the spiritual world , waiting for another opportunity to find a suitable physical accompaniment in order to continue the process of discovery ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conception of Love is higher than the conception of Will . Schopenhauer conceived reality as Will which was driven to objectification by a sinful bent eternally existing in its nature . Love or Will , according to both , is present in every atom of life ; but the cause of its being there is the joy of self-expansion in the one case , and the inexplicable evil inclination in the other . But Schopenhauer postulates certain temporal ideas in order to account for the objectification of the Primordial Will ; Bahaullah , as far as I can see , does not explain the principle according to which the self-manifestation of the Eternal Love is realised in the Universe . <p> 1 . See Phelp 's Abbas Effendi , chapter , " Philosophy and Psychology " . <p> 147 <p> CONCLUSION <p> Let us now briefly sum up the results of our survey . We have seen that the Persian mind had to struggle against two different kinds of Dualism pre-Islamic Magian Dualism , and post-Islamic Greek Dualism , though the fundamental problem of the diversity of things remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkers is thoroughly objective , and hence the results of their intellectual efforts are more or less materialistic . The Pre-Islamic thinkers , however , clearly perceived that the original Principle must be dynamically conceivedWith Zoroaster both the primary spirits are " active " , with Mani the principle of Light is passive , and the principle of Darkness is aggressive . But their analysis of the various elements which constitute the Universe is ridiculously meagre ; their conception of the Universe is most defective on its statical side . There are , therefore , two weak points in their systems : <p> 1 . Naked Dualism . <p> 2 . Lack of analysis . <p> The first was remedied by Islam ; the second by the introduction of Greek Philosophy . The advent of Islam and the study of Greek philosophy , however , checked the indigenous tendency towards <p> 148 <p> monistic thought ; but these two forces contributed to change the objective attitude characteristic of early thinkers , and aroused the slumbering subjectivity , which eventually reached its climax in the extreme Pantheism of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dualism between God and matter , . by reducing matter to a mere confused perception of the spirit ; the Asharite denied it altogether , and maintained a thorough-going Idealism . The followers of Aristotle continued to stick to their master 's PrimaMateria ; the Sufis looked upon the material universe as a mere illusion , or a necessary " other " , for the self-knowledge of God . It can , however , be safely stated that with the Asharite Idealism , the Persian mind got over the foreign dualism of God and matter , , and , fortified with new philosophical ideas , returned to the old dualism of light and darkness . The Shaikh-al-Ishraq combines the objective attitude of Pre-Islamic Persian thinkers with the subjective attitude of his immediate predecessors , and restates the Dualism of Zoroaster in a much more philosophical and spiritualised form . His system recognises the claims of both the subject and the object . But all these monistic systems of thought were met by the Pluralism of Wahid Mahmud , who taught that reality is not one , but many - primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to perfection by passing through an ascending scale of forms . The reaction of Wahid Mahmud was , however , , an ephemeral phenomenon . The later Sufis as well <p> 149 <p> as philosophers proper gradually transformed or abandoned the Neo-Platonic theory of Emanation , and in later thinkers we see a movement through Neo-Platonism towards real Platonism , which is approached by Mulla Hadi 's Philosophy . But pure speculation and dreamy mysticism undergo a powerful check in Babism which , unmindful of persecution , synthesises all the inherited philosophical and religious tendencies , and rouses the spirit to a consciousness , of the stern reality of things . Though extremely cosmopolitan and hence quite unpatriotic in character , it has yet had a great influence over the Persian mind . The unmystic character and the practical tone of Babism may have been a remote cause the progress , of recent political reform in Persia . 
@@40786682 @786682/ <p> Reviewed by David Silverman ( Department of History , George Washington University ) Published on H-AmIndian ( May , 2007 ) <p> In the recent burst of scholarship about Native peoples and colonial empires in the context of the Seven Years ' War , Colin Calloway 's Scratch of a Pen stands out as the book most suitable for undergraduate use . Scholarly interest in this topic revived in the 1990s with studies by Richard White , Gregory Evans Dowd , Michael N. McConnell , Ian K. Steele , and Eric Hinderaker , then extended more recently to Fred Anderson 's epic Crucible of War and Dowd 's War under Heaven. 1 The general public has been curious about this subject too , as evidenced by recent PBS and History Channel programs , a superb museum exhibit at the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania , and a new volume by Anderson that pares down his voluminous earlier study. 2 Suffice it to say , then , Calloway 's book arrives just as the scholarly wave is cresting . Indeed , his book offers little new in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous works , including The American Revolution in Indian Country ( 1995 ) , New Worlds for All ( 1997 ) , and One Vast Winter Count ( 2003 ) , he is a master of synthesis , remarkably capable of placing specialized studies in a broad framework suitable for an educated reading public . Scratch of a Pen might be the best example of this talent to date , for in a brisk 171 pages of text , Calloway masterfully demonstrates how the 1763 Treaty of Paris " set people and events in motion " across almost the entire North American continent ( p. 15 ) . Scratch of a Pen is particularly successful at placing Indian country as far west as the Great Plains in a rich comparative colonial context . Readers are sure to finish this book thoroughly convinced that 1763 was one of the pivotal moments in American history . <p> This volume showcases Calloway 's flair for narrating panoramic tours of multi-ethnic America . From the opening chapter 's snapshot survey of North America in 1763 , Scratch of a Pen traverses sea lanes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the peoples who shaped and were shaped by empire , including those living in and around Native villages , rather than just those along the Atlantic rim . This approach creates a powerfully instructive kaleidoscopic effect . Oscillating between Johnson Hall and Whitehall , Vincennes and Versailles , will give students a newfound appreciation for the spectrum of North America 's peoples , the hybridity and interdependence of many of their communities , and the contested nature and even absence of imperial authority across huge swaths of the interior . If only our outdated maps that attribute this territory to one or another European power would follow suit . <p> Calloway sustains this theme as he discusses the vast , tangled movement of peoples in response to the Treaty of Paris . The most familiar cast of characters are " backcountry " colonists who streamed into greater Appalachia once the French threat was gone . Many of them , as recent scholarship has emphasized , carried vicious hatreds of Native people after experiencing years of back-and-forth atrocities . Joining them were tens of thousand of Scots , Irish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fled home in such numbers that imperial authorities feared the northern parts of Britain proper would become empty . Indians had an even stronger reaction to the arrival of these groups in America . Colonists ' determination to wrest away Indian land for their own use turned the Ohio country into a bloody ground of racialized terror well into the nineteenth century . <p> Another notable characteristic of Scratch of a Pen is its labeling of Pontiac 's War as the " First War of Independence . " In a chapter-length treatment of the event , Calloway suggests that Indians in the Ohio River Valley and Great Lakes region rose up against Britain for some of the same reasons as the thirteen colonies : in both cases , London wanted to reduce the costs of governance over its now massive claims after running up staggering debt during the Seven Years ' War , while at the same time strengthening its rule over peoples unaccustomed to vigorous imperial oversight . In the provinces , this new approach involved Parliament passing taxes that colonists believed violated their rights as Englishmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly , and revoking political privileges that colonial assemblies considered prerogatives . In Indian country , it involved treating Indians who considered themselves independent as conquered " subjects . " No sooner had the British taken over French posts in the Great Lakes region and Ohio River Valley , then they halted gifts to Native leaders , restricted trade in powder and shot , and appointed military men with an overt contempt for so-called savages to conduct sensitive Indian diplomacy . This ham-handed policy , combined with the inability of the British to restrain the throngs of Indian-hating colonists who streamed into Appalachia , left Indians none too pleased with the fleur-de-lis ' replacement by the Union Jack . Native peoples near Detroit , such as the Ottawas , Wyandots , Ojibwas , and Potawatomis , expected the British to fulfill the traditional French role of " father " by arbitrating Indian disputes , handing out generous gifts , subsidizing the costs of trade goods , and treating Native people with respect , including adhering to their protocols . Indians further east , such as the Delawares , Shawnees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincials to honor the boundaries of Native lands . The British failed in all of these respects , and the Indians , inspired by the Nativist preaching of the Delaware Neolin and the militant calls of the Ottawa Pontiac , responded by placing almost all of Britain 's western posts under attack . Though some Indians fought to convince the French to return to the pays d'en haut , and others , in lieu of that , to convince the British to act like the French , the Natives ' overriding goal " was to keep their country independent of either " ( p. 49 ) . That hope grew increasingly dim after 1763 , but , with British passage of the Proclamation Line , which placed colonial purchases of Indian land under strict imperial oversight , many Natives believed they had achieved something of a victory . They could see that , more than ever before , future relations with colonial Americans were going to center on negotiations for land . <p> What is missing from Scratch of a Pen is almost as refreshing as what is included . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the imperial crises that produced the Revolution , writing that " the British government in 1763 began to impose order , controls , and limits on its colonies at the very time when colonists hoped for increased freedom , opportunities , and expansion " ( p. 11 ) . Yet he dedicates little space to that old chestnut in favor of developments that directly involved or affected Native people , or that Native people influenced . In his telling , the Revolutionary crisis emerged not only from Parliament 's attempts to reduce its national debt from the Seven Years ' War and to make the colonies more responsive to imperial directives , particularly in wartime , but from its unwillingness to allow these problems to fester any longer after enduring the additional expenses of fighting Pontiac 's War and witnessing the ongoing provocations of Indian-hating settlers moving into Indian country . Britain 's determination to address its " Indian problem " by raising revenue from colonists , controlling diplomacy , trade , and westward expansion , and maintaining a standing army in America that could address Indian or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a determinative role in the onset of the thirteen colonies ' War for Independence . <p> In the end , Scratch of a Pen restores contingency to this critical historical moment . It is easy to assume that the colonies ' independence and the Indians ' dispossession was inevitable following the Treaty of Paris . Population figures alone suggested as much , for more migrants ( free and enslaved ) entered the British colonies from 1760 to 1775 than the total Indian population east of the Mississippi , and Britain showed little capacity from keeping these newcomers and their forerunners from seizing Indian land and throwing off imperial authority . Yet when we restrict our chronological vision and expand our geographic and thematic horizons , as Calloway has done here , we see how difficult it was to predict the future in 1763 . Britain and Spain had acquired vast new inland American empires , yet Indians and even Frenchmen still held the balance of power in these places . War , disease , diplomacy , and opportunity , were still capable of unleashing seismic shifts of population and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very much works-in-progress . Scratch of a Pen deserves a wide readership and loud praise for reminding us of the many possibilities in what was unquestionably a time of reckoning . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

@@40786683 @786683/ <p> Since the 1960s , a decade during which Latin American Studies underwent dramatic consolidation and diversification , a growing number of works of political and intellectual history have emerged which focus on theories of Latin American development in the context of the overall dynamics of inter-American relations.1 This trend has been paralleled by an interest in the role of perceptions and values in the formulation and execution of U.S. policy in the Americas , the study of U.S. attitudes toward Latin America , and an explicit focus on the cultural aspects of inter-American relations.2 A recent study by James William Park , a San Diego Community College historian , can be located at the crossroads of these trends . His new book is an examination of North American perspectives on ' underdevelopment ' in Latin America between 1870 and 1965 . Park makes clear at the outset that he seeks " to identify the salient interpretations of Latin American underdevelopment , trace their evolution and relate them to the emergence in the 1960s of conflicting theories of development " ( Park , 1995 , p. 6 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent and enduring pattern " of North American " disdain toward the peoples and cultures of Latin America " which flowed from " ( i ) gnorance , misinformation , an ethnocentric perspective , and racial bias " . This pattern of disdain , which explained the lack of ' progress ' in Latin America in terms of climate , race and the Black Legend , " underwent some modification " with the increasing professionalization of the study of Latin America by the 1920s and the relative undermining of North American self-regard brought on by the Depression of the 1930s . However , it was only following the end of the Second World War that what Park calls the " traditional interpretation " was superseded by " more-complex analyses " ( Park , 1995 , p. 4 ) . <p> Park provides a very useful overview of shifting U.S. perspectives towards Latin American ' underdevelopment ' from 1870 to the 1960s , and of the cultural antecedents of modernization theory . At the same time , this review questions the book 's analytical framework and the interpretation of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alliance for Progress . ( I should note at the outset that I am the author of a new book which covers somewhat similar terrain , but does so from a very different politico-intellectual position ) . A major weakness of Park 's book is its overarching assumption that greater contact between North and South , and more information about Latin America can , or should , lead to increased understanding and sympathy throughout the Americas . For example , at the end of his book he suggests that , ethnocentrism has " hindered a fair-minded assessment of the peoples and cultures of Latin America " for many years , but is confident that the " gradual spread " of a " multi-cultural perspective " from the 1960s onwards " may further constrain the ethnocentric influence of U.S. attitudes toward foreign cultures " ( Park , 1995. p. 236 ) . More specifically , his analysis of the professionalization of the study of Latin America clearly assumes that the appearance of a growing number of ' specialists ' has had a beneficial impact on U.S. perspectives , influencing official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words , more " balanced " and helping North Americans pay more attention to what he calls " the Latin American point of view " ( Park , 1995 , p. 4 ) . The rise and growth of the professional study of Latin America has certainly been part of a wider increase in the quantity and sophistication of ' information ' about Latin America . However , the professional study of Latin America has never been as autonomous from official concerns and commentary as Park 's approach implies ( particularly up to the 1960s which is the period covered in his book ) and Latin American studies as a whole remains embedded in the projection of U.S. power in the Americas . Nevertheless , Park eschews the " more-complex issue " of the relationship between North American " perceptions " of Latin America and " the formulation of U.S. policy " ( Park , 1995 , p. 4 ) , implying that it is possible to talk about U.S. perspectives on ' underdevelopment ' in Latin America without engaging with the " complex " relationship between North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book rests on the assumption that there need not be any serious conflict of interest between the governments and peoples of the U.S. and of Latin America , and that the Americas as a whole can ' develop ' in the context of existing inter-American power relations . This liberal Pan American conception of ' progress ' and an avoidance of the whole question of power relations puts serious limits on the overall analysis which is offered . It is very hard for this reviewer to see how any effort to understand U.S. perspectives on ' development ' in Latin America , can avoid the power relations which have shaped the history of inter-American relations and the way in which North American knowledge about ' underdevelopment ' in Latin America has been constantly reproduced in the context of unequal power relations . There is little or no exploration in Park 's work of the way in which the various historical and contemporary explanations for ' underdevelopment ' in Latin America serve not so much as factual observations but as elements in a wider series of discourses via which ' Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sees the history of U.S. perspectives on ' underdevelopment ' in Latin America as a history of the uneven , but gradual , increase in knowledge and understanding this review starts from the premise that the dominant North American perspectives on Latin America have served , and continue to serve , primarily to complement inter-American power relations and elite efforts to manage the disruptive and uneven process of capitalist development in the Americas . Having established Park 's overall perspective and the key elements of my critique , the following review article will be devoted to a more detailed summary and evaluation of ' Latin American Underdevelopment ' . <p> Taking the U.S. controversy over the annexation of the Dominican Republic as his starting point , Park emphasized the " absence of solid information " and the way in which " scanty knowledge " was filtered through " distortions imposed by racism and ethnocentrism " ( Park , 1995. pp. 23-24 ) . Before 1870 , and for many years after , the " common portrait " of Latin America which emanated from North America rested on the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of inferior , mixed breeds perpetuating the nonproductive ways of the colonial era and stagnating in tropical languor amid undeveloped abundance " ( Park , 1995. pp. 32-33 ) . By the beginning of the twentieth century , the U.S. image of Latin America , flowed from an " intellectual context " which rested on a " prideful awareness of territorial and economic expansion together with rising nationalism , Anglo-Saxon ' racial ' pride , Social Darwinism , and a sense of mission and destiny " ( Park , 1995. p. 46 ) . The U.S. was clearly a rising " world power " by 1900 , at the same time as Latin America was seen to be trapped in a condition of " turbulent backwardness " ; however , in the context of limited U.S. " expertise " on Latin America , there appeared to be " little concern over this great disparity " , and Latin American ' backwardness ' was generally perceived in North America as if " it were the natural order of things " . He goes on to note that the dramatic increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn of the century and the beginning of the 1920s encouraged considerable increase in " information " ; however , the " information " was of a poor quality and the perspectives on ' development ' did not alter significantly between the turn of the century and the 1920s ( Park , 1995. pp. 62-63 ) .5 Park 's analysis fails to draw out the possibility of a connection between " greater hemispheric intrusion " on the part of the U.S. and the continuation and even strengthening of negative North American perceptions of the region . The way in which the U.S. was effectively operating as a colonial power in the Caribbean and beyond in the context of a global era of colonialism and racial explanations for human ' backwardness ' and ' progress ' is significant . Furthermore , there is plenty of evidence ( the history of the last 500 years in the Americas , for example ) to suggest that increased contact between cultures can lead , among other things , to increased conflict and heightened conceptions of superiority and inferiority rather than greater cooperation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the backdrop of U.S. expansion into Latin America , and in the context of increased " popular interest " in the region , Park notes that the basis for the " formal study " of Latin America was established . He points in particular to the University of California ( Berkeley ) and the University of Pennsylvania , while mentioning that William R. Shepherd ( Columbia University ) , Edward Gaylord Bourne and Hiram Bingham ( Yale ) , William S. Robertson ( University of Illinois ) and Leo S. Rowe ( University of Pennsylvania ) were all pioneers in the teaching of courses on Latin American history and politics . Park argues that the " practical consequences " of the " professionalization " of the study of Latin America was that over time " much of the misinformation " that characterized North American " commentary " on the region was eventually challenged , but what he regards as a " corrective process " took " decades " to produce results . Furthermore , professional Latin American specialists themselves often manifested the " long-standing and deeply engrained prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , " even when " they were " on the right track they often failed to address the nonacademic audience " ( Park , 1995. pp. 71-72 ) . More broadly Park argues that between 1870 and 1921 the powerful " negative " and " distorted perceptions " of the region which emanated from North America had not altered substantially , while a " corps of regional specialists " , with the necessary linguistic training , to study Latin American history and culture , and " an empathy for its peoples " based on " extended residence there " , had not yet emerged . However , he was confident that a move in the direction of the " ordered , scholarly study of Latin America " had been embarked upon , even if the influence of increased scholarship and information on North American " public perceptions was not yet evident " ( Park , 1995. pp. 98-99 ) . <p> Here , again , Park assumes that increased U.S. involvement in Latin America ( and the emergence of the professional study of Latin America ) should , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the region . However , it can be argued that any and all knowledge produced in the context of both U.S. politico-military and economic expansion into Latin America , and the related trend towards the professionalization of the study of Latin America , in the period up to 1921 ( and after ) , was produced in the context of power relations that precluded a North American discovery of an authentic ' Latin America ' which existed beneath the many layers of disdain and prejudice . A key aspect of the very constitution of the professional study of Latin America was the development of strong links between academics , private foundations and the State Department or another branch of the U.S. government , at the very time when U.S. politico-military and economic expansion into Latin America was on the increase . Many early Latin American specialists emerged from , and/or spent at least part of their career in , government service . A Latin American specialist who exemplified the close relationship between the academy , the government and private foundations in this period was Leo S. Rowe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowe , who Park cites in passing as a pioneer in the teaching of Latin American history and politics , was well connected in government circles and was very sympathetic with U.S. policy in Latin America . He served as the Director General of the Pan-American Union from 1920 until 1946 ( the Pan American Union was the direct organizational predecessor to the Organization of American States , which was founded in 1948 ) and as President of the American Academy of Political and Social Science for almost thirty years ( 1902 to 1930 ) . Rowe 's most well known book was The United States and Porto Rico , which grew out of his work for the U.S. government in Puerto Rico at the beginning of the century . In it he characterized U.S. expansion into the circum-Caribbean as " inevitable " , and the countries there as " natural economic dependencies " of the United States , emphasizing that the North American embrace had the potential to provide the region with a level of " prosperity " which it had not known since the mid-1800s . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers in order to deal more effectively with its growing collection of dependencies . Rowe 's career trajectory flowed from and worked in direct complicity with U.S. politico-military and economic influence in the region . And Rowe 's perspective on Latin America , like wider North American perspectives on the region in this period can not easily be separated from government policy and the projection of U.S. power into Latin America in the first two decades of the twentieth century.7 <p> II ) The Coming of Development Theory : The Great Depression , the Good Neighbor Policy and the Second World War 1921-1945 <p> Although the dominant explanations for Latin America 's ' underdevelopment ' continued to rest on race , climate and the Hispanic legacy into the 1920s , Park emphasizes that it was in this decade that these approaches were first seriously challenged by scientists , intellectuals and radical journalists . At the same time , he argues that more significantly still , there was an increased " flow of information " on Latin America which was " more evenhanded " , of a higher quality and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , U.S. policy in the region in the 1920s was the subject of much more debate than previously and an increased number of North American commentators called for " greater understanding " of the region 's " problems " , while pointing to the need for more " tolerance " . Park goes on to note that a growing number of reprints and translations of Latin American articles began to turn up in U.S. newspapers and journals , emphasizing that this reflected a " trend toward more-balanced reporting " . He argues further that the higher profile given to " the Latin American perspective " by the 1920s facilitated " a more balanced and informed public opinion " in North America ( Park , 1995. pp. 100-101 , 108-111 ) .8 At the same time , he takes the view that there was " more continuity than discontinuity " in U.S. descriptions of and prescriptions for Latin America ( Park , 1995. pp. 113-115 ) . The rise of scientific racism in this period reinforced more popular conceptions of race , and " racial factors " remained crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great bulk of Latin America 's population--Indians , Negroes , and mixed races--was a major " and " lasting obstacle to progress " ( Park , 1995. pp. 118-119 ) . However , a small , but growing " countercurrent against scientific racism " gained greater currency by the 1930s under the leadership of cultural anthropologists such as Franz Boas , not to mention influential academics and journalists such as John Dewey and Walter Lippmann ( Park , 1995. pp. 122-123 ) . More generally , Park draws attention to the emergence in the 1920s of an increasingly technical interest in solutions to Latin America 's ' problems ' ( he points to the advisory work of Edwin Walter Kemmerer , an economist from Princeton University , who advised five Andean governments on economic policy between the early 1920s and the early 1930s ) and emphasizes that the increasingly thorough examination of issues such as foreign investment and land reform was indicative of a shift away from the " highly generalized views " of earlier decades towards " specialization " and " more-complex analysis " . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public was still indifferent to , and disdainful of , Latin America , and race , climate , and the Hispanic legacy , were still the most regularly deployed explanations for Latin American ' underdevelopment ' ( Park , 1995. pp. 127 , 130-131 ) . <p> As Park notes , the Great Depression and the onset of World War II were central to shifts in U.S. policy toward Latin America and the re-definition of inter-American relations . In this context the Good Neighbor policy " brought unprecedented " U.S. " attention " to the region and worked to " fashion a more cooperative hemispheric relationship " . Although , according to Park , race , culture and climate remained major factors in North American explanations of Latin American ' underdevelopment ' , this period was also characterized by the " remarkably tolerant , even benevolent , tone " of a growing amount of North American " commentary " , which had become , by the end of the 1930s , " a fascination for all things Latin American " . This was apparent in the growing popularity of Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued " Latin American themes " not to mention , the increase in tourism , cultural exchanges and " an explosion of information " in which overwhelmingly negative Latin American stereotypes ( which had been a standard of Hollywood film-making ) were increasingly superseded by more deferential and culturally-sensitive stereotypes . Park also notes the increase in college- and university-level courses on Latin America and the growing role of professional Latin Americanists . He observes that , by the 1920s the " formal study " of Latin America , an important element in the " ultimate shaping " of North American " attitudes " , was proceeding at a steady , but " gradual pace " . And Park concludes that a " small but growing corps of regional specialists " had appeared by the 1930s , and a number of them were active in efforts to " inform public opinion " . In his discussion of the 1930s Park draws particular attention to Herbert E. Bolton , president of the American Historical Association in 1932 , and his efforts to publicise and popularise his ideas about the " common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1920s and 1930s at which time Bolton was head of the history department at the University of California , Berkeley , he produced numerous books , while the number of graduate students who did Latin American history topics under his supervision numbered in the " hundreds " . According to Park , Bolton 's various achievements " all had lasting and widespread influence among Latin American historians , not only on perceptions of the Spanish borderlands but also in acceptance of his thesis that the Americas share a common historical experience " ( Park , 1995. pp. 112-113 , 130-132 , 140-143 ) . <p> It can be argued that Park overstates the significance of Bolton and the long term importance of his work as a result of his assumption that professional Latin Americanists were involved in a cumulative , and an almost inherently progressive , process of knowledge production . Bolton 's case for a unitary and comparative approach to the history of the Americas--which emphasized the hemisphere 's common colonial origins , the ongoing transplantation of culture from Europe , the exploitation and marginalization of the indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence of , and competition between , new nations , and what was believed to be a shared and ongoing struggle for political stability and economic progress--ultimately had a very limited impact . Although Bolton 's call for Pan American history was favorably received in many quarters , and meshed well with the Good Neighbor policy , interest in the unitary and/or comparative study of the history of the Americas implied by what became know as the Bolton Theory faded after 1945 . Bolton 's failure to generate much scholarly research on the unitary/comparative history of the Americas was a result of the continued strength of the conventional demarcation between the study of U.S. history and the study of Latin American history . At the same time , Bolton focused primarily on the colonial history of the Americas . And as the independence era in North American and Latin American history gained importance for U.S. historians , Bolton 's significance declined . After 1945 the colonial history of North America was important because of its significance to the U.S. rise to " national greatness " rather than because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes clear the post-1945 study of Latin America rested increasingly on the systematic codification of an analytical framework which departed dramatically from notions of a common history and emphasized the historic and contemporary differences between North America and Latin America , assuming that the U.S. was ' developed ' and Latin America was ' underdeveloped ' . <p> Furthermore , while Bolton , as Park notes , supervised a large number of post-graduates ( over the course of his thirty-three years at Berkeley , he supervised 350 master 's degrees and 105 doctorates , and fifty-four of the latter did their work in Latin American history , while over forty of them pursued academic careers ) , produced a large number of books , and wrote numerous articles for scholarly and popular journals , Bolton was not regarded , even by some of his contemporaries , as a particularly gifted historian . While Berkeley emerged , under Bolton 's guidance , as an institutional focus for a nascent Latin American studies profession , Bolton was perceived as a " mass producer " of PhDs , and many of his students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important eastern and northern universities . Although Bolton 's contribution to the historical profession was acknowledged with his election to the post of president of the American Historical Association in the early 1930s , Berkeley 's re-emergence as a major national center for Latin American research in the 1960s , owed little to Bolton and a great deal to the politico-economic dynamics of the Cold War . Berkeley 's earlier Latin American reputation appears to have often gone unnoticed and unmentioned by a new generation of Latin American specialists , many of whom perceived Bolton as something of an " embarrassment " .10 In the early 1960s , Richard Morse argued that Latin American studies prior to World War II was " a faintly ridiculous tail to a politico-commercial kite " .11 <p> Even though there was a wide variety of efforts aimed at the overall " promotion " of the region by the 1930s and early 1940s , Park emphasizes that specialists lamented that throughout this period the vast majority of North Americans " remained pitifully ignorant of the region " insofar as the Latin American " craze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distorted the real " . At the same time , Park emphasizes that the realities of the Depression had generated a growing amount of economic research and analysis of Latin America , some of it quite critical of the role of the U.S. government and U.S.-based corporations . It is in this trend that Park finds the partial origins of dependency theory . He outlines the work of Carleton Beals , Margaret Alexander Marsh , Melvin M. Knight and Frank Tannnenbaum in the 1930s as key commentators in the promulgation of a more radical and economic-oriented perspective . Park concludes that up to the 1920s , the idea that foreign capital played a part in the ' underdevelopment ' of Latin America had been the preserve of a " leftist minority " ; however , by the 1930s this perspective had " gained general respectability " ( Park , 1995 pp. 130 , 147-151 ) . The overall importance of the progressive and/or radical studies of U.S. economic imperialism in Latin America , which began to appear by the late 1920s and challenged the representation of U.S. hegemony as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Deal and the Good Neighbor Policy some progressive ideas were partially incorporated into U.S. foreign policy and into the dominant professional discourses on Latin America , but this occurred in a way which clearly defused their more radical political implications . Furthermore , as Park does makes clear , the emergence of a focus on the economic aspects of ' development ' , and a radical critique of the maldistribution of the control of economic resources in the region , did not mean that climatic explanations and the less frequent , but still influential , Black Legend lost their salience for North American commentators seeking to explain Latin American underdevelopment , while ' race ' also persisted as a " common explanation " ( Park , 1995. pp. 157-161 ) . <p> Nevertheless , in Park 's view , although alterations to North American perspectives on Latin America " were indeed slow in coming " the 1930-1945 era saw significant professional growth in Latin American studies and in the diplomatic corp accredited to the region . He notes that the " ( r ) eorganization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionalization and a consequent improvement in reporting from the region " at the same time as " the placement of personnel sympathetic to Latin America in key policy-making positions within the State Department , had a favorable though indirect impact on shaping public opinion about Latin America " . Park is also enthusiastic about the " dozens of cultural exchange programs " which were " sponsored by the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations and the Pan American Union " and by the government itself . He praises the " youthful energy and prior experience " of Nelson A. Rockefeller , who was appointed director of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs CIAA when it was set up by the U.S. government in 1940 . Park emphasizes that Rockefeller and his organization " proved effective in combating Nazi penetration of the hemisphere and in promoting Pan American solidarity by improving dissemination of information through the mass media networks in the Americas " . The CIAA also " stimulated " the professional study of Latin America and distributed funding to academics engaged in field work in the region ( Park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in his analysis of the professionalization of the foreign service , is any indication of the unequal character of inter-American power relations and any critical consideration of the politico-economic and military imperatives driving both U.S. policy and the growing number of academics who worked directly or indirectly with the government before and after the outbreak of World War II . One of the ostensible goals of the Good Neighbor Policy after 1933 , which was eventually taken up by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in 1940 , was to generate an environment of appreciation and respect for Hispanic American culture . To this end the CIAA began to work with the State Department 's Division of Cultural Relations through a Joint Committee on Cultural Relations . By the end of 1941 hundreds of seminars on inter-American relations inspired and funded by this Joint Committee on Cultural Relations had been held across North America , while Pan Americanism was propagated in the school system . A whole range of organizations were enlisted to form links with similar organizations in Latin America and promote Pan Americanism.13 By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the emphasis was clearly on using Pan American cultural relations as a conduit for the transmission of North American influence rather than anything resembling mutual cultural appreciation . In the 1930s and early 1940s , the dominant perspectives on Latin America , and Pan Americanism more generally , rested on self-serving assumptions about the complementarity of U.S. ideals and U.S. interests and about the existence of a relative harmony of interest between U.S. goals and Latin American aspirations . <p> Ultimately , according to Park , the " explosion of information on Latin America " in this period was " still error-ridden " and " superficial " ; however , a number of young academics , such as Robert Redfield , who would rise to considerable prominence in the profession after 1945 , increasingly countered " traditional interpretations " , while a growing focus on the economic dimension of Latin America 's ' problems ' flowed " naturally " out of the experience of the Depression ( Park , 1995. pp. 164-166 ) . Park adopts a descriptive and uncritical view of Redfield 's career and the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II . What is not emphasized is that Redfield 's particular career trajectory and modernization theory more generally ( of which his books were key texts ) was grounded in the tight linkage between academics and government which had been central to Latin American studies since its inception , but became more marked during the Second World War . Redfield , an anthropologist at the University of Chicago , emerged as an important Latin American studies figure by the late 1930s , serving as chairman of the Joint Committee on Latin American Studies , which was set up in 1940 under the auspices of the American Council of Learned Societies and the Social Science Research Council , with direct links to the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs under Nelson Rockefeller.14 His work on the Maya exerted considerable influence on anthropology and Latin American studies before and after the Second World War.15 His approach emphasized a tradition-modernity dichotomy and a liberal evolutionary conception of ' progress ' . This emphasis was central to modernization theory as it emerged after World War II and continued to dominate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> III ) The Discovery of Development : The Cold War , Modernization Theory and the Alliance for Progress 1945-1965 <p> In the immediate post-war years the degree of U.S. " interest " in its southern neighbors faded precipitously and did not really recover , as Park notes , until the end of the 1950s by which time the concept of ' underdevelopment ' had become firmly established in inter-American ( and international ) political and economic discourse . At the same time , apart from " the climatic factor " , the " traditional explanations " for Latin America 's ' failure ' to ' develop ' remained alive ; however , they increasingly emerged as complementary to the " new ' modernization theory ' " which offered far more systematic and " complex explanations " and prescriptions based on particular readings of North American history . In this context definitions of ' development ' were increasingly grounded in economics , while emphasizing that the ' political ' and the ' social ' would line up " behind the locomotive of economic growth " . By the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread far beyond the academy and pervaded public discourse on ' development ' . According to Park , modernization theory represented an attempt to provide a " more-ordered " perspective based on " increasingly complex " and " multi-disciplinary views " ; however , the shift it represented was less " real " than first appearances suggested . He emphasizes that modernization theory as it emerged after 1945 reinforced " existing attitudes " , insofar as it continued to regard the cultures and institutions of Latin America with disdain , emphasizing , furthermore , that Latin American cultural practices had to be " discarded " for the region to evolve towards modernity . As Park notes , by the early 1960s the idea that the " development " of Latin America could only come about through a process of complete , but evolutionary , " transformation " and strict emulation of the U.S. " model " had become predominant and many North Americans had also become convinced that the ' development ' of the region necessitated a dramatic increase in North American " participation " . By 1960 , Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its regional " interests " and was also possessed of " a gnawing sense of some measure of responsibility " for Latin America 's ' underdevelopment ' . In this context U.S. policy shifted toward an effort to meet nationalist and radical " challenges to its hemispheric hegemony " head-on " while expressing a characteristic sense of optimism and world mission " ( Park , 1995. pp. 167 , 201-203 ) . <p> While Park 's discussion provides general coverage of the 1945 to 1960 period , and emphasizes the ethnocentric North American antecedents of modernization theory and the Alliance for Progress , his analysis fails to draw out the shifting and dramatically unequal inter-American power relations and the way in which the vicissitudes of the Cold War shaped the changes to , or the reworking of , U.S. perspectives towards Latin America . He points to the way Latin America remained a low priority in Washington in the 1950s because the region appeared to be relatively stable in relation to U.S. concerns about a global ' communist threat ' . However , once he has established the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cold War even though a direct and specific discussion of Cold War imperatives , at various points , would have illuminated and contextualized his discussion of particular commentators and trends.16 To take just one example , he draws attention to Walt Whitman Rostow 's influential work of modernization theory , The Stages of Economic Growth at two different points , as well as to one of his earlier books , jointly authored with Max F. Millikan ( Park , 1995. pp. 184 , 199 , 219 ) . However , at no point is Rostow 's career , or his work located in the wider context of the Cold War and the projection of U.S. power in Latin America and beyond . Surely , any attempt to come to grips with Rostow 's book The Stages of Economic Growth : A Non-Communist Manifesto , a classic statement of modernization theory in the 1950s and early 1960s , and its overall significance in relation to U.S. perspectives towards Latin America requires more attention to the details of Rostow 's career and the international power relations of the Cold War.17 All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic historian at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Park does not even mention that Rostow , who served in the research and analysis branch of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) during World War II , continued to work with the government in the 1950s and was a close advisor to President Kennedy and President Johnson . Nor does Park mention his role as a major and influential advocate of the shift in U.S. foreign policy in the late 1950s , away from containing the Soviet Union with direct military force , towards taking the initiative in the so-called ' Third World ' via the increased use of U.S. economic and military aid as part of an ambitious strategy of economic development and nation-building ( and counter-insurgency ) .18 This strategy was embodied in the Alliance for Progress and the Kennedy administration , in which Rostow served as deputy assistant to the President for National Security Affairs , built on the state-led reformism of the Good Neighbor era and sought to breathe new life into Republican-style Cold War globalism . <p> In his last chapter , Park concludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar , decade-long , program of land and economic reform , aimed at bringing about annual growth rates of at least 2.5 percent , greater agricultural output , illiteracy eradication , trade diversification , and improvements in housing and income distribution ) was one of " many casualties " of the 1960s . According to Park , the Alliance for Progress emerged as U.S. policy " largely because " it meshed with a theory which was " widely accepted in the academic world " and also " popularized among the educated public " at the sametime as its " inherent optimism " coincided with both the " mood " of the early 1960s and the " traditional " North American " sense of mission " . However , by the mid-1960s , although classical modernization theory continued to underpin North American analysis of Latin America , " it was less and less expressed with the high idealism of a few years earlier " at the same time as the anti-communist military element of the Alliance for Progress became increasingly important . From Park 's point of view the Alliance 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in Latin America as it did from " momentous cultural and political " developments in North America " which sharply curtailed the liberal agenda " and " reduced the public 's already notoriously short attention span for things Latin American " . More broadly , Park attributes the failure of the Alliance to " many factors " including " excessively ambitious " objectives , " the distraction of war in Vietnam , the fading of the Cuban ' threat ' , balance of payment problems and the decline of liberal reformism as the decade advanced " . In Park 's view , the " smug confidence " of the Kennedy years had inspired a perspective on ' development ' in Latin America which found the origin of the region 's " problems " to be internal and the solution to be external in origin , but the " turbulent " 1960s undermined that " confidence " and the rising political opposition increasingly found the roots of Latin American ' underdevelopment ' in an " exploitative " inter-American politico-economic system centred on the U.S. ( Park , 1995. pp. 204-205 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park 's analysis of the Alliance for Progress follows an established pattern which views the Alliance as a basically sound policy initiative and locates its failure in the weaknesses of the implementation process and the wider context of the weakening of U.S. commitment.19 This approach is premised on the overall compatibility between the interests of the governments and people of Latin America , and the interests of the government and people of the United States . From their perspective the earlier problems that had developed between Latin America and Washington had grown out of the shortcomings of previous policies , a shortage of information and U.S. failure to pay sufficient attention to the region . As with Park 's overall analysis , inter-American problems are explained in terms of a lack of ' understanding ' between North and South caused and compounded by different cultural backgrounds , irrational stereotypes and a shortage of information.20 This can be seen as an exceptionally sanguine assessment which glosses over the unequal relations of power , the disruptive effects of capitalist development and the profound contradictions which characterize inter-American relations and were reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overarching , but usually unstated , goals of the Alliance was the protection of inter-American arrangements conducive to North American investments and trading interests . At the same time many of the Alliance 's reforms endangered U.S. investments , while trade diversification threatened the U.S.-based transnationals ' monopoly in primary agricultural products and mineral extraction . Furthermore , any significant land reform threatened the interests of powerful land-based elites often allied to U.S. political and economic interests . These contradictions were apparent in the way that Kennedy 's reformist rhetoric went hand in hand with Washington 's ever-deepening commitment to aiding military and police efforts to quash peasant-based rebellions . From the very beginning , U.S.-based transnationals and the landed oligarchies attempted to preserve the status quo and prevent any meaningful change . Although high rates of economic growth in many Latin American countries had been achieved by the late 1960s , they had served primarily to increase social inequality , while the middle class moved to side with the ruling political and socio-economic elite as politics , instead of evolving towards democracy , moved further towards authoritarianism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within eight years of the launch of the Alliance for Progress ) . Already by the time of Kennedy 's assassination , the reformist element in the Alliance had been sidelined in favour of a more straightforward approach of military and economic aid to any regime which was committed to the status quo.21 <p> IV ) Post-Kennedy Liberalism : The Development Debate and the Domestication of Dependency Theory <p> Ultimately , the optimism and missionary zeal of the Alliance for Progress , according to Park , " sprang from an interpretation of Latin American underdevelopment that is yet today expressed as a major voice in the ongoing debate in academic circles on hemispheric development and that rests on a perspective with very deep roots in the American past " ( Park , 1995 , p. 1 ) . At the same time , by the second half of the 1960s , the weaknesses of the major Cold War theories of development , and of the Alliance for Progress , had also encouraged the appearance of a theory of underdevelopment " antithetical " to modernization theory . In Park 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conflict " between a re-emergent " economic interpretation " which originated in the 1930s , but had been marginalised by the " prosperity " of the post-1945 era , and a revised " cultural interpretation " with an even longer genealogy . He goes on to suggest that the development debate of the 1960s " reinforced the growing awareness of the inordinate complexity of Latin American underdevelopment " and for this reason the " collapse " of the " consensus " around a " culturally based and ethnocentric " modernization theory , which had reached a peak by the beginning of the 1960s , should be regarded favourably . He also argues that achieving a new theoretical " consensus " on development and underdevelopment in Latin America was difficult because of the growing power and articulation of " the Latin American view " and because dependency and modernization theorists " were driven by ideology " ( Park , 1995. pp. 228-234 , 236 ) . First of all , I can not imagine any theory or perspective that is outside of politics or " ideology " , as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " driven " by liberal assumptions about political and social change which are linked to modernization theory . Furthermore , as with his attempt to chart the shifts in inter-American relations and U.S. perceptions of Latin America , Park 's brief analysis of the competing theories development which had emerged by the 1960s , neglects the power relations which shaped the debate in important ways at the same time as he provides a somewhat simplistic analysis of dependency theory . For example , at a minimum he could have distinguished between the reformist strands which are seen to have originated with Raul Prebisch and the ECLA in the 1950s on the one hand and the more revolutionary strands , associated with Andre Gunder Frank and others , which first appeared in the 1960s and are generally regarded as classical dependency theory . At the same time , while there are clearly various resonances and linkages between dependency theory of the 1960s and the theories of economic imperialism which emerged in the 1930s , the link is not necessarily straightforward . Park 's heavy emphasis on continuity here , as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier ethnocentric perspectives , somewhat obscures the dynamic reconfiguring of older perspectives which occurred during the Cold War . <p> Park , in my view , also overstates the challenge which dependency theory represented to the liberal consensus underpinning modernization theory . He argues that the late 1960s saw a break down of " consensus " and it was not until the beginning of the 1990s that there was a re-emergence of a " general concordance of views on development " ( centred on a neo-liberal model ) amongst government leaders , policy-makers and the general public in the U.S. ; however , it is not clear whether he sees this consensus extending to the academy ( Park , 1995. p. 234 ) . This emphasis on a breakdown of consensus in the 1960s , as a result in part of the growing influence of dependency theory , is a common observation.22 However , it can be argued that this exaggerates the politico-theoretical power of dependency theory in North America and beyond , and takes an ahistorical perspective on the trajectory which theories of dependency followed in the 1960s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political turmoil , liberalism clearly remained dominant within and outside the Latin American studies profession . The theoretical and political changes within the North American study of Latin America since the 1960s occurred in the context of power relations that worked to domesticate radical theory and politics to liberal academic structures , professional organizations and discourses . Even when the lack of political and theoretical consensus appeared to be particularly acute , such as the late 1960s or the early 1980s , the institutional power relations and the dominant professional and policy discourses provided the context for the domestication and containment of theoretical and political dissent . While a crucial site for the domestication of dependency theory was the Latin American studies profession the domestication process was also intimately linked to shifts in U.S. foreign policy and the trend to neo-liberal economics and electoral politics which was a key characteristic of inter-American political economy by the second half of the 1980s.23 The diffusion of radical ideas into the dominant professional discourses was part of the wider reinvention of liberalism . In the 1960s and 1970s , in the context of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it a more critical edge . They also began to adopt elements of dependency analysis . However , unlike the radical reliance on a conflict model of inter-American relations , the dominant professional discourses continued to rest on the view that there was no fundamental conflict of interest between U.S. objectives in Latin America and the aspirations of the people who lived there . And while most radicals advocated revolutionary change , or at least radical reform , liberal narratives continued to be based on considerable optimism about the possibility of improving North-South relations within the existing inter-American framework . <p> Conclusion : Pan American Progress <p> As we have seen Park 's book is about U.S. perspectives on ' underdevelopment ' in Latin America up to and including the Alliance for Progress and he is preoccupied with charting the cultural antecedents of modernization theory . I have tried to argue that his overall analysis is seriously weakened by his assumption that the growing involvement of the U.S. in Latin America , and the increased contact and information should , or did , gradually lead to increased understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address possible conflicts of interest between the government and people of the U.S. and Latin America . This points to an unwillingness to acknowledge the important role that power relations play in shaping ' ethnocentric ' North American perspectives on Latin America . Nor does his analysis take into account that ' enthnocentrism ' without power , is quite different from ' ethnocentrism ' with power whereby the historic North American disdain towards Latin America which he charts is translated into policies and actions that have significant effects . At the same time , Park 's failure to address the question of power results in an analysis of the development debate of the 1960s which treats dependency theory as a virtual equal competitor with modernization theory and overstates the scale of the dependency challenge to liberal theories of development . Furthermore , despite his cultural critique of modernization theory , there is a tendency towards an ahistorical perspective which reads too much continuity into US perspectives on Latin America , while his overall analysis , like most elite visions of a regional or universal capitalist modernity , tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modernization theory and the Alliance for Progress of the 1960s , and neo-liberalism and Pan-American efforts at economic integration in the 1980s and 1990s , have been aimed less at Pan American progress and more at managing capitalist development in the interests of regionalized and internationalized elites . The Alliance for Progress coincided in the 1960s with both increased rates of economic growth and dramatic increases in social and economic inequality , while the liberalization of trade and investment in the 1980s and 1990s , has been paralleled by the concentration of incomes , high rates of underemployment and unemployment , widespread poverty and the marginalization of large numbers of rural and urban poor throughout the Americas . <p> 2 .

The absence of any conception of power relations in Park 's account is apparent when he emphasizes that the ignorant , racist and ethnocentric attitudes which underpinned US perspectives towards Latin America " should not be taken as uniquely " North American , " for they were quite universal " . This point is reiterated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in mind that ethnocentrism is not unique to American culture ; the Latin American interpretation of life in the United States is also burdened with its own ethnocentric limitations " ( Park , 1995 , pp. 4 , 236-237 ) . <p> 5 . Park highlights the continued influence and codification of the climatic explanation for Latin American ' backwardness ' into the 1920s , as reflected in the work of the Yale academic Ellsworth Huntington . See Ellsworth Huntington Civilization and Climate New Haven : Yale University Press , 1915 . Even more than climatic explanations , ' race ' and ' racial mixing ' continued to be " widely accepted " explanations for the ' backwardness ' of Latin America . Again , as Park points out , the writings of influential North American exponents of scientific racism worked to legitimate racial explanations for ' underdevelopment ' in Latin America . Two well-known books which explicitly pointed to Latin America to highlight the " evils of miscegenation " were Albert Galloway Keller , Colonization : A Study of the Founding of New Societies Boston : 1908 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York : 1916 . Apart from climate and race , the hispanic legacy also continued to be deployed to account for the " purported backwardness " of Latin America . In fact , according to Park , the influence of the Black Legend was especially " pervasive " in the first two decades of the twentieth century . A particular acute example of this was a book by G. L. Morrill , a Protestant minister . See G. L. Morrill , Rotten Republics : A Tropical Tramp in Central America Chicago : 1916 . As Park points out the " harsh judgements " emanating from the North in this period were also being made by influential Latin Americans , and their observations were often deployed by North Americans . The most famous example of this literature is probably Latin America : Its Rise and Progress by Francisco Garcma Caldersn which was was widely cited in North America .

For example , in Park 's view , the heated debate over Mexican policy in the 1920s " was more balanced and offered a clearer exposition of the Mexican point of view than ever before " . He pointed to the work of three well known radical journalists , Frank Tannenbaum , Ernest Gruening and Carleton Beals and the way in which their work emphasized that the main objectives of the Mexican revolution were " just and humane " , that Mexico was starting to realize those objectives and that this should take place without US. interference ( Park , 1995. pp. 109-110 ) . <p> 11 .

In his view Washington and Managua each formulated policies , based on different " psychological baggage " , that " consistently evoked the worst in the other " . Robert A.

The rise of the Newly Industrializing Countries in Latin America ( Mexico and Brazil ) , and East Asia ( South Korea and Taiwan ) , and the rise of OPEC , also helped to undermine the subordinate image of Third World nations , and contributed to the fading of radical dependency theory 's luster . By the late 1970s , the North American and Western European emphasis on the corruption and authoritarianism of many ' Third World ' governments helped to shift the burden of explanation for underdevelopment back onto the elites and states of Latin America and beyond .

@@40786686 @786686/ <p> J. H. Elliott 's Empires of the Atlantic World compares the British and Spanish empires from the time of Columbus to the shattering of the old imperial order in the early nineteenth century . It offers a striking picture of how similar these empires were and yet how much they differed politically and culturally . To create a coherent story , Elliott divides the book into three parts : " Occupation , " " Consolidation , " and " Emancipation . " His purpose , he acknowledges , is to compare and juxtapose the two empires , focusing on " settler societies and their relationship with their mother countries " ( p. xviii ) . <p> The next section , " Consolidation , " explores frameworks of government throughout North America . Here Elliott makes the compelling point that European culture had a far greater effect on colonial settlement than did the American environment . Eschewing Frederick Jackson Turner 's frontier thesis , and keeping in line with recent scholarship on the Atlantic World , he argues that , although British imperial policy provided a conceptual framework for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shape colonial political structures than did metropolitan officials from London. 1 The obverse is true for the Spanish empire , Elliott asserts . He notes that Spanish officials in Spain created an empire in the Spanish borderlands that was organizationally and bureaucratically managed from across the Atlantic . <p> The final section , " Emancipation , " is the most interesting part of the book . Elliot shows how both empires struggled to maintain order with their distant possessions . By the latter part of the seventeenth century , he writes , the Virginia settlement was plagued by Bacon 's Rebellion , Massachusetts suffered from King Philip 's War , and the Spanish experienced the Pueblo Revolt in New Mexico , all of which proved that empire-building in the New World would not be as easy as European officials had imagined . <p> What further weakened these Atlantic empires , Elliott affirms , were the imperial wars of the eighteenth century , which left both empires burdened with debt . After the Seven Years ' War , British officials passed a series of reforms that were designed to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the first taxes in 1764 , Elliott notes , British imperial policies sparked a broad and pointed discussion in the empire about what powers Parliament had over the colonies and what powers it did not have . The inability--of both colonial elites and Whitehall administrators--to resolve those problems led to war , which culminated in 1776 with American independence . <p> Elliott then concludes with a section on Latin American independence , which was different than independence in the United States . Revolution in the Spanish empire was not led by disgruntled colonial elites angry with Spanish policies . Rather , Elliott argues , the revolutionary fervor in Europe did more than any other factor to foment revolution in the Latin American states in the early nineteenth century . <p> All told , this is an ambitious book .

@@40786687 @786687/ <p> Huck 's Raft comes to me , in the modern fashion , garlanded with pre-publication praise . Seven eminent scholars tell me that it is , without any question , the best single-volume history of American childhood and youth . Scholarly , and engagingly written , it places the history of childhood in the mainstream of the history of the United States ; as David Brion Davis puts it , it is " a major reinterpretation of the entire sweep of American history as seen through the eyes and experiences of children and adolescents . " The endorsements , let me say straight away , are fully justified . The book is a major achievement , and will become the benchmark against which any future histories will be judged . <p> The book also provides us with a benchmark for considering broad questions about the history of children and childhood . That history , Mintz acknowledges , " is especially difficult to write " ( p. vii ) . The difficulties lie partly in the question of agency . No one , now , would want to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims or as passive participants in events . But sources do not often show up children as active agents in any historical process . Mintz is alert to any evidence that they may have played some role of that kind . He opens arrestingly with the story of seven-year-old Eunice Williams , captured in a raid in 1704 , and later refusing to leave her Mohawk captors for a life with her clergyman father . Children in his narrative are actively engaged in the revolutionary and civil wars , they initiate strikes , they lead peace protests . But if we can name any of these children--and Mintz is very good at drawing upon personal testimony--they are likely to be older children . Eleven-year-old Harriet Hanson , who in 1836 led a walkout from a textile factory in Falls River , Massachusetts , and twelve-year-old William Black , the youngest wounded soldier in the Civil War , his left hand and arm shattered by an exploding shell , are exceptional in their youth . Children below ten , when agency is more difficult to unearth , are perhaps poorly served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second difficulty in writing about childhood . When does it begin and end ? Mintz , without debating the issue , settles on the period from infancy to eighteen . Does starting at " infancy " rather than birth , or , as some would prefer , conception , mean that babies are outside the scope of a history of childhood ? Certainly the very young get little attention in this book unless they die . In the U.N . Convention on the Rights of the Child , as for Mintz , eighteen is the cut-off age for childhood . But , in the past at least , and I suspect in the present , many in their mid- or later teens would have seen themselves as beyond childhood . Slave children , for example , began to work full-time in the fields around the age of twelve , and at the same age received a full ration of food and adult clothing . Can they be said to belong beyond that age to a history of childhood ? As it is , many parts of Huck 's Raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of youth or , in the twentieth century , of adolescence . Even if we take childhood to encompass all the years before adulthood , we are in difficulties , for the typical markers of adulthood ( partnered , living outside the parental home , economically self-supporting ) have come at very different ages at different times in the past . In short , it is not at all clear what the bounds of our subject are , and Mintz is disappointingly unreflective about this . <p> A third difficulty lies in trying to write a history of childhood in one country . Like socialism , childhood can not easily be constrained within national boundaries . Children themselves certainly were not . They were as much participants as were adults in the great movements of people that play such a key role in U.S. history : from Europe , from Africa , from Asia , from east to west , from south to north . Mintz is very good on this . A recurring theme is how children who might have at first thought of themselves as Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not come ) to think of themselves as American . Mintz is rather less alert to the flow of ideas . They traveled just as easily as people , and it was a two-way traffic . And patterns of behavior that seem to be explicable in exclusively American terms may turn out to be more widespread and therefore call for further attention . Mintz , for example , explains the diminution of the role of fathers in the late nineteenth century by reference to the Civil War ; but exactly the same diminution and at the same time has been observed in Britain , where the Civil War explanation obviously has no hold. 1 <p> The desire to see children as agents , the extension of childhood up to eighteen , the confinement of the narrative within the bounds at any one time of the United States , and the linkage made between childhood and major events in the history of the nation , at times have the effect of making Mintz 's book read like a stirring patriotic tale . The children in the early chapters are each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder in the late twentieth century . But patriotism is a diminishing motif after the Civil War . There are moments when children again contribute to the national cause , by their earnings for family budgets in the Depression , or by their support for the war effort in World War II . But it is possible to read Huck 's Raft as a story of the rise and decline both of childhood and of the nation . In the rise children are purposeful , and engaged in useful social activity , contributing their full part to the making of the nation . Moreover , adults are alert to the needs of children . Sometimes their well-meaning efforts go badly wrong , all too often their good intentions sit alongside racism or gender bias , but they are seen as at least making an effort , more praiseworthy or less blameworthy than their successors today . The child-savers " pioneered innovative and creative approaches to the problems of childhood that should stand as an inspiration and a rebuke to Americans today " ( pp. 155-156 ) . Progressive ideals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the simplistic solutions ... favored today " ( p. 178 ) . The decline started in the late nineteenth century , and was in full flow after the near-realization by the mid-twentieth century of the ideal of a protected childhood for all children . The recent past is a history of a commercialized children 's culture and of successive parental panics , all of them out of proportion to the actual danger to children . Mintz himself firmly nails the myths that underlie such panics about the good of the old days , and has no truck with notions of either progress or decline ( p. 3 ) , but a story that ends in Columbine High School will implant in many readers a sense that things were better in the past . Mintz strives to be optimistic about the present , and is disinclined to romanticize the past , but the message that comes through the texture of the book may point to a different conclusion . <p> Although the book can be read as a story of rise and decline , Mintz prefers to see three overlapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial era , parents saw the young as adults in the making . Modern childhood , in which adults aim to mark off childhood as a protected state , has its seeds in the middle of the eighteenth century , and two centuries later had come to define childhood across the spectrum of class and ethnicity . But already in the 1950s it was under threat from post-modern childhood , when norms about family structure and authority and gender roles began to break down . The problem is that many observers , as Mintz is fully aware , see post-modern childhood as a fundamental decline from the good of modern childhood . But there is , Mintz rightly insists , no way back . <p> Diversity , not progress or decline , is Mintz 's overarching theme . The diversity covers gender , religion , ethnicity , geography , demography , and chronology . But the diversity to which Mintz gives greatest weight is class . It is , and presumably always was , " the most significant determinant of children 's well-being " ( p. ix ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely economic explanations for the spread of the ideas of modern childhood , whether there is a Marxisant Mintz struggling to come out . What would the history of childhood look like if we wrote it as part of the history of class rather than as part of the history of the nation ? It would be deeply unfashionable to do so , but might yield insights to which at present we are blinded . The focus would be on slave children , two million of them on the eve of the Civil War ; on the 100,000 children in the 1900s whose childhood was spent in one of 1,200 orphanages ; on the 30,000 Native American children who in any one year in the early twentieth century lived in boarding schools designed to separate them from their culture ; on the children living in poverty , 16 percent of all children in 2002 , higher than it had been thirty years previously . It would be possible to ascribe the state of many of these children to ethnicity , but what they all had in common was poverty--and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents to children . Put another way , they were the victims of a class structure . As Mintz so appositely points out , the very economic circumstances that allowed for the invention of a protected middle-class childhood were also the ones that condemned so many children to labor in factories and mines . <p> A focus on class and power might lead us to examine more closely what became a defining experience of childhood in the modern phase : school . School can , of course , be represented as the means of escape from poverty and powerlessness , and in the United States there are strong ideological reasons why it should be so seen . But it was also a site of power , in part simply between adult teacher and child student , but also between middle and working class . Mintz rather dutifully chronicles the rise in the number and proportion of children in school , and reflects at some length on the role of the high school in molding children . But he does not spend much time inside the classroom , exploring the dynamics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult area to access , and to do so one has to cut through the largely institutional accounts that clutter up the shelves that constitute the history of education , but it might reveal more about childhood than what Mintz tends to concentrate on , the media and childhood , a topic likely to provoke either alarm , or , as one comes within living memory , nostalgia--and there is quite a lot of nostalgia for baby boomers to suck up in the latter chapters of this book. 2 <p> Huck 's Raft has provoked these thoughts . It is , to repeat , an excellent book : wise , moving , and stimulating . It forces us to reflect on the peculiarities of childhood in the early twenty-first century--and it offers us no easy solutions . At the same time it invites us to reflect on how we now write the history of childhood . For about twenty years between the 1970s and the 1990s the history of childhood was in large part a history of parenting . It was also , and has always been , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century did the focus change to trying to give the child a voice , to make children agents .

@@40786688 @786688/ <p> Reviewed by J. Michael Ryan ( Department of Sociology , University of Maryland , College Park ) Published on H-Urban ( December , 2005 ) <p> In Which the Middle Class Goes Shopping <p> In Point of Purchase , sociologist Sharon Zukin makes the often complicated ideas of consumer culture and history accessible to the people who are most directly affected by such a culture . Through an examination of both the social geographies of shopping and the less tangible consumer mentalities found therein , Zukin presents a convincing argument of how , as the subtitle of the book implies , shopping has changed American culture . While many other books have successfully linked culture with consumption , they have done so at the expense of readability. 1 Zukin 's book for a general audience suffers no such problem . <p> That said , however , Zukin 's approach is notably inflected by her personal experiences as an upper-middle-class , female sociology professor living in New York City 's Greenwich Village . When Zukin writes of the Internet , Zagat 's dining guide , or a farmers market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a particular type of culture , one less accessible to those outside of Zukin 's general demographic profile . <p> Point of Purchase could be viewed as a type of consumer ethnography and thus prone to many of the same merits and flaws of traditional or even critical ethnographies . While the use of individual stories , such as those of Julia and Artemio , can be useful in problematizing larger issues , they can also fall prey to nuanced individual concerns . For example , while the discussion of the Internet is fruitful to those of us privileged to have access to it and certainly one important way that an upper crust of American society has changed , it generally suffers from a sort of technological elitism . Similarly , a cultural elitism appears in the discussions of consumer guides woven throughout the book . Zukin sees consumer guides--most notably Zagat's--as honest brokers between producers and consumers and performing a type of market research in reverse . To consult a guide like Zagat 's , however , requires a certain amount of cultural and economic capital--a requirement not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy the guide in the first place . Private issues do not always make for public concerns . To this end , Zukin 's larger point about a change in American culture--or what should really be called consumer culture--relies more on the reader 's ability to identify with the specific examples used rather than on any hard-nosed empirical or theoretical evidence . <p> " Low " culture , however , is not absent from the analysis . There are substantive references to middle-class consumption icons such as the Gap , and working-class favorites such as Wal-Mart . These institutions , however , are discussed primarily in terms of the cultural domains from which they originate . For example , Zukin 's discussion of Wal-Mart is mostly limited to its effects on small-town middle America , with no consideration of its impact in major cities . The reverse is also true : her analyses of Neiman-Marcus and Woolworth 's are restricted to their impacts in major cities , with little indication of how these companies have affected rural America . <p> Zukin treats one retail establishment in particular , K-Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her analyses of Woolworth 's or Wal-Mart . In recent years , K-Mart has run the gamut of retail fortunes from bankruptcy to renewed profits , and thus could represent a range of issues related to shopping in American culture , especially in terms of contemporary " low " culture consumption . But Zukin uses anecdotes drawn from her local K-Mart in Greenwich Village , a store located anomalously in a major metropolis and thus not likely representative of the " true " K-Mart experience . K-Mart , and other discount stores , are most often located in the outskirts , suburbs , and exurbs of major cities and only very rarely in their downtowns . Presumably , K-Mart shoppers from these areas would not come into the city simply to shop at a retailer they can find closer to home ( where it is probably larger to boot ) . Consequently , one can assume that the shoppers at the K-Mart near Zukin are most likely residents of Greenwich Village and therefore of an economic , social , and cultural demographic not characteristic of K-Mart shoppers elsewhere . Zukin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The author argues for the importance of social status over social class and , by doing so , again highlights the middle-class shopper . The glass front display window , the emergence of the discount store , and even Wal-Mart are cited as evidence that through consumption , one can achieve at least the appearance of a middle-class lifestyle . For example , when discussing Wal-Mart , Zukin says that the key to its success lies in its promise that " by shopping for brand names at bargain prices , all shoppers can be ' middle class ' " ( p. 84 ) . Zukin even asserts that " the great achievement of the universal store Wal-Mart is to surround us with both democracy and humanity " ( p. 88 ) . While others have made similar arguments about the democratizing possibilities of consumption settings , I do not believe that any one setting itself--least of all Wal-Mart--has become the realization of a status- rather than a class-based society. 2 At any rate , status and class in the world of retail can be seen as so highly correlated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most insightful and well-supported sections of the book is concerned with consumer mentality . Zukin makes the case for consumption as involving not only economic , but also cultural , capital , and drawing on not just markets , but also values . Thus , shopping is a process of learning about goods , not simply acquiring them . Zukin describes waves of consumer mentality--first in the 1930s with the earliest reviews of consumer products , then again in the 1960s when social changes shaped a new consumer mentality , and more recently in the 1980s when Reaganomics increasingly emphasized a company 's performance in the stock market . Zukin asserts : " Ultimately , a new culture depends not just on the production of consumer goods but on the production of consumers " ( p. 257 ) . <p> Zukin also turns a keen eye to sex differences in consumer culture . She sees consumption as a democratizing force but one that also segregates the sexes in many respects . For example , she asserts that men spend more time researching their purchases , picturing themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picturing themselves in the perfect outfit . Women shop more for the home and family , while men shop more for electronics and cars . Men are more likely to purchase brand names , while women are more apt to go bargain-hunting . These are indeed cultural truisms , but I , as a man quite attuned to shopping , with many visions of myself in the perfect outfit , still hunt for bargains . Would the democratizing potential of consumption really stop at sex lines ? Is there a discrepancy between actual and reported activities--particularly among men in this country who might fear admitting to their fashion sensitivity ? Or are women , in fact , more capable navigators of the seas of consumption ? <p> These objections aside , Zukin 's analysis of the department store and her approach to shopping in general make a number of powerful arguments about not only the effects of shopping on American culture but also the effects of American culture--particularly with respect to race , demeanor , and Internet access--on shopping . For example , in her case study of Artemio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tiffany 's , but is tailed by security staff , we are able to see both how shopping has influenced race in American culture and how American culture has influenced shopping . Zukin does not clarify , however , whether in Artemio 's case it is the color of his skin or his " urban style " of clothing that led to his mistreatment . As Zukin points out elsewhere , one must also learn how to dress to shop . <p> True to her goal , Zukin does not leave us feeling hopeless OR awash in a sea of unbridled consumer ecstasy , but rather more sensitized to why , and how , ( some ) Americans shop . Zukin offers an epilogue with several useful approaches to counter prevailing aggressive marketing strategies , chief among them being her local farmer 's market . A farmer 's market , she argues , not only allows one to get back in touch with the products , but it also provides , much like the Greek agora , a public space , where political activism and civic engagement can potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farmer 's market to act as a rejuvenating space for community-building in a commercial setting , I do not view these markets as widely prescriptive . They are still limited in accessibility , both geographically and to those who have sufficient time to seek them out and peruse their offerings . Thus , like her analysis of many of the problems presented throughout the book , the solutions Zukin offers are keenly insightful but woefully limited .

Ira Berlin charges to the aid of all who labor to demonstrate that slavery entailed meaningful change across three evolutionary centuries . Generations of Captivity offers a reflective synthesis and broad narrative . Moving fluidly , the author navigates the current of historical transition from one era to another and one region to another . Throughout , Berlin has crafted a trenchant review of the salient elements of African-American enslavement . One of the author 's stated goals is to draw upon the abundance of new scholarship ( well over two hundred books ) during the five years since his highly acclaimed Many Thousands Gone . The number itself is a testament to the fecund nature of recent slave historiography and the valuable service offered through Berlin 's efforts . He reminds us that , like all other human interactions , slavery also rested on a continual process of negotiation . <p> Neatly divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research model beginning with the appropriately titled " charter " generations . Slavery 's formative years , by default , will always remain shrouded beneath a greater degree of mystery than antebellum slavery . Nevertheless , Berlin is perhaps at his boldest when he affirms the significance of the charter period and its key players : Atlantic creoles . Influenced by two centuries of European contact along coastal Africa and often finding themselves in the West Indies prior to their mainland arrival , creoles seemingly possessed a cosmopolitan sagaciousness born of their unique context . Anthony Johnson , perhaps the most well-documented instance of seventeenth-century creolization , represented the possibilities before the legal codification of racism in colonial Chesapeake Bay . Berlin does not limit himself only to the famous example of Johnson . However , his inclusion of the free black tobacco planter is indicative of both Johnson 's significance and the constraints of limited evidence from American slavery 's genesis . Berlin reminds us that one of the distinctive features of the charter generations was their diminutive size relative to their influence . It remains a tantalizing notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Johnson 's great-grandchildren prospered alongside eighteenth-century white neighbors . Instead , they became the objects of financial security in reflection of the circumscribed nature of their ancestors ' influence . <p> Moving the schema forward , Berlin examines " plantation " generations . Although the degradation of black life possessed numerous sources , " the largest was the growth of the plantation " ( p. 54 ) . Indeed , degradation is the fundamental variable which shadows the emergence of this new paradigm . Whereas creoles experienced racism , they nevertheless existed in something like an embryonic phase of potential societal development . The future remained to be set . The plantation changed that . It emerged as midwife and oversaw the birth of institutionalized racism sustained by the growth of agricultural capitalism . The monolithic scope of these new plantations exerted an inescapable gravitational pull . Everything soon moved around them in a prescribed orbit . Both their size and insatiable labor needs fundamentally altered eighteenth-century America . Most importantly , Atlantic creoles ( such as the Johnsons ) largely disappeared from the colonial landscape . Berlin places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor could no longer be met via the West Indies ' surplus or from limited experimentation with enslaved Native Americans . African slaves from the continent 's interior now composed the bulk of forced migrants to colonial America . Unlike their " charter " generation predecessors , they increasingly relied on preserving past cultural links as a means to endure an impossible situation . Planters likewise found themselves in the midst of a generational transition . Consolidation of resources necessitated consolidation of power . A new sense of white mastery yielded a reciprocal increase in societal hierarchy . Lastly , Berlin spreads his analysis beyond the Atlantic South to the Gulf Coast and the North as he offers a balanced appraisal of slavery 's significance throughout colonial America . While this was not Berlin 's purpose , it stands as an important rebuttal to the prevalent misconception outside academia that many historians seem either unaware or unconcerned about slavery 's existence in the North. 1 <p> Next , Berlin ushers in the broadly defined " revolutionary " generations .

The accompanying emphasis on gradual emancipation and the opposing influence of cotton yielded a more thoroughly dichotomized nation . Berlin carefully weighs the limited gains of a " free " North in the midst of what Don Fehrenbacher called a " slaveholding republic . " While this is familiar ground , Berlin skillfully constructs the foundation for what may become the most enduring section of the book . <p> " Migration " generations illustrates African-American enslavement at its zenith as an institution ; fiercely disruptive and passionately contested , it shaped every facet of American life . While previous chapters chronologically cover the same material as Many Thousands Gone , this section moves into new territory . Berlin reaffirms how different slavery looked at the end of the eighteenth century compared with the middle of the nineteenth . Cotton cultivation , residence in the black belt , and Christianity all emerged as new components during this period . He correctly points out that the specific reasons why this happened remain imprecise . Certainly , this will serve as an impetus for new studies by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed analysis of an imperfectly understood process . <p> The chapter also provides what may become one of Berlin 's more memorable contributions to the arena of interpretive discourse . He describes the forced migrations of the nineteenth century as a " Second Middle Passage , " thus offering a potent metaphor for those who wish to either agree or dispute the veracity of the accompanying mental image . Berlin interprets this generational phenomenon in the strongest language : " it was the central event in the lives of African-American people between the American Revolution and slavery 's final demise in December 1865 " ( p. 161 ) . Berlin concludes the entire book with an epilogue and gives a parting nod to the existence of " freedom " generations and its array of unique challenges . <p> Overall , criticisms of this work are more likely to revolve around form instead of substance . Some readers may question how successfully Berlin proved his assertion in the prologue that the better analytical framework for U.S. history is found in the binary distinction between slaves and slaveholders rather than slavery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation 's inhabitants , white nonslaveholders , who neither owned nor were themselves owned by others . Arguably , the division between slavery and freedom still retains greater interpretive flexibility . Berlin 's work also stands as an important barometer , indicative of the current climate as well as the future " weather " within the field . Although it was not emphasized in this review , Generations of Captivity is a vigorous affirmation of the seminal importance of human " agency " and its continuing historiographic vitality . If this book is any indication , the forecast for slavery studies suggests a continuation of the " reign " of agency. 2 This award-winning sequel to Many Thousands Gone is an admirable compliment to the author 's sweeping overview of slavery in America . It further solidifies Ira Berlin 's secure standing as one of the generation 's preeminent scholars on the topic . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

The Coloquio , in fact , is in its entirety a citation of the Casamiento . This essay focuses on different aspects of citation in the Casamiento / Coloquio ? citation being understood as the explicit or implicit attribution of words to someone regardless of whether those words are actually repeated , altered somehow or invented . My aim is to sketch out the workings of citation theoretically in the Casamiento / Coloquio . Like Don Quixote , the Casamiento / Coloquio is one of those exceptional texts that provide extreme and sometimes bizarre examples of widespread novelistic practices , and thus invite theoretical inquiry on their own grounds . I am especially interested in what happens to language which , when quoted , becomes something quite other than what it was . This certainly happens when it passes from one sort of discourse to another , from one character type to another , one worldview or set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set of circumstances to another , and so forth . In such cases words come to take on a markedly different significance and orientation every time they are quoted . When this occurs repeatedly , the ever-expanding transmission itself elaborates on its own true or fictive history of intermediate transmissive events and their various contexts ; cited language thus becomes densely populated with recognizable faces , as it were . I shall characterize citation as a complex process composed of the simultaneous enactment and displaced reenactments of many communicative events . The very fact that such citation is differential , dialogic , ? otherizing , ? implies an active relationship between citing and cited discourses . In the Casamiento / Coloquio , discursive interaction brings about a refraction of value and viewpoint and a consequent loss of discursive authority on the part of most participants . In order to bring novelistic citation into relief , I shall contrast it with multiple citation in a radically different body of texts , the Islamic hadith , or ? traditions. ? 3 Because the hadith , associated with the sacred , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Islam to protect them from alteration and forgery . Means were devised to isolate cited discourse from both discursive and <p> 3 To avoid confusion , I shall use the singular form hadith ( and not the plural ahadith for plural as well as singular meaning . <p> 8 ( 1988 ) <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 143 <p> circumstantial context and thereby ? at best ? preserve its integral authority over centuries . In many ways the hadith are poles apart from Cervantes ' novela with respect to citation . Nowhere in the Casamiento / Coloquio do strata of citation run deeper than when la Camacha , a sorceress , utters a divination concerning the fate of two puppies to which her fellow sorceress la Montiela has given birth : <p> La Montiela transcribes and memorizes these lines and somehow passes them on to a third witch , la Caizares , 5 who in turn cites them in a much longer discourse spoken to the dog Berganza , whom she identifies as one of her friend 's litter . Much later Berganza quotes Caizares ' monologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his canine companion Cipi=n , who repeats the divination and subjects it to a skeptical critique . A delirious ensign named Campuzano , for his part , claims to have overheard the dogs ' dialogue and to have transcribed it faithfully while recovering from syphilis at the Hospital de la Resurrecci=n . His friend Peralta , after hearing Campuzano 's own account of events leading to the illness ( the subject of the <p> Forcione discusses the literary sources of this divination ( 44-48 ) . There are two minor discrepancies between Cipi=n 's version ( 346 ) and Berganza 's ( 338 ) . These could well be Cervantes ' inadvertent errors : he is not , after all , renowned for accurate citation . Or they could be attributed to numerous others , ranging from the dogs to Cervantes ' typesetters.5 There is an ambiguity here concerning whether la Caizares is present at the deathbed scene and hears the divination directly , or whether she receives it from la Montiela . Because of the text 's insistence on la Camacha 's speaking to la Montiela ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ; ? ? Esto dijo la Camacha a tu madre . . . , ? 338-39 ) , I favor the latter . If this is the case , a further ambiguity concerns how la Caizares comes to know the prophecy , whether by reading or listening ( ? Tom=lo tu madre por escrito y de memoria , y yo lo fijT en la mfa . . . ? ) . <p> 144 <p> STEVEN HUTCHINSON <p> Cervantes <p> Casamiento ) reads the manuscript of the Coloquio as fiction . All of this is conveyed by a nameless narrator , and the narration as a whole is of course Cervantes ' written text . The poetic lines are thus produced and reproduced in many discursive events occurring in different times and places and on different ontological planes . Yet they only appear twice in the text we read , once within Berganza 's life story told to Cipi=n and the other time as Cipi=n 's citation of them back to Berganza in the same dialogue . Significantly , maximum depth of citation corresponds exactly to the crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophecy several times as a possible key to the mystery of the dogs ' origin and sudden powers of speech . Cipi=n singles it out for exegesis and rejection . La Caizares ( like Berganza ) centers her discourse on it . La Montiela dies of grief upon hearing it along with la Camacha 's confession of having performed the malicious sorcery . And la Camacha utters the divination on her own deathbed.6 Vital interests and discursive interests coincide to produce multiple citation . The following discursive levels are active precisely when the divination appears for the second time in the novela : <p> LEVEL <p> WRITER / SPEAKER <p> TEXT / UTTERANCE <p> READER / LISTENER <p> MEDIUM <p> MODE <p> Ia <p> Cervantes ( as novelist ) <p> Casamiento / Coloquio ( as novelas ) <p> reader(s) <p> written <p> fictive / novelistic <p> Ib <p> narrator <p> Casamiento / Coloquio ( as historias ) <p> narratee(s) <p> quasi-oral <p> narrative informative <p> IIa <p> Campuzano ( ? novelist ? ) <p> Coloquio ( as novela ) <p> Peralta <p> written <p> fictive / novelistic <p> IIb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> narratee(s) ( fictive ) <p> written <p> transcriptive <p> III <p> Cipi=n <p> critical interruption <p> Berganza / ( Campuzano ) <p> oral <p> analytic / evaluative <p> IV <p> Berganza <p> life story <p> Cipi=n / ( Campuzano ) <p> oral <p> narrative / informative <p> V <p> Caizares <p> birth of dogs / witchcraft , etc . <p> Berganza <p> oral <p> narrative / informative <p> VI <p> Montiela <p> divination <p> Caizares <p> written / also oral ? <p> transcriptive <p> VII <p> Camacha <p> divination <p> Montiela <p> oral <p> prophetic <p> 6 Ruth E1 Saffar analyzes both the anticipation and the centrality of the witch episode in her study Cervantes : El casamiento engaoso and El coloquio de los perros , 59-70 . See also sections devoted to these novelas in her Novel to Romance , especially 72-81 . <p> 8 ( 1988 ) <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 145 <p> One should bear in mind , firstly , that this artificial scheme , whose ? levels ? are really communicative events and their reenactment , corresponds to only one moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? merely for lack of an appropriate word ; there are no ? levels ? as such in discourse . ) Just before and after Cipi=n quotes the divination ( III ) , levels IV through VII disappear entirely . When Berganza utters the prophecy ( IV ) , in contrast , all levels except number III of the above scheme are simultaneously active ; just before and after his citation of the prophecy , all but levels III , VI and VII are active . Given such mutability from one moment to the next , it would be pointless to try to establish a ? discursive structure ? for the double novela as a whole without taking temporality into account.7 Outside the text the number of levels is likewise unstable , because if I quote or misquote la Camacha 's divination and someone else reads or listens to this , or if we discover that the divination is itself a quotation of some extratextual source ? la Camacha , after all , was tried and sentenced by the Inquisition for sorcery before Cervantes made her ( or rather her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character ? more levels can be added indefinitely . Secondly , I have arbitrarily chosen to subdivide levels I and II , since both involve author / narrator and reader / narratee ( and thus also invention / transmission ) distinctions that are clearly of a different order from the relationship between any consecutive ? levels ? as such . In levels VII through IIb ? to follow the order of events ? one character says or writes something that is heard or overheard or read by another character , who in turn cites part or all of this some time later in his or her own discourse , and so on ; the result is a chain of verbal transmission from one character to another . The knowledge of an ? omniscient ? narrator unites levels I and II , embracing the entire narration and all levels of citation . Thirdly , level III is clearly anomalous because what Cipi=n says would normally be located at the same level as what Berganza says , both dogs being engaged in a dialogue that is overheard by Campuzano , but here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interposes itself between Berganza 's speech and <p> 7 JosT Maria Pozuelo attempts to produce such a scheme for the novela . The result is applicable neither to the entire novela , since narrative strata continually change , nor to any particular moment in the text , since both Campuzano 's autobiographical tale and his Colloquy are made to occupy different levels of the hierarchy at the same time , whereas in fact they should be somehow parallel and mutually exclusive in terms of discursive time . Pozuelo also seems to be unaware of several levels of enunciation / reception . John Barth ( 54 ) much more successfully plots out complex citation in other works by taking temporality into account . <p> 146 <p> STEVEN HUTCHINSON <p> Cervantes <p> Campuzano 's transcription of it . Whereas swallowing another 's discourse more or less whole is the norm in levels VII through IIb , Cipi=n at level III does not include Berganza 's life story in his discourse but rather interrupts that story to quote and comment upon a fragment of it . In terms of the reconstructed order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ? ascending ? chain of transmission is thus established with no fewer than six links ( VII to IIb before level IIa reveals the entire discursive chain ? below ? it to be as counterfeit as the fake gold chain Campuzano used to deceive other characters in the Casamiento engaoso ( 290-91 ) . What such discourse loses in authenticity it more than makes up for by the artistry that has gone into its ? forgery. ? Such , at least , is the opinion of Peralta , who reads as fictive a manuscript presented to him as factually true , praising its ? invenci=n ? ( 359 ) . Moreover , Campuzano 's discursive counterfeiting itself turns out to be counterfeit within Cervantes ' fiction . The prophecy 's transmission moves forwards in time through disparate communicative events , while those events are doubly invented , projected backwards into a putative past that is made for them . The cited prophecy undoubtedly figures among the most resonant moments in all of Western literature . John Barth , in his study ? Tales within Tales within Tales , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , levels of citing and cited discourses active at any one moment in the text . Cervantes , with his multi-discursive finale to the Novelas ejemplares , could well be inviting his readers to take part in a profound literary game , one that reveals some of the secrets of fiction-making . The study of verbal transmission / invention has led me rather far afield to a cursory comparative survey of identical issues in very different texts , the Islamic hadith , which reported the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad in chains of communicative events extending across the first few centuries of Islam . Much can in fact be learned from the rigorous discipline that began to emerge in the 2nd century A. H. ( 8th century A. D. ) out of the need to distinguish true or reliable hadith from false or ? weak ? ones among the many thousands extant at the time . Such distinctions were essential because the reported sayings of the Prophet had , for the mainstream Sunni Muslims , become the most important source of ethical guidance apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the isnad , or chain of <p> 8 ( 1988 ) <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 147 <p> transmission ( literally ? support , ? ? prop ? ) , and the matn ( ? body ? or ? text ? ) . In the words of one scholar , the hadith would typically adopt the following formula : ? It was related to me by A , on the authority of B , on the authority of C , on the authority of D , from E ( here a companion of Muhammad ) that the Prophet said : ? . . . ? ? and the matn would follow ( Cragg 537 ) . The isnad could of course vary greatly in the number of transmitters . Those cited included women and men , people of all social strata , the learned and ignorant , the faithful and heretical . It should also be noted that both writing and speech were cited as authority : manuscripts could be cited orally and speech transcribed ( Siddiqi , 43-44 , 100 , 160 ) . The matn would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb , aphorism , brief dialogue or anecdote whose sense might apply to a range of new contexts , as may be appreciated in Ibn Hazm 's Collar de la paloma ( 174-76 ) . Zealous concern for the accuracy and authenticity of transmission is more than understandable given the religious and cultural importance of the hadith . Interestingly , the practice of attaching an isnad to received discourse extended to other genres of literature and science in Arabic , including instances of fictive narrative in which authors would record all the extraneous facts of a story 's transmission ? who told it to whom , and where , and so on ? before actually telling the story itself ( Siddiqi 141-42 ) . Trivial as some of these instances may be , widespread use of the isnad attests to an extraordinary preoccupation with traditio and to an unusual wariness with regard to transmitted discourse . So important was the specificity of transmission that when two traditions were textually identical but diverged in isnad , they were regarded as completely different hadnth . ( Siddiqi 164 ) . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly the full force of hadith criticism fell on the isnad : it was a matter of examining the chain of transmission . The most meticulous chronologies and tens of thousands of biographies were established to determine not only the whereabouts and contacts of transmitters at different times but more importantly to judge their character , intentions , memory , social standing and affiliations in terms of reliability . Techniques of interpreting and comparing hadith became extremely refined . The strictest criteria were thus set up to discern whether any given hadith was authentic or forged , ? healthy ? or ? infirm , ? etc . Ironically , criteria for authenticity became so acute that any new hadith conforming to them might for that very reason be highly suspect ; one may surmise that after a while the science of hadith had to take this paradox into <p> 148 <p> STEVEN HUTCHINSON <p> Cervantes <p> account and establish new criteria to detect forgeries that satisfied its old criteria . Faulty memory , ? story-telling ? ( qisas ) , piety at the expense of truth , heresy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered principal causes undermining the validity of traditions ( Siddiqi 52-59 , 127-29 ) . Hence a sophisticated discipline emerged whose object of inquiry , regardless of its specific scope and practical purposes , was nothing other than verbal transmission and invention . Under ideal circumstances , the chain of corroboration would presumably preserve the integrity of the matn across vast expanses of time : nothing would be changed in the matn , no voices would be added to it , no accents , no traces , no circumstances of telling , except inevitably those of the most immediate source . A strong link in such a chain would serve as a partial guarantee of the transmitted words : the stronger the link the less it would interfere with the message itself . The importance of who speaks or writes , and who listens or reads , would ultimately balance on the crux of reliability , for once this is decided upon , the isnad has fulfilled its footnoting function for better or for worse , and the quoted passage is judged on a linear scale of authenticity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mainly of interest to the extent that they strengthen or weaken the claims of authority implicit in any hadith . The basic formula for the isnad of course suppresses such particulars in favor of a chain of names , and in doing so it dissolves the verbal and extraverbal context in which the matn was reportedly quoted . This context , in which someone previously found the hadith worth citing and placed it in some wider discourse or compilation or life circumstance , disappears at every instance of re-transmission unless the teller or writer deviates from the formula . Thus the circumstances of reception are effaced at the moment of retransmission . The bare form of the isnad therefore not only serves to authenticate the hadith as a whole but also , by taking the citation continually out of context , preserves it as something set within but detachable from the context in which it was uttered or written , and ensures against any lasting intervention by discourses or circumstances alien to it . The isnad puts many pairs of quotation marks around the matn without allowing any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text . It presents the matn as coextensively quoted time and again , adding only a name for each communicative event . Discursive levels representing the sequence of transmissive events may be reconstructed here , but since the matn is <p> 8 ( 1988 ) <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 149 <p> taken to be practically identical at every stage , only a pair of names , those of the addresser and the addressee , would distinguish one level from another . Previous transmitters are dispossessed of the discourse in which they cite the tradition , with the result that the hadith provided it is thought to be sound , retains its original authority : the alleged words of the prophet or a witness 's account of his actions come to inhabit the present without bringing with them the many discursive contexts in which they have been transmitted . The isnad thus isolates its citation from much of the refraction that inevitably occurs when wider discourses enclose it . The transmitters play a sort of guardian 's role with regard to the words they cite : their function is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words themselves come from a source whose authority they can never attain . When the isnad was believed to be weak or apocryphal , the hadith as a whole would obviously lose all credibility and be separated from the canon . The loss of authority nullified the tradition entirely . The science of hadith so geared to discovering the reasons why people invented hadith , could abandon its investigation at this point . Understandably , once a hadith was considered to be fiction , it became devoid of interest except perhaps insofar as it might aid in detecting other false traditions . In most respects , the multiple citation of Cervantes ' double novela behaves very differently from that of hadith . Above all , there tends to be an ever-widening sphere of discursive contexts with each new quotation of a quotation . An essential part of this expansion involves recontextualizing others ' discourses in one 's own , framing them in such a way that they make sense in new circumstances . Berganza , for example , tells Cipi=n about his encounter with la Caizares both before and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his part , tells his friend Peralta about the dogs before handing him the manuscript of the Coloquio , which supposedly cites everything the dogs talked about , and everything they cited . Through this snowballing , or what I would call augmentative citation as opposed to coextensive citation , alleged acts of communication themselves become part of the narration : tellers , listeners , writers and readers in turn all become figured within and around the discourse they have produced as objects of ever new discourses . Those involved in transmitting hadith , in contrast , become a string of names outside the citation ( matn ) . In the Casamiento / Coloquio , the previous telling becomes told with each citation : discours , while remaining discours with respect to the <p> 150 <p> STEVEN HUTCHINSON <p> Cervantes <p> language it governs , turns into histoire when objectified by another discourse . Narration becomes a narrated event which in turn becomes the narrated event of a narrated event , and so on to about the ninth power . Citation temporally aligns communicative events word for word to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the past of any framing discourse , citation itself involves transposing the once here-and-now of the cited discourse into the present here-and-now . Thus discrete communicative processes belonging to different times are made simultaneous when represented through direct discourse . As we read la Camacha 's divination , the almost unfathomable time-frames of transmission ( or invention ) , reception and reference artificially coincide with our own reading time . This also occurs in the hadith , except that the isnad , by stripping away discursive contexts , all but mutes awareness of intermediate communicative events and their time-frames . To complicate matters further , all the basic types of temporal relations between discours and histoire ? as defined by Genette ? function simultaneously in Cervantes ' text ( Figures III 228-34 ) . Characters narrate events after they happen , while they happen ( e.g. , when ; he dogs speak about what they are doing : speaking ) , before they happen ( e.g. , the divination itself ) , and in the interstices between which they happen . Hence a series of pasts , presents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are superimposed one on another . Distinct values and viewpoints of each process of transmission / invention or reception come into play with those of other such processes . For instance , despite his own limited understanding , Berganza takes la Caizares ' already complex understanding of events into account to the extent that his discourse incorporates , allows room for and interacts with her cited discourse . The interplay of understanding within single characters should not be overlooked in this regard : Berganza , as listener to la Caizares , as teller of his own life-story , and as listener to Cipi=n , behaves variously according to the three discursive situations . So much discursive activity means , of course , that an extraordinary number of minds , both real and imaginary , are simultaneously active in the text , engaged in reading , writing , speaking , listening . There is a compounding of minds , each caught in distinct vital circumstances , each viewing things differently , each with its own active memory and sense of anticipation , each involved in communicative activity . Discourse itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 151 <p> the normal one-word-at-a-time constraints of written and spoken discourse while seeming to conform to them . Though one word follows another on the page , citation provides a means whereby every word becomes many words . The processes of discourse themselves come into such powerful focus in the Casamiento / Coloquio that they turn into more than a medium of expression : they are to an important extent the object of expression in this novelistic discourse about discourse . Nearly every character draws attention explicitly to the ongoing discourse he or she is engaged in by affirming its truth and accuracy or by expressing criticism , doubts , amazement , etc . At the level of the dogs , in particular , this self-consciousness intervenes and monitors speech at every turn . Such awareness and self-referentiality on the part of characters regarding their own and others ' discourse , together with our knowledge that the text we read is being read by a character while the fictitious author sleeps , are bound to make us uncannily self-conscious while reading and perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text , one thus becomes aware of many processes , chronotopes and viewpoints operant at the same time . Augmentative citation arranges , condenses and polyphonizes discourse . Readers are likely to find their attention here and now divided into many elsewheres and other times in which the discourses and their objects are imagined to take place . Their divided focus distributes itself unevenly among many discursive processes , for some of these intrinsically call more attention to themselves than others . Indeed , as occurs in hadith , some processes are almost entirely hidden , such as la Montiela 's transcription of the divination . Others stand out strongly . Among the determining criteria involved here are the extent to which anyone 's discourse focuses on material other than what it cites , the degree to which any character refers to any other character and his or her discourse , and the ways in which one discourse sets itself apart from ? or integrates itself with ? the discourse it cites . Character groups themselves , made up of ( 1 ) the witches / sorceresses , ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licenciate , zone discourse in their own peculiar ways : each group or pair manifests a social coherence and shares a worldview ? and hence an orientation towards language ? very different from that of the others . Changes of medium also accentuate contours between one discourse and another since these set up radically different relationships of transmission and reception . Again and again <p> 152 <p> STEVEN HUTCHINSON <p> Cervantes <p> textuality incribes orality , which in turn frames textuality by speaking around it and about it . As in the hadith there is no inevitable or irreversible switch from one to the other , though ? transmission ? does pass through a definitive textual stage in both the hadith and the Casamiento / Coloquio in the form of the canonical compilations and the novela , respectively . Yet if there is one sort of discursive activity that remains in the dark , it is writing . One sees the results of writing , but there are no witnesses to the activity itself . When characters in the novela refer to writing ( their own or others ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it were a simple act . Even Cervantes , in his prologue to the Novelas ejemplares , is remarkably reticent with regard to the process of writing . If the simplest act of quotation sets up a two-way relationship between discourses , the interrelationships of multiple citation increase geometrically . Moreover , the discourses in the double novela most often relate to each other through other discourses , whose mediation destabilizes the text to the point of vertigo . Our only access to la Camacha 's prophecy is through the language of so many mediators , all of whom necessarily recreate everything they cite . Qualitatively , too , citation in the Casamiento / Coloquio brings about surprisingly complex relationships due to diverse ways in which discourses interact . I find that in order to characterize these relationships with even minimum adequacy , one has to resort to a wide range of ? principles ? and metaphors , many of them somehow anthropomorphic : citation is after all one of the most human activities after laughter . Antoine Compagnon , in his resourceful book on citation , invokes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities ? accommodating , working , playing , exchanging , possessing , tailoring , paper-cutting , and many more culled from various fields of action and knowledge ? and yet he might be the first to acknowledge the inexhaustibility of metaphors applicable to citation . Here , then , are a few of the ways I would characterize citation in the Casamiento / Coloquio . Most obviously , as in any act of citation , the quoting discourse claims to repeat another that has already unfolded . Accordingly , direct responsibility for the content of the quotation would fall mainly on whoever wrote or uttered it in the first place . The citer 's role would be that of a conveyor of language to which a distinct mind and voice , distinct circumstances and intentions , could be assigned . Multiple citation would involve tracing words back to an originating discourse . This is precisely how citation in reliable hadith is regarded . <p> 8 ( 1988 ) <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 153 <p> Yet by taking possession of quoted discourse , the quoter appropriates that other discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? other , ? something exogenous . The quoter defers to the citation , letting it unfold as though intact , preserving its alleged verbal integrity , while the quoting discourse appears to suspend its own internal development . At the same time , however , the quoter contextualizes the citation within his or her own discourse , adding voice and directionality to it and generally yoking it to certain purposes , as Bakhtin has so convincingly argued ( e.g. , Bakhtin 276-94 ; Volosinov and Bakhtin 228-34 ) . The quoting context orients and infiltrates into the quotation , while the latter finds itself surprised , as it were , in an alien context , mimicked by someone else for an alien audience . It goes without saying that even when words are quoted verbatim , as in Pierre Menard 's version of Don Quixote , 8 they are by no means the same words as before . When nonexistent discourses are ? cited , ? as in unreliable hadith they become almost pure functions of the citing discourses , yet retain their exogenous status ( a fictive status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through any internal phenomena ( e.g. , stylistic ) that somehow set the quoted discourse apart from the quoting one . In the Casamiento / Coloquio , the various nonexistent discourses of the witches and dogs reveal themselves as exponents of Campuzano 's fiction-making , and his discourse along with everything else in the double novela turns out to be an exponent of another authorial imagination . Each discourse , then , is bounded by linguistic / ideological markers and by the character to whom it is attributed , yet entirely infiltrated by intentionalities from ? above. ? The etymology of the verb to cite ? to set in motion ? suggests another essential aspect of quotation , that of a dual or multiple process in which a citing discourse revives another and sets it in motion , with the result that all discourses involved necessarily ? happen ? simultaneously . Such inert terms as ? structure , ? ? embedding , ? ? frame ? or even ? level , ? though difficult to avoid when talking about citation , tend to deny this movement by spatializing ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of quotation . These terms are of course a misleading legacy of structuralism , which characteristically abstracted process out of <p> narrative , even when temporality was the object of inquiry ; failure to recognize their artificiality and distortion precludes an adequate conceptualization of citation.9 To cite is to be active in discourse and activate another discourse , setting it in motion at the same time as one 's own and in the same direction , so to speak . Even the minimal formula of the isnad , often reducible to ? A said ( qala ) that B said that C said . . . ? concatenates simultaneous discursive processes . As I have already suggested , the Casamiento / Coloquio may be seen as a complex event in which discourses mobilize other discourses to their own purposes . How and why they do so is of key importance . Furthermore , quotation affects authority of discourse . In this respect , the hadith and the Casamiento / Coloquio are poles apart . The authority of the hadith , as we have seen , is already immanent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Prophet , but depends on the reliability of transmitters ; when any of these is considered suspect , the validity of the hadith as a whole is placed in jeopardy . In the Casamiento / Coloquio , the founding discourse is to be found not in what would be the most distant source ? la Camacha 's divination , for example ? but rather in the most immediate source , the novels themselves . Authority and authenticity are completely at odds , though Cervantes naturally makes use of the conventions of authenticity , of verbal transmission , as he undermines them . As sorceresses / witches or as dogs , the first five transmitters of the divination establish one of the most feeble chains of corroboration imaginable : witches and dogs in Cervantes ' ( and Peralta 's ) world possess little or no discursive authority . Yet judged according to how they verbalize experience , la Caizares , Berganza and Cipi=n would register remarkably high on the scale of reliability despite their self-doubts and close involvement with the events narrated . Where reliability breaks down entirely is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already in his own tale shown himself to be capable of delusion and thus of fiction-making ; the <p> 9 The classic structuralist analyses of narrative all elude questions concerning process , preferring to deal with a more stable entity , the textual product ( Levi-Strauss , Genette , Todorov . . . ) . Oddly enough , recent narratology seems not to have taken up the challenge of rethinking ? levels ? in terms of the dynamic processes involved ( e.g. , Bal , Rimmon-Kenan ) . Deconstruction , for its part , seems to be as entrapped as ever in this sort of terminology . <p> 8 ( 1988 ) <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 155 <p> presence of speaking dogs renders his text even more suspicious . At this point the manuscript of the Coloquio becomes revalued as invention , as artifice , intended for the mind 's recreation , as Peralta points out ( 359 ) . The breakdown of internal authority heightens the reader 's awareness of the fictional status of the double novela as a whole . This collapse is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits it or not , whether he knows it or not , has invented the colloquy he claims to have transcribed . Yet contrary to the transmission and criticism of hadith , there is also a direct attack on the matn itself ? the divination ? as well as on the sorceress who uttered it , in the form of Cipi=n 's critique . At the moment of utterance , the divination derives its authority from the proven power of the sorceress , from the highly specialized language of divinatory verse , and from the hold it claims to have over the future of Montiela 's offspring . Yet its ambivalent terms and dubious contingency clause render it more than suspect to Cipi=n : even if it were to come true , who could ever be sure that it had done so ? After considering implausible figurative and literal interpretations of the lines , the dog rejects the ? text ? itself as malicious nonsense and attributes this to the character and profession of the sorceress and her colleagues ( ? la Camacha fue burladora falsa , y la Caizares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ? ? 347 ) . Not only here but with each new speaker and listener , writer and reader , la Camacha 's unverifiable divination loses in prophetic authority and becomes enriched in meaning , adulterated in intentionality . Citation undermines the prophecy 's personal authority , poetic inviolability and control over the future . Even Cipi=n 's critique becomes text , undergoing a similar loss of authority as it is subordinated to alien values and intentions . Through ? transmission ? with its widening texts and contexts , speakers and writers in the Casamiento / Coloquio lose control of their own meanings and of their own being as authority dissipates outwards . Characters are unable to control what happens to their own discourse once someone else has appropriated it . In particular , Campuzano 's eavesdropping of discourse not intended for him , as well as his ? ghostwriting ? of a text not directly intended for us , demonstrates discursivity getting out of hand . Citation figures so insistently in the Casamiento / Coloquio that it ceases to be merely a technique : every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas citation in hadith literature strips away discursive contexts and strives to retain <p> 156 <p> STEVEN HUTCHINSON <p> Cervantes <p> the authority of the transmitted word , citation in the Cervantine text relativizes , decenters , undermines , recontextualizes , ironizes , enriches meaning ? to mention only a few of its effects . Any attempt to deal with the complex issues of value and meaning in the Casamiento / Coloquio therefore has to take into account the destabilizing effects of citation ? of transmission and invention , and corresponding reception . For this reason , simple moralistic statements in the criticism of the novela tend to fall flat . To deceive others or oneself , to act hypocritically , to engage in tropelfa ( making one thing appear to be another ( 337 ) , to participate in witches ' Sabbaths , to practice sorcery , to imagine talking dogs , to dream , to write fiction , to read it ? all of these are analogous activities in the novela , some positively and some negatively charged . I would argue that in the context of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adequately discussed without reference to their subtle interaction with the others . This means taking the complex discursive interplay of the novela fully into account . I would further hypothesize that although various episodes in the Casamiento / Coloquio resolve themselves , not one of the many discourses operant at the time that Cipi=n quotes the prophecy even approaches any kind of resolution . Nor does one discourse solve the problems of another discourse . Although writing may be a therapeutic diversion for Campuzano , his fiction can hardly be said to illuminate his own past or present circumstances . The various communicative encounters end inconclusively and give way to a present as openended as an unfulfilled and suspect prophecy . Augmentative citation contributes to this openendedness , since the recontextualization of discourses revives and reorients them ; it predisposes one to view discourse as uncontained and unfinished , as a praxis rather than a product . The citation of hadith is also unfinished , since what was once new ( the words and / or deeds of the Prophet ) is made new again with each telling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning ? to happen ? ( form I ) and ? to tell a happening ? ( form II ) , points at the same time to a primary event and its renewal through citation . In order to keep that happening new while externally supporting its authority , the isnad dissolves the intermediate events of citation with all their context , retaining only the insoluble names of the tellers . Thus , in the case of strong hadith , the matn is felt to be both immediate and verifiable despite the dubious medium of popular transmission over generations . The hadith typically allows one to ask what the Prophet said or <p> 8 ( 1988 ) <p> Counterfeit Chains of Discourse <p> 157 <p> did , according to whom , and what applicability this could have to life now . In the Casamiento / Coloquio , Cervantes pushes the techniques of citation about as far in the opposite direction as anyone has in Western literature , showing not their limits but their limitlessness despite discursive constraints . He exploits one of prose fiction 's integral features and richest resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wider aims of the double novela . Who , how , why , what for , for whom : these are some of the questions that emerge most insistently about every transmissive event . Citation in the Casamiento / Coloquio accumulates the circumstantiality of discourses about discourses so as to bring about a simultaneously mediated discursive process , heightening readers ' awareness of the multiple significance and intentionalities of the words cited . It show how citing and inventing in the novel are sometimes indistinguishable . It shows , moreover , how people or characters articulate their own discourses obliquely through the discourses of others ? and how novels cite their own invented discourses .

Mentawai has two schools , Uganda none ! The Faith is going ahead very rapidly in the South Pacific . <p> ( I asked when the " Regional National Assemblies would be de-regionalized . ) The teaching work is going forward well.The numbers are enough.The Assemblies are enough.But the African believers must gain experience , must learn how to administer the Faith.The must gain experience in administration ; they must be trained in administration . <p> In the formative Age the spirit of the Faith , born in the Heroic Age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Administrative Order , the establishment of the World Order and the flourishing of the World Civilization is a three-fold successive process .

( The Guardian was here speaking in the strongest terms against the excesses of materialism . ) Bahaullah established His Faith in Persia the most decadent nation on earth.The Persians were more barbarous than the savages of Africa.The World Order of Bahaullah will be established and has been started in America because it is now the most corrupt politically.The American nation is not altruistic in what it does.The American government lends money to other nations only to protect itself.Other nations know this and resent it , but they take the money.America is trying to buy friends.They wo n't succeed.It is too late to change the course of the world.The people of the world are impure.The world needs a blood-letting.The retributive calamity which is to come will be like a giant blood-letting through which the non-Bahais of the world will be purified.The Bahais are also impure and they will be purified through the opposition which will come to the Faith everywhere in the world.There are two processes of purification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retributive calamity , the purification of the Bahai world through the world-wide opposition to the Faith . <p> It is quite possible that the two-thirds of the earths population spoke of in the Bible will be annihilated.This is quite possible.The world is over-populated , and the blood of the people is impure.The retributive calamity will correct over-population problem this time.When the world is re-made , the advance of techniques and science will solve the problem of over-population in the Golden Age.Now , so much money is being used for armaments that there is no money with which to solve the population problem . <p> I have appealed directly in my messages for many years for the American Bahais to arise and pioneer and fill the needs of the Faith.But they did not respond.But why should they respond to my letters when they did not respond to the Master when he went there in person ? ! I shall never appeal to the American believers to pioneer again . <p> Abdul-Baha went to America to warn the nation and appeal to the believers.The Master was very sad at the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why he was so sad when he died.If you want to know the truth , history will record that the Masters mission to America was a failure because of the lack of response of the nation and the believers . ( The beloved Guardian was here speaking with considerable emotion ; and when he made this last statement about the failure of the Masters mission to America , he clenched his fist , brought it down soundlessly onto the table and turned side-wise from the table in his chair.The impact of his grief in rendering this verdict was truly heart-wrenching . ) <p> A retributive calamity which will be worse than war will come.It will appear suddenly not by degrees.It will take place in the twinkling of an eye.You will go to bed one night ; and when you wake up in the morning , it will be all over.You will know when it is coming.You will read about it in the newspapers and hear about it on the radio.You will recognize the signs of its coming.Read the newspaper editorial pages.The interpretation of the news is what is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large areas of the earth that become uninhabitable unarable.The southern continents will become more important in the future . <p> North America will be the worst affected especially the United States.The Bahais should not think that they have any special protection simply because they are Bahais.Their only protection is in their dedication to the Faith.The homes of the American Bahais will evaporate over-night.They will become refugees to other continents . <p> ( Turning specifically to me , he continued ) Kampala will be safe so long as they do n't  build American air bases in Kenya.The foothills of the Himalayas Mountains will also be safe . <p> You have trouble getting enough pioneers for Africa , but at that time the believers will come to Africa happily.They will come as refugees nothing in their hands.And they will be only too happy to come.You will have more help than you ever dreamed possible . <p> Russia will also suffer.When the Russians gain military equality with America , America will be trapped.Both the Russian system and the American system are wrong.Both are materialistic.Both are to be condemned by the Bahais.The Russians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control by the capitalists.Both are wrong . <p> Americas motives are not pure because they do not want to coalesce with other nations far from it.America must be purified by tribulations.Read the talks of Abdul-Baha in America.Read between the lines.He gently , tactfully warned them.But they did not heed his words . <p> In connection with the race problem in America , the Master said that the streets of New York would run with blood . ( At this point the Guardian asked the American pilgrims present at the dinner table if there had been any inter-racial marriages in the American Bahai community , but before a reply could be given he continued speaking . ) Even when there are such marriages , if you looked at them couple by couple and examined their individual motives in marrying , you would probably find impure motives , ( Ruhiyyih Khanum interjected at this point by remarking : " But , Shoghi Effendi , people in America only marry for love ! " ) Yes , they idolize love ; they only think of love.They idolize their wives ; they idolize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes ; they idolize their possessions.They have no principles just possessions . <p> There are three types of marriage being practiced in the world today.None of them conforms to the Bahai principles of marriage.The first is the so-called " romantic " marriage of the west.This is the least successful type of marriage.The second is the marriage of convenience practiced in Europe in which the marriage is intended to benefit the social or financial position of the partners and there is usually a mistress in the background.The third is the arranged marriage of the east of which there are several kinds.In the Bahai marriage the two people must choose each other , and the four parents must given their consent to the marriage.The two people study each others character before deciding to marry to make sure that there are no character traits in the other person which would in time become intolerable and become the cause of separation . <p> It is a sign of the times that the Faith in America is stagnant.The American Bahai community will pass through a period of transition when the believers will be almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American news are in my Convention message as compared to Africa and the Orient ? Their news bulletin contains only programs , agendas , marriages , death , etc.And they do no even know how to present the news of the victories of the Faith in other areas.The American " Bahai News " has become an international organ of news.But the Committee does not seem to know how to report the victories all over the world . <p> The black and the brown races will lead the world.They will rise up through materialism , education and other means.The white race will go down through the retributive calamity.An equipoise will be established among the nations , and then they will go forward into the World Commonwealth of the future on the basis of equality.The black race of Africa has been protected by God through their geographical isolation from the rest of the world.The African people will play a very important role in the World Commonwealth of the future . <p> The American people are too fond of their central heaters , their comforts.They are not willing to sacrifice.Victories come only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes and go pioneering ; they should go as far away as possible to the other ends of the earth.Otherwise they will go as refugees bankrupt both materially and spiritually.The Bahais should be willing to lower their standard of living in order to teach and serve the Faith.The Americans already have far too high a standard of living . <p> There is a great distinction between pioneering and dispersal.In the past I appealed to the American Bahais to pioneer to arise and sacrifice for the sake of the Faith and to meet the needs of the Faith.But when I saw that they did not respond to my appeals and saw in what danger they were , as a loving father I advised them to save themselves.I urged them to disperse to the farthest corners of the earth and to take with them all those things which they love more than the Faith : their money , their cars , they refrigerators their wives !

This is one of the very important things that he will do.Opposition to the next Manifestation will thus be much less than in former times that is to say , the area of opposition will be reduced .

( In response to a question about the distances and difficulties of travel in Africa , the Guardian said that this frequency of meeting with the Hands of the Cause should be " if feasible " . ) <p> The Bahais must teach the Faith through their conduct rectitude of conduct.The African people will look to the pioneers to be more kind , more just.You must administer the Faith with justice . <p> You should not fear the church.You should defend the Faith before the missionaries.The sooner the opposition comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition or cause it to come earlier than it should.The African believers should defend the Faith against the missionaries after consultation with the National Spiritual Assembly . ( The Guardian was notably enthusiastic about opposition . ) We must be careful with government and reckless with missionaries ! We must be very careful with the Government in South Africa . ( In using the word " reckless " with the missionaries , the Guardian seemed to expressing his zest for believers defense of the Faith before the missionaries.He clearly was not implying that the believers should be careless , foolish or rash in their contact with missionaries . ) <p> There are seven stages through which the Faith will pass in all countries in the course of its establishment and emergence : obscurity , repression , emancipation , recognition as an independent religion , establishment as the state religion , the emergence of a Bahai state and finally the coming into being of the Bahai World Commonwealth.In the various countries these stages may be either long or short , and in some places one or the other stage may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous evening , the Guardian spoke to Mrs. Alice Dudley about France . ) More American pioneers are needed in France pioneers who will settle and stay there whatever happens.We need French Olingas ! The pioneers to France and the French pioneers should follow the example of the African pioneers in settling and teaching . <p> ( The Guardian again told Mrs. Alice Dudley to go to the Balkans later , when it would be possible for her to leave France for a time . ) There are the most important places behind the Iron Curtain , as they were once independent states and soon will be so again . <p> 24th April . <p> ( Once again , as on the previous evening , the Guardian spoke of the functions of the Hands of the Cause and the Auxiliary Boards . ) The function of the Auxiliary Boards is to encourage the friends , to remind them of their duties and responsibilities , especially their responsibility to pioneer.The National Spiritual Assemblies should report the conditions and needs of the Faith to the Hands of the Cause , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and needs.The Auxiliary Board members should do what they can to meet these needs especially the need for pioneers . <p> The Hands of the Cause should travel as much as possible.When they do not have administrative duties , they should travel as much as possible.This is their responsibility to travel and encourage the friends.The Hands of the Cause on each continent must work and consult together as a body , and the Auxiliary Board members on each continent are responsible to this body of the Hands of the Cause on their continent . <p> There is a hierarchy in the Faith.You must not be afraid to teach the people that we have a hierarchy.In the west they do no like hierarchies , but they must understand that the Faith has a definite hierarchy.The Bahai hierarchy is composed as follows.At the top is the function of interpretation the Guardianship ; next comes protection eventually the function of the Hands of the Cause ; then comes propagation now in the hands of the Assemblies , but in the future the responsibility of the Hands of the Cause ; and finally administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hands protection and propagation , of the Assemblies government . <p> The believers should not be afraid to teach about the Bahai hierarchy.The Bahai hierarchy should be compared with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church the Pope , the Cardinals , the Archbishops , the Bishops , etc.In the Catholic Church individuals do the administering and groups do the teaching.It is the opposite in the Faith.Individuals are responsible for the teaching work the Hands of the Cause ; and the groups are responsible for the administration the Assemblies . <p> Later the Hands of the Cause will have all the teaching work in their charge.The Auxiliary Boards are only the beginning.Later the Hands of the Cause will have their own hierarchy with the Auxiliary Boards and each Auxiliary Board member having his own Committees to help him.Later the Assemblies are to be concerned only with government , and all the teaching work will be the responsibility of the Hands of the Cause . <p> I noticed in the Annual Report of the American National Assembly that a report of the Hands of the Cause is printed just ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cause are not on the same level as the National Committees.The friends do not understand.The Hands of the Cause rank far above the National Assemblies.The Hands do not report to the National Assemblies.On the contrary , the National Assemblies report to the Hands.The Hands of the Cause are to be venerated.In America today they do not know the meaning of the word veneration.Look how they treat their parents especially the youth of America.They must learn to venerate their parents.They must venerate the Hands of the Cause . <p> In England and Germany and , to a degree , in France the believers are disciplined , but it is not so in America and Africa.The friends must be reminded of their duties.The are holy duties.The African friends particularly must learn to accept their responsibilities.They must teach and take part in the Bahai administration . <p> Concerning drinking , the Bahais must learn to obey the Bahai law.They must be told and they must know that eventually they will have to obey the laws.You must tell them the laws ; then remind them that they must obey ; then warn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eventually they will have to obey the laws . <p> The believers in America should pioneer.The flow of pioneers has almost stopped.This is a great detriment to the Faith.America is a large reservoir which must not dry up.The pioneers should copy the example of Marion Jack " General " Jack.She was dedicated and consecrated.She did not leave her post despite the fact that I advised her to go . <p> ( The Guardian was asked by Mrs. Mayberry to speak about child education . ) You should look at what the non-Bahais do and do the opposite ! That is the general principle.It is good to have Bahai childrens classes , but the machinery is not as important as to know the principles involved.The machinery is a means to an end , and you should know what the end should be . <p> The parents , especially the mothers who are with the children more than the fathers , are responsible for the Bahai education of their children.The parents must be strict in all matters.The mothers must exercise their influence when the child is young not wait until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between right and wrong , between good and bad ! They must insist that the children do what is right and good.If the mothers neglect their duties , the children , when they come to the age of decision-making , will make the wrong decisions.All that parents think about today is ensuring the childs future financial success , security and position in the world but not their spiritual character.The principle purpose of Bahai childrens classes is the training of the children to have a spiritual character . <p> ( The Guardian spoke in a light-hearted manner about Persian food . ) Persian food is the richest food it is poison , delicious poison.All the Persians have liver trouble.Now they are learning to give up animal fats.They are even taking vitamin pills.Do you find the Americans are more energetic from vitamin pills or more excitable ? ! <p> ( The Guardian told us of news received of 21 Local Spiritual Assemblies newly formed in East Africa 9 in Kenya and 12 in Uganda . ) <p> 25th April . <p> ( In the morning Ruhiyyih Khanum had told me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pilgrimage in gratitude for certain help which I had given to her and because I had had malaria on the first day.That evening the Guardian confirmed this joy-producing information and told me that I would be spending the extra day at Bahji . <p> On this particular evening , the Guardian included in his discussion many useful points about Africa.He also spoke again in detail about the international victories and statistics of the Faith . ) <p> Regarding the need of pioneers in the Central and East Africa Region , the African friends will eventually be able to solve the problem of the pioneer needs in the territories other than Uganda.There are avenues open to them for teaching which are not open to the non-African pioneers.The National Spiritual Assembly must consult and solve this problem . ( I asked if any pioneers could come to some of our Central and East African countries from other parts of Africa . ) It is questionable whether pioneers can be spared from other parts of Africa for Uganda.There are all too few pioneers in Africa now . ( Ruhiyyih Khanum asked which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied that there were concentrations of Persian believers in some of the coastal areas . ) The Persian believers like the coast because it is better for trade . ( The Guardian smiled . ) <p> The progress of the Faith in Africa is due to the lack of prejudice of the Persian believers.If you could get the African friends to open their hearts you would find that they have a great love for the Persian pioneers.The British are not as prejudiced as the Americans.The American believers in Africa have had much to learn about teaching in Africa from the Persians.It is very important that association with the African people should be informal , spontaneous , friendly , consistent and continuous but most of all informal . <p> It is essential that the pioneers and the African believers visit among the village communities.The National Spiritual Assembly must arrange this.The National Spiritual Assembly must ensure that the local communities receive visitors.Visitors are the life-blood of the Faith.Without the circulation of this life-blood the village communities will die . <p> ( I asked if women pioneers could travel to the villages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes , the women pioneers can and must travel along or accompanied . ( Ruhiyyih Khanum asked about the effect of this on the missionaries as it might be contrary to the customs of the people . ) It does not matter that this is contrary to the customs of the people.The benefits to be gains are most important.But wisdom must , of course , be exercised . <p> The use of " visual aids " is very important in the teaching work in Africa.These " visual aids " include the pioneers themselves and their cars moving through the villages ; also the Bahai buildings , books , slide , photographs , rings , etc . <p> The African friends must be warned now that opposition to the Faith is coming.You must tell the African friends that the missionaries are their age-old enemies who have long made the African people their tools.They should be told to expect opposition in the form of falsehoods told to the government about the Faith by the missionaries , especially falsehoods about the pioneers so as to have them sent out of the country.They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pioneers may be made to leave their posts.They should not put their roots down too deeply so that they will not have difficulty or find it too painful when and if the time comes that they have to pull them up again.Tell John Allen not to put all his eggs in one basket . ( The Guardian knew that Mr. and Mrs. Allen were friends of mine , and he spoke directly to me at this point . ) <p> You must expect defection among the African believers when opposition comes.But you must not let this worry you.When the opposition comes , it will be like a strong wind blowing the " tree of life " . All the dead leaves will be blown away , and afterwards you will know that the leaves that remain on the tree are strong and healthy.In those days some of the believers whom you thought were strong will completely disappear and others , of whom you were hardly aware , will prove themselves to be the pillars of the Faith . <p> These points and warnings concerning opposition should not be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disseminated in printed form.The traveling teachers must do this work of explaining about the opposition.This subject should be discussed at conferences , the conventions , the weekend-schools , at the gatherings of the believers.These discussions will help the friends to become conscious of Bahai community life.It is very important that the African believers should have a feeling that they are members of a strong world-wide community . <p> The American Negroes are infected with materialism.The African believers will probably have to go to the Unites States to teach them.But it should not have to be like that.The Bahais of America must be more aggressive in teaching the Negro people of the south . <p> ( I mentioned to the Guardian that a very fine chief , Seth Nyakahuma , had come into the Faith recently in Uganda . ) Avoid the chiefs ; they are politically-minded ; they have impure motives.Chiefs may lead their people into the Faith , but they may lead them out of the faith again as quickly as they lead them in.The may cause great trouble.It is an eastern trait to approach higher-ups because orientals like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable if they have no political or material ambitions.You will not find many Enoch Olingas . <p> ( I had been requested by two of the pioneers in Kenya , Mr. and Mrs. Allen Elston , to enquire from the Guardian as to the advisability of Mr. Elston holding a job in a firm owned and run by a member of the Ismaili Community.The Guardians reply went beyond simply answering my question . ) You should avoid the Ismailis.There is no possibility of their becoming Bahais.On the contrary , they are our potential enemies.You should stay away from them.They are jealous of us.You should also avoid the Indians , the Europeans and the Arabs.The Indians want money and the Europeans political supremacy.You should avoid the Arab Moslems they are jealous of us.They are dangerous to us.You can teach the Faith to the African Moslems because they are still pure-hearted and can respond.But the Indian Moslems and the Arab Moslems are our potential enemies and are to be avoided.Of course , Mr. Elston should be leave his job and endanger his ability to stay in Africa.But they should not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following explanation , which introduced a subject totally unrelated to the previous subjects of the evening , the beloved Guardian paused for quite some minutes in his conversation ; and then without any preface to his remarks , he made the following statement . ) People wonder what happened to the body of Christ after the crucifixion.It was buried by the disciples under the wall of Jerusalem to protect it from the Roman legions.It remained buried there for some 260 years . ( The Guardian gave the exact number of years but afterwards none of the pilgrims could remember precisely the number . ) It remained buried under the wall of Jerusalem until the mother of the Emperor Constantine , who had herself become a Christian , came to Jerusalem and had the Church of the Holy Sepulcher built at which time the body of Christ was removed from under the wall of the city and was placed under the Church of the Holy Sepulcher . And that is where it is today.The Bahais should be aware of this fact when they visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bahais when they come to the Holy Land should come first to Haifa and Akka for their pilgrimage to the Bahai Holy Shrines.Then after their pilgrimage they should visit the Jewish , Christian and Moslem Holy Places in the Holy Land so that they can compare them with the Bahai Holy Places . <p> The Bahai pilgrimage is to the Holy Shrines and the Holy Places . ( This remark was made in the context of the pilgrimage not being for the purpose of meeting the Guardian but for the purpose of worshipping at the Holy Shrines . ) In the future , the pilgrimage , which will be obligatory for the men , will be to nine Holy Places and will be performed in this order:the House of the Bab in Shiraz ; the House of Bahaullah in Teheran ; the place of the Martyrdom of the Bab in Tabriz ; the House of Bahaullah in Baghdad ; the House of Bahaullah in Istanbul ( Constantinople ) ; the House of Bahaullah in Edirne ( Adrianople ) ; the Shrine of the Bab in Haifa ; the Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bahji.Special visitation prayers have been revealed which will be said when approaching each of these Holy Places . <p> ( I had been speaking to Ruhiyyih Khanum in the morning and had asked her if the Guardian had ever been asked about the permissibility of contraception.She said that he had told other pilgrims that there is nothing in the Holy Writings about it.In the evening , Ruhiyyih Khanum asked this same question of the Guardian . ) There is nothing in the Holy Writings on this subject.It will be up to the Universal House of Justice to decide about it . <p> 26th April . <p> I have been receiving and answering cablegrams all day . ( The Guardian appeared to be very tired . The cablegrams he referred to were those sent to him from the various National Conventions throughout the world . ) <p> There are now 252 countries opened to the Faith.Chagos Archipelago has been opened by a believer from Mauritius Island . The Faith in the capital of Mauritius , Port Louis , has been registered.The Canadians have offered an alternative to Anticosti Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing that happens in territories other than those mentioned in the Ten Year Plan will be added to the Plan . <p> There is no restriction on what the believers should do.I have encouraged the friends to buy more endowments.I have told them where to buy temple land.I have asked them to obtain at least one Haziratul-Quds in ever territory.In Africa the endowments can be anywhere in the territory - where the land is cheapest . They need not be in the important cities.In Africa land can be obtained cheaply - not so in Europe.In South America it is not very expensive . <p> ( In response to a question about the organization of the teaching work in Africa , the Guardian commented as follows . ) In the northwestern area of Africa there must be a Regional Teaching Committee for the whole region with sub-committees for the various countries or for smaller areas.This is because the region is so large.The general pattern which is good is a Regional Committee for the whole region and sub-committees for the territories that are within the region.But the other three National Spiritual Assemblies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not necessary for each National Assembly to have the same system.In fact , you should encourage them to try different methods.We insist on uniformity in matters of principle , but we encourage diversity in lesser matters . <p> If the members of the Committees can not travel , because of distance and expense , much can be done by correspondence.As with the Convention delegates who need not attend to Convention , Committee members need not necessarily attend all the meetings . <p> The National Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa must ensure that the Pygmies are reached.It is their responsibility.All such minority groups must be reached the Berbers , the Somalis , the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert , the Pygmies.In the United States there must a committee for miscellaneous minorities , with a sub-committee for each minority . <p> The fund is the individual responsibility of each believer and the responsibility of each Assembly.Contributions must be a sacrifice by the individuals and must be voluntary and steady.Every believer should watch the needs of the Cause and contribute where they see the need is greatest.It is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Spiritual Assemblies should make token contributions to the International Fund in order to be a part of the unity of giving of the world-wide community . <p> The African friends must learn to sacrifice for the fund.They should be encouraged to contribute to the Temple Fund.Only through sacrifice will the Cause and the teaching work prosper.In America the friends have to realize that they have been helped for fifty years with their temple.Now they must repay their debt.The must lower their standard of living in order to contribute more . <p> April 27th . <p> ( This was the day and night of my second visit to Bahji and the Most Holy Shrines . ) <p> April 28th . <p> ( On this last evening with the beloved Guardian , I was the only pilgrim at the dinner table , as Mrs. Mayberry and the Persian pilgrims were still in Akka.The Guardian welcomed Hand of the Cause Charles Mason Remey and asked him if he had a good trip to America . ) <p> How is the Faith progressing in Washington , D.C. ? It is very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of the United States.This is an important responsibility of the American believers . <p> ( The Guardian then spoke of the Temples . ) The plans are ready for the Kampala and Sydney Temples.The Kampala Temple can now be widely publicized among the believers of the world.Photographs of the progress of the building work should be sent for publication in the Bahai news organs.Publicity among the Bahais of Africa should be constant and wide-spread.But there should be no publicity among the non-Bahais in the press or anywhere else.It would be dangerous to do that , as the missionaries are very watchful and might try to cause the government to prevent the building of the Temple.Tell the National Spiritual Assembly that they must act quickly and quietly to ensure that the Temple is built . <p> It is very important that there should be firm , harmonious relationships between the Bahais and the Uganda government.Philip Hainsworth should act as a liaison between the National Spiritual Assembly and the government.It is providential that he occupies a position in the government.It is a very grave and important responsibility which he has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities in order to safeguard the building of the Temple.The National Spiritual Assembly must consult and instruct Philip what he is to do , and Philip must carry out the instructions of the Assembly.Tell this to the National Assembly and to Philip . <p> Will your husband visit Egypt en route to England ? No ? I hope he can see his father in Libya.It is many years that they have not met.I hope you will try to meet his father in Libya , and I hope you will go to Fezzan.This is a most important place for the Faith to be established because it is the place to which Abdul Hamid wanted to banish Abdul-Baha.There is a center there now there must be a Spiritual Assembly.Tell Fuad Rushdy that he should try to stay in Fezzan . <p> ( Ruhiyyih Khanum asked the Guardian if he knew that Fuad Rushdy is my husbands cousin.He said yes , that he did know this . ) Abdel Rahman Rushdy and Abdel Fattah Sabri , on in Alexandria and the other in Cairo , are brothers.This is one of the staunchest Bahai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith in Egypt.He must be very proud of his sons pioneer services in Africa.Please tell Mr. Sabri to urge the Egyptian friends to pioneer to Libya , especially to Fezzan , as this is a most important place to which they wanted to banish the Master . <p> ( My husband , Hassan , and I had wanted to make this pilgrimage together.But the Guardian had replied to our request by asking Hassan to postpone his pilgrimage while welcoming me.It seems clear to us at the time that the postponement of Hassans visit to the Holy Land related to the war between Egypt and Israel the previous year , as Hassans country of origin is Egypt.On this final night of my pilgrimage , I asked the beloved Guardian if Hassan would be able to make the pilgrimage in the future . ) <p> Yes , Hassan is welcome to Haifa.He should come in February or March , 1958 , a year from now.Is that convenient ? ( I replied that he might not be able to have leave from his job so soon again . ) No then he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you to the Hand of the Cause Musa Banani a piece of the plaster from the ceiling of the room in which the Holy Bab was incarcerated in the Prison Fortress of Mah-Ku.This is a most important room , for it is the room in which the Bab revealed His Book of Laws , in which book is contained His Covenant.This is the important difference between the Babs Covenant and the Covenant of Bahaullah.Both the Babs Laws and His Covenant are contained in one book.Bahaullahs Covenant is in a separate book from His book of Laws . <p> You will yourself carry this piece of plaster to Mr. Banani and will tell him what I have told you about it.Tell him it is to be placed in the foundation of the Kampala Temple on the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone.Mr . Banani will be my representative at the laying of the foundation stone , and he will place the plaster in its position with his own hands.A photograph must be made of this important event . ( The beloved Guardian then took from his pocket a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many-colored Persian silk handkerchief.He opened the box and removed the plaster which was wrapped in a piece of paper on which was written a statement , in Amatul-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanums handwriting , explaining what the plaster is.He then replaced the plaster and the paper in the box , again wrapped it in the silk handkerchief and handed it to me . ) <p> Your work has not ended.It has only just begun.When you go back to Africa , you must be active in confirming many more new believers , in establishing many more new centers , and many more Local Spiritual Assemblies.New believers re-vitalized the Faith ; new centers broaden its basis ; new Assemblies consolidate it.New believers bring new centers ; new centers bring new Local Spiritual Assemblies ; new Local Spiritual Assemblies bring new National Spiritual Assemblies ; and new National Spiritual Assemblies bring new Temples ! ( He gave this last series of in a tone of rising enthusiasm and , when he said " bring new Temples " , he was smiling very broadly and triumphantly . ) I want more believers , more centers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come into the Faith.Africa is like a dry field of grass.The Faith can spread across Africa like a flame . <p> ( As this was the final night of my pilgrimage and my final opportunity for asking questions , I overcome my shyness and spoke to the Guardian of the perplexity which I and some of the other pioneers in Uganda felt at realizing how very little the newly declared African believers really know about the Faith . ) <p> You can not expect the illiterate African friends to understand much about the Faith.Watch them closely watch their spirits.If the people are strongly attracted , if they are enthusiastic about the Faith , accept their declarations even though they know little about the Teachings.This is a most delicate matter.You must watch closely for their reactions to the Faith.If they are enthusiastic , eager and have pure motives , accept them.Tell them that there is nothing to be gained from becoming Bahai except the blessing of sacrifice.Do not be too rigid about accepting their declarations and do not be too right about letting them leave the Faith.They have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must let them do so if they find they really can not accept the teachings and principles of the Faith as they come to know of them.The doors of the Faith must be wide open for them to come into it , and open also for them to leave it if they really can not accept the teachings.Some who are weak will grow to be strong and will be good teachers.Some will drop out.It does not matter if they know very little.They can not be expected to know very much.The work of the pioneers is to keep the doors of the Faith open.And they should not stand in the doorway ! <p> In America they teach the Faith by discussion and argument to convince.This is because the people are so materialistic.In Africa the people are not materialistic hence they are more pure-hearted and responsive.In Persia they teach through the heart.The American believers must learn to teach through the heart . <p> ( I had been wondering exactly what the Guardian referred to when he so often wrote about the " purity of heart " of the African people.I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I speak of their purity of heart , I mean one thing and one thing only.I mean that they are not materialistic that they have the capacity to live happily with new material possessions.When you see that the people have become materialistic , you will know that they have lost their purity of heart . <p> Materialism is like a cancer which is beginning to spread in Africa.It has already started in the cities and is now spreading outward from the cities to the villages.If you want to reach the pure in heart who are the spiritually receptive people , you must go as far away from the cities as possible to the villages which have not yet been touched by the cancer of materialism.This spreading cancer of materialism will ultimately envelop the whole continent.The people of Africa are entering a long dark valley of materialism.Once this happens , it will be a long time before they come out of that valley.You must hurry.The time will come when the pioneers will be like spectators sitting on the sidelines , hardly able to do anything because of the materialism which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spiritual receptivity.You must hurry , hurry ! If you lose this opportunity , it will be a long time before it will come again . <p> The pagan peoples in the remote villages are the purest in heart and the most receptive people in Africa.You should go to the places which are farthest from the cities and are where the page people are to be found.There are still large numbers of pagan people in Africa.Try to find them and attract them to the Faith . <p> ( Some of the Bahai friends hold the view that the Guardian is all-knowing and that it is , therefore , not necessary in writing reports to him to include all the facts.This , in my view , could result in reports that do not give a clear picture and could be misleading to the Guardian.I decided to ask the Guardian to clarify this matter.He replied to my explanation and question in a very emphatic tone . ) I must be told all the facts.Nothing must be withheld from me.How can I give the best advice if I do not have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Temple designs which were ready.Hand of the Cause Leroy Ioas was asked to bring the designs to the dinner table.The Guardian showed the plan for the German Temple to Hand of the Cause Mason Remey and asked Mason what he thought of it , as it had been designed by a non-Bahai German architect.Mason said he thought it was good and that he liked the dome.Then the Guardian showed the Australian design to Mason with the changes the Australian friends had made in the columns.Then he showed him the Persian plan and told him that its construction was to be definitely postponed.Lastly he showed him and me the Kampala design.The Guardian commented on the shame of the dome being like the Shrine of the Bab and said that he liked the lantern on the top . ) The Kampala Temple is being built because the Persian Temple can not be built.The Persian Temple will cost about 350,000 , the German one about 100,000 , and the Kampala Temple about 50,000 or 60,000 . Millie ( Hand of the Cause Amelia Collins ) has contributed 100,000 for this project.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be given by the 4,300 Bahai centers in the world.It works out about $18 per center . <p> The believers all over the world must now start contributing for the building of the Australian and Kampala Temples especially the Americans for whose Temple the Bahais of the world , especially the Persian , contributed for 50 years . <p> ( The Guardian asked Mason how he like having two of his Temples under construction at the same time.He also asked Mason if he is prepared to draw the plans for forty more Temples , as land is to be acquired for fifty temples during the Ten Year Crusade . ) <p> ( Taking from his pocket a small metal phial containing a glass phial of perfume , the Guardian said to me ) : <p> I am giving you this attar of roses to take back with you to the friends.Please , share it especially with the African believers.How many African believers are on the National Assembly ? Four that is good . <p> ( The beloved Guardian left the dinner table on that final , memorable evening at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with very heavy heart if I would ever meet him again.Six months later he has " winged his flight " to the Abha Kingdom , and life has never been the same again . <p> The zest and zeal , the eagerness and enthusiasm , the certitude and consecration of Shoghi Effendi were the very breath of life to those who served our Lord in his day.The warmth and gentleness of his love and kindliness , his encouragement and inspiration were the experience of every pilgrim.But far and away the most distinctive characteristics which were graven upon the memory were the manifest nobility of nature , the deep strength of intellect , the burning single-mindedness of purpose , and the profoundly guided depth of insight and wisdom of the Guardian of the Cause of God. ) 
@@40786701 @786701/ <h> May on Weatherford , ' Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World ' <p> Reviewed by Timothy May ( Assistant Professor of History , North Georgia College and State University ) Published on H-World ( March , 2005 ) <p> The name of Genghis Khan is often associated with destruction , although the image of Genghis Khan has been rehabilitated somewhat in the west . The western world , saturated in media distortion and a reluctance to accept changes in perceptions of history , has been rather averse in accepting Genghis Khan 's activities as pivotal in world history and the shaping of the modern world . Thus , the publication of Jack Weatherford 's book , Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World , is a welcome addition to the literature on the Mongols . <p> The author , Jack Weatherford , the Dewitt Wallace Professor of Anthropology at Macalester College , has written several books targeted for the non-academic world and writes in a very engaging style . As a result , Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strength of Weatherford 's writing is that he mixes narrative with analysis and grabs the attention of any reader . <p> The book is organized into an introduction , and then three sections of the text itself , and concluding with an epilogue , notes , glossary , and bibliography . Preceding all of these is a genealogical table showing Genghis Khan , his sons , and the successor khanates . In addition to showing the rulers of the empire , the terms of the regents are designated . The latter is something that is often remiss in these sorts of tables , but a welcome addition here . There is an odd segment of the table though . All of the Khanates or states resulting from the split of the Mongol Empire are shown except the Chaghatayid Khanate of Central Asia . In its place is the Moghul Empire of India . Indeed , the Moghul Empire has connections back to the Mongols ( Moghul is Persian for Mongol ) , but the founder of the Moghul Empire , Babur , was himself a Timurid , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Genghis Khan. 1 While Babur was descended from Genghis Khan on his mother 's side , he can not be viewed as a direct line from Genghis Khan 's grandson , Chaghatai , as Weatherford 's table indicates . <p> In his introduction , Weatherford reveals that he did not set out to write a book about Genghis Khan . Rather , he intended to write a book on the history of world commerce . During his research on the Silk Road he traveled to Mongolia and read about the accomplishments of the Mongols . Like many who have done so , Weatherford was , one might say , " bitten by the Mongol bug " and could not resist the allure of Genghis Khan . Thus , Weatherford began working on the impact of the Mongols on the world . He did much of the research in tandem with a Mongolian team that included a scholar of shamanism , an archaeologist , a political scientist , and an officer in the Mongolian army , providing a wide viewpoint and a variety of expertise . <p> Weatherford 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to change from the medieval to the modern because of the Mongols . Weatherford wrote , " The new technology , knowledge , and commercial wealth created the Renaissance in which Europe rediscovered some of its prior culture , but more importantly , absorbed the technology for printing , firearms , the compass , and the abacus from the East " ( p. xxiv ) . This passage is , without question , controversial . Many would scoff at the notion that a literal horde of illiterate nomads from Mongolia created the Renaissance . There is something to be said about Weatherford 's view ; however the impact of the Mongols on the Renaissance will be discussed more fully in the discussion on section three of the book . Nevertheless , Weatherford 's pronouncement does seize one 's attention and stir the imagination . <p> Weatherford also entices the reader by remarking on the accomplishments of the Mongols such as that they conquered an empire that stretched from the Pacific to the Mediterranean , an area roughly the size of Africa . Furthermore he notes that the Mongols accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which only around 100,000 comprised the military . Weatherford does well to illustrate the magnitude of this deed by pointing out that many modern corporations have more employees than the Mongol army had soldiers . The author uses these analogies exceedingly well to clarify his points . <p> There are two general comments before discussing the actual content of the book . There is a curious lack of dates in many of the historical sections , for the non-specialist this can be problematic . In his writing style , Weatherford moves back and forth between events ; while not hampering the flow of the narrative , this can be confusing to the reader . Secondly , the method of citation is frustrating . Granted , this is a work intended for the general public thus the lack of footnotes is to be expected . Yet , the manner in which sources are cited is awkward . Rather than a footnote or endnote with a number , the reader must turn to the notes section , and look for a page number . If he is lucky , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source . However , there are a number of quotes which are not attributed . This is not to say that it is plagiarism as it is clear that Weatherford does not claim to make the statements , but rather just plain sloppiness on the part of someone whether it is the author or editor . <p> The first section after the introduction concerns the rise of Genghis Khan and the unification of Mongolia . As with most of his writing , this section comprising three chapters is very engaging . The first chapter begins with an account Genghis Khan 's attack on the Khwarazmian Empire , which covered much of Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan , and the former Soviet Central Asia . Throughout this section , Weatherford provides the reader with a very good sense of the rise of Genghis Khan to power and how the Mongols viewed warfare , which is to say , honor was not in the methods of war , but rather in gaining victory . Furthermore , Weatherford does a splendid job of illustrating that Genghis Khan was not a born military genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mongol leader , but rather he learned from his mistakes and then applied the lessons . <p> Also in the first chapter , Weatherford provides an excellent description of the topography and ecology of Mongolia . It is clear he understands how vital these two factors are to the rise of Mongol dominance . Weatherford 's anthropological insight is clear when discussing various aspects of nomadic culture . <p> Weatherford , however does engage in some historical speculation ; some of it very interesting and convincing , particularly that based on anthropological premises . For instance , Tem++jin killed his older step-brother . Many scholars have concluded that this was partially based off of a rivalry for power , even at a young age between the two branches of the family ( Yes++gei , Tem++jin 's father , had two wives ) . Weatherford raises the intriguing possibility that the half brother was murdered because of the possibility that Tem++jin 's mother would become the half-brother 's wife due to Levirate law ( p. 23-24 ) . <p> The second section concerns the expansion of the Mongol Empire outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into China , Central Asia , the Middle East , and Europe . These chapters provide a discourse on the effectiveness of the Mongol military as well as a comparison with its enemies , including such ubiquitous yet interesting elements such as diet . Weatherford also attempts to put the massacres and destruction conducted by the Mongols into perspective and makes a good contrast between the Mongols and their " civilized " opponents who were often much more prone to torturing prisoners , often for entertainment purposes . Finally , Weatherford attempts to explain the rationale between each invasion as well as provide the political background behind each event from the Mongol perspective . <p> The third section is truly the focus of the book : the impact of the Mongols on the world . This section begins with the breakup of the empire and various changes that occurred in the khanates that would lead to the transformation of the world . Weatherford rightly places his emphasis on the Mongols ' role in facilitating trade . With their empire secure , caravans and merchants traversed the Mongol realm with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , others took advantage of the secure roads leading to the migration of people ( in some cases against their will ) , ideas , and technology . One particular item that made its way to Europe from the Mongol Empire was quite unintentional : the Black Plague . The effects of the plague on Europe are well known and need no further comment . <p> Weatherford also makes his connections between the Mongols and the Renaissance and emergence of modern Europe . Weatherford states that it was the importation of the printing press , blast furnace , compass , gunpowder , as well as Persian and Chinese painting styles from the Mongol Empire that spawned the Renaissance . Indeed , Weatherford writes during the Renaissance period , " The common principles of the Mongol Empire-such as paper money , primacy of the state over the church , freedom of religion , diplomatic immunity , and international law-were ideas ... gained new importance " ( p. 236 ) . Weatherford states his case very eloquently and with an abundance of evidence demonstrating not only the indirect influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from agents of innovation in the Renaissance into agents of destruction in the European mind during Enlightenment . <p> It is quite clear that Weatherford is a brilliant writer , blending anthropological insight and incredible enthusiasm with a captivating narrative . It is easy to see why many reviewers and readers have been enthusiastic about it . Despite all of Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World 's acclaim , it is very clear that Weatherford is not a historian . In the general narrative Weatherford is sufficiently accurate . However , in the details , Weatherford is wrestling with material that he clearly does not fully appreciate . It is important to remember that the book is intended for the general public and thus certain allowances are often made , usually in the form of generalizations . While this can be a useful method in writing , often it is misleading or just simply wrong . Unfortunately this is the case with much of Weatherford 's book . <p> Again , the general narrative is correct , but finer points are simply wrong . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1260 by mentioning the Mamluks , slave soldiers who were primarily Kipchak Turks , many of whom the Mongols sold or sent fleeing into slavery . Curiously , Weatherford mentions that the Mamluks were comprised of Kipchaks and Slavs . While it is quite possible that Slavs were sold in the Middle East as slaves , if any did serve as Mamluks , their numbers were negligible and more of a rare exception than the rule . <p> Also in discussing the Battle of the Kalka River , the first encounter between the princes of the Rus ' and the Mongols , several problems surface . This discussion is a perfect example of the frustration caused by Weatherford 's lack of footnotes . In one section ( p. 141 ) Weatherford states that the Mongol arrows could not be used by the Rus ' but the Mongols could use the arrows shot by the Rus ' . Yet there is no indication of the source in the notes , nor any explanation in the text of why this was so . In his discussion of the army of the Rus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities are intriguing , there is no evidence that a levy of peasants took part in this battle . Weatherford also confuses the horses of the Rus ' with the large warhorses used by knights in Western Europe ( pp. 141-142 ) . <p> One of the most troublesome aspects is that Weatherford places an incredible amount of emphasis on the Mongols ' use of gunpowder in warfare , going so far as to insinuate that they used cannons at the siege of Baghdad in 1258 ( p. 182 ) . There is no indication of this in the Arabic , Syriac , or Persian sources of this practice , nor of the Mongols using devices like a cannon at other sieges . To be sure , the Mongols did use grenades thrown from catapults occasionally , but gunpowder weapons of any form were not a major component of their arsenal . <p> In relation to Baghdad , Weatherford also takes another historical misstep noting that Baghdad would not fall again to " infidel troops " as it did to the Mongols in 1258 until 2003 to the Americans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1917 during World War I. <p> Furthermore , many of the errors are simply careless . In discussing Timur ( Tamerlane , 1336-1405 ) as a successor to Genghis Khan , Weatherford states that Timur captured the sultan of the Seljuk kingdom in modern Turkey . This is incorrect as the Seljuks no longer existed . Rather , Timur captured Sultan Bayazid , the Ottoman Sultan . Then Weatherford links Din-i-Illah , the universalist religion of Mughal ruler , Akbar the Great ( 1543-1605 ) , with the religious policies of Genghis Khan . While Akbar and the other Moghul rulers certainly did use many of the practices of the Mongol Empire , one should not confuse the religious policies of the Mongols with a higher goal of religious unity and toleration on philosophic ideals . Mongol religious toleration was based on preventing strife in the empire , not ensuring spiritual harmony . <p> While Weatherford 's book is filled with inaccuracies it is also rife with unsubstantiated historical speculation . While some of his speculations do have merit and deserve further consideration , many aspects are passed off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An example of this concerns the last ruler of the unified Mongol Empire , Mongke . Weatherford makes a curious statement that Mongke had a fondness for European contraptions and designs ( p. 177 ) . This perhaps stems from an account of a fountain that provided four different beverages at feasts through intricate means . It was designed by a European prisoner , Guillaume Boucher , but hardly accounts for a fondness as there are no other accounts of these " contraptions " in the sources . <p> Weatherford undermines his own efforts by dabbling in linguistic matters . While this reviewer can not be positive , it seems clear that Weatherford enters a field where he has no business . Indeed , the words he mistranslates in Persian demonstrate that , one should hope , he has no background in the language . Weatherford may have learned some Mongolian , but it is also clear that he is not a student of the language , and thus does not understand the transformation of the Mongolian language from the Middle Mongolian of the thirteenth century to the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated on several occasions . In relation to Mongolian , Weatherford states that the title " Genghis Khan " , means strong , firm , fearless . In this instance , he is correct as Genghis ( or more properly , Chinggis ) comes from the middle Mongolian " ching " ; Weatherford uses the modern Mongolian equivalent , " chin . " Weatherford then associates it with the Mongolian word for wolf , chino , which was also the male ancestor of the Mongols ( the female ancestor was a deer ) . Weatherford 's lack of familiarity with Mongolian is apparent as , while the words are somewhat similar , they bare no relation other than that a chino could be described as " ching . " <p> While other examples exist , one final example of these linguistic errors must be brought forth , particularly as it pertains to a subject that has been in the news in the recent years : the Hazara people of Afghanistan . Weatherford is correct in that the Hazara trace their existence back to a Mongol regiment that was stationed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in Persian as Weatherford states , but rather " a thousand " , which was the essential unit for military and civil operations . <p> Thus with Weatherford 's Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World , the reader is left in a quandary . Many may have thought of using this book in a class . Considering the numerous factual errors and misguided etymological speculations this reviewer can not recommend using this as a standard text for a world history class with the exception of using it as a point of discussion on historiography . While the overall thrust of the book is on target and may promote new discourse on the influence of the Mongols in history , it is undermined by numerous mistakes . Weatherford overstates his case in his enthusiasm for the Mongols , making connections that are often tenuous . Did the Mongols contribute to the modern world ? Definitely yes , the evidence ( even considering the errors ) assembled makes this very clear . It is too much to say that Renaissance would not have happened without the Mongols . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles and Chinese technology would have crept into Europe at any rate via the Middle East , albeit perhaps at a slower rate . One could make the argument that the Renaissance would not have happened without the Crusades or the rise of the Jin Dynasty in Northern China . After all the Jin unwittingly allowed the Mongols to rise to power , whereas their predecessors , the Liao dynasty did a great deal more to control the steppe tribes . More importantly the great period of translation of Greek material conducted by the Arabs is of equal importance . <p> That being said , there is still something to be said for Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World . The errors are almost forgivable considering how well it is written . This reviewer doubts that most historians found their love of history in a dusty monograph but rather a well-written popular book that they read in their youth . Thus in this respect , while this reviewer would be reluctant to use Weatherford 's book in a class , I would suggest it to someone might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Timur , himself conquered the remnants of the Chaghatayids . Timur , however suffered from the fact that he was not descended from Genghis Khan , and thus was not always viewed as a legitimate ruler in the steppes . To overcome this handicap , he married Genghisid princesses , and even placed Genghisid princes on the throne of his empire , while he ruled " behind the scenes " ( needless to say , nobody was fooled ) . 
@@40786702 @786702/ <p> N VIRTUALLY every work of Cervantes , the critic confronts what Jean Canavaggio has described as ? una contaminaci=n sistemtica del espacio textual por el vivir cervantino. ? 1 So striking is the presence of autobiographical references that readers have often succumbed to the temptation to peer through the veil of fiction for glimpses of the historical Cervantes : wounded but victorious in Lepanto , captive in Algiers , moving through the picaresque underworld and jails of Seville , struggling to make his living as a writer . Whole generations of scholars devoted themselves exclusively to this kind of ? cervantismo ? which so exasperated Unamuno , making masterpieces into documents of the author 's real-life frustrations.2 The figure of Don Quixote in particular ? middle-aged nobody , impoverished hidalgo , nostalgic dreamer of an obsolete heroism , incorrigible reader ? has been conflated repeatedly with that of his author . Conspicuously in the tradition of the great biographies of Cervantes , the mad knight of La Mancha merges with the hero of Lepanto . Pursuing fame , like Don Quixote , along the twin routes of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> protagonist aspired to be . Titles like El ingenioso hidalgo Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra , 3Vida heroica de Miguel de Cervantes , 4 and Vida ejemplar y heroica de Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra , 5 suggest the desire of the biographers to write chivalresque history anew , ? enderezando los tuertos , ? and naturally purging it of parody . Even the recent biography of William Byron follows in the footsteps of its antecedents , moving freely from the works to the man and back again , finding in the life and the books of Cervantes abundant suggestions for reciprocal illumination.6 Textual criticism , on the other hand , tends to stress the absence of Cervantes from his texts . If we find ourselves tantalized in the Quixote by the shadow of an ? historical ? Cervantes , we are most often faced with the insistent , intrusive presence of a narrator . It has generally been recognized that this personified author is not interchangeable with the historical Cervantes , but rather another character within the author 's fiction , one who serves as another reminder of the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice closest to the reader in Cervantes ' novel , this narrator is also another reader who filters the ? original ? text of the Arab historian Cide Hamete Benengeli and the one produced by his Moorish translator . If the narrator promises to transmit faithfully the contents of these documents , we find him in fact interrupting at will , ordering his material to suit himself , shifting abruptly from scholarly deference to outright parody . The critical mainstream of our day , in one way or another , applauds Cervantes ' use of the fictitious authorship device . If , however , under the impetus of the New Criticism , we have succeeded in distinguishing Cide Hamete from the narrator and the narrator from the real-life Cervantes , we have come paradoxically to see the author 's non-presence in his text as a kind of proof negative of his authorial power , as the key to the control over his fiction , to his very authority . His distance , in Ruth El Saffar 's formulation , is control . The text continually calls attention to <p> its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cervantes Saavedra ? most remote of all . Aloof from his work , unlocatable within its boundaries , the ? real author ? nonetheless pulls all of the strings.7 A history of interpretations of Miguel de Cervantes would surely trace a changing view of the authorial figure just as suggestive as the readings of Don Quixote recently surveyed by Anthony J. Close.8 That book 's extraordinary popular success , which appears already legendary in the 1615 text , and the homage of subsequent European prose fiction , provided fertile ground for legends about its author . From recognition of a masterwork , it is but a short step first to acknowledge , then to revere , a master . Literary criticism in the twentieth century , while granting a new measure of autonomy to the fictional world of the book , particularly that of the novel , nonetheless retains the concept of the book as creation and the author as creator . The image , of course , occupies a venerable place in the history of Christian thought , where God is the Author , and the world is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation , lives apart from his Creator , still the latter 's guiding Providence informs and unifies his work . Unamuno borrowed the conceit to dramatize the freedom of the creature , first in Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho , later in Niebla . But over against Unamuno 's vision of the hero who , as spirit of a national yearning , dwarfs both Cervantes and ? cervantismos , ? other readers rose to the defense of authorial power . From an understandably awed sense of the writer 's ultimate responsibility for what appears on the pages of his book , partisans of the author go on to postulate a Cervantes who plays God to his creation , a Cervantes whose omniscience and absolute power render him almost divine . Leo Spitzer , one of the most eloquent exponents of authorial authority in the Quixote , associated this view with the name of <p> We sense the presence of something which is not subject to fluctuation : the immovable , immutable principle of the divine ? which , perhaps , to some extent , is reflected in the earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mastery of his material and in his own unshaken attitude toward the phenomena of his world.9 <p> This concept has prospered alongside ideas about the figure of the poet in the Italian Renaissance epic . Croce 's view of Ariosto as omniscient author-God continues to appear in readings of the Orlando furioso , the most important recent example being Robert Durling 's study , which characterizes the intrusive figure of the poet in the Furioso as demiurge.10 Spitzer repeatedly cautions that neither Cervantes nor he ( Spitzer ) means actually to confuse the author with God himself . Yet rhetoric seems often to soar beyond that caveat : <p> Let us not be mistaken : the real protagonist of the novel is not Quixote , with his continual misrepresentation of reality , or Sancho with his skeptical half-endorsement of quixotism ? and surely not any of the central figures of the illusionistic by-stories : the hero is Cervantes , the artist himself , who combines a critical and illusionistic art according to his free will . From the moment we open the book to the moment we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almighty overlord is directing us , who leads us where he pleases ( p. 69 ) . <p> High above the world-wide cosmos of his making , in which hundreds of characters , situations , vistas , themes , plots and subplots are merged , Cervantes ' artistic self is enthroned , an all-embracing creative self , Nature-like , God-like , almighty , all-wise , all-good ? and benign : this visibly omnipresent Maker reveals to us the secrets of his creation , he shows us the work of art in the making , and the laws to which it is necessarily subjected ( pp. 72-73 ) . <p> up with an ideal of free will joined with quasi-divine goodness of spirit , this perspectivismo shows how readily a concept becomes a creed , how easily the image into which an idea crystallizes ascends to the status of myth . Without wishing to disparage in any way the seriousness of the issues to which Spitzer was speaking ? for criticism like literature is always written from an existential context ? , I suggest that we find ourselves in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fables of lived heroism , of the sufferings and strivings of the impoverished writer , we have here the myth of Cervantes , quasi-divine artist , ? almighty , all-wise , all-good. ? To these we must add still another construct of literary history , a myth of literary origins , or more exactly of Cervantes as originator of the modern novel . Italianists are acutely sensitive to the mythical or fictional status of this idea , perhaps because they would propose a candidate of their own . Many studies of the European novel nonetheless confidently locate in Don Quixote the genesis of modern prose fiction as self-conscious literature . Cervantes criticism has questioned the extent to which the author perceived his own originality or the implications of his innovations . The Novelas ejemplares and Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda suggest to some that Cervantes did not wholly embrace the brave new novelistic world of his own making.11 He could not in any case have imagined the significance of his work for unborn generations of writers . Still , the perception of Cervantes as some kind of important beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what extent can Cervantes be held accountable for the myth-making that centers around his figure ? Perhaps by looking at those passages in his works which call attention to Cervantes himself we can discover a relationship between the author 's self-portraiture and the mythical portraiture of a heroic Cervantes or of a God-like , originating genius . This project , we realize at once , faces the initial difficulty of defining its object of inquiry . Even if we restrict ourselves for the moment to Don Quixote , we face the problem of deciding which passages can be called autobiographical or which can be thought of as self-portraits . By perusing the footnotes of virtually <p> 11 For example , Ruth El Saffar , Novel to Romance . A Study of Cervantes 's ? Novelas ejemplares ? ( Baltimore : Johns Hopkins University Press , 1974 ) . Here , as throughout this article , we give only representative bibliography for issues discussed by many important cervantistas . <p> 88 <p> MARY GAYLORD RANDEL <p> Cervantes <p> any edition , one discovers what its editor took for material from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . Some references , however , are more readily identified : the prologues of 1605 and 1615 , the 1615 Dedicatoria to the Conde de Lemos , the scrutiny of Don Quixote 's library ( I , 6 ) , the famous interruption between Chapters 8 and 9 of the first part , the story of the Capitn cautivo . It is to these that we now turn . The 1605 Prologue introduces Cervantes ' book-child ? ? como quien se engendr= en una crcel ? ? as the predictable offspring ? ? un hijo seco , avellanado , antojadizo y lleno de pensamientos varios y nunca imaginados de otro alguno ? ? of his own ? estTril y mal cultivado ingenio. ? 12 Cervantes reminds his reader of his fifty-eight years and the improbability of his present reappearance on the literary scene : ? al cabo de tantos aos como ha que duermo en el silencio del olvido , salgo ahora , con todos mis aos a cuestas ? ( p. 20 ) . Self-portrayed as deficient in both natural talent and learning ( ? mi insuficiencia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author seeks to please , yet he is unwilling to beg public indulgence or the literary insurance of prefatory sonnets for the ugly child he has begotten . His ? suspensi=n y elevamiento ? poise him in an imaginative and literal contortion ? ? suspenso con el papel delante , la pluma en la oreja , el codo en el bufete y la mano en la mejilla , pensando lo que dirfa ? ( p. 20 ) ? between pride and self-deprecation . His seesawing between assurance and doubt is dramatized by the arrival of the friendly other , whose ironic enthusiasm sees him through the chore of producing a prologue . Although the vehement opinions of the self-appointed literary censors of Part One , Chapter 6 , lead us to suspect that we may be hearing a thinly veiled authorial voice , we find there no visual portrait . When considering La Galatea , the Curate claims its author as his friend of many years : ? y sT que es ms versado en desdichas que en versos ? ( p. 75 ) . The volume in question seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abundance of his misfortunes : ? Su libro algo tiene de buena invenci=n ; propone algo , y no concluye nada : es menester esperar la segunda parte que promete ? ( Ibid . ) . In the meantime , La Galatea deserves neither mercy nor condemnation ; its <p> provisional sentence mandates a sort of detention : ? entre tanto que esto se ve , tenedle recluso en vuestra posada , seor compadre. ? The Barber 's laconic reply ? ? Que me place ? ? suggests that the pastoral novel will not go unread for the length of its probation . Chapter 9 introduces a personified author who is less transparently Cervantes , but whose state of suspense mimics not only the upraised swords of Don Quixote and his Biscayan adversary left hanging in mid-flight , but the suspended sentence of La Galatea and the head-in-hand suspension of the Prologue . Here suspense belongs to the writer who is first a reader , left dangling when the thriving tree of his story is so abruptly ? destroncada ? ( p. 91 ) . The joy of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet it is precisely this sense of what is lacking in Don Quixote 's history , the instinct for completion nurtured apparently by avid reading of chivalresque fiction , that serves to bridge the gap . ? Confuso y deseoso de saber real y verdaderamente toda la vida y milagros de nuestro famoso espaol Don Quijote de la Mancha ? ( p. 92 ) , the author submits not only to this urgent curiosity but to his voracious appetite for the written word in general ( ? como yo soy aficionado a leer aunque sean los papeles rotos de la calle ? p. 93 ) . Two providential encounters ? first with the peddlar boy , then with the Moorish translator ? leave him again ? at=nito y suspenso , ? hoping and doubting , near bursting with curiosity yet all the while wary lest any show of interest should raise the price of his coveted treasure . Bent on wresting the ? truth ? about Don Quixote from ignorant hands , the author does not scruple to deceive his unwitting benefactors . At the same time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uneasy sense that the historian , on whom he has pinned his hopes , as an Arab , may also be a liar who would be capable of deceiving him . In a flowery tribute to history ( Mother of Truth ) and to historians , the ? author ? once more submerges in the text , giving himself up to the pleasure of narration . When next the author surfaces , in the story-within-a-story of the Capitn cautivo ( I , 39-41 ) , he has donned military dress . The central section of this tale traces the itinerary which leads Ruy PTrez de <p> 90 <p> MARY GAYLORD RANDEL <p> Cervantes <p> Viedma from Spain to Algerian captivity . So closely does it dovetail events of the writer 's life , that it is difficult not to accord it virtually documentary status.13 Yet Ruy PTrez is not Cervantes . The soldier 's career they share sits as though in the center of a triptych , offset by the folktale-like account of the three brothers and the legend-like story of Zoraida 's conversion and rescue of the Captive.14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served not as common soldier but as captain , and met with a different fate at Lepanto . Unlike Cervantes , whose wounds cost him the use of one hand , the officer suffered the loss of his liberty . The Captain 's authority paradoxically makes him an easy captive on this day of glory for Christendom , when many Christians who have been slaves are restored to their freedom . As he leads his men on board Uchalf 's vessel , that ship swerves away from the attack , cutting the Captain off from his men : ? solo fui el triste entre tantos alegres y el cautivo entre tantos libres ? ( p. 399 ) . He travels to Algiers as a slave , and there his story rejoins that of Cervantes . The Captain even tells of meeting ? un soldado espaol llamado tal de Saavedra ? ( p. 409 ) , famed for his heroic struggles to escape from servitude . The name clearly conjures up the author 's figure , and it is tempting to see in this Saavedra the historical Cervantes . Yet if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature shadowing the ? real ? life of Saavedra-Cervantes , we are also bound to notice that the exploits of this ? tal de Saavedra ? appear on the horizon of heroism as the promise above all of another tale , surpassingly entertaining , full of wonder . Even the Captain 's brief hints paint his circumstances as little short of miraculous : despite apparently tireless attempts to escape , he enjoys with his jailer a prestige which makes him immune from the standard punishments . Saavedra ( ? por la menor cosa que hizo temfamos todos que habfa de ser empalado ? ) functions as a limit in this fiction , perhaps that point <p> His likeness to Ruy PTrez de Viedma allows the untold story to reach beyond the one the Captain has just unfolded , speaking to the same insatiable appetite for stories of ? novedad y estraeza ? that makes Fernando wish aloud that the telling would begin all over again . The stories of Ruy PTrez , Saavedra and Cervantes ( the latter available from outside the text ) clearly function as mirror stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , however , what remains consistent is the pattern of paradox which the military narratives reveal : authority linked to loss of liberty , servitude joined with the struggle for freedom , moral victory accompanied by crippling physical loss , Christian triumph paired with personal defeat . We might read the Dedicatoria and Prologue of the 1615 Quixote as readings of his earlier self-portraits by an author now well established in public esteem . Theirs is a doubly reflexive gesture ? the scrutiny of self-scrutiny . Cervantes ' own words echo uncannily , as Elias Rivers has shown , both in the contours of its anecdotes and the nature of its recurring themes , the Aprobaci=n of the Licenciado Mrquez Torres ( pp. 530-31 ) .15 The picture of an author who is ? viejo , soldado , hidalgo y pobre ? seems derived from earlier self-portraits , both in the Quixote and in the Prologue to the Novelas ejemplares . Yet the new context makes the familiar string of traits into the stuff of contrast . An unlikely candidate for success has in fact been acclaimed , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publication of a rival Segunda parte . The author of this apocryphal version appears to have read Cervantes ' self-portraits as carefully as the rest of his work . His challenge is not only literary , but personal and moral , pointing a derisive finger at Cervantes ' age and his lifeless hand , accusing him of envy and even hostility to the Church in his references to Lope de Vega ( I , 48 ) . Beyond this , the matter of age has taken on a different cast for Cervantes himself , in 1615 nearly sixty-eight . In the Dedicatoria 's fictional audience with an emissary from the <p> Emperor of China , the author excuses himself from that ruler 's call to found in his kingdom an academy for the study of the Castilian tongue on grounds of i 'll health : ? porque yo no estoy con salud para ponerme en tan largo viaje ? ( p. 534 ) . In the Prologue he laments that his competitor should have faulted him for his years , ? como si hubiera sido en mi mano haber detenido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 535 ) . Time , moreover , has not only taken its toll ; in some sense it is the writer 's ally : ? y hase de advertir que no se escribe con las canas , sino con el entendimiento , el cual suele mejorarse con los aos ? ( p. 536 ) . Paradoxes continue to proliferate on these pages : Lepanto 's triumphant scars ( far better than any inglorious wholeness ) ; the absurdity that so beloved an author should struggle with poverty ( ? Pues +a tal hombre no le tiene Espaa muy rico y sustentado del erario pblico ? ? asks a visiting French gentleman in the Aprobaci=n p. 530 ) ; the true honor of decent poverty . Although Cervantes in effect reinforces the image of himself as ? viejo , soldado , hidalgo y pobre , ? he sounds a bit like the successful politician who continues to protest that he is just a country boy . There is evidence of his strategy in the effusive whitewash of Lope ( ? del tal adoro el ingenio , admiro las obras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his careful posturing vis-a-vis the Conde de Lemos and the Archbishop of Toledo , for whose consumption he must mention but not whine about his straightened circumstances . At the moment when he confidently puts down his challenger and reasserts the fueros of his authorship , any claim of incapacity inevitably becomes part of a calculation . Yet to recognize the workings of guile is not necessarily to conclude that authorial alchemy here simply turns wretchedness into power . It is in the play between the portrait and its exploitation that Cervantes ' characterization of the artist emerges . Criticism of his rival fosters at the same time an ironic self-indictment : <p> Not only ridicule but self-mockery is at work in these jibes at the writer 's vanity . Avellaneda does not stand alone in facing the failure of his inflated ambitions . <p> 3 ( 1983 ) <p> Cervantes ' Portrait of the Artist <p> 93 <p> Looking back ? like Cervantes ? over these sketches of the author , we conclude first that we have found in them nothing like a full-blown autobiography . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passages turn on a series of recognizable themes : 1 ) advancing age , 2 ) poverty , 3 ) the soldier 's calling , 4 ) battle scars , particularly the crippled left hand , 5 ) imprisonment , in both African and Spanish jails , 6 ) strong moral conviction , 7 ) love of literature , and 8 ) a desire to write which invariably exceeds his ability . In every case , the gesture of self-contemplation is dramatized by a form of doubling : the author 's friend in the first Prologue ; the Curate who claims long acquaintance with Cervantes in the scrutiny ; the manuscript peddlar , the translator and the Arab historian ; the mirror tales of the Captain and Saavedra ; the Emperor of China and the scurrilous Avellaneda . The form of the dialogue seems always to hold the portraits suspended ? and images of the most literal sort of suspension abound ? between apology and self-deprecation . Even the New Criticism , in its insistence on severing writing from writers , left largely unexplored as aesthetic objects these islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been recognized that figures of the historical author are somehow mediated by literature , the dominant notion has been that of ? aesthetic distance. ? That is to say , the writer , in an act of creative purification , converts life , his own life , into art . Yet these most ? transparent ? figures of self , it bears repeating , are no less fictions than Don Quixote or Cide Hamete . A supposed verisimilitude , or some likeness to a picture we have grown accustomed to identifying as that of Cervantes , tends to interfere with our ability to perceive the semiotic function of self-portraits within his works . All of these sketches , either explicitly or implicitly , fuse physical characteristics ( age , crippling ) and historical circumstance ( military career , imprisonment , poverty ) with qualities of intellect and spirit . When Cervantes calls our attention to his authorial self , he asks us in effect to see the writer in the shape of human anatomy , of human life history , of human desire . The fusion of the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these qualities a potential metaphor for the other , paving the way for a rich chain of metonymic substitutions . Nor is this economy restricted to Don Quixote : we find the same system at work in virtually all of Cervantes ' <p> 94 <p> MARY GAYLORD RANDEL <p> Cervantes <p> prologues and in the Viaje del Parnaso , to mention only the most obvious examples.16 It becomes clear that when he chooses to intrude into his texts , Cervantes cuts an authorial figure that is anything but authoritarian : aging , impoverished , imprisoned , maimed , he struggles with unfulfilled desires . If portraits of Cervantes are read as portraits of the artist , then it makes sense to look for their relation to other artists and authors within the same texts . In the Quixote , authors ? storytellers and writers ? abound . It is difficult to identify a character in the book who is not in some sense a writer . The categories of character , reader , author , turn out to be virtually reversible , as one narrative 's characters become another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles . To be sure , the most conspicuous authorial figures of the Quixote are the segundo autor , Cide Hamete , the Moorish translator and the imaginary sabio encantador . But it is hard to stop here : we find Gris=stomo , Antonio the goatherd , Marcela , GinTs de Pasamonte ( Maese Pedro ) , Cardenio and Dorotea , the Captive , Vicente de la Rosa , the goatherd Eugenio , Avellaneda , the son of the Caballero del Verde Gabn , the crafty Basilio and his pedantic cousin , Sans=n Carrasco , the Duke and Duchess , and so on ? not to mention the principals , Don Quixote and Sancho Panza themselves . Although not entirely lacking in redeeming qualities , these authors are madmen and misfits , both literary purloiners and literal criminals , sinners and infidels , liars and tricksters , artists in deception and victims of self-deception.18 They dream and scheme , but rarely succeed in converting their desires into reality . They are not only figures of creation , but of destruction and self-destruction . Don Quixote himself suggests quite often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authorial distance sets Cervantes the master above and aloof from the multitude of artistic forms represented by these <p> 16 This paper sketches the outlines of a much larger study on Cervantes ' portraits of the artist , a book in progress . I have previously dealt with poets in La Galatea ( ? The Language of Limits and the Limits of Language : The Crisis of Poetry in La Galatea , ? MLN , 97 1982 , 254-71 ) and in the Entremeses ( ? La poesfa y los poetas en los Entremeses de Cervantes , ? ACerv , forthcoming ) .17 Cf. Ruth El Saffar , Distance and Control.18 Alban K. Forcione , ? The Cervantine Figure of the Poet : Impostor or God ? ? Chapter 9 of Cervantes , Aristotle and the ? Persiles ? ( Princeton : Princeton University Press , 1970 ) , especially p. 306 . <p> 3 ( 1983 ) <p> Cervantes ' Portrait of the Artist <p> 95 <p> tellers and their tales . In this view , the book taken as a whole scrutinizes and implicitly judges the partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the bombastic romances of chivalry , Sancho 's inundating proverbs and ? artless ? folktales ( plagued by redundancies and interruptions ) , the stilted pastoral with its transparent artificiality , the picaresque ( flawed by the limitations of the first-person narrative ) , erudite commentaries like Fernando de Herrera 's Anotaciones , inflexible satires like Avellaneda 's sequel . Certainly no one would argue with the notion that the whole of the Quixote is greater than the sum of its parts . From the dialogue between the Curate and the Canon of Toledo in Part One , Chapter 47 , emerges the vision of an all-inclusive literary genre , that ideal , total form which would subsume every other . The Curate , of course , purports to describe not the Quixote itself , but that good book of chivalry , the prose epic . Cervantistas have found a greater likeness to his picture of fictional perfection in the Persiles . The notion that Cervantes ' success is an effect of distance seems to postulate a true , magisterial voice , which the author withholds as the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must then either posit its nature without ever having heard it , or identify it arbitrarily with particular passages in the text . Critics inevitably differ as to which of these belong to the ? real ? Cervantes . Perhaps , then , it is more fruitful to recognize that the need for a voice pure and secure in its aloofness , untainted by lesser spirits , is our own . Cervantes does not speak unmediated , but through many other voices . Although one of his voices may proclaim the intent to ? derribar la mquina destos caballerescos libros ? ( p. 25 ) , the requirements of parody make the ridiculer and the ridiculed necessary bedfellows . The author 's ? own ? voice is always inextricably bound up with the languages and personae he exploits . Cide Hamete provides a particularly instructive case of the difficulties we face when we try to draw a line between Cervantes and his surrogates . As parody of the overworked fictitious-authorship device of the chivalric romances , Cide Hamete is transparently a pretext . Although from Chapter 9 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author uses him to introduce episodes and to evade theoretical requirements like verisimilitude , the Arab historian seems to be present only when mentioned . Few studies have actually endeavored to characterize the <p> 96 <p> MARY GAYLORD RANDEL <p> Cervantes <p> nature of Cide Hamete 's voice or the features of his rhetoric.19 If we want to go along with the novelist 's ruse of faithful translation faithfully reported , we can technically make nine-tenths of the book Cide Hamete 's and declare the Arab the means of the author 's absence from his work . If , on the other hand , we recognize that the parentheses which his name sets up are largely phony , we must conclude that the invocation of Cide Hamete does not necessarily transform the voice of the narrator . Mancing suggests that the Arab alters that voice only abruptly and momentarily . When , on the last page of Part Two , we are invited to listen to the Arab 's ode to his pen , the voice we hear sends us back to the words of the author 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the pen ? ? reaffirms proprietary authority against ? el escritor fingido y tordesillesco : ? ? Para mf sola sic naci= don Quijote , y yo para Tl ( p. 1068 ) . Then , sounding in these final lines clear echoes of the first Prologue , he brings the book full circle : <p> Surely Cervantes does not expect us to be duped . Here he introduces Cide Hamete , figure and instrument of authorial distance , at that moment ? Death ? when distances and differences collapse , when Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra , Cide Hamete and Don Quixote collapse into one . If the Arab chronicler and the text 's many other surrogate authors are masks of Cervantes , it follows that the text 's jokes on them , especially as they engage the idea of authorship , of authorial authority , are jokes on Cervantes as well . AmTrico Castro preferred to call the famous 1605 Prologue an epilogue . As such , it might be taken for a final summation ( of Part One at least ) , repository of the author 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearest sound of the master 's voice . Yet we found in it no image of assurance and control , but a writer worrying about the problem of how to give his work its authority . The entire Prologue has its fun at the expense of the idea of authority . Every category it introduces ? literary lineage and heredity , freedom , intention and clarity , and so on ? falls prey to ironic contradiction . The author , although calling himself padrastro to Don Quixote , offers his child as confirmation of the genetic rule ? like <p> 3 ( 1983 ) <p> Cervantes ' Portrait of the Artist <p> 97 <p> father , like son. ? Painting himself as a rebel against conventions , he has produced his offspring in a prison . The friend 's advice too is contradictory . First he flippantly commends the trappings of traditional scholarly authority ( Latin marginalia and erudite annotations ) , then brushes that aside , affirming that the writer need only stick to imitation , say what he means : ? procurar que a la llana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vuestra oraci=n y perfodo sonoro y festivo , pintando , en todo lo que alcanzredes y fuere posible , vuestra intenci=n ? ( p. 25 ) . Even these last words make the author 's power contingent : ? en todo lo que alcanzredes y fuere posible ? leaves the proverbial distance between the cup and the lip dangerously open . In this Prologue , then , precisely where we are tempted to think ourselves closest to Cervantes , we learn the law of his text : that every sign , even and especially those which appear to make straightforward declarations and those we might most like to embrace , must be read as partial signs . In particular , critical utterances which champion verbal decorum , structural clarity and wholeness ( as in the case of Don Quixote 's exasperation with Sancho 's mannerisms and Maese Pedro 's famous advice , ? Vuelve a tu senda y camina ? ) , or authorial omnipotence , must , in a text replete with interruptions , affectations , inconsistencies , be read as problematic rather than programmatic . When Cervantes invokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blind belief , but because these are issues which affect his activity as an artist . His self-portraits , caricatured authors and the theoretical pronouncements scattered throughout his works must be considered together , for each by itself is only part of an inquiry into the nature and status of fiction . The critical impulse to reduce the multiple facets to one clear image invariably meets with the text 's resistence.20 Within Cervantes ' fiction , such reductive postures always offer an easy mark for parody . <p> At this point it may prove useful to appeal to the literary theory of Cervantes ' day for help in reassembling the puzzle we have created . It is now well established that Don Quixote 's author experienced the Italian revival of Aristotle 's Poetics by way of Alonso L=pez Pinciano 's Philosophia antigua poTtica ( 1596 ) .21 This fictional sixteenth-century tertulia concerns itself with the most urgent literary questions of the time : imitation , truth in fiction , verisimilitude and the marvelous , unity and variety , the characteristics of classical literary genres , the nature of poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second epistle , confirming the Platonic view that makes painting a less powerful form of art than literature ( ? Los pintores no alborotan tanto los nimos de los hombres como los poetas ? I , 169 ) , even contains the remarkable story of the author 's friend Valerio , who was so moved in the course of reading Amadfs de Gaula , that he fell into a mortal swoon . That anecdote , of more than passing interest to Don Quixote 's creator , alerts us to the possibility that the Philosophia antigua provided Cervantes not only a theoretical scaffolding , but materials for his imaginative edifice as well . Although he brings together Platonic and Aristotelian issues to a greater extent than is often acknowledged , El Pinciano remains a faithful Aristotelian in his concern with the structure of fable . Where literature 's essence is the ? imitation of an action , ? the theorist 's overriding concern becomes the structural logic of that action . The Aristotelian metaphor for the structure of poetry is the human figure ; the Philosopher conceives literary perfection in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . Tragedy embodied for him the greatest structural and therefore anatomical perfection . The Poetics concentrate not so much on the attributes of the artist , as on the nature of art . Aristotle describes the anatomy of poetry . The contertulianos of the Philosophia antigua lean very heavily on the analogy of the cuerpo de fbula ( II , 15 ) . When one of them , Ugo , suggests that ? la fbula toda es un vientre o menudo , y que el argumento es aquella tela mantecosa , dicha entresijo , de donde estn asidos los intestinos , y que Tstos son los episodios , los quales se <p> van enredando con la fbula como los intestinos con la tela ? ( II , 21 ) , he predictably elicits much mirth . Yet a generally serious dependence on the anatomical metaphor pervades the work , giving rise to frequent exaggerations that would in all likelihood have appeared to Cervantes as convenient springboards to parody.22 Beyond this flirtation with humor , the Philosophia antigua as a whole seems to sense that Poetry ( meaning Literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of these contradictions implicates the traditional hierarchy of genres . Of course , tragedy , comedy , even the epic as Aristotle described them , did not flourish in sixteenth-century Spain . How was one , then , to adapt the Poetics to the reality of the literary scene ? El Pinciano 's enthusiasm for Heliodorus sits awkwardly with the clear superiority Aristotle accords to tragedy . Not only does heroic poetry mix voices ( that is , the epic poet speaks directly with his own voice as well as indirectly though the voices of his characters ) and build its story out of many separate actions ; but the author of Theagenes and Cariklea writes in prose . El Pinciano 's sensitivity to that dilemma matches a recurring concern with the contradictions and paradoxes inherent in every demand of art . Literature must seek truth , yet prefer lies ; it must amaze , yet appear real ; it must rouse , yet still the passions ; its language must be clear , yet not common ; it must entertain , yet teach ; its episodes must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite into a defect . In the fifth epistle , where the subject of discussion is verisimilitude , Fadrique , marveling at the extent to which theatrical performance hangs on suspension of disbelief , puzzles : <p> The artffice coxo of the myth is , of course , Hephaestus or Vulcan , son of Jupiter and Juno . One version of his story has his parents evict him from heaven because his deformed body so displeased them . Another has him maimed in the fall when Jupiter , enraged at his son 's intervention in a conjugal dispute on the side of his mother , hurled him down to earth . Vulcan 's love life traces a series of frustrations : unsuccessful in his suit of Minerva , goddess of Wisdom , he married Venus . As husband of the goddess of Love and Beauty , fashioner of exquisite , miraculous warriors ' shields , Vulcan appears entangled in a compromising but suggestive triangle with Venus and Mars.23 Vulcan 's forge and his art , then , figure the power and desire of the cripple , former suitor of Wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the other to Beauty herself . The particular image of art concentrated in the figure of the crippled artifex enables El Pinciano not to criticize the failings of a genre , but rather to locate precisely in that flawed genre the very quintessence of art , with paradox as its paradigm . The crippled artist brings us back once again to Cervantes ' self-portraits and to the surrogate authors who crowd his novel . In the figure of Vulcan the common denominator of the portraits of Cervantes and his others becomes visible : love of beauty wedded to the consciousness of imperfection , even ugliness , deformity , dismemberment ; ? divine ? creative power counterbalanced by limitation . The manco de Lepanto , it is clear , serves no idle referential purpose nor the author 's vanity , but functions semiotically within the same system of signs that includes another maimed artifex , creator and captive of his own feeble armor , that gloriously vulgar Vulcan , Don Quixote de la Mancha . In terms of the literary theory of Cervantes ' day , this figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> views of literature , the uneasy sense of poetry 's power and its fragility . Vulcan , after all , is no golden Apollo , but an unsightly craftsman at the service of principles of order , beauty , strength . He is a compromise ? in the myth he is openly compromised , or cuckolded ? , a contingent authority . In El Pinciano 's sensitivity to the paradoxes of literary representation , we find a way to deal with the apparent arbitrariness of Cervantes ' text , where theory contradicts theory , and theory contradicts practice . Vulcan 's figure , Pinciano 's sign of flawed perfection , makes these inconsistencies not careless aberrations but part of the very essence of art . Perhaps it is our own sensitivity in the late twentieth century to these paradoxes of representation which enables us to see Cervantes and El Pinciano in this light . Our concerns in turn create a new danger : that we will set aside the cast-off myths of Cervantes as recreator of the spirit of his people , or Cervantes the crusader , or Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned myth of Cervantes as post-structuralist . It would be a mistake , I believe , to discover exactly mirrored in Cervantes our fascination with the troubled , infinitely deferred itinerary of reference . Truth for Cervantes was not fictional . As Spitzer insists , in his works an immutable truth lies always behind the play of appearances . But that truth is God 's truth : nowhere , without mockery , does Cervantes attribute that truth to a human actor . A final caution needs to be added . I do not suggest in these pages that Cervantes did not ? actually ? possess and enjoy the privileges of authorship . His control over his text is an historical fact , although the significance of that fact might be argued , particularly by contemporary theorists of intertextuality . Certainly no one would wish to belittle the achievement of a prodigious work which has withstood centuries of reductive assaults and will surely survive ours . In the end , the self-portraits and autobiographical references only serve to renew the sense of wonder ? frequent privilege of the reader of Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns dross into imaginative gold , and then suspends its shining threads in the precarious space between fact and myth.24 Yet it is striking that Cervantes chooses to dramatize the author 's relation to his text in figures which do not suggest authority , control , <p> power , but rather contingency , limitation , even impotence . If he makes visible the strings of authorial manipulation , he does so not so much glorying in the power of his art as wrestling with its paradoxes . In Cervantes ' literary cosmos , the authorial deity is a crippled god . 
@@40786704 @786704/ <p> Reviewed by David Robinson ( Michigan State University ) Published on H-Africa ( December , 1995 ) <p> Elizabeth Isichei has accomplished a very ambitious task : to bring together , in one volume , an account of the history of the different Christian enterprises and communities on the African continent . Not since C.P. Groves wrote his four volume history ( 1948-1958 ) has anyone attempted anything of comparable breadth , or surveyed a more vast literature . Adrian Hastings ' A History of African Christianity , 1950-1975 ( 1979 ) is obviously more limited . Professor Isichei lived , taught and wrote in Nigeria for many years , and brings her own experience of research and teaching to bear on the subject . Students and scholars will be in her debt for some time to come . <p> Isichei has chosen a chronological and regional framework for the book . The first chapter describes Christianity in Mediterranean Africa , Nubia and Ethiopia in ancient times . The second deals with the " middle years " of c. 1500-1800 , focusing on the Portuguese efforts to interact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at or near the coast . It deals with the vexed issue of the Atlantic slave trade and missionaries ' associations with it . <p> Isichei then concentrates for the rest of the book on the modern missionary movement and responses to it over the last 200 years . Chapter 3 , entitled " Mission renewed " , is a chronicle and occasionally an analysis of evangelical Protestant , Catholic and interdenominational " Faith Missions " and their various backgrounds and implantations . In subsequent chapters she moves to the different regions of Africa and the practice of Christianity up to 1900 , and then up to 1960 . She concludes with an overall chapter ( 12 ) on Africa since independence , which does not include northern Africa . <p> While the work is abundantly documented , it does not contain a bibliography or guide to further reading at the end . The index is minimal , limited to personal and place names . The maps are not adequate . Two continental maps , dealing with the environmental and modern boundaries , decorate the beginning . A number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no table warns the reader of their existence . All are general maps which do little to illuminate the situations of the Christian communities . Perhaps in their haste to make this important reference work available , author and publisher have not made this volume as useful as it might have been . <p> By choosing to write a survey , and to include in the definition of survey all instances of Christianity , of whatever persuasion , Professor Isichei has forced herself to move quickly and rather superficially over the mass of data and communities on the continent . Her chapters are typically broken into small sections of one to three pages each . She notes the ethnocentrism and Euro-centrism of most European missionaries and the very different understandings of African communities , and she affirms the variety of forms of Christianity which have emerged . She notes the controversies that have divided African Christians , including the knotty problems faced by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church , gives due emphasis to the independent churches that have emerged in Africa over the last century , and provides vignettes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have fought for the integrity of African societies and Christianities . Her sympathy for African struggles to create meaningful Christian lives is palpable . <p> Isichei is not able to take the reader very far into the dynamics of the Christian communities , their struggles with modernization , and the interface between the religious domain and social , economic and political realities . She addresses fundamental issues within the churches and communities , across gender and class lines , and between Christians and the larger societies and the state , but she does this in small sections buried in the regional and chronological chapters . To give a fairly typical example : in chapter 10 , " West Africa c. 1900 to c. 1960 , " she has 25 section headings in 35 pages . Those headings include such topics as " Church and State , " " Rivalry and cooperation , " " Mission and society , " " Marriage , " " Schools , " " Consistency , " " Purity and gender , " and " Literacy , " in addition to treatments of religious leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to similar headings in other chapters . <p> A History of Christianity in Africa is , consequently , a very useful survey and reference work for students of African religions and Christianity in Africa . It justifiably places an African claim to the Alexandrian and North African fathers of the early Christian church as well as to Samuel Ajayi Crowther , Johann Ludwig Krapf , John Chilembwe , and Isaiah Shembe . In the words of Richard Gray , the student of African religion quoted on the back cover , Isichei has provided a " vigorous introductory survey , crowded with memorable characters and incidents . " Her notes provide avenues whereby the interested reader can easily locate the relevant secondary literature . Her work will stimulate work of greater depth on the issues which she mentions in this work .

As editor Martin Klein of the University of Toronto notes , the " aim of the series is to stimulate debate , to challenge students and general readers " ( title page ) . Gomez fulfills this goal admirably by presenting a concise , well-organized and clearly written account of the development of the African Diaspora from ancient times to the Cold War . <p> Reversing Sail navigates the substantial historiography on the African Diaspora , providing basic definitions of key concepts and capturing the essence of the field . One example is how thoroughly Gomez defines the African Diaspora , " the massive movements and extensive relocations of persons of African descent , over long periods of time , resulting in the dispersal of Africans and their descendants throughout much of the world " ( p. 1 ) . There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomez manages to boil down a complex concept into a few simple phrases packed with meaning . He introduces undergraduate students to basic concepts in the study of the African Diaspora , such as identity formation , cultural exchange , the idea of Africa as a land of origin , slave experiences , the importance of race , confrontations with oppression , and the continued symbolic importance of Africa to persons of African descent . The " Suggestions for Further Readings " add to the text 's value , making Reversing Sail an important resource for graduate students interested in the African Diaspora , or compiling an exam reading list . <p> Gomez stays true to the target audience by offering a simply structured text composed of two parts . Part 1 , " Old World Dimensions , " explores various aspects of the African Diaspora prior to European contact with the Americas . Beginning his study in ancient Egypt with the origins of the African Diaspora in 3500-1700 BCE , Gomez examines the dissemination of African ideas and their influence on the Mediterranean world , clearly demonstrating the indebtedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Africans . The next chapter explores the role of Africans in the Bible and how these roles and experiences have shaped African identities since the writing of that tome . Of significance is the chapter 's explanation of how supporters and critics of slavery used the Bible to defend their divergent claims . This well-known material is refreshingly presented by conceptualising the Bible " to be primarily concerned with ' people of color , ' including Africans " ( p. 20 ) . Gomez offers fresh readings of Old Testament stories that include a range of interpretations of Noah 's curse on his son Ham , also known as the Hamitic curse , which generations of whites used to justify slavery and prove the supposed inferiority of Africans . <p> Part 1 concludes with a brief examination of " Africans and the Islamic World .

" Referring to Europeans as " an energetic group " that " burst upon the world scene , " Gomez chronicles the beginning of this new era in world history by examining the interconnectedness of global developments " that " gave rise to the transatlantic slave trade " ( p. 59 ) .

Desirous to reconnect with Africa , blacks could " return " to their cultural home through various intellectual pursuits , including art , music , and religion . Moreover , Gomez asserts that even in the modern era persons of African descent continue to experience seemingly endless motion , " fighting racism and colonialism globally " in a show of defiance " consistent " with the earliest slave revolts ( p. 193 ) . This defiance , Gomez concludes , will not end until Africans and their descendents are fully free . <p> That the book is a tour de force of decades of scholarship on the African Diaspora necessarily means that synthesis rules at the expense of detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years of history in a neat package , the astute student will have many questions about specifics .

" asks Naimark . " Or was there something new in these wars of ' ethnic cleansing ' about which the media spoke and wrote so often " ( p. 2 ) ? <p> Naimark 's answer is twofold . Firstly , he argues , it is important to distinguish between " ethnic cleansing " and genocide . These two activities are characterized by their different objectives . " Genocide is the intentional killing off of part or all of an ethnic , religious or national group ; the murder of a people or peoples ... is the objective . The intention of ethnic cleansing is to remove a people and often all traces of them from a concrete territory " ( p. 3 ) . The goal of the latter , therefore , is concerned with securing the ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders of a new and insecure state . This may involve expulsions , deportations , or forced transfers of a population carried out in a more or less orderly , though invariably brutal , manner . In certain circumstances , however , " ethnic cleansing " can generate genocidal actions ; as Naimark writes in his habitually simple yet evocative prose , " ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide , as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people " ( pp. 3-4 ) . <p> If it is necessary to distinguish in this way between genocide and ethnic cleansing , this does not mean that recent events in the former Yugoslavia were unprecedented . On the contrary , Naimark asserts that " ' ethnic cleansing ' is a useful and viable term for understanding not just the war in former Yugoslavia but other similar cataclysmic events in the course of the twentieth century " ( p. 3 ) . This second point takes us to the core of the author 's comparative project . <p> Genocide , in Naimark 's conception , is the consummate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 ) , which all too frequently in the twentieth century prompted European states--as well as others which , as noted above , remain outside the purview of this work--to embark on ethnic cleansing. 3 It is this underlying motivation which makes the phenomenon of ethnic cleansing " a profoundly modern experience " ( p. 6 ) . <p> Naimark offers a compelling account of why this is so . Firstly , the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries witnessed the spread of a " racialist nationalism " which asserted an " essentialist view of nations , a view that excluded the ' other ' and foreswore assimilation " ( p. 7 ) . This prompted European imperial powers to repatriate practices of mass murder from the colonies to their continental homelands . <p> Secondly , as European imperial territories fragmented in the early-twentieth century , there emerged a new form of state , defining itself in ethnic terms and striving to " homogenize " society to meet its own " needs for order , transparency , and responsiveness " ( p. 8 ) . 4 To accomplish this , the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its citizens , subjecting its population to regulation , surveillance , and manipulation by means of policy and propaganda . Crucially , it " insisted on identifying ethnic groups and concretizing difference and otherness with the goal of banishing it " ( p. 8 ) . <p> Thirdly , the new states ' capacity to intervene in society and effect their desired social and spatial re-ordering would have been impossible without modern innovations in communications , transportation , and the means of killing : " the drive toward ethnic cleansing comes in part from the modern state 's compulsion to complete policies and finish with problems but also in part from its technological abilities to do so " ( p. 9 ) . <p> Naimark , drawing on the work of historians such as Omer Bartov and Elizabeth Domansky , identifies the First World War as the defining experience , the " crucible for the development of the modern nation-state and its willingness and ability to engage in mass population policies " ( p. 9 ) . 5 In particular , he points to ways in which states at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their citizens and for the first time engaged in mass-scale forced deportations and evacuations ( which persisted as practices of peace-making , as new post-war governments embarked on the " unmixing " of territories and populations before the treaties were signed , sealed , and implemented ) . 6 The Great War also " introduced industrial killing into the consciousness and reality of the European state system " ( p. 9 ) . <p> Finally , Naimark directs attention to the role of political elites in instigating ethnic cleansing , and of bureaucrats and technical professionals in organizing its implementation . Throughout the book , in fact , the author repeatedly emphasizes that eruptions of inter-communal conflict have more to do with the " warped ambitions " ( p. 16 ) of cynical political actors , and their machinations and manipulations , than with the " ancient ethnic hatreds " so often adduced by the world 's media ( and by politicians in other countries reluctant to intervene ) as the source of ethnic violence . This is doubtless true , but Naimark might have attempted to examine the motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce blood-letting upon neighbors with whom they have lived for years in peace. 7 <p> Naimark , however , is more interested in writing history " from above " and he writes this history with admirable clarity , constructing a series of detailed analytical narratives that draw together an impressive range of secondary literature in numerous languages as well as some of his own archival research in the Russian archives . Each of the five case studies examines the particular " confluence of events , political leadership , and intercommunal hostility " ( p. 16 ) which determined the context and course of the events in question , and could stand alone as a short but thorough introduction to each topic , suitable for students as well as for a more general readership . At the same time , Naimark takes care throughout to assess the similarities and differences between each instance of ethnic cleansing . <p> A concluding chapter offers a useful systematization and reiteration of the insights the attentive reader will have elicited from the case studies , if they have not been numbed by the often gruesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic cleansing , from 1915 in Turkey to the present day in Kosovo , Naimark identifies a marked consistency of purpose and commonality of procedure . <p> Firstly , Naimark notes that ethnic cleansing is always a violent process . Unlike war , however , which " matches armed men against armed men in a contest of will , machines and numbers , ethnic cleansing usually involves an armed perpetrator and an unarmed victim--more often than not , an armed man and an unarmed woman , child , or elderly person " ( p. 186 ) . The violence of ethnic cleansing is particularly vicious and personal , motivated in part by a " rational " strategy of encouraging flight , but also by a desire to punish the victims for " their crime of being different " ( p. 186 ) . Even the " well-organised and premeditated " deportations of the Chechens-Ingush and Crimean Tatars involved high rates of mortality from disease and starvation , and the " orderly ' transfer ' " of Germans from Poland claimed up to half a million victims ( pp. 186-187 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed cases of ethnic cleansing have occurred either during war or during the " chaotic transition from war to peace " ( p. 187 ) . In such circumstances , state leaders can carry out extreme actions beyond the scrutiny of their own public and outside the purview of international opinion . War also offers regimes the opportunity to eliminate allegedly treacherous groups of the population . Furthermore , war " habituates its participants to killing and to obeying orders " ( p. 188 ) . The author remarks usefully that regular armies are frequently employed to carry out ethnic cleansing , but many of the worst atrocities are perpetrated by paramilitary formations . <p> Another characteristic common to all the cases of twentieth-century ethnic cleansing under examination has been their " totalistic " objectives . " Ethnic cleansing , driven by the ideology of integral nationalism and the military and technological power of the modern state , rarely forgives , makes exceptions or allows people to slip through the cracks " ( p. 190 ) . Here , as throughout the book , Naimark sensibly allows for exceptions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuance and difference . Thus , while the author emphasizes the " totalizing " nature of the Soviet national deportations and of the Nazi persecution , deportation , and , later , murder of the Jews , he concedes that Turkish assaults on the Armenians and Greeks did not aspire to total elimination of these ethnic populations ( permitting some Armenian women , for example , to convert to Islam and join Turkish households ) , and that the Polish and Czechoslovak governments in 1945 promulgated definitions of nationality and citizenship which left some slight room for accommodation with minorities , at least initially . <p> Throughout the case studies , Naimark stresses three further aspects of ethnic cleansing that testify to its " totalizing " scope . He consolidates these themes in his conclusion . Firstly , in almost all instances the authorities responsible for uprooting populations have striven to eradicate from the purged territory all residual traces of the former existence of these departing groups . To achieve this , the instigators of ethnic cleansing do not stop at the demolition of material remains of the displaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and frequently homes ( though sometimes the houses are occupied by neighbors or new settlers of the ethnic majority population ) . They also destroy all cultural and linguistic residues , burning books , encyclopaedias , dictionaries , and archives , changing place and street names , re-writing history books and ethnographies , or proscribing the use of a language . <p> Secondly , ethnic cleansing also involves dispossessing the displaced population . Sometimes the state itself undertakes to expropriate their property . More often it encourages its supporters to rob , exploit , and cheat the refugees out of their possessions . There is purpose in this criminality : to ensure departing communities have no means to return , and to ensure that if they do return , they can make no claims over confiscated or stolen property . <p> Finally , ethnic cleansing is deeply misogynistic , invariably being directed disproportionately at female populations as the " cultural and biological repository of the nation " ( p. 83 ) . In particular , Naimark underlines the use of systematic campaigns of rape as a " tool of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorize the target population , to drive them out of their homes and territories , and to punish and humiliate them for their difference . <p> Naimark 's stated ambition in this work is that by identifying " the characteristics of ethnic cleansing and examining the way it works in concrete cases ... we may perhaps find ways to prevent future episodes , or at least to stop them earlier in their fearsome trajectories towards genocide " ( p. 185 ) . His conclusion , however , is not optimistic . Corrupt and cynical political elites continue to exploit integral nationalism to mobilize support ; having gained power , they continue to implement " homogenizing " programs on behalf of their own socio-ethnic constituency . Yet when nationalist regimes undertake such actions , the international community continues to be impotent , refusing to intervene or intervening tardily and ineffectually . What is worse , history seems to demonstrate that ethnic cleansing is successful in its own terms . In Kosovo , despite international intervention ( or , some would claim , partly as a result of a belated and misconceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , separated from their former neighbours by walls , barbed wire , and heavily armed NATO forces " ( p. 182 ) . As Naimark argues , societies in the longer term are left impoverished by the departure of minorities and the permanent loss of diversity . <p> Overall , this volume is a significant contribution to the literature on genocide , as well as to our understanding of forms of collective violence and the nature of the modern state . The book 's strengths have already been described . To criticize it for a lack of great theoretical originality or sophistication would be to miss the point--this volume is designed to be a comparative analysis of a series of empirical case studies , and its conceptual framework is perfectly adequate for this purpose . It raises many important and challenging questions , in particular concerning the nature of " high modernism " ; about the correlation between modern state-building and the " totalizing " claims and practices of different systems and regimes ; about the rationality of ethnic cleansing as a state strategy ; about the character of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own experience of ethnic cleansing . That a slim volume such as this offers only partial answers is to be expected . Indeed , its great virtue and value lie precisely in its vigorous exposition of a new and vital research agenda , which will , without doubt , inspire many scholars to pursue more exhaustive studies . That the publishers failed to include relevant maps to illustrate the case studies is , however , unforgivable , especially since the author defines ethnic cleansing specifically with reference to its territorial dimensions . <p> Notes <p> 1 . For example , see Isidor Wallimann and Michael Dobkowski , Genocide and the Modern Age : Etiology and Case Studies of Mass Death ( New York : Syracuse University Press , 2000 ) . While many of the individual chapters are engaging works of historical synthesis , social scientific abstraction , or theological and philosophical reflection , the volume as a whole , in the opinion of this reviewer , serves more to befuddle than to enlighten . <p> 3 .

@@40786710 @786710/ <p> Richard T. Arndt 's relationship with U.S. cultural diplomacy has spanned more than a half-century . He spent the years 1961-85 serving in an official capacity with the Department of State and the United States Information Agency ( USIA ) . But his first experience came years before , in 1949 , when he was part of the initial wave of Fulbrighters to benefit from a pioneering program in international cultural exchange . In 1985 , he returned from whence he came--the academy--to contemplate his experiences and use them to educate others . This book is the culmination of those decades of observing , practicing , contemplating , and , above all , believing in the " art of cultural diplomacy " ( p. 550 ) . <p> At six hundred pages , The First Resort of Kings is really two interweaving books . The first is a synthetic history of the various institutional attempts at a public diplomacy ( a term Arndt uses interchangeably with " cultural diplomacy " ) in the United States since World War I. The second might be called a memoir , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many colleagues , friends , and acquaintances he made throughout his long career . The book begins the transition from history to memoir--a transition it never fully realizes--when Arndt made the jump from the academy to the foreign service in 1961 . <p> The synthetic history recounts a story with which many historians of U.S. foreign relations will already be familiar . Arndt borrows liberally from works by Emily S. Rosenberg ( Spreading the American Dream : American Economic and Cultural Expansion , 1890-1945 1981 and Financial Missionaries to the World : The Politics and Culture of Dollar Diplomacy , 1900-1930 2003 ) , Frank A. Ninkovich ( The Diplomacy of Ideas : U.S. Foreign Policy and Cultural Relations , 1938-1950 1981 ) , and others who have written about the public and private cultural diplomacy initiatives of the interwar and immediate postwar years . He discusses in sharp prose the tensions arising during WWI and after between " unidirectional informationists " interested in spreading " truth " about American values and the proponents of reciprocal educational and cultural exchanges to build bridges of international understanding ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government handled the task of information ( e.g. , George Creel 's Committee on Public Information ) , while the **26;289;TOOLONG idea developed primarily in the world of private philanthropy . Secretary of State Cordell Hull , impressed with Pan-American commitments to cultural exchange at a 1936 Buenos Aires conference , established in 1938 the first State Department division dedicated to globalizing U.S. cultural exchange . Two heroes of Arndt 's story--Sumner Welles and Archibald MacLeish--headed the division consecutively from its founding until the end of World War II . For Arndt , MacLeish defined the office 's imperatives better than any of his successors : " In a divided world in which the real issue of division is the cultural issue , cultural relations are not irrelevancies . They are everything " ( p. 61 ) . In much of the narrative that follows the division 's founding , informationists and uncultured bureaucrats continually defile the culturalist purity of the founders ' vision . <p> The first postwar decade witnessed increased attention to the possibilities that public diplomacy presented in the emerging ideological conflict with the Soviet Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CU ) struggled for an identity trapped between the informationists and the culturalists . Prominent politicians like Nelson Rockefeller sought to blur the lines between unidirectional information ( i.e. , propaganda ) and open and honest cultural exchange . The creation of the USIA in 1953 aimed at correcting the balance , but the lines between the CU 's and USIA 's functions were never clearly articulated , generating decades of tensions between the two camps . Established by Dwight D. Eisenhower , " in a spirit of nationalist renewal , as a separate agency for nonmilitary psychological warfare , " USIA effectively defeated the hopes of culturalists ' intent on conducting a public diplomacy divorced from narrow geopolitical interests ( p. 237 ) . Arndt painstakingly details decades of bureaucratic and congressional debate over the ends and means of cultural diplomacy . <p> The grandest hero on Arndt 's stage is Senator J. William Fulbright , progenitor of U.S. public diplomacy 's most successful and sustainable program . Reflecting on his achievements at the end of his life , the enigmatic Arkansan intellectual recalled that he " just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 178 ) . By any measure the senator was successful : in its first dozen years the Fulbright Program could already count fifty thousand U.S. and foreign alumni , and it consumed half of CU 's annual budget . Arndt sees the program as the one unequivocal triumph of U.S. public diplomacy in the postwar era , because it did what good public diplomacy should do : the U.S. government facilitated and stimulated exchanges and then it got out of the way . As a Fulbright student in France in 1949 and as a State Department officer after 1961 charged with chairing national Fulbright selection committees , Arndt 's judgment comes from years of personal experience . <p> The book 's most significant contribution to new understanding of public diplomacy is in its detailing of the daily lives and activities of cultural affairs officers ( CAOs ) . As Arndt writes , " The life of a CAO is a well-kept American secret " ( p. 301 ) . Despite his professional training in French literature , Arndt spent time as a CAO in locations as diverse as Beirut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stationed where their experience applied , nor did they stay in any one location for more than a few years ; the idea was to prevent the development of affinities that might cloud rational assessments of U.S. national interest . ) He matches his personal recollections with published and unpublished memoirs of fellow CAOs , along with his memories of countless conversations over a lifetime . The result is a unique glance into public diplomacy at the " point of contact , " where " talented " CAOs were always making remarkable connections with local populations but rarely received credit ( p. 281 ) . The enterprising researcher may be frustrated that often pages brimming with detail pass with few or no citations to sources--standard practice for a memoir , but insufficient for a scholarly work . <p> The exceptionally high quality of CAOs in the first two postwar decades made that period a " golden age " of public diplomacy , in Arndt 's judgment ( p. 311 ) . He provides biographical sketches of " super-CAOs " from this period , intellectuals like the imperial historian Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Arndt stresses that CU and USIA once valued placing uniquely talented intellectuals in the official service of cultural diplomacy . This pattern ended in 1974 with USIA 's decision to hire only " generalists , " whom Arndt sees as cultural " apparatchiks " sufficiently competent at touting the party line but intellectually undistinguished ( p. 457 ) . By phasing out the super-CAOs , USIA effectively bureaucratized cultural diplomacy . It eliminated the " one constant of U.S. cultural diplomacy : its occasional and repeated capacity to put marvelous people in the field and let them do amazing things " ( p. 458 ) . Arndt 's disillusion with the end of the golden age is palpable throughout the book . <p> USIA 's 1974 decision marked the beginning of a decades-long decline in attention to public diplomacy that would ultimately result in Congress ' dissolution of the agency in 1999 . In an act of misplaced idealism , the Jimmy Carter administration merged the functions of CU and USIA in 1978 , granting the new union the title of International Communications Agency ( a temporary name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the informationists in USIA and the culturalists in CU ended with USIA victory and the death knell for an independent cultural diplomacy . Arndt is skeptical of the " revolution " swept into government by Ronald Reagan 's election , seeing instead a pack of ideologues intent on trimming any function of public diplomacy that did not meet their immediate and aggressively nationalistic ends . The narrative is increasingly thin after the mid-1980s , speeding through the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton years to the agency 's termination . <p> The final chapter summarizes the lessons of public diplomacy 's history for an era when the U.S. government has shunned it in favor of aggressive unilateralism . Three pages of neatly bulleted historical and contemporary political arguments encapsulate Arndt 's claims throughout the dense text . Some of them are diplomatic axioms ( " ' reservoirs of good will ' ... take decades to fill and minutes to empty but can be replenished " ) , while others tempt historians with new ways of conceptualizing the institutional history of public diplomacy ( " Since cultural diplomacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid field structure of USIA seriously impeded its work " ) ( pp. 551 , 552 ) . Arndt 's prescriptions include rebuilding the sort of CAO corps of talented intellectuals drawn from university life that dominated U.S. cultural diplomacy from WWII until the late 1960s . <p> The book 's primary weakness through all the talk of culture is that it fails to interrogate how culture 's meaning changed dramatically in the postwar era . Arndt writes at the outset that " thoughtful cultural diplomats " use the term in the " anthropological " sense to " denote the complex factors of the mind and values which define a country or group , especially those factors transmitted by the processes of intellect " ( p. xviii ) . While anthropologists in the first postwar decades may have defined culture as such , most no longer view it as so deterministic . Even so , culture still unfortunately functions throughout the book not as culture-as-determinant but in the even older sense of culture-as-art ; for Arndt 's CAOs , culture was the realm of great white men who dedicated themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , the overseas libraries ( which Arndt discusses in an illuminating half-chapter ) and the touring art exhibits brought foreign societies closer to the United States , but often " low " culture , like television and Coca-Cola , had a greater impact , especially at the nonintellectual level . <p> Not to claim that the author should have added further weight to this six-hundred-page work , but he at least could have acknowledged that CAOs lived in one world of culture while much of the rest of the world ( including the United States ) lived in another . The sort of culture in which the CAOs were interested was the kind they learned in classrooms at Harvard and Yale in the first half of the twentieth century . In fact , Arndt 's description of the CAO profession occasionally reads like nostalgia for Ivy League fraternity life , e.g. , when he describes fresh faces in CU as " new boys " ( p. 75 ) . As part of a memoir , it is quaint ; as a work of history , it smacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , " Even educated Americans have little understanding of the criteria and the values of intellect , of the life of the mind , of the community of scholars , of lives spent searching for new truth " ; or " intellectual relations are best carried on by denizens of the world of intellect " ( pp. 419 , 520 ) . He even disparages the Clinton administration 's attempt to bring the U.S. cultural diversity to cultural diplomacy by hiring women and minorities , " which created a stress on appearance over excellence " ( p. 539 ) . The occasional impression in this otherwise highly informative text is that culture should remain the privileged domain of the cultured . <p> Arndt 's writing style , while lively enough to hold the reader 's attention through many pages , is frequently peppered with metaphors that obfuscate more than they clarify .

@@40786711 @786711/ <p> One area of rhetorical study that has burgeoned in the last decades is in biblical studies , in particular New Testament studies . The result has been provocative and revealing analyses of the rhetorical function and structure of scriptural texts . Since Amos N. Wilder 's Haskell Lectures delivered in 1962 at Oberlin College and culminating in his Early Christian Rhetoric ( 1964 ) , biblical scholars have steadily investigated scriptural texts using rhetorical critical methods . For more than a decade , Vernon K. Robbins has been a major contributor to the rhetorical turn in New Testament studies , and his book Exploring the Texture of Texts : A Guide to Socio-Rhetorical Interpretation is another milestone in the field . Although the intended audience for the book is students and scholars of the New Testament , the relevance of this book need not be limited to New Testament criticism . Scholars and students of rhetorical criticism , socio-linguistics , and cultural history will find much to reward their time and efforts in this book . <p> The scope of the book is suggested in its title : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphor of textures within a larger metaphor of tapestry . The richness of a tapestry is best appreciated when beheld from several perspectives , each different from the others and each revealing something unique about the composition of the whole ( pp. 2-3 ) . In many ways , Exploring the Texture of Texts is the instructional counterpart of his analysis of the discourses of early Christianity , The Tapestry of Early Christian Discourse : Rhetoric , Society and Ideology ( Routledge , 1996 ) . The metaphor of tapestry is apt because Robbins presupposes that meaning is multivalent in " that words themselves work in complicated ways to communicate meanings that we only partially understand " and in " that meanings themselves have their meanings by their relation to other meanings " ( p. 132 ) . Given these presuppositions , any serious reader will benefit by exploring the multiple layers or the many textures of texts . <p> Robbins ' socio-rhetorical interpretation draws upon work from several disciplines . " Socio " refers to interpretative strategies developed in sociology , anthropology , and socio-linguisitcs . Occasionally , Robbins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe the results of socio-rhetorical analyses ( pp. 2 , 5 , 130 ) , and in these adjectives one can hear echoes of Clifford Geertz 's classic essays " Thick Description : Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture " and " Deep Play : Notes on the Balinese Cockfight " ( The Interpretation of Cultures 1973 ) . Robbins complements the insights from social science with rhetorical criticism of the Bible and with rhetorical sources such as Aristotle , Rhetorica ad Herennium , Quintillian , Hermogenes ' and Theon 's progymnasmata , and Burke . The result of this interdisciplinary approach is an impressive array of interpretive tools for the scholar and student . <p> Robbins ' purpose in Exploring the Texture of Texts is " to build an environment for interpretation that provides interpreters with a basic , overall view of life and language as we use it " ( p. 2 ) . This goal presupposes the complexity of the interpretive task as well as the abilities that we as interpreters of life and language already possess . His focus , therefore , " is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another " and " to integrate skills people use in ordinary life with exploration of the intricacies of language in a text " ( p. 2 ) . This goal involves all the language strategies people use to negotiate meanings , but it also includes an awareness of how social and historical locations as well as personal interests affect the interpretive process . Robbins confesses that final interpretations of texts are impossible , and his approach does not claim to yield finality or completeness ( p. 2 ) . As a result Robbins has made accessible to anyone who wants to read carefully a rich array of interpretive tools with unlimited potential . <p> Robbins identifies five textures of texts . They are : 1 ) inner texture , 2 ) intertexture , 3 ) social and cultural texture , 4 ) ideological texture , and 5 ) sacred texture . With the exception of the last , all textures could easily be applied , with minor adjustments , to any text . Each chapter analyzes texture focusing primarily on the same passage in the Gospel of Mark 15:1-16:8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " features in the language of the text itself " ( p. 7 ) . Chapter Two explains intertexture , or the relation of the text to other texts , oral , written , cultural , social , and historical . Chapter Three develops social and cultural texture , or the ways texts encourage readers " to adopt certain social and cultural locations and orientations rather than others " ( p. 72 ) . Chapter Four explores ideological texture , which " concerns the biases , opinions , preferences , and stereotypes of a particular writer and a particular reader " ( p. 95 ) . This chapter recounts a fascinating situation in which three different interpretations of the same passage of scripture are given by three different interpreters with different ideological commitments , showing how each ideology applied to the same textual data yields a different interpretation . Chapter Five explains sacred texture as the way in which readers use texts to relate human life to the divine ( p. 120 ) . <p> Each chapter concludes with a study guide that takes readers carefully through the textures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful in leading students through the socio-rhetorical approach . Robbins insists that the five textures need not all be applied to any given text , that there is no order to the levels of texture , and that not all the resources of socio-rhetorical analysis need to be applied ( p. 5 ) . The reader is free to pick and choose from the textures and the kinds of analysis the interpretive tools that best suit the text , the interpretive purpose , and the rhetorical situation . <p> Within each of the five textures , Robbins lays out several textural constituents . For example , the inner texture consists in the familiar elements of literary and rhetorical close reading . Specifically , Robbins encourages readers to become acutely aware of " words , word patterns , voices , structures , devices , and modes in the text , which are the context for meanings and meaning-effects that an interpreter analyzes with the other readings of the text " ( p. 7 ) . Robbins identifies inner texture as consisting of repetitive , progressive , narrational , opening-middle-closing , argumentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virtue of the socio-rhetorical method by putting one layer of texture against another to provide new insight into how the text works . For instance , many detailed analyses at the level of inner texture never answer the question " So what ? . " It sometimes appears as though detailed analysis is an exercise in its own right . Not so in Robbins ' analysis . In an analysis of the inner texture , Robbins suggests making tables of repeated words and concepts . Along the horizontal axis , the critic lists the topics of repeated words and concepts . Along the vertical axis , the critic charts the sequence of the text . The result is not just a list of repetitions , but a table of significant topics and their progression . That is , the table of repeated words and concepts becomes a tool for determining how the repetitive texture and pattern of a text complements and enables the progressive texture and pattern . This kind of inter-relational analysis is typical of Robbins ' socio-rhetorical method and substantiates his supposition that interpretation is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner texture , Robbins ' analyses are not unfamiliar to most readers aware of literary formalism and rhetorical criticism and resemble the kind of analysis of sacred texts one could find in the rhetorical tradition in such texts as Augustine 's De Doctrina Christiana , Book Three , or in Joachim Camerarius ' Notatio figurarum sermonis in libris quatuor euangeliorum ( 1572 ) or in Salomon Glass 's Philologia sacra ( 1653 ) . In other textures , however , Robbins uses familiar rhetorical terms such as " topics " and gives them new meaning and life by incorporating research from sociology . The common social and cultural topics , for instance , are not patterns of inference as in Aristotle , but are instead values , patterns , or codes that help interpreters avoid ethnocentrism and anachronism in their interpretations . For example , interpreters of the New Testament need to be aware of the cultural topics characteristic of their own time and place as opposed to those operative in the Mediterranean region during the first century CE . This would require an understanding of the difference between " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values " ( pp. 75-76 ) . <p> In all , Robbins ' socio-rhetorical approach is interdisciplinary but not haphazardly so . The range and depth of what he offers does , in fact , provide the tools for thick and deep , and I must add , insightful interpretations of texts . The book is straightforward and could easily be used as a textbook for literary or rhetorical criticism or for any course in which interpretation is requisite . Its appeal may be limited because all examples are taken from the Bible and presumes some familiarity with Christianity . Nevertheless , Robbins has succeeded in bringing together an abundant repertoire of interpretive strategies and has presented them in a way illuminating for scholars and students alike . 69402 @qwx479402

Col. Eugenio Daza led a group of Philippine revolutionaries from their hiding places in a church inside an American army camp on the island of Samar . Armed mostly with bolos and machetes , the Filipino soldiers descended on a group of unsuspecting U.S. troops as they ate breakfast . " With the surprise , and at such close range , the insurgent disadvantage in weapons was neutralized , and bitter hand-to-hand combat broke out " ( p. 191 ) . U.S. forces were routed . Those that survived fled to the coast , climbing into small boats , and after several days at sea they made it to the nearest American outpost . Virtually every member of U.S. Infantry Company C had been wounded in the surprise attack , and forty-eight were killed , while approximately twenty-five to thirty Filipino soldiers died ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war such as these through a driving , concise narrative in A War of Frontier and Empire : The Philippine-American War , 1899-1902 . The attack was one of the most sensational events of the conflict . For most Filipinos , it was a triumphant military victory . But for the American army , the events on Samar were best understood as a massacre , which represented their worst single defeat of the war . The American response was swift and terrible , underscoring the inherent military and moral hazards of this sort of conflict . Gen. Jacob Hurd Smith razed the town of Balangiga where the attack happened . He then reportedly issued the much-maligned direction to make the interior of Samar a " howling wilderness " in retribution . These events have tended to give rise to an interpretation of the war as evidence of America 's racist , violent , and imperial motivations . Silbey is careful to show that while there is some truth behind such assessments , the Samar atrocities should not be construed as evidence that only the United States committed wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence on all sides . <p> In recent years new studies of American empire and the conflict in the Philippines have flourished in part because of the pressing questions historians are asking about the U.S. role in the world . Noting the " urgency of the asking , " from 1899 to 1902--and today--David Silbey has produced a good , brief survey of what he terms " three separate and distinct conflicts " in the Philippines ( pp. xi , xv ) . The question " What form was American entry into true global power to take ? " lies at the heart of the way that Silbey adeptly surveys and synthesizes much of the work on the American-side of the conflict , including a limited but attentive effort to explore the Filipino perspective ( p. xi ) . <p> Silbey 's book is an excellent introduction to the Philippine-American War that is primarily a military history and is best suited for students and for a popular audience . A War of Frontier and Empire is succinct , well written , and illustrated with maps and photos , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise movements of people and armies . <p> Silbey argues that the conflict itself represents a transitional moment in American thinking about frontier and empire . He asserts that the Philippine-American War must be understood as occurring in three distinct periods and in terms of three discrete conflicts . First , in 1898 , was the brief-lived alliance between U.S. and Filipino forces that fought and defeated Spain ( not a major focus for Silbey ) . Then , in 1899 , immediately on the heels of victory over the Spanish , tensions rose and shortly thereafter a " second " war began . It was a conventional conflict between American and Filipino troops in the field , largely restricted to central Luzon and the area around Manila . However , within one year it became clear the United States was likely to win most conventional engagements so , rather than surrender , Philippine revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo chose to engage in what Silbey argues was a " third " war . This was a guerrilla conflict ( combined with a series of pacification campaigns ) between U.S. and Filipino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1899 through 1902 . Silbey 's thesis that there were " three conflicts " in the Philippines provides an excellent way to conceptualize and analyze the conflict ( p. xv ) . It is also a great way to teach it and is just the sort of compact narrative that historians need to distill for lectures and for reading lists . <p> A War of Frontier and Empire is structured both chronologically and thematically . The first two chapters examine the precursor ideas and actions of the conflict : the election of William McKinley to the presidency in 1896 and the rise of American imperialism . The main theater of the Spanish-American war was the Caribbean , of course , but once Commodore George Dewey maneuvered his American Asiatic Squadron out from harbor in China , the importance of Pacific naval operations greatly increased . Under Dewey 's command the inexperienced fleet shocked the world by defeating the seasoned Spanish armada at Manila Bay in only six hours , sinking seven ships without losing a single American sailor . President McKinley was stunned and yet not certain if the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Luzon , let alone the whole archipelago . Meanwhile , Aguinaldo 's revolutionary Filipino Army of Liberation consolidated their gains and conquered most of the island chain , forming an independent revolutionary government . As American troops disembarked their transport ships , Filipino revolutionary forces were about to capture Manila from the Spanish . The war against Spain ended quickly yet at the city 's perimeter a dangerous standoff ensued between Americans and Filipinos . This situation dragged on for months until , on February 4 , 1899 , a minor nighttime skirmish spiraled out of control and " both side 's forces were engaged in a chaotic fight in the darkness " ( pp. 64-65 ) . Thus began a second conventional war in which it quickly became clear that the Filipino insurrectos , having defeated the Spanish without virtually any help , were no match for U.S. troops . <p> In Silbey 's account , Aguinaldo comes off as increasingly weakened and naturally vacillating . Yet Silbey finds that he was perspicacious enough to see that for the revolution to continue it would require a major tactical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1899 , the conventional war was nearly over . Hotly pursued , Aguinaldo headed toward the mountains of Bayombong and made a heart-wrenching decision to " go guerilla " in December 1899 . According to Silbey , the insurrectos " managed to reconstruct themselves organizationally and turn to an unconventional form of warfare that relied on ambush , concealment , and the avoidance of conventional set-piece battles " ( p. 143 ) . This new strategy prolonged the hostilities throughout 1900 and forced American troops , under the command of General Arthur MacArthur ( Douglas 's father ) , to fight a grim kind of jungle warfare in which enemies , neutrals , and allies were difficult to distinguish . Aguinaldo hoped that the sustained war would become unpopular enough to help elect William Jennings Bryan , and his an anti-imperialist bloc , which pledged to end the conflict . The resounding reelection of McKinley in November 1900 pushed Aguinaldo to despair and deeper into hiding . Within four months he was captured in a bold commando assault . While the fighting dragged on into 1902 , " in combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a disastrous capstone " to the revolution ( p. 178 ) . <p> In his gripping narrative , Silbey shows the important role that race played in American descriptions of the war , particularly the depictions of the revolutionaries . He also highlights the struggles of African American soldiers as they grappled with the racism of their comrades . " The difficulties were profound for African-American soldiers ; their duty was to fight against an enemy with whom they had some sympathy , and live among a people becoming victims of the same ' diabolical race hatred ' that African-Americans experienced at home " ( p. 111 ) . These racial realities were so potent that Filipino propaganda stressed the hypocrisy of the U.S. Army and urged its " darker " troops to switch sides , with little success . <p> Silbey concludes his book with a powerful argument that the war was pivotal for all the nations involved . It signaled the demise of the Spanish empire , " long past its days of glory " ( p. 218 ) . The conflict marked the " final war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their continent and represented " the first war of a global ethos " that would propel them across oceans ( p. 218 ) . For the Filipinos , the defeat " looked , in later decades , a lot like victory " because the three wars united the vast , disparate archipelago ( p. 218 ) . The islands " became , largely because of the shared experience of revolution , war , and insurgency , a self-conceived nation " ( p. 218 ) . In the end , Dewey 's naval victory and the haphazard events of war led to an American intervention that lasted almost half a century . The United States did not grant the Philippines their independence until 1946 . <p> What A War of Frontier and Empire misses is common for any synthesis intended for a broad , non-specialist audience . There are a few conspicuous missed dates , such as the overthrow of Hawaii 's Queen Lili'oukalani ( which was in 1893 , not 1883 ) ( p. 17 ) , and the misspellings of several names and places : for example , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rendered as " Sargosan , " and Banaue becomes " Banane . " In addition , a few generals and others receive incorrect names , such as Gen. Henry Lawton , misnamed " William " ( p. 84 ) and Gen. Mariano Trias , called " Antonio " ( p. 131 ) . For a book surveying a complex topic requiring translation of Spanish , Tagalog , and other languages into English , these are not major problems. 1 <p> The book provides a good , succinct summary and a fast-moving narrative . However , though well intentioned and well executed , A War of Frontier and Empire has one notable historiographical drawback . It does not quite recover from what is best characterized as the " usual problem " of America-centric historiography on the war in the Philippines . Silbey , like most historians well versed in this subject , himself notes his concern with the problem of United States-centered , primarily English-language scholarship on the subject . Historians since the 1980s have done much to move beyond America-centric narratives of the conflict in the Philippines . Postcolonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become preferred models for such scholarship and have opened new and insightful vistas on this history . Yet this quandary remains stubbornly persistent in many studies of the larger encounter in the Philippines . Perhaps it is a problem without a clear solution because most of the local Philippines archives were destroyed during WWII . The remaining sources , chiefly those from the turn of the century and the period of American rule , are bureaucratic English-language documents , most of which are located in the National Archives ( Washington , D.C. ) . Nevertheless , excellent new histories , such as Brian Linn 's The Philippine War , 1899-1902 ( 2002 ) and Paul Kramer 's Blood of Empire ( 2006 ) , have begun to rectify this problem . These and other recent histories shed new light on the relationships and intersections of race , empire , nations , and peoples at war and in peace in the Philippines . With so much on-going work in this vibrant field and on a transnational model , it is likely that the next wave of scholarship will continue to chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is impossible to read the current spate of scholarship on the Philippines and American empire without reference to the present . U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has again furnished a contemporary prism through which to view the complicated history of American expansionism and the challenges of the Philippine-American conflict . Silbey 's A War of Frontier and Empire does not directly address these concerns but they are very much evident in his absorbing account . Reflecting on the history of America 's " three wars " in the Philippines emphasizes the urgency of an enduring question : what is America 's proper role in the world ? <p> Notes <p> 1 .

@@40786713 @786713/ <p> Reviewed by James Bogen ( Pitzer College ) Published on H-World ( June , 1995 ) <p> This fascinating book is far too rich for adequate review in a discussion of this length . I 'll gesture at some of its leading ideas and ask a few questions in hopes of tempting you to read it . <p> By " truth " Shapin means claims which are accepted . Since different groups accept different claims at different times , truth , so conceived , is various and changeable . By " social history of truth " Shapin means a history of micro-social factors which influence the generation and acceptance of claims by the groups ( during times ) chosen for study . Shapin 's primary focus is on scientific claims developed by Robert Boyle and other 17th century members and correspondents of the Royal Society . <p> He orients his study in opposition to some received views about science and scientific discourse . One is epistemological individualism--the official position of the British empiricists--according to which the " legitimate springs of empirical knowledge " are located , not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual 's sensory confrontation with the world " ( 202 ) . On this view , the ideal scientist bases his evaluations of empirical claims as much as possible on his own observations and reasonings , instead of depending on the testimony and theorizing of others . Shapin argues , to the contrary , that scientists rely so heavily on the testimony of others whom they trust that we can not understand the production of scientific truth unless we understand how trust is established and maintained , weakened and lost . <p> Shapin also opposes the idea that scientific discourse is radically different from what Luhman , Oakeshott , and Rorty call " conversation " . The aim of " conversation " is to perpetuate itself along with the social practices and institutions which support and are furthered by it . By contrast , says the received view , science is dedicated to the discovery of facts , rigorous refutations of false claims about facts , and rigorous demonstrations of true claims . Thus scientific discourse is marked by skeptical examinations and harsh criticisms which would be non-conducive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the contrary , that even if this contrast between conversation and scientific discourse is " ... a significant actor 's distinction ... , " the historian or sociologist can " ... illuminate the nature of scientific practice ... " analyzing it on the model of conversation ( 352 ) . Social and political communities can not thrive , and their members can not fruitfully pursue their goals without mutual trust and the sociability and cooperation it fosters ( 10-13 ) and Shapin argues that the same holds for " communities " of working scientists . The conventions of non-scientific , genteel conversation provided ways to avoid ( or where they could not be avoided , to manage ) disputes which could otherwise weaken the trust and sociability required for community life . His leading idea is that conversational conventions deriving from those of genteel discourse were incorporated into and performed the same function in the scientific discourse of the Royal Society . <p> In a fascinating and authoritative survey of material from 17th century " courtesy literature " on what it is to be , to act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from Bacon , Locke , and other scientifically minded philosophers of the period , from the scientific correspondence of the Royal Society , and from the life and writings of Robert Boyle , Shapin extracts seven maxims ( 212ff ) which the prudent l7th century gentleman should use to assess the credibility of empirical claims . So evaluated , the acceptability of a claim would depend to a great extent , upon how closely the person who made it conformed to the picture of a gentleman set out in the courtesy literature and related ethical and political writings . And it would also depend upon whether the claim was made in a way which met the requirements of genteel conversation . <p> Shapin 's development of his thesis features a number of meticulously described and engrossing case studies . In one , Boyle resolved an apparent incompatibility between travelers ' descriptions of icebergs and received hydrostatical principles by devising a story which allowed both to be accepted without contradiction . Shapin thinks an important reason for resolving the dispute this way instead of by rejecting the travelers ' accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 247-258 ) : " Factual testimony from gentleman-philosophers ... was almost never gainsaid in the public forums of seventeenth-century English science " ( 124 ) . <p> In a second case , the testimony of some deep sea divers who claimed not to have felt crushing pressure underwater conflicted with the principle that parcels of a body of water should press upon one another no matter where the body they belong to is located . Shapin claims that instead of trying to reconcile principle with testimony as in the first case , Boyle and others rejected the divers ' testimony because , unlike the travelers who described the icebergs , the divers were too ungentle to merit trust ( 258-266 ) . <p> Shapin uses a third case study--the Royal Society 's handling of a controversy between the astronomers , Hevelius and Auzout , over the position and trajectory of a comet observed in the mid 1660s--to argue for the similarity between scientific discourse and conversation . Neither disputant met all of the conditions for gentility . But they belonged to and had powerful friends in the Royal Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain its access to the data Hevelius and Auzout could provide , the Royal Society had a strong interest in managing the dispute so as to minimize enmity among their partisans , and to preserve their reputations as trustworthy observers . Shapin thinks the explanation of complicated social and theoretical maneuvers ( including the treatment of a proposal that the most troublesome of the observations were sightings of different comets ) by which the controversy was diffused ( 266-291 ) lies in the relocation to the scientific setting of conversational practices historically " .... adapted to protect the reliability of testimony and the integrity of the moral order ... in gentlemanly society ... " ( 125 ) . Here and elsewhere the task of preserving scientific conversation itself not only took precedence over " ... the attainment of more , more exact , or more powerful truth " but shaped the conversationalists ' standards for factually acceptable empirical claims ( 309 ) . <p> Shapin 's book makes it hard to doubt that a sociological account of trust can be of great value to philosophers , and historians , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important fact--well illustrated by Shapin 's case studies--that isolated individuals typically can not find , establish , or promulgate answers to important scientific questions and that the development of scientific knowledge is the work of groups of people . ( On pain of trivializing Shapin 's project , we must avoid confusing this version of the claim that scientific knowledge is a group product with the wholly uninteresting version which can be established on the cheap just by thinking of truths as claims which groups accept and appealing to the banality that it takes the work of groups of people to get claims accepted by groups of people . ) But although the sociology of trust can be quite important to the study of science , it 's worth asking whether Shapin has n't overemphasized the importance of " connections between the identity of individuals ... and the credibility of what they claim " ( 126 ) and the influence of trust in people on assessments of the reliability of their empirical claims . Here are some questions about this . <p> First , Shapin 's theme leads him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in techniques for their employment can be to assessments of the reliability of claims they are used to establish . Consider the discredited divers . Shapin observes that the results of experiments in which bottles were lowered into the sea ( e.g. , implosions of glass bottles at 40 fathoms ) counted more heavily for the claim that water presses upon itself than the testimony of the divers who said they felt no pressure counted against it ( 264 ) . Was the non-gentility of the divers an important reason for this ? Quite apart from any questions concerning the reliability of the divers or the truth of their testimony , it 's plausible that scientists believed that what happens to submerged bottles was a clearer and more reliable indication of whether water pressed in upon itself than the experiences ( no matter how accurately reported ) of submerged people . Why in general should confidence in empirical claims derived from the employment of reliable instruments , experimental designs , etc. have to be explained mainly in terms of the " identities of individuals " ? ( For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galison , *How Experiments End* , and Alan Franklin , *Neglect of Experiment* , and *Experiment , Right or Wrong* . ) <p> Secondly , it 's conceivable that people relied upon some of the empirical reports Shapin considers because of external constraints which encouraged truth telling and discouraged speaking falsely rather than because of the character of the reporter . The constraints built into to the work situations of Shapin 's non-genteel " invisible technicians " are an example ( Ch . Eight ) . Other reports might have been relied upon not so much because of the identities or situations of the reporters as because of perceptual and cognitive psychological factors which made mistakes unlikely . Thus Boyle 's assistants describe some things which cognitively and perceptually normal human beings typically do n't get wrong ( 385 ) . Here it 's worth considering Annette Baier 's discussion of reasons other than trust for relying on others ( see : " Trust and Anti- trust " in Baier , *Moral Prejudices* ) . <p> Thirdly , Shapin documents the importance of the plausibility of what is reported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obvious connections between plausibility and trustworthiness ; someone who wishes to establish a reputation for genteel trustworthiness is well advised to try to avoid making implausible claims . More interestingly , there is a matter of weighting . A prima facie implausible claim delivered in a manner which " ... inspires a just confidence " by someone with the genteel virtues of " integrity and disinterestedness " ( 212 ) will get a better hearing than the same claim delivered in a boastful , wonder-mongering , pedantic , or otherwise indecorous manner ( 221 ) or if it came from the mouth of someone whose personal vices , interest in a particular outcome , or susceptibility to the influence of others argue against his veracity ( 223 ff . ) . <p> But plausibility has to do with the likelihood of what is reported , and likelihood can depend upon biological or physical probabilities ; it 's implausible , e.g. , that an out of shape sixty year old should high jump over 7 feet , or that Santa Monica Bay should freeze over . It can depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British two year old should master ancient Greek , or that a woman should be elected president of the Royal Society during the 17th Century . And so on . This makes it natural to ask to what extent assessments of plausibility are influenced by facts of nature and other factors Shapin tends to downplay . Consider the astronomical controversy . What caused trouble was not Hevelius 's observations , but the implausibility of a comet 's trajectory which he calculated from them . This implausibility derived from later observations which--if they were observations of the same comet--would require Hevelius 's trajectory to continue in a physically improbable way . In light of this , the suggestion that the comet observed later on was not the same one Hevelius saw seems plausible for reasons which do n't sound particularly sociological . The Royal Society 's concern for its continuing relations with Hevelius and Auzout must have influenced its treatment of the dispute . But was this as important a factor as the astronomical and mathematical considerations which friends of the received view of science would emphasize ? <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century scientific practice . But a tantalizing epilogue suggests how the morals of this book might apply to current scientific practice . Shapin speculates that even if present day " outsiders " treat scientists with ungenteel skepticism of the kind which Merton thought was essential to scientific practice , small " communities " of scientists might nevertheless behave in something like the manner of the manner of the Royal Society ( 409-417 ) . This is a fascinating idea . Its implementation would require an account of what sort of social unit a " community " is , and an investigation of the epistemic significance of interactions between scientists working on common problems in competing laboratories or research groups as well as scientists working together in the same groups . I hope Shapin will write something about this . But whether or not he does his Social History of Truth is one of the finest of science studies books , and a model of how intellectual history should be done . 
@@40786715 @786715/ <p> J. H. Elliott sets himself a daunting task in Empires of the Atlantic World : Britain and Spain in America , 1492-1830 . Comparing two empires , focusing on the individual , local , regional , and transatlantic contexts of European expansion , he aims to counter the " black legend " of Spanish imperialism . Elliott does not deny that the Spanish process of conquest could be , and often was , brutal . He argues , however , that the viciousness and chaos of initial contact were followed by something other than centuries of inept imperial management . According to Elliott , the Spanish empire in the Americas constituted a highly complex society governed by a generally effective colonial system . It was that very complexity and stability , he attempts to demonstrate , that made the Latin American wars of independence so destructive . In this , and in many other ways , the history of Spanish America differed from the history of British America ; but that does not mean that the British were better empire builders . In comparison to Spain , Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England , Virginia , and the Middle Colonies . That Elliott goes far towards making this case , while providing a detailed survey of the rise and fall of two European powers in the Americas , is a testament to the magnitude of his achievement . <p> Empires of the Atlantic World is divided into three parts , each focusing on a discrete phase of the settler experience in the Americas : occupation , consolidation , and emancipation . In the first **25;317;TOOLONG begins by outlining the mindset and motivation of two archetypal adventurers , the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes and the English captain Christopher Newport . In Elliott 's reading , these two men possessed a similar mentality of conquest and both were motivated by the same zeal for wealth . Indeed , tales of Spanish success in the New World did much to whet the collective appetite of the founders of Jamestown , though , of course , their hopes of finding their own Aztec empire to overthrow and pillage were doomed to disappointment . Still , Elliott 's main point is clear enough : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas were similar . Such differences as did exist between them--and Elliott is careful to point these out--had more to do with the varying contexts of Spanish and British settlement than with any hard-and-fast distinction between empires of conquest and commerce . This is an argument that Elliott drives home in his discussion of the impact of Spanish and British settlement on the geography , indigenous people , and resources of the Americas . <p> In part 2 , Elliott deals with the consolidation of the European presence in North and South America . He concentrates on those political , social , and religious factors that tended to pull the two colonial societies apart , including the " relatively slow and haphazard British moves towards the imposition of empire " and Spain 's incorporation of its overseas territories " within an effective imperial framework " ( p. 119 ) . That " effective imperial framework " consisted of a byzantine bureaucracy and a culture of loyalty that permitted political dissent as long as it did not aim to topple the imperial regime itself . There was nothing quite like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's higgledy-piggledy approach to colonial government . Instead , the British settlers were compelled to make their own way in the New World , developing , for instance , a legal system that was based on the English customs of the time , but that was also adapted to their own unique circumstances . This pattern of Spanish hierarchy and British " liberty " was repeated in the overall development of the two empires ; but , Elliott concludes , the final result of this process of imperial consolidation was the same for the British and Spanish colonists : they became increasingly " American " in their outlook . By effectively analyzing both the similarities and differences between Spanish and British America , Elliott , once again , avoids any reductionist explanation of colonial development . This delicate balancing act allows him to draw attention to the striking similarities between Protestantism and Tridentine Catholicism , made manifest in the Salem witch trials of 1692 and the mass hysteria that gripped the Spanish American city of Queretaro in 1691 . At the same time , Elliott convincingly pinpoints the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : British America was marked by a diversity of sects and Spanish America by religious uniformity . Each culture had its weaknesses : the former tended towards instability and the latter towards rigidity . Those same weaknesses , Elliott demonstrates , were evident in the social and political structures of the British and Spanish colonies . <p> The final part of Empires of the Atlantic World concentrates on the breakdown of British and Spanish imperial authority in the Americas . Elliott 's contention that the colonies were shaped by " a host of personal choices and the unpredictable consequences of unforeseen events " ( p. 411 ) comes most clearly into play in this section . He provides insightful character sketches of key players , including George Washington and Simon Bolivar , explaining how their different personalities and circumstances affected the outcome of the revolutionary struggles in North and South America . Revolutions being notoriously complex , Elliott goes further , outlining those structural factors--economic , political , and cultural--that contributed to the course of British American and Latin American emancipation . Particular noteworthy , however , is Elliott 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empires turned out so differently . Comparing the American and Latin American revolutions , Elliott finds the answer in the way that the Latin American wars of independence were fought and , equally important , in the relative staying power of the Spanish imperial system . Unlike the American revolutionaries , the Latin American liberators had to contend with a series of highly stratified settler societies that were prone to civil war ; and the civil wars that were part of the Latin American struggle for independence were far more economically disruptive than the conflict between loyalists and patriots in the Thirteen Colonies . Things only went from bad to worse once independence was achieved : the Latin American liberators attempted to recreate the centralized structures of government that they had just overthrown . It was a tactic , Elliott notes , that made sense politically and psychologically , but that was not well calculated to meet the economic needs of the time . In contrast , the revolutionary struggle of the new United States of America left it prepared to " make its way , with growing confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. 402 ) . <p> There is much to praise in Empires of the Atlantic World . It serves as a model of how Atlantic history should be done . Drawing on a vast array of secondary material , Elliott more than meets the goal he sets for himself in the introduction : a comparative study of British and Spanish settlement that deals , in equal measure , with similarities and differences and that provides explanations and analysis calculated to do justice to both . And , though concentrating on the British and Spanish settler societies in North and South America , Elliott also effectively integrates Native American groups into his narrative . As he points out , the " tribal traditions and culture " of the indigenous people " were as important in determining the outcome of any confrontation as were the varieties of approach adopted by the Europeans themselves " ( p. 63 ) . In the end , Elliott 's account bears out Richard White 's argument in The Middle Ground that , when it came to negotiating Native-newcomer relations , the British were less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sheer force of circumstance , Elliott demonstrates , the Spanish were compelled to find a way to incorporate relatively large numbers of Native Americans into " an organic and hierarchically organized society ; " for the British , in contrast , " there was no middle way between anglicization and exclusion " ( p. 85 ) . <p> However , for all his skill in comparing and contrasting the empires of the Atlantic world , at certain points Elliott seems to be too intent by half on dispelling the " black legend " of Spanish imperialism . In his discussion of the settler impact on American space , for instance , he provides valuable insights into the geographic transformations wrought by the introduction of European ideas of property and urban settlement , but he does not touch on the environment consequences of contact in any sustained way .

In the age of revolution , Elliott states , Canada was invaded , became a Loyalist refuge and , finally , along with the British West Indies , served as a sort of consolation prize for the disappointed empire builders of Britain . All of this , of course , is entirely accurate , as far as it goes ; but it may be fair to suggest that it does not go far enough , despite the book 's already broad scope . As J. G. A.

Enlivened by Elliott 's elegant prose , it provides a consistently thought-provoking account of the colonial efforts of Spain and Britain in North and South America .

@@40786716 @786716/ <p> In 1919 , Carter G. Woodson critically reviewed U. B. Phillips 's American Negro Slavery and found it severely lacking in its recognition of African American historical subjectivity . " In just the same way as a writer of the history of New England in describing the fisheries of that section would have little to say about the species figuring conspicuously in that industry , " charged Woodson , " so has the author treated the negro in his work . " 1 The historiography on slavery and the slave trade in 2007 is worlds away from Phillips 's early twentieth-century study . Yet the heavily quantitative and European-centered nature of the evidence on the transatlantic slave trade still poses difficulties for historians who desire to write , as Joseph Miller phrased it , " in warmer tones , " not only of aggregate numbers , but of the impact of the market on human lives. 2 Stephanie Smallwood 's visionary Saltwater Slavery rethinks the route from Africa to the Americas from the perspective of forced African migrants . In terms of both argument and methodology , Smallwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic World and the transatlantic slave trade . <p> Focused on the British slave trade from the Gold Coast between 1675 and 1725 , Saltwater Slavery offers a broadly relevant exploration of the processes of commodification and forced migration . Drawing on both the business records and the voluminous correspondence of the Royal African Company ( RAC ) , the book 's seven chapters follow the trajectory from West African captivity across the Atlantic to the expanding plantation complex of the Americas . Fully engaged with West African , British , Caribbean , and North American historical scholarship , Smallwood illuminates the market forces that bound the African coastal dungeons of El Mina to London shipyards and Jamaican slave markets . At the same time , she exposes the Atlantic World as a European construction of time and space , given definition by maps , financial networks , and sailing ships . At the heart of this book lies the argument that for most African captives , the Atlantic World was not a coherent geographic entity , but a space of saltwater terror . The Atlantic passage , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " experience of motion without discernible direction or destination " ( p. 122 ) . <p> Saltwater Slavery is first and foremost a profound meditation on the historical process of commodification in early modern Atlantic markets . Although this point is oddly downplayed in the book 's introduction , Smallwood has elsewhere described herself as writing the " cultural history of economic systems . " 3 As such , the book joins other notable studies , such as Walter Johnson 's Soul by Soul ( 1999 ) that transcend conventional boundaries between economic , social , and cultural history . Compared to existing seventeenth-century systems of African servitude , Smallwood argues , the Atlantic slave trade institutionalized the distinctly alienating process of transforming persons into commodities . Chapters 1 through 4 detail the process of commodification . Building on Orlando Patterson 's notion of " social death " ( Slavery and Social Death , 1982 ) , Smallwood reads between the lines of RAC ledgers to show how West African slave factories massed individual captives into the " full complements " that slave traders were required to accumulate before embarking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escapes , uprisings , and other acts of resistance , the forces of the Atlantic market permeated the West African littoral , inexorably moving captive Africans into European hands . In coastal incarceration points as well as the holds of slave ships , Smallwood contends , slave merchants turned captives into commodities by determining the outer limits of suffering that captive Africans could endure without endangering the profits of their captors . Here , Smallwood 's innovative readings search the familiar ground of death and suffering to find new insight into the embodied meanings of enslavement . For example , rather than count the total captives taken on board the Edgar in 1681 , Smallwood imagines the voyage from the perspective of the growing number of men and women who languished in the ship 's hold over the course of two months , as the Edgar sailed between West African ports attempting to fill its hold . Similarly , Smallwood reads Peter Blake 's narrative of the 1675 voyage of the James not for aggregate mortality statistics but instead to illuminate the meanings Akan-speaking captives might have placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper funerary ritual . <p> Having traced the rupture of West African identities and social relationships past the " point of no return , " chapters 4 through 7 turn to the question of reconstituting African identity in the Americas , where the forces of the Atlantic market were no less overwhelming . Smallwood complicates the recent debates between " creolists " who posit a synthesis of African cultures in the Americas and " slave route " advocates who argue for specific African ethnic continuities. 4 Rather than discussing specific African survivals , Smallwood first explores in detail the " multivalent " identities of Akan-speaking people and then suggests that such a complex understanding of identity challenges " the erroneous assumption that shared culture traits automatically constitute community " ( pp. 115 , 119 ) . Referencing Sidney Mintz and Richard Price 's 1976 Birth of African American Culture , Smallwood insists that men , women , and children chained in the holds of ships constituted neither " groups " nor " crowds . " Rather , she argues , they were " a mutilated assemblage " of alienated persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " the antithesis of community " ( pp. 121 , 101 ) . Smallwood 's final chapter on " life and death in the Diaspora " disrupts historians ' sometimes over-eager search for community among traumatized persons . At the same time , Smallwood calls attention to the enormous energy required by Africans who managed to reverse even partially the relentless current of commodification by reestablishing new social relations under American slavery . Compared to voluntary immigrants ' social networks that served to connect past and present , Smallwood argues , enslaved African communities in the Americas faced the " serial repetition of one-way departures " in which the " voices of saltwater slaves , could not reverberate back to Africa " ( p. 201 ) . <p> Bringing " the people aboard slave ships to life as subjects in American social history " ( p. 3 ) is no easy feat given the nature of Smallwood 's evidence . At times , Smallwood provides original interpretations of familiar evidence , such as ex-slave Charles Ball 's account of an African-born father who placed a canoe and paddle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back across the sea to Africa . Instead of the familiar interpretation that this evidence shows the survival of African cosmology , Smallwood uses the anecdote to deepen her argument of the impact of the " saltwater " passage that required enslaved Africans to innovate ritual " to meet the particular needs of slave life in the Atlantic system " ( p. 190 ) . At other times , Smallwood relies heavily on secondary literature about Akan kinship , culture , and politics to piece together the way captive Africans may have strained to understand the long Atlantic voyage . The richness of Smallwood 's discussions of Gold Coast cultures and societies contrasts starkly with the absence of direct evidence from captive Africans and emphasizes the void of meaning that transatlantic enslavement created . Occasional arguments call for further evidence and elaboration . Two such examples arise in chapter 7 in the brief discussion of the importance of women in reconstituting social relations and the many references to the disruptive potential of " new Africans " arriving in tentatively established slave communities . For the most part , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources and Smallwood 's bold readings illustrate both the risks and promise of reading traditional sources against their grain . <p> Situating issues of diasporic identity within the political economy of the slave trade , Smallwood provides a new look at the history of forced migration whose legacies have yet to be fully confronted . With its unflinching analysis of the violence of slave markets , Saltwater Slavery contributes to a larger shift in the interpretation of slavery towards an emphasis on trauma and loss . From Nell Painter 's landmark essay , " Soul Murder , " to Saidiya Hartman 's recent travel memoir Lose Your Mother ( 2006 ) , scholarship calling for a " fully loaded cost accounting " of slavery has countered the earlier weight placed on resistance , autonomy , and community strength. 5 Despite her recovery of numerous acts of African resistance and resilience , Smallwood nevertheless asks readers to confront the irreparable violence of early Atlantic capitalism . Furthermore , like Jennifer Morgan 's Laboring Women ( 2004 ) , Saltwater Slavery explores the question of African subjectivity in the early centuries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices from enslaved Africans . Though some of the questions Smallwood raises may not ever be answered , the eloquent and sophisticated framing of her inquiry sets the terms of discussion for future studies of transatlantic slavery . <p> 4 .

By looking at the 1950s and 1960s , Ryan- M.- Irwin's- Gordian Knot- considers an earlier era in the struggle against apartheid . andHe explores how the domestic policy of the Republic of South Africa was fought internationally by newly independent African nations ( in solidarity with the ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress ) , particularly through the supra-national institutions of the post-war era : the United Nations ( UN ) and the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) . <p> Irwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the African gGroup ) invested heavily in the idea of Pan-Africanism .

While India and other decolonizsed countries tried to foster collaborative action between the African Group and the Western nations on the issue of apartheid , Irwin shows , that this proposed collaborative action relied heavily upon the political will of the United States to intervene . <p> At the heart of Irwin 's account is the U.S.- government's- struggle within the United States government over what course to take regarding South Africa , the United Nations's- involvement , and the- African- Group 's public denunciation of apartheid being made by the African Group . By examining the internal files of the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that while the Departments of Defense- and the Treasury saw South Africa as a crucial anti-communist ally and an important trading partner respectively , the State Department saw the apartheid state as a barrier to closer relationships between the United States and the newly decoloniszed Africa .

Mennen " Soapy " Williams , the Aassistant Ssecretary of Sstate for African Affairs , who encouraged the Johnson administration to take a more confrontational stance with toward- the Republic of South Africa and develop closer ties with the African nations inside the United Nations .

The African nations used South Africa 's occupation of South-West Africa ( now Namibia ) , unresolved- from the days of the League of Nations , to challenge South Africa 's authority in the Ssouthern African region. - South Africa 's implementation of apartheid in South-West Africa was also challenged by the African Group- as a fundamental violation of human rights. - Irwin does well to outlines the build-up to the showdown between South Africa and the African Group at the ICJ in 1966 and shows how that- the decision , which came as a surprise to many , defused the situation at the- international geo-political level for the next decade and a half .

The experience of the African nations in their actions against South Africa through the UN and the ICJ highlighted the fallibility of trying to fight apartheid through purely legal and diplomatic means , - demonstrating- to South Africa 's opponents that more revolutionary strategies needed to be- adopted to fight the apartheid state . While Irwin does discuss this shift briefly- in the conclusion- of- Gordian Knot- briefly , it would have been more compelling to see a greater explanation of- the change from the supra-national stage to the grassroots level in a stand-alone chapter . <p> The only other reservation that this reviewer I- can make- is that its the- book's- focus on the United States sometimes means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to Western capitalism presented by the Soviet Bloc in the 1950s and 1960s .

G. Ogbar writes as one who struggles to love hip-hop while moving it forward through critique . The chapters are thematically organized by prominent debates surrounding rap music , which he uses to unpack the discourse of race , to a lesser extent gender , notions of " realness , " and the terms of authenticity . His work focuses on the expanse of these debates rather than their depth , leaving several critical holes but aptly illustrating the constricted nature of blackness in the play of authenticity . <p> Ogbar begins his work by aligning hip-hop with other forms of racialized cultural production in the United States , demonstrating their inextricable link to earlier representations of black pathology . Chapter 1 opens with a look at popular representations of minstrelsy in the late nineteenth and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinema . These twinned figures fundamentally shape hip-hop , combining to become " the real nigga " --the most commercially and financially viable rap figure for white and non-white audiences alike . Ogbar makes the connection to commercialization , but goes no further than to say , " The cause of this historical myopia stems chiefly from the marketing of hip-hop " ( p. 41 ) . <p> The next two chapters are about race and gender respectively . Ogbar argues that the public use ( or absence ) of " nigga " by non-black MCs in their rhymes is for the first time chiefly on black people 's terms , even without their unwavering consensus . This use marks the confluence of black agency and the commercialization of black pathology in performances of rebel authenticity in hip-hop . Ogbar discusses Latino , Asian American , and white MCs but misses multiple opportunities to flesh out the first two in what reads like a rush to whiteness . For example , he hastily concludes that blacks and Latinos share an essential comraderie made evident by black audience 's acceptance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This argument illustrates the glaring absence of Raquel Rivera 's New York Ricans in the Hip Hop Zone ( 2003 ) , a work that delves into the often strained relationship between African Americans and Puerto Ricans . And while few works on rap acknowledge Asian American MCs , Ogbar again abbreviates the analysis , leaving me to wonder how Asian artists represent themselves within the confines of narrow configurations of hip-hop authenticity despite their lack of mainstream popularity . Thus the bulk of the chapter is dedicated to white MCs ' negotiations of black stereotypes . He argues that they traverse a terrain circumscribed by narrow ideas of blackness to which their access is always limited , probationary , and undergirded by hostile responses for " intolerable infractions , " such as in Eminem 's reference to blacks as " niggas " in his early " lost tapes " ( p. 66 ) . <p> Ogbar successfully expands the discourse of good and bad images of women in hip-hop by focusing on female MCs whose public personas and rhymes tout neither extreme of " soft femininity or being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a diverse community of women performers and more spaces for work as actors and models as a result ( p. 98 ) . But when coupled with the reality of video models who are in the forefront of rap 's marketability , women rappers have a force stronger than their collectivity to contend with . His troubling over-simplification fails to acknowledge the precariousness of video modeling and the unlikelihood of it leading to bigger and better things for more than a lucky few . <p> Chapter 4 , " Rebels with a Cause : Gangstas , Militants , Media , and the Contest for Hip-Hop , " is about the moral panic over rap music , what he calls the culture wars , and the hypocrisies they highlight . Particular attention is given to accusations of rap 's indecency and its correlation to the downfall of today 's youth .

The thrust of " Locked Up : Police , the Prison Industrial Complex , Black Youth , and Social Control " challenges criticisms of cop-killer storylines versus the utter silence about those on black-on-black violence . " Following nationally coordinated protests to court cases and pressure from music label , the violent thrust of hardcore rappers shifted focus from killing the police to killing other black people . Moreover , as violent narratives about killing black people expanded , rap songs explored the prison complex , but largely as a code of honor or a thug rite of passage " ( p. 156 ) .

The importance of Hip-Hop Revolution is exemplified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope of these larger debates and the limitation of black stereotypes . <p> At the same time , the work falls short at the convergence of experience and representation . Ogbar walks a thin line between lyrics as truth and as artistic play . So much weight is put on what rappers say that little analysis is directed toward the music 's production in its totality . While hip-hop plays in the realm of verisimilitude in public performances , gangster rappers more than most artists are forced to be their work . But knowing that these demands come from the market and from within hip-hop should complicate his analysis and challenge the status quo because such lyrics indicate a great deal of room for play . For example , Ogbar highlights what he sees as the ironic contradiction of college-educated MCs who grew up middle class and now live fairly stable home lives with wives and children of their own despite self-representations as the most dangerous thugs . But it is only ironic and contradictory if we give credence to the demand that they can not be that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of lyrical analysis . <p> There is a growing body of hip-hop scholarship that purposefully moves away from lyrical analysis , focusing methodologically on field work , archival research , and critical cultural analyses , including Joe Schloss 's Making Beats ( 2004 ) , Jeff Chang 's Ca n't Stop , Wo n't Stop ( 2005 ) , James Spady 's The Global Cipha ( 2006 ) , and Halifu Osumare 's The Africanist Aesthetic in Global Hip-Hop ( 2008 ) . Ogbar dabbles in but does not fully execute any of these methods . While not always adding something new Ogbar manages to simplify ( sometimes overly so ) hip-hop 's most salient debates and locates how authenticity and realness become determining forces . Although several points demand much greater attention , this book is a primer for those wanting to delineate these themes , making it a solid resource for undergraduate classes .

Entenmann ( Department of History , St. Olaf College ) Published on H-Asia ( October , 1998 ) <p> The Rape of Nanking <p> In December , 1937 , the Chinese army abandoned Nanking ( Nanjing ) , the Nationalist capital , and the Japanese army occupied the city without a fight . The notorious " Rape of Nanking " that immediately ensued began as a wholesale murder of Chinese prisoners of war and civilian men on pretext that they were fleeing soldiers who had discarded their uniforms . As the discipline of Japanese troops collapsed they began indiscriminately killing civilians . Estimates of the number of victims range widely . In the middle range are the numbers presented at the Tokyo War Crimes Trials : 42,000 killed in city and over 100,000 in the surrounding area over six weeks . The local war crimes trials held in Nanking immediately after the war estimated that 190,000 were killed . Iris Chang accepts the highest plausible estimate of 300,000 dead . The incident was also a rape in a literal sense . According to evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raped at least 20,000 Chinese women , many of whom were murdered afterwards . The massacre began with prisoners or suspected soldiers , then extended to those unambiguously civilian , including women , children , and old men . <p> Iris Chang asks why this atrocity is so little remembered . The Western historical memory of World War II , of course , focuses on the struggle against Nazi Germany and generally pays little attention to the war in Asia before Pearl Harbor . But that does not fully explain the relative obscurity of the Rape of Nanking . <p> I can refer to my own modest contribution to the literature here . When I was a graduate student about eighteen years ago I was commissioned to write a few short articles relating to China for the Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan ( 9 vols. , Tokyo : Kodansha , 1983 ) . One of my contributions was on the " Nanjing Incident . " A member of the editorial staff with whom I worked , whose name I have forgotten , told me that as a comprehensive reference the encyclopedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its glories and accomplishments . My entry , however , was only 179 words long , following the guidelines I was given . Yet that is more than one can find in the Cambridge History of Japan , where in volume VI there are two one-sentence references. 1 The China Quagmire , one volume of the English translation of a Japanese study of the origins of the war in the Pacific , does not mention the incident at all. 2 <p> Iris Chang attributes this neglect to a politically-motivated conspiracy of silence and an alleged atmosphere of intimidation that prevents Japanese from facing their history . Research on this subject can be " life-threatening , " she claims , and " . . . the Japanese as a nation are still trying to bury the victims of Nanking - not under the soil , as in 1937 , but into historical oblivion " ( p. 220 ) . The present generation , she writes , " can continue to delude themselves that the war of Japanese aggression was a holy and just war that Japan happened to lose solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 224-25 ) . The flyleaf of the cloth-bound edition states that " the story of this atrocity . . . continues to be denied by the Japanese government , " although that assertion , which is false , does not appear anywhere in the paperbound version . <p> Chang seems unable to differentiate between some members of the ultranationalist fringe and other Japanese . A Japanese translation of the dairy of John Rabe , a German businessman who helped protect civilians in the Nanking Safety Zone , is a best-seller in Japan . Moreover , despite what Iris Chang maintains , current Japanese textbooks discuss the massacre , giving figures of between 150,000 to 300,000 killed . A 1994 opinion poll found that eighty percent of respondents in Japan believed that their government had not adequately compensated victimized peoples in countries Japan colonized or invaded . " This is hardly the response of a people suffering from acute historical amnesia , " as John Dower notes. 3 Chang generalizes from extremists who deny that the incident took place , fanatics motivated by ultranationalism and ethnic prejudice , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West . Moreover , although Chang explicitly rejects explanations of national character , her own ethnic prejudice implicitly pervades her book . Her explanations are , to a large extent , based on unexamined ethnic stereotypes . <p> Many in Japan would certainly prefer that the incident be forgotten , feeling that unpleasant and shameful things should not be talked about . But that is not the same as denying it occurred . In any case , many Japanese have dealt with the Nanking massacre , and have done so for many years . As early as 1940 Yanaihara Tadao , an economist and specialist in colonial policy , courageously criticized his fellow Japanese Christians for honoring General Matsui Iwame , commander of Japanese troops in Nanking. 4 Immediately after the war Maruyama Masao dealt with the incident in his attempt to understand Japan 's wartime behavior. 5 My first reading about the Nanking massacre was in Ienaga Saburo 's The Pacific War , originally published in Japanese thirty years ago . In recent years other Japanese , including Hora Tomio , Honda Katsuichi , and Tanaka Yuki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Japanese historical background Chang presents is clichd , simplistic , stereotyped , and often inaccurate . She writes that " . . . as far back as anyone could remember , the islands ' powerful feudal lords employed private armies to wage incessant battle with each other . . . " ( pp. 19-20 ) - a description appropriate to the Warring States period of the sixteenth century but not to any other period . She places the Tokugawa unification of Japan in the wrong century ( p. 21 ) . She asserts that the conditions of Japan 's unconditional surrender " exonerated all members of the imperial family . . . " ( p. 176 ) . Her use of sources is uncritical and credulous , treating hearsay as the equivalent of more reliable evidence . She engages in implausible speculations , for example about " Emperor Hirohito 's role in the Rape of Nanking " ( p. 177 ) . " We will probably never know exactly what news Hirohito received about Nanking as the massacre was happening , " she writes , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. 179 ) . Chang confuses Japanese leaders ' delight in the fall of the Chinese capital with exulting in the massacre that occurred afterward . <p> So why has this book become so widely acclaimed ? Probably because of her account of the massacre itself , a vivid and gut-wrenching narration . Moreover , she brings out of oblivion the neutral foreigners who established the Nanking Safety Zone to protect non-combatants , particularly the enigmatic Nazi party member John Rabe . Yet her description of the massacre itself , the strongest part of the book , is also open to criticism . The Japanese historian Hata Ikuhito makes some telling criticisms , although Hata himself minimizes the extent of the massacre. 6 He questions Chang 's estimate of the number of victims , a ghoulish exercise perhaps , but an important one . He argues that Chang 's figure of 300,000 is impossibly high , but his own figure of 40,000 killed , although similar to the estimates of some Western witnesses , is implausibly low . Hata claims that eleven photographs in Chang 's book are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he succeeds in demonstrating that with only two . One , a photograph of a row of severed heads , depicts bandits executed by Chinese police in 1930 rather than victims of the Nanking massacre . Another photo , which appeared in the November 10 , 1937 issue of Asahi Gurafu , is a propaganda picture of Chinese villagers returning from fields " under the protection of Japanese soldiers . " <p> Chang also does not adequately explain why the massacre occurred . Maruyama Masao suggested that because Japanese soldiers lived in brutal hierarchical social order , they developed a habit of submitting to power and authority from above and dominating the weak and powerless below . They assumed their superiority over other races , especially the Chinese . Japanese soldiers were regimented , confined , and harshly treated by their officers . When discipline broke down they lacked any sense of individual responsibility for their actions . Chang argues simply that the Japanese army did not have the means to feed such a large number of prisoners of war , and therefore killed them . This is plausible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapes and the murder of women and children . Perhaps part of the answer lies in the way enemies were dehumanized , one of the distinctive features of World War II . The Nazis described Jews as vermin . Japanese soldiers in Nanking , similarly , regarded their Chinese victims as animals , comparing killing of Chinese to slaughtering pigs . It was not only Japanese and Germans who dehumanized enemies that way : John Dower describes the American use of bestial imagery about the Japanese in World War II. 7 <p> World War II , of course , had broken all the rules of war . It was fought with a new technology that targeted civilians , creating what Omer Bartov calls industrial killing : " mechanized , rational , impersonal , and sustained mass destruction of human beings , organized and administered by states " . 8 Civilians were considered as legitimate military targets , and the notion of civilian immunity all but disappeared . Women and children became targets in warfare . <p> Yet the Rape of Nanking was not committed by impersonal or distant perpetrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to explain , even in the context of a war which routinely violated the norms of civilian immunity . To return to theme of rape and sexual violence , for example , why were Chinese women subjected to these outrages ? Rape was a weapon against " enemy " women , an action that was both misogynist and xenophobic . It humiliated the victims and demonstrated power , over both women who were the immediate victims and men who traditionally were regarded as their protectors. 9 The Japanese military encouraged a rape culture , and rape as well as murder was a means to avenge the 70,000 Japanese soldiers killed or wounded in first six months of the war in China . <p> Explanations for the behavior of Japanese soldiers should probably focus on their brutalization , in training as well as in warfare , and the military culture that encouraged them to see enemy human beings as animals .

@@40786726 @786726/ <p> " Read It with Fresh Wonder " : The Murder of Charles the Good by Galbert of Bruges <p> If one has the chance to go to the British Library in London and see the illuminated French chronicles , one should not miss the version of the Chroniques de France ou de Saint Denis known as Royal 16 G. VI . Not only does it impressively depict French kings , battles , crusades and meetings of ambassadors ; the chronicle contains a very rare representation of one of Europe 's most cruel conspiracies and murders of the twelfth century . It depicts the assassination of Charles the Good , Count of Flanders , in the church of St. Donatian in Bruges ( folio 266 ) . <p> While Charles prayed in front of the altar , he was murdered by several noblemen . Most of them came from the Erembald clan , the head of which was Bertulf ( 1091-1127 ) , provost of Bruges and chancellor of Flanders . He and some of his followers were sentenced to death or killed in the months following the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scaffolds--the just penalty for their crime . But it does not address questions such as who the conspirators were , why and how they were persecuted or why they planned a conspiracy against Charles in the first place--a man famous for his " goodness " and judged by the poor to be an upright prince . It is probably due to the fact that the French king intervened in the conflict after the murder that a picture was painted in a French chronicle . A more accurate and very detailed source of events is the present account , penned by Galbert of Bruges and known among scholars under the Latin titles De multro , traditione , et occisione gloriosi Karoli comitis Flandriarum or Historia vitae et passionis S.Carol comitis Flandriae , auctore Galbert notario or sometimes Passio karoli comitis auctore Galberto . <p> Galbert , a cleric who was close to the counts of Flanders , belonged to St. Donatian in Bruges and worked as notary for Charles and later on for his successor , William Clito . As an eyewitness to the assassination and the ongoing conflicts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Galbert claims to give an accurate depiction of Charles 's murder as well as ensuing events--riots and upheavals and the executions of the conspirators and of Charles ' enemies . He even dismisses possible criticisms : " If anyone tries to criticize and disparage it , I do not care very much " ( p. 80 ) . Historians today are more cautious about textual claims to infallibility . Nevertheless , Galbert 's text has been judged as accurate and reliable . Originally planning some kind of diary , Galbert made his notes on wax tablets and later copied them down on parchment . Unfortunately an autograph , even on parchment , does not survive . The text has been transmitted us in early modern copies , however , from Arras , Paris and Bruges , all varying in content . Historians of differing focus edited these texts several times in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Rudolf K+pke edited one in 1856 ; Henri Pirenne , using the Paris and Arras manuscripts , published another in 1891. 1 Some French translations have their origins in the nineteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guillaume Guizot. 2 It is surprising to note that this text--which plays an important role in history of Flanders and Europe more generally , but also sheds light on the history of political conflicts and military , legal and social history--was not translated into English or a Germanic language until the middle of the twentieth century . <p> In 1960 J.B. Ross of Vassar College translated the text into English . His translation was well received and republished ( with slight changes ) in 1967 . Both editions were published in the " Records of Western Civilization " by Columbia University Press. 3 Ross , known among students for his Portable Medieval Reader ( 1949 ) and The Portable Renaissance Reader ( 1953 ) , also composed a remarkable introduction to Flemish society in the twelfth century , delineating the reasons behind Charles 's murder as well as depicting the life of Galbert .

The edition is rounded out with a bibliography , an index , different maps and a genealogy of the Dukes of Flanders and Charles ' enemies--the Erembald clan . Karl Joseph Leyser and Nicolas-Norbert Huyghebaert as well pointed out several mistakes and misunderstandings in the first edition ; 4 Ross corrected only some of these in the 1967 version . This later version is now being republished by Columbia University Press in both cloth and paper . Of course , one may ask whether it makes sense to reissue a good ( though not perfect ) edition dating back to the middle of the last century . It might have been more appropriate to issue an electronic version of the text . However , Ross 's introduction is still great use , despite the fact that it is slightly out of date , especially in the face of changing research agendas and approaches .

The bibliography , at a minimum , could have been updated with little effort . Still , it is good that this important text is being reissued , providing students and scholars with significant details of an important aspect of European history in the twelfth century . And , as Galbert himself put it , it should still be read " with fresh wonder " ( p. 80 ) .

Numerous books on colonial history quote his comments on southern life and culture , particularly the practice of slavery . By his own count , Fithian filled seven diaries over the course of ten years , including his final diary recording his experiences as a military chaplain . He also wrote numerous letters to friends and Betsy Beatty , the young woman with whom he fell in love and eventually married . While the original diaries do not appear to have survived , transcriptions ( most undertaken but not completed by his brother shortly after Fithian 's death ) and his other papers are housed at Princeton University Library .

In the process , Fithian participated in the intellectual life of the Enlightenment , while maintaining his Christian beliefs . He joined an increasingly " cosmopolitan " community of like-minded colonists , while always yearning to return " home " to his south Jersey friends and family .

Using Fithian 's travels , Fea also looks at life among the planters of Virginia , as well as the backcountry frontier regions of Pennsylvania and Virginia , places Fithian visited as a tutor and itinerant minister . This book is simultaneously both broadly and narrowly focused , offering readers information on a wide range of topics . Of greatest interest in this biography are its discussions of the Enlightenment , a pursuit of knowledge , and reading of essays , books , and novels ; and its examination of how these ideas spread into such rural areas as southern New Jersey in the years before the Revolution . <p> Fithian was born and grew up in the area around Greenwich , New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the third generation of the family to farm in the area , and if he had arrived a few years earlier , he probably would have been content with the annual harvests .

He spent two years at Reverend Enoch Green 's new academy in the area , and then another two at the College of New Jersey ( today 's Princeton University ) , graduating in September 1772 . His return home to study for the ministry was cut short by the deaths of both parents in his senior year ; rejection of his proposal of marriage by Beatty ; and a push from Witherspoon , the president of the college , who urged him to accept a position in Virginia .

First , he apparently was too forward and was rejected . Then , he persisted , even when she was close to marrying another man and several south Jersey elders warned him off . The whole business lasted several years . It provides a lesson in colonial courtship , or , at the very least , in how it was not supposed to happen , excused perhaps by the fact that both Fithian and Beatty were orphans without parental guidance .

On December 22 , 1774 , when a group of locals decided to dispose of a shipment of tea headed for Philadelphia ( temporarily stored in Greenwich ) , Philip was " probably " among the twenty-three " burners . " On his role in this event the journal is silent , but local tradition maintains his presence . His early support for the patriot cause is clear in his journal entries , and it grew from an intellectual commitment to what Fea characterizes as a second " conversion " --this one to the Revolutionary cause with the willingness " to even sacrifice his life to this cause " ( p. 186 ) .

To most African Americans , and to white liberals committed to racial justice , better education was ( and thus better lives were ) now imminent for blacks . They also expected that school integration would produce greater acceptance among whites of African Americans as full and equal participants in American life . <p> Looking back several decades later , however , many civil rights activists insist that such optimism was grossly misplaced . NAACP attorney Julius Chambers sharply observed that Brown " gave blacks enough legal crumbs to satisfy them for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. xxvi ) .

In this important and engrossing book , historian James Patterson offers an insightful , balanced , and concise examination of how the battle to improve education for African Americans has developed since World War II . Patterson acknowledges the defeats and disappointments that pessimists such as Chambers , Clark , and Derrick Bell , among others , emphasize as the proper legacy of Brown . Expectations were surely too high in the heady days of 1954 . Nevertheless , Patterson insists , Brown has helped bring about substantial , meaningful improvements in race relations and the lives of millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Supreme Court , for it went on to issue important decisions affecting women , the disabled , gays and lesbians , and other disadvantaged groups in American society . <p> Taking issue with writers whom he believes offer a misguided nostalgia for the pre-integration era , Patterson surveys the deplorable conditions of black education across the South prior to Brown . Teachers in Sunflower County , Mississippi , many of whom worked on farms , lacked much training and often could only teach part-time . Children attended school for just three months in the winter , when there was little work to be done in the fields . In Atlanta , black schools were so over-crowded that there were double-sessions each day that limited students to just three hours of instruction . Spending in Atlanta in 1949 on white schools was more than twice as much as for African American schools . <p> Patterson presents a well-balanced look at the origins of Brown . Highlighting the role of individuals , he shows how Brown was both bottom-up and top-down history . On the one hand , Patterson emphasizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation who brought suit in hopes of improving the lives of their children . Many suffered horrific consequences for their activities . One South Carolina farmer who simply wanted authorities to provide buses for his daughter to attend a segregated school saw his crops rot in the field because white farmers refused to help him with the harvest . Other parents were fired from their jobs , harassed by the Klan or other vigilante groups , or murdered . Meanwhile , Patterson notes , Thurgood Marshall and his team of lawyers at the NAACP were making some important decisions too . Having achieved victories in several cases during the 1930s and 1940s that would force states with segregated schools to live up to the " equal " part of the " separate but equal " doctrine enshrined in the Plessy v. Ferguson case of 1896 , Marshall decided to mount a frontal assault on segregation itself . Without a ruling overturning segregation , Marshall knew , the NAACP faced the impossible task of litigating thousands of cases . Such an approach would require amounts of time and money that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals , Patterson also rightly notes that neither the parents nor the lawyers operated in a vacuum . Economic , social , and political trends opened up opportunities in the 1950s that had not existed before . <p> Patterson stresses the role of contingency in a vivid portrait of the Supreme Court . Personal and intellectual squabbles characterized the Court during the early 1950s . However , in September 1953 Chief Justice Fred Vinson died of a heart attack , and President Dwight Eisenhower named Earl Warren as his replacement . Warren , Patterson demonstrates , played a critical role through several months of discussion and personal lobbying that resulted in the unanimous decision . Here too , Patterson nicely balances the role of individuals with the larger context by highlighting how rising expectations among blacks , the Cold War , the growing importance of education in American life , and changing white attitudes about race shaped the ruling . <p> Warren 's decision has come under intense criticism over the years . Some liberals wish the Court had outlawed all legal considerations of color , not just those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social science evidence to justify the decision unnecessary . Conservatives , meanwhile , also attacked the use of social science evidence . Patterson , however , credits Warren and the other justices for " acting thoughtfully , indeed inspiringly " ( p. 68 ) . The decision , he notes , helped set the stage for other branches of government to act more forcefully on behalf of racial equality , undercut white southerners ' lies about blacks , and signaled that the Constitution would be interpreted in light of new circumstances . " These were no small innovations , " Patterson convincingly writes ( p. 69 ) . <p> The ruling proved among the most controversial ever handed down by the Supreme Court . Patterson reminds us that though the majority of African Americans hailed the decision , some resented the assumption that all-black institutions were inferior , or that black students had to be grouped with whites to learn . Likewise , some blacks worried that the sociological and psychological evidence employed by the NAACP depicted African American culture as depraved . Many of these points would gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected for vastly different reasons . <p> In surveying the implementation struggle across the South in the late 1950s and early 1960s , Patterson is appropriately sensitive to variations . Compliance was stronger in border states and the Upper South , areas with relatively fewer blacks , than the Deep South . Local leadership was also a critical variable . Compliance was more likely where local leaders firmly backed the Court , such as in Baltimore , but demagogues , such as Senator James Eastland of Mississippi , helped rally white opposition in other locales . In discussing the implementation phase , Patterson again weighs in on long-standing controversies . Many civil rights advocates have blasted the Court 's decision in Brown II , which held that integration should occur with " all deliberate speed . " Integration , critics claim , would have occurred far more quickly and smoothly had the Court firmly demanded immediate compliance . Patterson agrees that the Court 's wording encouraged white southerners to resist , but he contends that critics mistakenly assume that white southerners were ready for substantial changes in the late 1950s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the two rulings held back greater gains . Given that Eisenhower and Congress largely wanted to avoid getting involved in the crisis in the South , Patterson adds , there was little more the Court could do . <p> Patterson 's book , however , is much more than a look at the decision and how it shaped the turbulent racial politics of the 1950s , for he also surveys how the issue of school integration has affected American life down to the present . The Warren court had , in cases such as Green v. County School Board of New Kent County , Va tightened the screws on southern defenders of segregation through the 1960s , but the election of Richard Nixon in 1968 , and his subsequent appointment of four Supreme Court justices during his first term , greatly worried civil rights advocates . Under new Chief Justice Warren Burger , however , the Supreme Court surprised many observers by initially affirming the pattern set by Warren . The Burger Court tossed out " all deliberate speed " and ordered the immediate end to dual school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the mid-1970s , Patterson notes , the South had integrated much more fully than other parts of the nation . <p> This direction by the Court was short-lived . As white flight and controversies over busing and school integration in general flared across the nation , the Court issued two decisions which greatly troubled integrationists . In 1973 the Court allowed unequal school funding mechanisms to stand , while a year later it blocked busing from central cities to suburbs and vice versa . This ruling , along with social and economic trends shaping city and suburban life since the 1970s , meant that most city districts in the North and Midwest saw little in the way of integration . By the 1990s , the Supreme Court , under the sway of several staunch conservatives , continued to back away from requiring integration . Voices from the left , such as Derrick Bell , as well as from the right , such as Clarence Thomas , expressed strong criticisms of the alleged superiority of integrated schools . Meanwhile , civil rights groups and black parents increasingly turned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearson , who had fought with her husband and others for integration in Summerton , South Carolina , was asked if her efforts had been worth it . " No way , " she bluntly replied ( p. xxix ) . The new overarching aim for many was improving academic achievement of black students in inner-city schools . <p> This proved frustratingly difficult , Patterson points out . Despite increased school funding and additional programs , the performance of African Americans on standardized tests badly trails that of other groups in American society . James Coleman 's research on the relationship between funding and academic performance casts doubts that increased school spending will alleviate the performance gap . Segregation , meanwhile , continued in the North during the 1980s and 1990s . Indeed , these later chapters are among the strongest in the book , for here Patterson weaves a brief but sharp synthesis that highlights social , economic , and political problems that continue to vex educators and other policymakers committed to integration and improving African American academic achievement . Brown , Patterson concludes , still should be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits that the judicial branch can achieve on its own . As NAACP lawyer Jack Greenberg wrote in 1994 , " Altogether , school desegregation has been a story of conspicuous achievement , though flawed by marked failures , the causes of which lie beyond the capacity of lawyers to correct . Lawyers can do right , they can do good , but they have their limits . The rest of the job is up to society " ( p. 223 ) . <p> Specialists in the field will find the narrative to be familiar ground , but Patterson 's interpretations of old questions and ongoing problems in American education are thought provoking . This work is aimed at both an academic audience and readers in the broader public . Patterson offers a splendid start to a new series , " Pivotal Moments in American History .

Board of Education decision and the release of the Southern Manifesto , Mayor William Hartsfield of Atlanta sought to distinguish his city from the recalcitrant Deep South by highlighting its reputation for civic order , economic growth , and racial moderation . Atlanta , Hartsfield bragged , was the " city too busy to hate . " As the key figure in a powerful postwar coalition of local business progressives , moderate politicians , and African-American leaders , Hartsfield confidently defended Atlanta 's progressive mystique--both in 1955 and throughout the period of massive resistance--by pointing to the carefully orchestrated desegregation of its schools , parks , and other public facilities. 1 For Hartsfield and Atlanta 's governing bloc of racial moderates , civic order in Atlanta signaled the failures of massive resistance in the newest New South . As Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Atlanta and other American cities , north and south , were more adaptive , widespread , and persistent than the city 's boosters ever imagined .

" <p> An adaptation of Kruse 's doctoral dissertation , White Flight presents , at long last , the first full-length scholarly monograph on one of the most significant spatial migrations in American history . Through an exploration of the causes , processes , and implications of white flight , Kruse finds that whites in Atlanta responded to even limited forms of racial integration by first fighting and then fleeing desegregated spaces . But white flight , in Kruse 's account , was much more than a spatial movement from cities to suburbs . It was , in fact , a " political revolution " that brought refashioned forms of segregationist ideology into the mainstream of an ascendant conservative political discourse . In the end , according to Kruse 's revisionist case study , grassroots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actually triumphed in their quest for racial exclusivity . <p> White Flight begins with an exploration of Atlanta 's black and white power structures that together brokered the postwar pace of racial progress in the city .

Under the auspices of the Atlanta Negro Voters League , formed in 1949 with the backing of powerful black financial interests , black leaders such as John Wesley Dobbs and Austin Walden gained a level of political power that would have been unthinkable in more rural sections of the Deep South .

As Kruse writes of Atlanta 's white power structure , " Forced to choose between the social customs of segregation and the economic creed of progress , they readily chose the latter " ( p. 37 ) . By negotiating with black leaders over the relaxation of racial segregation , however , the moderate coalition helped to spawn grassroots rebellions within Atlanta 's white working-class neighborhoods and other spaces on the margins of Atlanta 's expanding black community . <p> In chapters 2 and 3 , Kruse documents the battles over race and residence , particularly on the city 's West Side , which sparked a segregationist revolt in defense of residential Jim Crow . Following in the traditions of historians Thomas Sugrue and Arnold Hirsch , Kruse focuses on the battles that erupted in transitional neighborhoods. 2 With a remarkable level of detail and precision , Kruse pinpoints the exact locations and moments at which whites fought to " defend " their neighborhoods , arguing that the battles over residential desegregation stood at the forefront of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s , Ashby Street emerged as a citywide flashpoint , one of the first in a series of rapidly shifting racial frontier zones that moved as the African-American community grew and shifted westward . Exploiting the animosity of white residents , small cells of extremist groups , such as the Columbians ( a neo-Nazi gang ) and the Ku Klux Klan , terrorized prospective black buyers through threats , intimidation , and open violence . But Atlanta 's moderate establishment loathed and ultimately repressed the white supremacist groups through a series of judicial and legislative proscriptions . <p> For opponents of neighborhood integration , the demise of the Klan and the Columbians proved that extremism and violence were less successful than neighborhood defense strategies that emphasized property rights and whites ' rights to " freedom of association . " For Kruse , the rhetorical and ideological transformations of segregationist politics represented a clear nexus between the fall of the Old South and the ascendance of the New Right . As the battle over neighborhood space raged on Atlanta 's West Side , groups such as the Southwest Citizens Organization ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some homeowner 's organizations had obvious ties to the Klan and racial extremism , homeowner segregationists eventually learned to tone down their rhetoric and violence , choosing instead more subtle , rights-based neighborhood defense strategies . One of the most common responses to residential integration , as Kruse demonstrates , entailed white fundraising schemes for the collective purchase of black-owned properties . Such strategies ultimately failed to halt black home buyers from crossing the color line , however . <p> As greater numbers of African Americans moved into previously all-white blocks , white solidarity quickly eroded as homeowners rushed to place their homes for sale on the black real estate market . In order to prevent massive panic selling and racial violence on Atlanta 's West Side , Hartsfield formed the West Side Mutual Development Committee ( WSMDC ) . Composed of three whites from the SCO and three prominent African Americans , the WSMDC either blocked or managed racial transitions in Atlanta neighborhoods depending upon the community 's " integrity . " When white neighborhoods could demonstrate the community ties that bound residents together , the WSMDC brokered gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other planning measures to preserve the homogeneity of white neighborhoods . But , in neighborhoods across the city threatened with racial transitions , the WSMDC found few white communities that exhibited cohesiveness in the face of desegregation . Unveiling the familiar patterns that emerged in Adair Park , Kirkwood , and other areas , Kruse demonstrates how whites nearest to black neighbors tended to favor flight , while those farthest from transition zones chose to fight , at least until their blocks became integrated . In reference to the failures of the WSMDC and other top-down initiatives to manage neighborhood boundaries , Kruse writes , " city planners sought to impose the boundaries of a community from above , when in reality a community could only be created in the minds of local residents " ( p. 104 ) . <p> In 1961 , following the token desegregation of Atlanta 's public schools , civil rights forces moved against the privatized forms of segregation that sheltered Atlanta 's moderate elites . Though they had been protected by the spatial buffers of class from the desegregation of public facilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans sought to integrate private facilities such as country clubs , restaurants , hotels , and private schools . With the support of the Civil Rights Act , the black protest movement successfully desegregated a number of privately owned establishments within the city , " even breaking down the color line at Lester Maddox 's Pickrick Restaurant , " but white flight to Atlanta 's suburbs proved to be a successful means of resisting the moral and political demands of the civil rights movement . Politically , the sit-in demonstrations and boycott actions of the 1960s tore apart the moderate interracial coalition that had governed postwar Atlanta , in the process creating space for the political ascendance of extremists such as Maddox , who won the governorship in 1966 . Over time , resistance to the desegregation of private facilities and to the mandates of the 1964 Civil Rights Act fueled the growth of a new breed of conservative Republicans in the Atlanta metropolitan region . Though white flight to the suburbs may have marked the last gasp of massive resistance , it proved to be a successful strategy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the segregationists of old and the Sunbelt conservatives of the future . <p> Moving from the city to the suburbs was a transformative experience for the whites who fled Atlanta . For leaving the city , as Kruse suggests , was in the end a secessionist strategy that anticipated the suburban hostility to annexation , metropolitan mass transit , fair share housing , and other prospective relations with the city of Atlanta and its black majority . In contrast to Lisa McGirr and other scholars of the postwar political culture of suburbia , Kruse argues that the racial politics of the New Right emerged within a specifically urban context : " The decision to leave the city had changed their outlook , and their arrival in the suburbs did nothing to change it back " ( p. 234 ) . 3 Kruse is also careful to remind readers that there was nothing peculiarly southern about the white response to desegregation in Atlanta . The rise of the New Right in Sunbelt cities such as Atlanta mirrored spatial and political transformations that reshaped metropolitan landscapes across the country . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's postwar race relations were exceptional vis-a-vis the North and the nation . Though this book is likely to be misread by some as a confirmation of the top-down Southern Strategy thesis that credits George Wallace , the political maestro , and working-class white supporters with generating the backlash that created the New Right , Kruse 's version of white flight signaled a national spatial and ideological movement to the suburbs that rippled upward from grassroots protests among white Atlantans of all class backgrounds. 4 <p> In comparing this account to other " rise of the right " narratives , readers will surely note that Kruse 's spatial orientation plays a decisive role in the story that unfolds . By choosing to highlight the conflicts and politics that sprung from Atlanta 's central city racial frontiers , and by looking specifically at working- and middle-class segregationists , who always experienced desegregation first ( though , in truth , the author does critique Atlanta 's Northside elites as well ) , Kruse tends to reduce suburban politics and the rise of the right to a single causal narrative : white secession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suburbanites never even lived in the city of Atlanta ( arriving from cities and suburbs across the country and , indeed , the world ) , it seems less obvious , without more analysis of Atlanta 's diverse suburbs , that white flight alone can explain the economic , demographic , spatial , and political transformations that birthed the New Right . Federal housing and transportation subsidies , and Cold War defense policies that allowed Sunbelt suburbs to boom surely played significant roles . And , to be sure , the white flight model simply can not adequately explain African-American suburbanization , particularly the post-1960s growth of black suburbanization in Clayton , Fulton , and DeKalb Counties. 5 Nor can Kruse 's model of white flight fully explain the zoning and planning strategies that kept elite neighborhoods and suburbs segregated by race and class . But all of this may be asking too much of a book which purports to tell the urban exodus and rightward politicization narratives of a smaller group of neo-segregationist whites . <p> While white flight may not , in fact , explain all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolitan regions across the country , White Flight certainly explains the clear ideological connections between grassroots forms of massive resistance and the secessionist politics that have grown out of huge swaths of white suburbia . And though Kruse has neglected non-white suburban migrations , intersuburban migrations , and even key issues , some real and others imagined , that fueled white flight ( fear of crime , for instance ) his book reminds readers that race , and racial avoidance , were central to the growth of white suburbia ( and its political conservatism ) . Carefully researched , elegantly written , and boldly argued , White Flight is sure to become a classic in the field of urban political history , one that readers from a variety of disciplines will need to consult . For , in the end , Atlanta 's story of white flight played out on a national scale . <p> Notes <p> 1 . For more on the " progressive mystique , " see William H.

@@40786735 @786735/ <h> Bismarck 's Fall from Power , 1890 <p> A struggle for power between Otto von Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm II broke out immediately upon the death of Kaiser Frederick III ( 1888 ) . The " dropping of the pilot " and the setting of a " new course " in 1890 signified the end of an era , a watershed in modern German history . Many contemporaries looked back upon Bismarck 's dismissal as a tragic mistake , believing that he would have avoided the foreign policy blunders that plunged the German Empire into the disaster of World War I. <p> But it was not foreign policy that drove kaiser and chancellor apart . The problem was what to do about organized labor . Clearly , the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878 had failed to curb the growth of militant labor organizations . Bismarck aimed at confrontation , hoping that if the laws were allowed to lapse and workers went too far , he would be able to revise the Constitution of 1867-71 in an undemocratic fashion . Wilhelm , at least early in his reign , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Marxist socialism with concessions . The occasion for the chancellor 's resignation/dismissal was a technical matter over bureaucratic protocol . It only partially masked the true nature of the conflict , however . Wilhelm , ambitious to rule as well as reign , wanted to be free of Bismarck 's overbearing influence . As one wit put it , Wilhelm wanted to be the bridegroom at the wedding , the corpse at the funeral . On the other hand , the irascible Bismarck clung desperately to power , unaware of his isolation or how his authoritarian ways with peers and underlings had alienated many who could have helped in his struggle . The gap in their ages and " styles " made for an intense contest of wills , but the outcome was a foregone conclusion . Bismarck had created an unassailable position for the monarch , immune even from the " iron chancellor . " <p> The major players in these events do not differ markedly over the facts of the case but rather what the facts mean . Bismarck gives his side of the story in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unforgiving of Wilhelm II and so embittered , these chapters were , according to an agreement between Bismarck 's heirs and his publisher , to be withheld from publication during the lifetime of the kaiser . But when Wilhelm fled to Holland in the last days of World War I , the publisher felt himself free to produce a third volume of the chancellor 's memoirs , over the protest of the family . Bismarck 's character assassination of Wilhelm and all those who sided against him in the critical hour is masterful . He presents himself as an aged and loyal retainer who put up with great injustice and ingratitude out of a sense of responsibility to the nation . But along side the pathos , Bismarck makes ample use of innuendo , impugns others ' motives , and casts many aspersions , all in an effort to justify himself to posterity and to have his revenge .

Translated by Bernard Miall . <p> TEXT 1 <p> When the Kaiser first began to entertain the idea of setting me aside , or when the resolve to do so was matured , I do not know . The idea that he would not share the glory of his future government with me was already familiar to him as a Prince , and was now ripe for realization . It was natural that place hunters ... should attach themselves to the future heir to the throne as long as he was in the accessible position of a young officer . The more probable it seemed that the Prince would succeed to the throne soon after his grandfather 's death the more animated were the efforts to win the future Kaiser 's support in respect of personal or party aims . The cleverly calculated phrase applied by Count Waldersee had already been used against me--namely , that if Frederick the Great had had such a Chancellor he would not have been Frederick the Great . <p> The difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ended in at least an outward reconciliation. 1- ... On January 1 , 1889 , I received the following letter : <p> Dear Prince : The year which brought us such heavy afflictions and irreparable losses is coming to an end . The thought that you stand faithfully beside me and are entering upon the New Year with fresh strength fills me with gladness and consolation . With my whole heart I pray that you may be granted happiness , prosperity , and , before all , lasting health , and I hope to God that I may be long permitted to work with you for the welfare and the greatness of our Fatherland . <p> Wilhelm , Imperator Rex <p> Until the autumn no symptoms of any change of mood were observable ; but in October , in connection with the Kaiser 's presence in Russia , His Majesty was surprised that I advised against the intended second visit to Russia , and by his behavior to me gave me to understand that he was not well disposed toward me .... A few days later the Kaiser set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent me friendly telegrams relating to his impressions from Messina , Athens , and the Dardanelles . None the less , it came to my knowledge later that he had heard " too much talk of the Chancellor " while abroad . An eventual breach over this matter was increased by the witty and calculated remarks of my opponents , which referred among other things to the " firm of Bismarck and Son . " 2 <p> In the meantime I had gone to Friedrichsruh on the 16th of October. - 3- In my old age I was not for my own sake anxious to retain my position , and if I could have foreseen my early departure I would have arranged it in a manner more convenient to the Kaiser and more dignified to myself . That I did not foresee it proves that in spite of forty years ' practice I had not become a courtier , and that politics absorbed me rather than the question of my position , to which no love of power or ambition chained me , but only my sense of duty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my knowledge how keenly interested the Kaiser had become in the so-called " protection of labor " legislation- 4- and that he had conferred upon the subject with the King of Saxony and the Grand Duke of Baden , ... <p> It was repugnant to my convictions and my experience so far to encroach upon the independence of the worker , in his professional life and his rights as the head of a family , as to forbid him by law to exploit his own working capacities , and those of his family , according to his own judgment . I do not believe that the workingman is in himself grateful because he is forbidden to earn money on certain days , and during certain hours , as he may choose , even though the question was undoubtedly utilized by the Socialist leaders for the purposes of a successful agitation , with the misrepresentation that the employers were in a position to pay an unreduced wage for the diminished hours of labor . As for the veto upon Sunday labor , I have found by personal inquiry that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the weekly wage would be as large for six days as it had formerly been for seven . The prohibition or limitation of the work of children and adolescents did not commend itself to the parents of those forbidden to work , and among the adolescents it was welcomed only by individuals who followed hazardous ways of making a livelihood .... <p> Be this as it may , it is a fact that the King of Saxony , in spite of all his good will for me , influenced the King 's ideas in a direction which was opposed to that which I had advocated for years , ... He had not anticipated that my dismissal from the service would be connected with this point of issue , and he deplored this result . The Kaiser had been convinced by a number of high ranking ministers that my senile obstinacy was a hindrance to his efforts to win over public opinion and to convert the opponents of the monarchy into adherents . <p> On the 9th of January the Reichstag reassembled . Even before Christmas , and again soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion that was equivalent to a command , not to come to Berlin for the session . On the morning of the 23rd , two days before the session ended , Bismarck was informed that a crown council- 5- would be held at six o'clock on the following day , and upon my inquiring as to the object of the council , the informant replied that he did not know . My son ... betook himself to the Kaiser during the afternoon , and in reply to his query as to the purpose of the council he received the answer that His Majesty wished to lay his opinion concerning the labor question before the ministry and desired that I should attend the council . On my son 's remarking that he he expected me that evening the Kaiser said that I had better not arrive until noon on the following day , so that I should not be settled in the residence , nor appear in the Reichstag , where the expression of my opinion , which differed from that of the majority , might endanger the party truce ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would be incompatible with the intentions of the All-Highest . <p> I arrived at two o'clock on the afternoon of the 24th . I called a session of the ministers for three o'clock .... I moved , and the motion was accepted , that we intended to maintain a provisionally receptive attitude in respect of the imperial revelations , if these should be important , in order that we might thereafter discuss them confidentially among ourselves . The Kaiser had asked me to arrive half an hour earlier than the other ministers attending the council meeting , at half past five , from which I concluded that he wished to discuss the intended communication with me beforehand . Therein I was mistaken ; he vouchsafed me no hints as to what was to be discussed , and gave me the impression , when the council had assembled , that he had a pleasant surprise in store for us . He laid before us two projects , worked out in detail ; one in his own hand , the other written to his dictations by an aide-de-camp , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drafting and completion of a decree of the Kaiser 's , expressed in enthusiastic language , and intended for publication , in the spirit of the detailed scheme . The Kaiser had this read by Karl Heinrich von B+tticher- official of the Interior Ministry , who appeared to be familiar with the text . This , to me , was surprising , not so much on account of its businesslike grasp ... as on account of the practical aimlessness of the scheme , and its pretentious and exalted tone ; this could only weaken the effect of the steps announced , and threatened to allow the whole affair to come to nothing , as a sort of speech of popular felicitation . <p> Yet more surprising was the monarch 's frank written declaration , before his expert constitutional advisers , that this proclamation was based on the information and advice of four men , whom he described as authorities , and mentioned by name . One was Privy Councilor Georg Ernst Hinzpeter , an educationalist , who presumptuously and unskillfully exploited the remains of his reputation as a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully avoiding responsibility ; secondly there was Count Douglas , a rich and lucky speculator in mines , who had endeavored to enhance the consideration lent by a great fortune by the luster of an influential position near the sovereign ; for this purpose , with ready and appreciative conversational powers , he established political , or perhaps rather politico-economic , relations with the Kaiser , and sought through friendly intercourse with the imperial children to contrive that the Kaiser should make him a count . In the third place there was the painter von Heyden , a society man , easily persuaded , who , thirty years before , had been a mining official in the office of a Schleswig magnate ; today he was regarded as an artist in professional mining circles , while in artistic circles he was looked upon as a mining expert . He had , as we were told , based his influence over the Kaiser less upon his own judgment than upon his relations with an old workingman from Wedding , who served him as an artist 's model for beggars and prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions which he made in the most exalted quarter . <p> The fourth authority whom the Kaiser upheld in the presence of his councilors was Governor von Berlepsch from Koblenz , who had drawn the Kaiser 's attention to himself by his friendly attitude to labor during the strike of 1889 , and had entered into direct alliance with him thus circumventing Bismarck 's authority .... <p> After the ensuing reading of the draft His Majesty declared that he had chosen the birthday of the great King Frederick the Great for this crown council , because the latter would provide a new and highly significant historical point of departure , and he wished the drafting of the decree alluded to in one of the detailed statements to be so expedited that it might be published on his own birthday ( January 27 ) . All the ministers who spoke declared that the immediate consideration and drafting of such refractory material was impracticable . I warned them what the result would be ; the increased expectations and the insatiable covetousness of the socialist classes would drive the kingdom and the governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichstag were speaking of the protection of labor , but as a matter of fact it was a question of the compulsion of labor , the compulsion to work less ; and whether the deficiency in the income of the head of the family would be forcibly laid to the charge of the employers was questionable , because industries which had lost 14 per cent of their labor power through the Sunday rest would perhaps be incapable of carrying on , so that finally the workers would lose their livelihood . An imperial decree in the intended spirit would prejudice the coming elections , because it would alarm the propertied classes and encourage the Socialists . A further burdening of the costs of production would therefore be possible , and could be charged upon the consumers only if the other great industrial states were to proceed in a similar fashion .... <p> The imminent close of the Reichstag session raised the question of a renewal of the Anti-Socialist Laws , which would otherwise expire in the autumn . In the commission , in which the National Liberals struck the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal of the Bundesrat ; - 7- consequently the question was raised whether the confederate governments would comply in this particular or whether they would wish to retain the power of banishment because of the danger that the bill might not be passed . To my surprise , and in contravention of my strict instructions to him , Herr von B+tticher proposed to introduce on the following day , when the last sitting of the Reichstag would take place , an imperial proclamation by which the projected bill would be revised in the sense desired by the National Liberals --that is , the power of banishment would be- voluntarily- renounced--which could not be accomplished in a constitutional manner without previous consent of the Bundesrat . The Kaiser immediately agreed to the proposal .... I ... demanded that we should wait for the resolution of the full Reichstag ; if it submitted an inadequate law this would have to be accepted , but if now , on account of a refusal , a vacuum were to occur which could not be filled , it would be necessary to wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be anticipated . We should in any case have to lay a severer measure before the next Reichstag . The Kaiser protested against the experiment with the vacuum ; he could not in any case allow matters to come to such a pass , at the beginning of his reign , that there would be a danger of bloodshed ; that would never be forgiven him . I replied that whether it came to insurrection and bloodshed depended not on His Majesty and our legislative schemes , but on the revolutionaries , and that bloodshed could hardly be avoided unless we , while confronted by no admitted danger , determined to give way no longer , but to make a stand somewhere . The later the government began to resist the more violent must that resistance be . <p> The rest of the ministers , excepting B+tticher and Herrfurth , expressed themselves in agreement with me , some of them giving detailed reasons for their agreement . Here the Kaiser was visibly annoyed by the negative vote of the ministers .... <p> Wilhelm was determined to publish a decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's resistance was gradually undermined by ministers who were unwilling to brook the kaiser 's will . <p> In order to appease the Kaiser 's impatience to some extent , I gave the two drafts in question ( for the Imperial Chancellor and the Ministry of Commerce ) a style corresponding to his character and his desire for emphatic expression . On presenting them I declared that I had prepared them only in obedience to his command , and urgently begged him to refrain from publications of the kind , to wait for the moment when properly formulated and detailed proposals could be laid before the Reichstag , or at all events to allow the elections to go by before the labor problem was touched upon . The indefinite and universal character of the imperial proposals would arouse expectations which it would be impossible to satisfy , and their nonfulfillment would increase the difficulty of the situation . I wanted to be able to remember , when after months or weeks His Majesty should himself come to recognize the danger and prejudice which I feared , that I had advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that I had supplied the completed text only out of the dutiful obedience of an official who is still serving . I concluded with the request that the drafts which had been read aloud might be thrown into the fire then burning in the grate . The Kaiser replied , " No , no , give them to me ! " and with some haste signed both proclamations , which were published , without counter-signatures , ... in the official newspaper on the 9th of February 1890. - 9 <p> Bismarck 's hopes that the state council and an international conference on labor problems would modify or nullify the kaiser 's decrees were disappointed . Foreign powers were all too willing to see the kaiser 's government embark on a course of " self-injury , " according to Bismarck . Individuals in the state council , on the other hand , lacked independence and moral earnestness . He concedes victory to Wilhelm in this matter . <p> From his behavior to me , and from communications made to me later , I can only draw more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occurred in the Kaiser during the last weeks before my dismissal . Of the psychological changes in myself alone I can give some account , thanks to contemporary notes made from day to day . Each of us , of course , exerted a reciprocal influence , but it is not practicable to represent synoptically the parallel events which occurred on both sides . In my old age I did not cling to my position--only to my duty . The ever-increasing signs that the Kaiser--who was allowed to believe ( by B+tticher , Berlepsch , etc. ) that I was an obstacle to his popularity with the workers--had more confidence in B+tticher , Verdy , my councilors , Berlepsch , and other unofficial advisers than in me , made me consider whether and how far my complete or partial withdrawal without prejudice to the interests of the state might be advisable . Without any i 'll feeling , on many a sleepless night I considered the question whether I could and should extricate myself from the difficulties which I foresaw as imminent . I always came to the conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refused the conflict which I foresaw . I found the Kaiser 's disinclination to share the glory of his coming years of rule understandable from a psychological point of view , and , any sensitiveness apart , he was clearly within his rights . The idea of being free of all responsibility , in view of my opinion of the Kaiser and his aims , was to me extremely seductive ; but my sense of honor showed me this aversion from conflict and work in the service of the Fatherland as incompatible with a courageous sense of duty . I feared at that time that the crises which , as I believed , were before us would be upon us quickly . I did not foresee that their advent would be postponed by the abandonment of all anti-Socialist legislation through concessions to the different classes hostile to the Empire . I was and am of the opinion that the later they occur the more dangerous they will be . I regarded the Kaiser as longing for conflict , as he was , or remained while under alien influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a moderating influence , or eventually opposing him . <p> In the second week of February , when my impression was confirmed that the Kaiser wished to develop at least the socialist affair , in the belief that he could conduct it in a propitiatory manner , without me , and more indulgently than I thought advisable , I resolved to have the matter plainly understood , and said , in a colloquy , on the 8th of February , " I fear that I am in Your Majesty 's way . " The Kaiser was silent , signifying his assent . I thereupon amiably unfolded the possibility that in case I were first of all to resign my Prussian offices , retaining only that for which I had been recommended by my opponents more than ten years previously , that of the " old fellow at the Foreign Office , " I might still continue to make the capital of my experience and confidence which I had won for myself in Germany and abroad useful to the Kaiser and the Empire . His Majesty nodded in agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a vivacious tone , " But I suppose you will still move the military requisitions in the Reichstag ? " I replied , without knowing their extent , that I would willingly support them .... I offered without more ado to postpone my resignation from the Prussian administration , if His Majesty so desired , until the day of the elections ( February 20 ) , so that it would neither seem a result of the elections nor yet affect them ; for I considered that they were already imperiled by the the Kaiser 's manifestoes .... <p> In the ministerial session of the 9th of February I intimated my intention of resigning from the Prussian administration . My colleagues were silent , the expressions on their faces were various .... I said to my son , " At the idea of being rid of me they all said , Ouf ! ' relieved and gratified ! " .... <p> Although I was fully convinced that the Kaiser wished to be rid of me , yet my attachment to the throne and my doubts as to the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all means that might guard the monarchy from danger or defend it . The elections for the Reichstag turned out badly from Bismarck 's point of view . On account of the composition of the Reichstag , and in order to advocate the Anti- Socialist policy hitherto followed , as well as the military requisitions , I now held that it was all the more necessary for me to remain until after the first parliamentary conflicts , so that I might help to insure our future against the Socialist peril. - Bismarck is led to believe that the Kaiser , in light of the Reichstag elections , has given up his policy of indulgence toward the Social Democrats and that he fully backs his chancellor 's intention to meet the socialist challenge head-on . Gradually , Bismarck learns otherwise . <p> While I was thus working for the realization of the imperial program the Kaiser himself , I am forced to believe , had given it up , without giving me any hint of it . I shall not attempt to decide whether he had been particularly in earnest over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Baden , advised by Baron Adolf Marschall von Bieberstein of the Foreign Office , had in those days warned the Kaiser against a policy which might lead to bloodshed ; if it came to a conflict " the old Chancellor would be in the foreground again . " ... according to my observations the Kaiser 's resolution to allow the plan of campaign against the Socialists to drop dated from the period between the 8th and the 14th of March . I suppose it was repugnant to him to extricate himself openly in my presence , and instead of this , to my regret , the method was chosen of allowing me to remain in office until the June term of the Reichstag . The usual methods of business intercourse , with which I had until then been favored , underwent a decisive alteration during these days , so that I am obliged to conclude that the Kaiser not only regarded my services as unnecessary , but also as unwelcome ; and that His Majesty , instead of telling me this in a friendly manner , with his former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I personally had felt no i 'll humor . I was honestly ready to help the Kaiser to shape affairs as he desired . This mental condition of mine was first disturbed by the steps taken on the 15th , 16th , and 17th , which exempted me from any personal responsibility for my resignation from service and necessitated my breaking up a household which had existed for a lifetime at a day 's notice ; - 10- yet to this day I have not with absolute certainty learned the actual reason of the rupture . <p> ... On the morning of the 15th of March , at nine o'clock , I was awakened with the news that His Majesty had just had it announced that I should make a report in ... my son 's official residence . There we received the Kaiser .... I began my report : " I am able to inform Your Majesty that Ludwig Windthorst- 11- has come out of his burrow and has sought me out . " The Kaiser thereupon cried out , " Well , of course you had him thrown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windthorst , since I had always been accustomed , as minister , to receive any member of parliament whose manners did not make him impossible , and since I was in duty bound to do so when any such member presented himself . The Kaiser declared that I should first have inquired of him . I differed from him , indicating my liberty to receive visits in my own house , particularly such as it was my official duty to receive , or such as I had a reason for receiving . The Kaiser insisted on his pretensions , adding that he knew that Windthorst 's visit had been arranged through the banker , von Bleichr+der ; " Jews and Jesuits " always held together . I replied that I was greatly honored that His Majesty should be so exactly informed concerning the private occurrences in my house ; ... the choice of an intermediary was Windthorst 's , not mine , and did not concern me . In connection with the constellation in the new Reichstag , it was a matter of great importance that I should know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was pleased to hear that he unexpectedly wished me to receive him . I had discovered , in the course of this conversation , that Windthorst intended to make impossible demands ... To ascertain his intentions had for me been a professional necessity .... <p> The Kaiser asked me nothing as to Windthorst 's plans , but began : " I receive scarcely any reports now from my ministers ; I have been told that you have forbidden them to give me reports except with your consent or in your presence , and that you are relying on an old yellow order that was completely forgotten . " <p> I explained that this was not the case at all . This order of September 1852 , which had been in force as long as our Constitution had existed , was indispensable to every prime minister ; it required only that he should be informed in the case of important proposals , which were new in principle , before the Kaiser 's decision was obtained , for otherwise he could not shoulder the collective responsibility ; if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this order must be authoritative . The Kaiser asserted that the order in question limited his royal prerogative , and demanded its revocation . I called attention to the fact that His Majesty 's three predecessors had governed the country under this order ; since 1862 there had been no question raised in respect of it , for it had always been observed as a matter of course .... - 12 <p> I then turned the conversation upon the dispatches which had come to hand concerning the visit to Russia , which His Majesty had announced for the summer . I again sought to dissuade him from going , and in support of my arguments mentioned certain secret reports from St. Petersburg , which ... contained unfavorable expressions which the Tsar was said to have employed concerning His Majesty and the last visit which His Majesty had paid him . The Kaiser demanded that I should read him a report of the kind which I was holding in my hand . I explained that I could not bring myself to do that , because the verbal contents would wound his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , read it , and appeared to be justly wounded by the wording of the Tsar 's supposed remarks. - 13- ... I had hoped that the Kaiser would have listened to my decided refusal to inform him of the tenor of the report , as his father and grandfather would undoubtedly have done , and I had on this account confined myself to paraphrasing these passages , with the intimation that it followed therefrom that the Kaiser 's visit was not welcome to the Tsar ; that he would rather that it should not take place . The wording of the document whose perusal the Kaiser insisted upon , literally with his own hands , was undoubtedly extremely displeasing to him , and was intended to be so . <p> He rose , and offered me his hand--in which he was holding his helmet--more coldly than usual . I accompanied him to the outer steps before the door of the house . He was just about to step into the carriage before the eyes of the servants when he sprang up the steps again and shook my hand vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me could only produce the impression that he wanted to disgust me with the service and increase my i 'll humor to the point of seeking to resign , yet I believe that his fully justified irritation concerning the affronts contained in the reports ... had for the moment encouraged the Kaiser in his tactics against me . Even if the change in the Kaiser 's methods , and in his consideration for me , had not been intended , as I had incidentally supposed , to determine how long my nerves would hold out , it was nevertheless quite in the monarchical tradition that the bearer should be the first to suffer for the insult which might be contained in a message for the King . History ancient and modern contains examples of messengers who were sacrificed to the royal anger on account of the contents of messages of which they were not the authors .... <p> At the close of the discussion I asked His Majesty whether he insisted upon expressly ordering me to withdraw the order of 1852 , on which the position of the prime minister depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not as yet decide upon an immediate withdrawal , but proposed to take the command , as one says , " Sunday fashion , " and to wait until I should receive warning to withdraw the cabinet order , when I would ask for a written order and bring it forward for discussion by the cabinet . I was even then convinced that I should not have to assume the initiative , and therewith the responsibility , for my retirement . <p> On the following morning , the 17th of March , Chief of the Military Cabinet Wilhelm von Hahnke returned , in order regretfully to inform me that His Majesty insisted on the revocation of the order , and was expecting , from the report which he , Hahnke , had given him of his conversation with me on the previous day , that I should forthwith hand in my resignation . I was to go to the palace in the afternoon , in order to take it myself . I replied that I was not well enough to do so and would write .... <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my resignation . My draft of this resignation ran as follows : - 14 <p> Bismarck gives a reprise of all the conflicts , domestic and foreign , recounted above and then closes with : <p> " It is very painful to me , in my attachment to the service of the Royal House and to Your Majesty , and after long years of familiarity with conditions which I had regarded as permanent , to sever myself from the accustomed relations with Your Majesty and the general policy of the Empire and of Prussia ; but after conscientious consideration of Your Majesty 's intentions , which I should have to be prepared to carry out were I to remain in the service , I can not do otherwise than most humbly beseech Your Majesty graciously to please release me , with the statutory pension , from the offices of Imperial Chancellor , Prime Minister of Prussia , and Prussian Minister of Foreign Affairs . <p> " After my impressions of the last few weeks and the disclosures which I gathered yesterday from the communications of Your Majesty 's Civil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am meeting Your Majesty 's wishes by this my request for leave to resign , and also that I may safely assume that Your Majesty will graciously grant my request . <p> " I would have submitted the request for my discharge from my offices to Your Majesty a long time ago , if I had not had the impression that it was Your Majesty 's wish to make use of the experience and the capacities of a faithful servant of your predecessors . Now that I am sure that Your Majesty does not require these , I am able to retire from public life without the fear that my decision will be condemned as untimely by public opinion.von Bismarck " <p> To which Wilhelm responded : <p> " My dear Prince ! With deep emotion I have perceived , from your request of the 18th , that you are determined to retire from the offices which you have filled for many years with incomparable results .

The motives of your resolve which you have put forward convince me that further attempts to persuade you to take back your offer would have no prospect of success . I therefore respond to your wish , in that I herewith grant you the requested discharge from our offices ... , with my good will and in the assurance that- your counsel and your energy , your loyalty and devotion , will not fail me , and the Fatherland , in the future also .

But even abroad your wise and energetic peace policy , which I , too , am resolved , in future and out of complete conviction , to make the pattern of my own dealings , will always be recollected with glorious approbation . <p> To reward your service adequately is not within my power . I must in this connection be satisfied with assuring you of my and the Fatherland 's imperishable gratitude . As a token of this gratitude I confer upon you the dignity of a Duke of Lauenburg . I will also have my life-size portrait sent to you . <p> God bless you , my dear Prince , and grant you yet many years of an untroubled old age , illumined by the consciousness of duty loyally accomplished . <p> With these sentiments I remain , in the future also , in loyalty bound , your gratefulKaiser and King , Wilhelm , I.R . <p> END OF TEXT 1 <p> The ex-kaiser had the advantage of getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published his memoirs from exile after reading the long-suppressed third volume of Bismarck's- Gedanken und Erinnerungen . One of his clear intentions is to undo some of the damage done by the chancellor 's effective attack on his character . He portrays the old man as hopelessly out of touch with the will of the new Germany , especially in naval and colonial matters , autocratic in his dealings with others , even Wilhelm I , and not nearly as trusted by the high and the mighty as he thought he was . On the other hand , he , Wilhelm , had been long suffering , loyal , hard-working , and modest in his dealing with the chancellor . Although extremely ill-used , he bore no grudges .

Bismarck <p> Prince Bismarck 's greatness as a statesman and his imperishable services to Prussia and Germany are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man in existence , whatever his party affiliations , who would dare to place them in question . For this very reason alone it is stupid to accuse me of not having recognized the greatness of Prince Bismarck . The opposite is the truth . I revered and idolized him . Nor could it be otherwise . It should be borne in mind with what generation I grew up--the generation of the devotees of Bismarck . He was the creator of the German Empire , the paladin of my grandfather , and all of us considered him the greatest statesman of his day and were proud that he was a German . Bismarck was the idol of my temple , whom I worshiped . <p> But monarchs also are human beings of flesh and blood , hence they , too , are exposed to the influences emanating from the conduct of others ; therefore , looking at the matter from a human point of view , one will understand how Prince Bismarck , by his fight against me , himself destroyed , with heavy blows , the idol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great statesman , remained unaltered . <p> While I was still Prince of Prussia I often thought to myself : " I hope that the great Chancellor will live for many years yet , since I should be safe if I could govern with him . " But my reverence for the great statesman was not such as to make me take upon my own shoulders , when I became Emperor , political plans or actions of the Prince which I considered mistakes . Even the Congress of Berlin in 1878 was , to my way of thinking , a mistake , likewise the " Kulturkampf . " Moreover , the Constitution of the Empire was drawn up so as to fit in with Bismarck 's extraordinary preponderance as a statesman ; the big cuirassier boots did not fit every man . <p> Then came the labor-protective legislation. 15- I most deeply deplored the dispute which grew out of this , but , at that time , it was necessary for me- to take the road to compromise , which has generally been my road both on domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage the open warfare against the Social Democrats which the Prince desired . Nevertheless , this quarrel about political measures can not lessen my admiration for the greatness of Bismarck as a statesman ; he remains the creator of the German Empire , and surely no- one- man need have done more for his country than that .... <p> The tragic element for me , in the Bismarck case , lay in the fact that I became the successor of my grandfather--in other words , that I skipped one generation , to a certain extent . And that is a serious thing . In such a case one is forced to deal constantly with old deserving men , who live more in the past than in the present , and can not grow into the future . When the grandson succeeds his grandfather and finds a revered but old statesman of the stature of Bismarck , it is not a piece of good luck for him , as one might suppose , and I , in fact , supposed . Bismarck himself points that out in the third volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no grudge against him for the third volume of his reminiscences . I released this volume after I had sought and obtained my rights . To withhold the volume any longer would have been pointless , since the main contents had become known already through indiscretions ; were this not true , there might have been varying opinions as to the advisability in the choice of the time for publication . Bismarck would turn over in his grave if he could know at what time the third volume appeared , and what consequences it had . I should be honestly grieved if the third volume had damaged the memory of the great Chancellor , because Bismarck is one of the heroic figures whom the German people need for their regeneration . My gratitude and reverence for the great Chancellor can not be impaired or extinguished by the third volume nor by anything else whatever . <p> In the first half of the ' eighties I had been summoned to the Foreign Office at the behest of Prince Bismarck .... I won the confidence of the Prince , who consulted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about the first German colonial acquisitions in Africa , I informed him , at his wish , concerning the state of mind created in the public and the navy by this move , and described to him the enthusiasm with which the German people had hailed the new road . The Prince remarked that the matter hardly deserved this . <p> Later on I spoke often with the Prince about the colonial question and always found in him the intention to utilize the colonies as commercial objects , or objects for swapping purposes , other than to make them useful to the fatherland or utilize them as sources of raw materials . As was my duty , I called the Prince 's attention to the fact that merchants and capitalists were beginning energetically to develop the colonies and that , therefore--as I had learned from Hanseatic circles--they counted upon protection from a navy . For this reason , I pointed out that steps must be taken for- getting a fleet constructed in time , in order that German assets in foreign lands should not be without protection ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign parts , and the people stood behind it , there must also be a navy behind it . <p> But the Prince turned a deaf ear to my statements and made use of his pet motto : " If the English should land on our soil , I shall have them arrested . " His idea was that the colonies would be defended by us at home .... <p> The political interest of the Prince was , in fact , concentrated essentially upon continental Europe ; England lay somewhat to one side among the cares that burdened him daily , all the more so since Salisbury stood well with him and had , in the name of England , hailed with satisfaction the Double ( i.e. , Triple ) Alliance , at the time of its formation . The Prince worked primarily with Russia , Austria , Italy , and Romania , whose relations toward Germany and one another he constantly watched over . As to the prudence and skill with which he acted , Emperor Wilhelm the Great once made a pointed remark to von Albedyll , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much excited after a talk with Bismarck , to such an extent that he feared for the health of the old Emperor . He remarked , therefore , that His Majesty should avoid similar worry in the future ; that , if Bismarck was unwilling to do as His Majesty wished , His Majesty should dismiss him . Whereupon the Emperor replied that , despite his admiration and gratitude toward the great Chancellor , he had already thought of dismissing him since the self-conscious attitude of the Prince became at times too oppressive . But both he and the country needed Bismarck too badly . Bismarck was the one man who could juggle five balls of which at least two were always in the air . That trick , added the Emperor , was beyond his own powers .... <p> Despite considerable differences in our opinions , Prince Bismarck remained friendly and kindly disposed to me , and , despite the great difference in our ages , - 16- a pleasant relationship grew up between us , since I , in common with all those of my generation , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust by my zeal and frankness--nor have I ever betrayed that trust .... <p> My assignment at the Foreign Office brought a very unpleasant happening in its wake . My parents were not very friendly toward Prince Bismarck and looked with disfavor upon the fact that their son had entered into the Prince 's circle . There was fear of my becoming influenced against my parents , of ultraconservatism , of all sorts of perils , which all sorts of tale bearers from England and " liberal circles , " who rallied around my father , imputed against me . I never bothered my head with all this nonsense , but my position in the house of my parents was rendered much more difficult for me and , at times , painful . Through my work under Prince Bismarck and the confidence reposed in me--often subjected to the severest tests--I have had to suffer much in silence for the sake of the Chancellor ; he , however , apparently took this quite as a matter of course .... <p> Wilhelm describes the death of his father , Frederick III , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments , and initial diplomatic efforts . <p> Upon my return from Constantinople in 1889 I described to the Prince at his request my impressions of Greece , where my sister Sophie was married to the heir-apparent , Crown Prince Constantine , and also my Constantinople impressions . In doing this , it struck me that Prince Bismarck spoke quite disdainfully of Turkey , of the men in high position there , and of conditions in that land . I thought I might inspire him in part with essentially more favorable opinions , but my efforts were of little avail . Upon asking the Prince the reason why he held such an unfavorable opinion , he answered that Count Herbert Bismarck had reported very disapprovingly on Turkey . Prince Bismarck and Count Herbert were never favorably inclined toward Turkey and they never agreed with me in my Turkish policy--the old policy of Frederick the Great . <p> During the last period of his tenure of office as Chancellor , Bismarck declared that the maintenance of friendly relations with Russia , whose Tsar Alexander III reposed special trust in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . In this connection it was that he gave me the first hints concerning the secret reinsurance treaty with Russia. 17- Up to then I had heard nothing about it , either from the Prince or the Foreign Office , although it happened that I had concerned myself especially with Russian matters .... <p> When I was Prince Wilhelm , I was placed for a long time under the Chief President of the Province of Brandenburg , Heinrich von Achenbach 1829-99 , in order that I might learn about home administration , get experience in economic questions , and , moreover , take an active part in the work . Spurred on by the captivating discourses of Achenbach , I derived from this period of my life a special interest in the economic side of the inner development of the country , whereas the purely judicial side of the administration interested me to a lesser degree . Improvements , canal construction , highway building , forestry , improvement in all kinds of transportation facilities , betterment of dwellings , introduction of machines into agriculture and their cooperative development--all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this being especially true of hydraulic work and the development of the network of railways , particularly in the badly neglected territory of eastern Germany . <p> I discussed all these matters with the ministers of state after I had ascended the throne . In order to spur them on , I allowed them free rein in their various domains . But it turned out that this was hardly possible so long as Prince Bismarck remained in office , since he reserved for himself the main deciding voice in everything , thereby impairing the independence of those working with him . I soon saw that the ministers , being entirely under Bismarck 's thumb , could not come out in favor of " innovations " or ideas of the " young master " of which Bismarck disapproved . <p> The ministry , in short , was nothing but a tool in the hands of Bismarck , acting solely in accordance with his wishes . This state of things was , in itself , natural enough , since a premier of such overwhelming importance , who had won for Prussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers completely and led them despotically . Nevertheless , I found myself in a difficult position ; the typical answer with which my suggestions were met was : " Prince Bismarck does not want that done ; we can not get him to consent to that ; Emperor Wilhelm I would not have asked such a thing ; that is not in accordance with tradition , etc . " I understood more and more that , in reality , I had no Ministry of State at my disposal ; that the gentlemen composing it , from long force of habit , considered themselves officials of Prince Bismarck . <p> Here is an example to show the attitude of the cabinet toward me in those Bismarck days : The question came up of renewing the Anti- Socialist Law , a political measure devised by Prince Bismarck for fighting socialism . A certain paragraph therein was to be toned down , in order to save the law. - 18- Bismarck opposed the change . There were sharp differences of opinion . I summoned a crown council . Bismarck spoke in the antechamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot that he was an officer and wore a sword belt ; that he must fall back upon the army and lead it against the socialists , in case the socialists should resort to revolutionary measures ; that the Emperor should leave him a free hand , which would restore quiet once for all . At the crown council Bismarck stuck to his opinion . The individual ministers , when asked to express their views , were lukewarm . A vote was taken--the entire ministry voted against me . <p> This vote showed me once more the absolute domination exerted by the Chancellor over his ministers . Deeply dissatisfied , I talked over the matter with ... Chief of the Civil Cabinet Hermann von Lucanus 1831-1908 , who was as much struck as I was by the situation . Lucanus looked up some of the gentlemen and took them to task for their attitude , whereupon they made it clear that they were " not in a position " to oppose the Prince , and declared that it was quite impossible for anybody to expect them to vote against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ' strike in the spring of 1889 took the civil administration by surprise , causing great confusion and bewilderment , especially among members of the Westphalian provincial administration . From all sides came calls for troops ; every mine owner wanted , if possible , to have sentries posted outside his room . The commanders of the troops which were summoned immediately made reports on the situation as they had found it . <p> One of these was from a former military acquaintance of Wilhelm ; it convinced him that , properly handled , the workers could be pacified without force and their legitimate grievances satisfied by reforms . <p> ... Wilhelm decided to summon the state council , include employers and employees in its deliberations , and bring about , under my personal direction , a thorough investigation of the labor question . I decided that in so doing guiding principles and material were to be acquired which would serve the Chancellor and the Prussian government as a basis for working out appropriate projects for new laws . <p> Inspired by such thoughts I went to His Excellency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the Chancellor to such action , and advised strongly against it . I stuck to my ideas .... I said that it was my duty to take care of those Germans who were used up by industry , to protect their strength and better their chances of existence . <p> The predicted opposition from Prince Bismarck was not long in coming . There was much trouble and fighting before I put through what I wanted owing to the fact that some of the big industrial interests ranged themselves on the side of the Chancellor . The state council met , presided over by me . At the opening session the Chancellor unexpectedly appeared . He made a speech in which he ironically criticized and disapproved the whole undertaking set in motion by me , and refused his cooperation . Thereupon he walked out of the room . <p> After his departure the strange scene had its effect on the assemblage . The fury and ruthlessness which the great Chancellor brought to the support of his own policy and against mine , based upon his absolute belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous impression upon me and all those present . Nevertheless , it stood to reason that I was deeply hurt by what had occurred . The assemblage proceeded to take up its work again and turned out a wealth of material for the extension of that social legislation called into being by Emperor Wilhelm the Great , which is the pride of Germany , evincing , as it does , a protective attitude toward the laboring classes which as is not to be found in any other land on earth .... - 19 <p> Later on I talked with Bismarck concerning his project of fighting the socialists , in case they resorted to revolutionary acts , with cannon and bayonets . I sought to convince him that it was out of the question for me , almost immediately after Wilhelm the Great had closed his eyes after a blessed reign , to stain the first years of my government with the blood of my own people . Bismarck was unmoved ; he declared that he would assume responsibility for his actions ; that all I need do was to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not square such a course with my conscience and my responsibility before God , particularly as I knew perfectly well that conditions among the laboring classes were bad and must be bettered at all costs . <p> The conflict between the views of the Emperor and the Chancellor relative to the social question--i.e. , the furtherance of the welfare of the laboring classes of the population , with participation therein by the state--was the real cause of the break between us , and caused a hostility toward me , lasting for years , on the part of Bismarck and a large part of the German nation that was devoted to him , especially the official class . <p> This conflict between the Chancellor and me arose because of his belief that the social problem could be solved by severe measures and , if the worst came to the worst , by means of soldiers ; not by following principles of general love for mankind or humanitarian nonsense which , he believed , he would have to adopt in conformity to my views if he did not resign . <p> Bismarck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to lay stress , in view of what I have previously said . On the contrary ! He was far too great a statesman to mistake the importance of the labor question to the state . But he considered the whole matter from the standpoint of pure expediency for the state . The state , he believed , should care for the laborer , as much and in whatever manner it deemed proper ; he would not admit of any cooperation of the workers in this . Agitation and rebellion , he believed , should be severely suppressed ; by force of arms , if necessary . Government protection on the one hand , the mailed fist on the other--that was Bismarck 's social policy . <p> I , however , wished to win over the soul of the German workingman , and I fought zealously to attain this goal . I was filled with the consciousness of a plain duty and responsibility toward my entire people--also , therefore , toward the laboring classes . What was theirs by right and justice should become theirs , I thought ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wherever the will or power of the employers ceased , by the lord of the land and his government , in so far as justice or necessity demanded . As soon as I had recognized the necessity for reforms , to some of which the industrial elements would not consent , I took up the cudgels for the laboring classes , impelled by a sense of justice . <p> I had studied history sufficiently to guard myself against the delusion of believing in the possibility of making an entire people happy . I realized clearly that it was impossible for one human being to make a nation happy . The truth is that the only nation which is happy is the one that is contented , or at least is willing to be contented ; a willingness which implies a certain degree of realization of what is possible--a sense of the practical , in short . Unfortunately , there is often a lack of this . <p> I was well aware that , in the unbounded demands of the socialist leaders , unjustified greed would be constantly developed anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to combat unjustified aspirations with a clear conscience and in a convincing way , it behooved me not to deny recognition and aid to justified aspirations . <p> END OF TEXT 2 <p> An independent view of events is recorded in the diaries of Reichs-Chancellor Prince Chlodwig zu **26;344;TOOLONG ( 1819-1901 ) , excerpts of which appeared in a popular periodical in October 1906 . Wilhelm was incensed by the publication of the diaries , " unheard of without permission from the reigning monarch , " as he wrote to the heirs .

Levy . <p> TEXT 3Strasbourg , 26 April 1890 <p> On the 24th I traveled with the kaiser to the hunting lodge near Sufflenheim . The trip lasted about an hour during which the kaiser recounted , without interruption , the whole story of his quarrels with Bismarck . According to him , the dissension had begun in December 1889 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about the problem of labor . The chancellor was against it . The kaiser was of the view that unless the government seized the initiative , the Reichstag--that is , the Social Democrats , Centrists , and Progressives--would take matters in hand and the government would be left behind . The chancellor wanted to present the Anti- Socialist Laws , including the expulsion provision , to the new Reichstag . When the Reichstag rejected this proposal , and in the event of worker uprisings , he would intervene energetically . The kaiser opposed this . Had his grandfather , after a long and illustrious career , found it necessary to proceed against an uprising , no one would have thought less of him . It was different for him Wilhelm II because he had not yet achieved anything . It would be said of him that he began his regime by shooting his subjects to death . He was ready to intervene but wanted to do this with a clear conscience , after he had attempted to do all in his power to satisfy the legitimate demands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose decrees along the lines of the one eventually proclaimed . Bismarck was wholly opposed to this . The kaiser then put the question of what to do about the workers to the state council and finally received the decree he wanted , in spite of Bismarck 's opposition . But Bismarck worked against it behind the scenes .... The relationship between Bismarck and the kaiser was shaken by these frictions , but the controversy over the cabinet order of 1852 intensified the embitterment . Bismarck had often advised the kaiser to let ministers come directly to him . And the kaiser did allow this . But when the traffic between the kaiser and his ministers became more frequent , Bismarck took umbrage at this and hauled out the cabinet order of 1852 in order to draw the ministers away from the kaiser. - 20- The kaiser protested against this and demanded abolition of the cabinet order . Bismarck at first agreed but later would hear no more about it . Then the kaiser demanded that Bismarck either place the abolition order before him or his resignation .... The prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An addendum to all this is that as early as the beginning of February , Bismarck had told the kaiser he would resign . But then he declared that he had changed his mind and would stay on . Although this was disagreeable to the kaiser , he did not argue . The story of the cabinet order came on top of this . <p> The visit of Windthorst to the prince also gave rise to unpleasant discussions but led to no decisive outcome. - 21- In any case the last three weeks were full of disagreeable discussions between the kaiser and the prince . It was , as the kaiser put it , " heavy times " eine hahneb++chene Zeit and , he also said , a question of whether the Hohenzollern dynasty or the Bismarck dynasty ought to rule . <p> As far as foreign policy was concerned , the kaiser asserted , Bismarck went his own way and had withheld from him a great deal of what he was doing . Indeed , Wilhelm says , Bismarck had wanted it said in St. Petersburg that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kaiser added that he had no evidence for this . <p> END OF TEXT 3 <p> NOTES <p> 1- Bismarck had at first favored using Court Chaplain Adolf St+cker 's ( 1835-1909 ) antisemitic campaign in Berlin to weaken the political hold of his left-liberal enemies in the capital . But St+cker 's rhetoric and the rowdiness of the movement he engendered soon turned the chancellor against him , especially after a pointed personal attack on Bismarck 's personal banker and confidant , Gerson Bleichr+der , a Jew . The then Prince Wilhelm moved in circles that supported the court chaplain and his Christian Social Party , the avowed purpose of which was to win workers away from godless Marxism and back to veneration of throne and altar . St+cker for his part was actively attempting to drive a wedge between Bismarck and Wilhelm , hoping to dominate the young man after separating him from the chancellor . <p> 2- Many contemporaries believed that Bismarck was grooming his son , Herbert , who died in 1904 , to be his successor . <p> 3- Friedrichsruh was Bismarck 's estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the Danish War and conferred upon him after the victory over France by Kaiser Wilhelm I. Along with Varzin in Pomerania , the gift of the Prussian Parliament after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 , Friedrichsruh made Bismarck one of the great landholders of Prussia . The estate was two hours away from Berlin by rail . Bismarck spent much time there even before his dismissal . It is the site of his mausoleum . <p> 4- The protective measures being advocated by Wilhelm called for legal restriction of female and child labor and the prohibition of Sunday work . The Christian-Social rhetoric that accompanied these modest proposals offended many in the possessing classes and alarmed others . <p> 5- The crown council ( Kronrat ) was a special designation for a meeting of the Prussian state ministries with the king acting as president . <p> 6- Hinzpeter ( 1827-1907 ) was Wilhelm 's former tutor . <p> 7- Composed of appointed representatives of the federal states , meeting in secret , and chaired by the minister-president of Prussia , that is , Bismarck , the Bundesrat wielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could propose its own legislation , most of the bills it considered were drafted by the Bundesrat . To become law , a bill required a majority in both the Reichstag and the Bundesrat . Although Prussia did not have a majority of votes in the Bundesrat , it could always gather them from the smaller states . Bismarck 's insistence on including the provision that allowed the police to remove socialist agitators from their home areas seemed certain to rule out a possible compromise between liberals and conservatives and thus to assure the bill 's defeat .

@@40786738 @786738/ <p> AJOR studies during the last two decades of Cervantes 's Novelas ejemplares by El Saffar ( Novel to Romance , 1974 ) and Forcione ( Cervantes and the Humanist Vision , 1982 ) have heralded growing interest among Hispanists in this rich collection of short narratives , as they have turned our attention to the problems for interpretation evident in their varied content and generic diversity . In her view of the novelas as a systematic poetic study of man 's quest for transcendence and faith in higher truths , El Saffar separates what for her are early , realist works ? whose characters are limited by their own misdirected acts of volition ? from later , idealistic narratives ? whose characters ' lives are defined by faith and the intervention of God in the guise of the narrator . Forcione 's study , similarly , focuses upon the novelas as spiritual allegories , finding in their composition evidence of Cervantes 's debt to the dialogic poetics of Renaissance humanism . In so doing , he focuses upon the discursive and rhetorical complexities that have been the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the irregularities of Cervantes 's ?

Although their formulaic structure and lack of verisimilitude reveal their affinity to many other examples of romance , we find that these tales are multifaceted and ideologically ambiguous in ways quite similar to their more realistic counterparts in the Cervantine novelas.2 The presence of instability in the figurative systems of romances appearing to be Christian allegories only reinforces the cautionary posture of Cervantes 's more multivocal , discordant , ? down to earth ? tales : readers must work to assemble meaning that is as complex and pluridimensional as is the world in which they live .

Friedman 's recent study of La fuerza de la sangre , especially 153-54 , and Johnston 's essay on La ilustre fregona are excellent examples of the increased attention given to this generic hybridization in individual novelas. 69400 @qwx479400 <p> The Tyranny of Love in El amante liberal <p> 107 <p> experience as their own critical acts ? by ? doing the right thing , ? often in contexts shaped by hierarchically intertwined discourses and conflictive systems of value.3 Of the Novelas ejemplares , El amante liberal is one that has been largely overlooked by modern readers . While commentaries characterize it as a narrative of clear religious exemplarity , El amante liberal receives poor reviews for its confusing form and unnecessarily elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selig , and Dfaz Migoyo have taken up the issue of the work 's Byzantine composition , demonstrating the importance of its heterogeneous elements in generating that ? clear ? exemplarity for readers and in influencing their response . Hart 's detailed analysis of the complex layers of admiratio in El amante liberal suggests that the work 's difficulty represents not an artistic deficiency , but rather Cervantes 's mastery of those precepts that sought to heighten his readers ' pleasure in reading . Although they appear overly contrived by modern standards , the varied , often extravagant reversals of fortune that make up the plot 's peripeteia strive to deleitar by adding variety . The manner in which they are narrated clearly is intended to intensify that effect . Hart 's study of sample lines reveals a narrative discourse dense with cleverly executed rhetorical figures that Cervantes 's educated contemporaries would have recognized and appreciated ( 312-13 ) . The in medias res narrative format of the romance itself , scored by flashbacks , temporal disjunctions , interior narrative frames , repetitions , and parallels , is even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? whether irritated moderns or , we must assume , delighted contemporaries ? to seek reconstruction and closure of the tale 's many threads . Selig proposes that El amante liberal is not , as we tend to view it , an overwrought tale , but more accurately a mini-Byzantine romance , <p> 3 Spadaccini and Talens argue in ? Cervantes and the Dialogic World ? that literature of the Spanish Baroque , however popular or ? massified ? it appears , functions to instill in readers the ideology that privileges specific ? structures of institutionalized power ? ( 238 ) . Hence , they explain , ? in Baroque culture the collaboration between text and receiver is illusory to the extent that the power of interpretation is ? given ? to the reader/spectator in order to make the manipulation ( and the persuasion ) more viable ? ( 240 ) .4 Among those critics who see this work as clearly exemplary of Christian values , both in its final definition of liberalidad and in its resolution through marriage , are Lowe , Pabon , El Saffar , Sicroff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews of twentieth-century criticism of its style and form , see Ameza y Mayo , 2 : 58-59 ; Lowe , 400 ; Hart , 306 . <p> 108 <p> NINA COX DAVIS <p> Cervantes <p> in which many of the elements typical to a full-length work are employed to articulate the basic love story . His schematic review of such constitutive ingredients includes : a nonlinear and discontinuous narrative discourse that moves the plot from confusion to restored order ; protagonists whose journey catapults them across a landscape of real geographical places and encounters with coordinates that appear to be culturally and historically specific , and who are linked by a linguistic hybrid of Mediterranean languages ; repeated reference to material exchange ; adjective-formation that , as he hints , may reinforce the ideological slant with which the text views these coordinates ; similarly , the ? portraiture ? of characters ; and use of self-referentiality , in the stories within the story ? the latter , as Selig observes , bringing us full circle back to the problematics of Byzantine plot ( 6869 ) . By concentrating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Migoyo deconstructs in his study the telling of the lover 's tale to reveal in its entertaining exemplarity a curiously pluralistic message , what I would call an ideological ? echo-effect ? that resonates like back-talk to the hero Ricardo 's own complacent words . The critic observes that in this novela , as in many others , Cervantes chooses Christian marriage as the perfect conclusion to the love story , because its sacramental nature allows it to function as a material and an allegorical signifier of the union that is simultaneously signified , effecting a neat closure of the multi-linear plot ( 130 ) . He argues that the representation of this transcendent ending , however , is achieved with a peculiar procedure , for instead of positing the ideal as real , it forces us to accept a self-consciously constructed fiction that betrays its own artificiality ( 130-31 ) . The most notable example , he argues , is the staging of the story 's exemplary ? generous love ? as the act of linguistic creation on the part of the hero , Ricardo , that advances the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first articulation of Ricardo 's love , an unliberal or covetous desire for possession of Leonisa expressed when he finds her being courted by Cornelio , has set the events of the tale into motion well before the beginning of the in medias res narrative ( 135-37 ) . The novela itself opens , after Leonisa and Ricardo have been captured by Turks and separated by turbulent travels , with the lament of the captive Ricardo , who seeks to free her ? a duplicate , supplementary discourse of love that appears to be characterized this time by generosity or ? amor liberal. ? Dfaz Migoyo 69400 @qwx479400 <p> The Tyranny of Love in El amante liberal <p> 109 <p> asserts that while the second , apparently reformed , discourse would seem to be a product of the first , selfish one , as an effect of experience , the disordered chronological juxtaposition of flashbacks and the use of multiple narrative frames obscure the origination of all references to his past in Ricardo 's interested present-tense voice . As a captive , he still longs for her midway through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via the interlocutor , his confidant Mahamut , portray Ricardo as an equally desirous spectator to others ' attempts to steal and possess his woman . Although the heroine eventually agrees to feign pleasure in his company when they meet in disguise to plot their escape , she warns him that his love for her remains unrequited : <p> When the novela 's wanderings are brought to closure by the deception of their captors , and their escape and return home amidst expected fanfare , Ricardo once again declares his love , this time in an ideologically correct liberalidad that appears to be motivated by generous self-abnegation ( ? Yo sin ventura , pues quedo sin Leonisa , gusto de quedar pobre , que a quien Leonisa le falta , la vida le sobra ? 186 ) . He grandly offers to give Leonisa along with his share of their booty to Cornelio , the man she had originally preferred , only to realize that she is not his to give another : ? ? Vlame Dios , . . . no es posible que nadie pueda demostrarse liberal de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darla a otro ? ? ( 186 ) . Ricardo then magnanimously offers her the right to act autonomously , declaring her to be ? suya , ? her own person ( 186 ) . This declaration reverberates with irony , for her own words have clarified that she was never his to give . Yet by removing the discourse of love from the realm of exchange , the hero makes it possible for Leonisa to ? do the right thing ? in responding to ? las obligaciones que como discreta debe de pensar que me tiene , ? the obligations of honor made public by Ricardo 's very words of denial ( 186 ) . The heroine corrects Ricardo 's still presumptuous rationale , retorting : ? Esto <p> 110 <p> NINA COX DAVIS <p> Cervantes <p> digo por darte a entender , Ricardo , que siempre fui mfa , sin estar sujeta a otro que a mis padres . . . ? ( 187 ) ; she is bound only by the constraints of her lineage and class , not by the claims upon her of his ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the motive of representing her own flesh and blood honorably ? that Leonisa exercises her autonomy , paradoxically , by accepting to become his : ? a trueque de no mostrarme desagradecida , . . . oh valiente Ricardo ! , mi voluntad , hasta aquf recatada , perpleja y dudosa , se declara en favor tuyo ? ( 187 ) . As Dfaz Migoyo brilliantly observes , this ? acuerdo sinceramente figurado , armoniosamente contradictorio , literalmente figurado ? reinscribes the story 's exemplary ? liberalidad , ? rendering a correct reading of the text 's hidden anagram : ? RICARDO-CORAZON-DE-LEON ? ( 150 ) . Cervantes 's story in this novela thus closes with the double representation of ? doing the right thing ? on the part of both protagonists . The patent theatricality with which the lesson of conjugal love is staged appears to be in dissonance with the motives for love on the part of Ricardo and his competitors that have advanced the plot ? self-interest , desire for domination of the Other , and the lust to appropriate or possess that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her own eroticized symbolic function as a prime unit of exchange in a libidinal homosocial economy ? but it is all the more so an appropriate closure to Cervantes 's portrayal of Ricardo as masculine Christian exemplar . After pursuing the many threads of this highly charged story to its end , readers therefore confront an abruptly anticlimactic resolution : the desire mobilized earlier by the libidinous representation of Leonisa and the fantasies of those chasing her is rather unsuccessfully displaced onto Ricardo , who now appears somewhat ridiculously mythologized as a Christian knight within whose figure she is literally and figuratively subsumed by consummation of the marriage sacrament ( 188 ) . Dfaz Migoyo 's astute recovery of the chivalric subtext in El amante liberal merits careful consideration , for it signals a major drive in the ideological formulation of the novela , despite the story 's structural appearance of being a Byzantine romance in miniature . Although its ? idealism ? and closure have led some readers to place it among the few narratives of the Cervantine series that may be seen simply as Christian romances ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed another example of the writer 's experiments with the potential for problematizing meaning through counter-genres , this time not romance versus what we 69400 @qwx479400 <p> The Tyranny of Love in El amante liberal <p> 111 <p> call ? novel , ? but in a combination of Byzantine and chivalric romance forms . In Allegories of Love , Diana de Armas Wilson traces both the characteristics and underlying tensions that distinguish these two romance forms , noting that by the late sixteenth century the Byzantine model had largely supplanted its chivalric predecessor in Spanish literature , with good reason . The chivalric romance , she explains , ? generated by a merger between the cross and the stirrup , ? served to express the interests of the Church and of the feudal nobility , idealizing the behavior of the latter ( 13 ) . In this literary tradition , marriage ? an alliance between families ? is one more expression of class interest ; desire is focused beyond its limits , in a privileging of adultery . As Wilson points out , ? the chivalric was also an enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly being undermined by nascent capitalism , by a value system in which the erotics of money and property had begun to displace the erotics of courtly love and holy war ? ( 16 ) . She speculates that renewed interest in the classical Byzantine romance stemmed from changes in Spanish society and its ideologies in the wake of the expulsion of Jews and moriscos and of its faltering attempts at capitalism , for this supplanting form is structured upon the travels of exiled and marginalized characters , and is laden with reference to commerce and exchanges ( 16-18 ) . The prominent erotic longing that characterizes the Byzantine form finds resolution in the requited love of a marriage between two active subjects , which provides an egalitarian structure for closure in this less class-dictated , quasi-bourgeois narrative form . I propose that while the exchange ? based , libertine Byzantine structure and many of its oriental elements clearly dominate the plot 's ? literal ? level in El amante liberal , they function in a very complex fashion to allegorize the latent political and religious message of western , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating multiculturalism , the eroticism , the inviting marginality and transgressiveness of the Byzantine romance constitute both admiratio and the discursive formulation of dangers requiring the punitive operations of the work 's restrictive chivalric moral , which reveals itself to be religious , racist , and for us , at least , extravagantly sexist . In El amante liberal we find clear articulation through Ricardo 's voice of what Said terms the ? Orientalist discourse , ? as ? a collective notion identifying ? us ? Europeans against all ? those ? non-Europeans ? that has informed Western institutions and their ideology since the early imperialist <p> 112 <p> NINA COX DAVIS <p> Cervantes <p> expansion of nations such as Spain ( 6-7 ) .5 By rejecting the allure of difference ? the oriental Moslem world , its money , the ? torpe deseo ? ( 174 ) of his Turkish master 's wife , and ultimately the ravishing beauty of a Leonisa marketed in that world , the male exemplar Ricardo is rewarded in the narrative by a return to his own religion , homeland , and class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh . Leonisa 's own exemplification of the knightly Christian ideal of self-abnegation , in marrying him to emulate a familial and nobiliary honor that is engendered masculine in the text , confirms the hero 's drive to sameness , closing the narrative on a resounding rejection of other lands , their economies , and their religion , elements that , as I will show , are represented in feminized terms.6 The heroine , the principal motive for the plot 's development until its end , then recedes from view to bear Ricardo 's heirs , her will to biological subjugation being rendered , paradoxically , in the novela 's ideology as indication of her heroic ? that is , manly ? virtue . Ricardo 's amorous territorial quest thus opens and closes upon the represented topology of the woman who is , in his own words , ? para mf leona ? ? oxymoronic embodiment of the valiant and fiercely unyielding , as capable of self-abnegation in her decision to value marriage over desire as is the victor ? liberal ? himself ( 142 ) . The process through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tale , however , is fraught with apparent inconsistencies : for if her person symbolizes the correctness of one hierarchical system of human correspondence at the novela 's end , that same body serves to represent other configurations of social and political power earlier in the narrative . The eroticism with which it is represented betrays a desire that <p> 5 In Orientalism , Said dates the formulation of the ? Orientalist discourse ? from the great imperial drives of Britain and France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . However , he acknowledges the significant contribution to Orientalism of the Spanish and other smaller empires prior to this ( 17 ) . Although the Orientalism of the Spanish Golden Age has not been widely studied as a phenomenon broader than specific racial and religious issues , the construction of literary texts such as El amante liberal reveals the strong influence and the complexity of its discursive articulations well before those of modern Orientalism.6 While Paul Julian Smith does not study the representation of Moors and Turks in the Golden Age , he comments in opening Representing the Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish and Spanish American Narrative ( 1992 ) upon the importance of the largely unstudied Oriental motifs that abound in peninsular literature of the period ( 2 ) . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> The Tyranny of Love in El amante liberal <p> 113 <p> is , in fact , clearly more ideological than specific to her character , for Leonisa is given little voice and less agency in the narrative ( her primary utterances , up to the work 's end , consist ironically of deprecation of the very man whom she finally marries ) and her would-be lover Ricardo expresses desire first and foremost for possession of her undifferentiated body ? lifeless , if need be . ( After describing the separation of their captors ' ships by a storm which splintered the one in which she traveled , he recounts searching the waves for ? el cuerpo de la desdichada Leonisa , ? lamenting ? mas an no quiso el cielo concederme el alivio que esperaba tener de ver en mis brazos el cuerpo de Leonisa , que , aunque muerto y despedazado , holgara de verle , por @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con Tl como mis buenos deseos merecfan ? 151-52 , my emphasis . ) In effect , the men of the narrative relate to each other through her desirable body , and these political tensions are rendered along a series of linked axes : religious , racial , and simultaneously engendered . While this system of attempted and thwarted exchanges is organized hierarchically around the fundamental symbol of Ricardo ( Christian , European , masculine ) , his rivals for Leonisa vary from the same or related race and religion , figuratively engendered female ( Cornelio , the Greek captives ) , to racial and religious others ( Moslem Turks and Arabs , the Jewish merchant ) , equally engendered female . Until the economies that operate between them stabilize at the work 's end under the latent but dominant one represented by Ricardo , Leonisa functions as the multivalent , mediating body through which their struggle for power is carried out . This novela is a striking example of the ? eroticism of the body politic , ? both in Leonisa 's variable figurative function and in the prurience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative . Although the essays of the Hunt anthology , Eroticism and the Body Politic , focus upon eighteenth-century France , the conceptual framework that links them bears consideration here . Stressing that ? the very fact that political organization can be imagined as a body leaves open the potential for erotic connotations , ? Hunt explains that ? the special role of women in the transmission of power through their reproductive capacities ? guaranteed that their common body was the representational figure of choice ( 1-2 ) . To clarify , she observes that this unique role is , more appropriately , ? an ambivalent position in conceptions of power ? : ? Men could not relate to one another , politically or socially , <p> 114 <p> NINA COX DAVIS <p> Cervantes <p> without their relationship to women 's bodies . The social and political order can not be reproduced without women , but women were almost always imagined as dangerous if they meddled in public ? that is , political ? concerns ? ( 2 ) . Cervantes 's heroine , Leonisa , is indeed a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbored by Ricardo when she is the object of heated pursuit and exchange among his rivals , the infidels ; yet she also functions to confirm the principles that organize his world in her will as subject to deny them all both use of her body and the benefits of her desire . It is precisely Leonisa 's lack of ? meddling ? in the politics that revolve around her that enables the narrative to affirm her merits as subject : she , in the end , is not a threat to the transmission of her society 's power , but proves to be quite the opposite . Readers of this novela are led to anticipate the centrality of the heroine to the captive Ricardo 's quest by the intense yearning that marks his discourse from the start . For the first five pages of the in medias res plot , however , its force is revealingly displaced in a testy diatribe against the foreign economy in which , we eventually find , she at present exists , one marked by material exchanges predicated on the assignation of variable monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slave trading , and sexual favors is defined , in the words of Ricardo 's male companion , the crypto-Christian Mahamut , as an evil empire that can not prevail : ? todo este imperio es violento , seal que prometfa no ser durable ?

Reference to the heroine whose pursuit launched the hero 's adventures in this figuratively and literally ? that is , racially ? ? dark ? territory follows , in the form of a eulogy of his homeland , the Christian Trpana , an exclusive island community whose geographical perfection is manifest in the legendary beauty of one of its own : ? una doncella , digo , por quien decfan todas las curiosas lenguas y afirmaban los ms raros entendimientos que era la de ms perfecta hermosura que tuvo la edad pasada ?

She does not desire Ricardo , but rather Cornelio , the one inhabitant of Trpana whose attractions are foreign both to Ricardo and the values of his homeland ( 142 ) . The hero 's narrative brands his rival as ? mancebo galn , atildado , de blandas manos y rizos cabellos , de voz meliflua y de amorosas palabras , y , finalmente , todo hecho de mbar y de alfeique , guarnecido de telas y adornado de brocados ?

Uncontrollable jealousy , he admits , caused him to spy on their meeting in the locus amoenus of Cornelio 's garden and to assault not Cornelio but Leonisa , with a verbal devaluation of the former intended to destroy her pursuit of the male beauty . In a parody of the metaphors common to Renaissance love lyrics , she is ridiculed for seeking union with a lover who has no phallic authority nor the hot humor of a male , a beautiful man whose valor resides not in him at all , but rather in the money with which his alluring disguise is made possible : <p> The very wealth , or monied economy , that enables Cornelio to project such a highly valorized exterior , argues the hero , is incompatible with what is of true value in love ? constancy and an esteem for the transcendent rather than the physical or material assets of the beloved .

When she appears to transgress the limits of her role as ? lady ? and desired love-object in the second series of coordinates , by actively desiring a male beauty that reflects her own , Leonisa herself gives impetus to Ricardo 's conquest of those infidel economies that the narrative represents as having spiritually as well as physically enslaved her . The triangularity of the garden encounter immediately gives way to the narrative staging of a much more global , symbolic triangularity , Ricardo 's struggle against a foreign menace for the freedom ? or proper reconstitution ? of Leonisa . In this process , the heroine appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary object ? or territory ? upon which the strategic operations against mutual foes are carried out . Because she is characterized with sufficient ambivalence to represent plural cultural ideologies during the narrative , she obviates the need of the Christian Ricardo ever directly confronting in combat ? and hence acknowledging the true power of ? his allegedly effeminate enemies . He simply skirmishes against the manifestations in her of their influence , striving to extract her from the market that has temporarily redefined her functions . Leonisa 's intransitive , yet mediate function allows the triumph of his beliefs to be inscribed in the narrative from its outset despite the hero 's literally subjugated , weaponless state ; he need not slay a Turk , but only win back their prized booty . Her status as medium also allows the development of her character to parallel Ricardo 's own struggles with the terms of desire , toward the exemplary realization of its most spiritually appropriate manifestations . The correct fulfillment of desire , we find , is none other than the essentially intransitive behavior represented by Leonisa 's love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper mirroring of Leonisa 's disallowed ( implicitly non-procreative ) , self-affirming desire for an effeminate male is Ricardo 's substitution of lust with the neoplatonic desire only for what is valiantly ? leona ? in her ? a reflection of himself in her honorable bearing of inheritors to their faith and caste . Throughout the travels that buffet them about , Ricardo is confronted with the image of Leonisa both as the corporeal possession of multiple foreign rivals and as the pure ideal of his Christian fantasies , for although she is repeatedly exchanged among owners , she is never ? consumed. ? When first captured , Leonisa , like Ricardo , is assigned by her captors a ransom value . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> The Tyranny of Love in El amante liberal <p> 117 <p> Ricardo tries to operate in their economy by offering for her exorbitant price his entire net worth , ? todo cuanto valfa mi hacienda ?

In the Turkish regrouping of prisoners and booty , Leonisa is taken off by her first master , Yzuf , a Greek renegado who has deserted the Christian world for greater profit as an infidel mercenary ; she appears to have perished with him in a shipwreck ( 147 ) . Ten pages and ? un ao , tres dfas y cinco horas ? ( 143 ) later , when the narrative flashbacks of dialogue with his faithful companion Mahamut catch up to the present , Ricardo is shocked to see her again ( 157 ) . This time Leonisa is for sale by a traveling Jewish merchant to whoever bids the highest , the exalted cadf who is Mahamut 's master or Ricardo 's own current master , the sultan Hazn . After both men compete for the rights to her , in order , supposedly , to bestow her for favor upon the ? Gran Seor , ? the superior to whom they owe their own authority , she becomes the transitory possession and ward of the Cadf . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Turks to secretly possess her body before passing it to the ? Gran Seor ? as virginal , the scheming of the Cadf 's wife to seduce Ricardo ( who enters the Cadf 's service as ? Mario ? ) , and the scheming of Ricardo and Mahamut to escape this bondage with Leonisa . Descriptions of the heroine during this period oscillate precariously between the deprecatory system of references that marks the infidels and idealizing ones that allegorize her Christian virtues . Ricardo characterizes her first captor Yzuf not only as ? su nuevo amo ? but also ? su ms nuevo amante ? ( 150 ) , thus implicitly questioning the firmness of her morals ; when she reappears , it is in the guise of a ? mora , ? with covered face but uncovered feet ( 157 ) and unbound hair ( 160 ) , the latter expressions of sexual provocation by the standards of her own culture . The excess of pearls and gold that bedeck her do not bespeak the legitimacy of her rightful class , but rather broadcast the desire of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they begin to meet in the Cadf 's house to plot escape , the narrator continues , Leonisa counters Ricardo 's guise as his master 's procurer with her own as that of her mistress . She attempts to formulate a strategy with her ardent admirer first by encouraging the possibility of his lust for Halima and then by advising <p> 118 <p> NINA COX DAVIS <p> Cervantes <p> that he comply with the woman 's physical demands with whatever imagined interest is necessary for his successful participation ? in effect envisioning the seduction of either one or the other ( ? si a Tl deseo quisieres corresponder , aprovecharte ha ms para el cuerpo que para el alma ; y cuanto no quieras , es forzoso que lo finjas ? 170 ) . Neither is she ashamed to fan the flames that rage within the Moslem woman , thereby entering into the complicity of prurient interest and sexual marketing that defines non-Christians in the narrative : ? Leonisa acrecent= en Halima el torpe deseo y el amor , dndole muy buenas esperanzas que Mario harfa todo lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , the narrative brings the transcendent , spiritual nature of Leonisa 's allure to the readers ' attention by repeated use of solar metaphors in describing her beauty : ? descubri= un rostro que asf deslumbr= los ojos y alegr= los corazones de los circunstantes , como el Sol ? ( 157 ; a description duplicated on 164 ) . In effect , the foreigners are shown to be captivated by that aspect of her beauty that defies definition in their economy ? her Christian Otherness . The logic of the narrative confirms the primacy of this latter characterization of the heroine , for she survives her trials ? con la entereza y verdad que podfan poner en duda tantos caminos como he andado , ? with her literal as well as figurative virtue intact ( 173 ) . The ambivalence with which the captive Leonisa 's moral status is represented up to this point is but a reflection of that larger struggle between the world of Ricardo and that of her captors . If the trials of the former are characterized by the quest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , as we are fully led to expect , manifest the inverse ? the negative exemplarity of immorality , in a political body whose ? irrational and frenzied couplings , ? to borrow Brundage 's apt description , have indeed disrupted the transmission of social power ( 152 ) .7 From the micro-structure of the family to the <p> 7 Brundage 's monumental study Law , Sex , and Christian Society , demonstrates the insistence with which canon and then civil law sought from early Christianity onward to guarantee the stability of social structures by regulating sexual behavior .

The difficult corollary was , of course , the model of Christian marriage as a procreative union without lust , except for that stimulation necessary for its consummation and productivity . The defusing of erotic energy between the two protagonists at the end of El amante liberal 's plot seems clearly dedicated to the representation of this ideal . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> The Tyranny of Love in El amante liberal <p> 119 <p> macro-structure of regional government the foreigners are in disorder : their equivalent of the viceroyalty is in dangerous transition and the only marriage portrayed for readers , that of the Cadf and Halima , is torn by adulterous desires on the part of both members and is without issue .

Disputes by the Moslem conspirators to possess the body of the exotic Christian beauty , an act that neither they nor the wandering Jew succeed in consummating , belie the inherent inability of the Orientals to function procreatively or productively to insure the growth of their race and empire . Not surprisingly , Fetala , Ricardo 's first captor , happily traded rights to Leonisa for the hero himself , four stalwart rowers , and ? dos muchachos hermosfsimos . . . ( de lo cual se content= ) ? ( 149 ) . The narrator 's pointed aside foregrounds the symbolic relationship between race and religion on the one hand , and sexual preference perceived as gender function on the other , that is carefully elaborated throughout Cervantes 's novela to prepare readers for the final triumphant contrast between the ? lion-hearted ?

The quest for truth in El amante liberal takes us on an erotic odyssey that charts the ideological and political differences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engendered human body .

In one of many examples she writes : ?

( 136 ) . <p> 120 <p> NINA COX DAVIS <p> Cervantes <p> truth of his own existence through the person of Leonisa and the others he encounters is represented in terms that are simultaneously spiritual , or psychological , and material , geopolitical . The novela 's narrative betrays through Ricardo strong anxiety regarding both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercenaries , as it examines the threat of unstable values ? and the buying and selling of bodies ? in the body politic . Perhaps not surprisingly , given our knowledge of seventeenth-century Spain , the coalition of threats to the subject Ricardo and to social stability ? from domestic to international ? is artistically engendered female , in a series of characters of both sexes.El amante liberal 's exemplarity , ultimately , appears to lie in the authoritative ? male ? rendering of its resolution : the hero marks his freedom from effeminate , libertine commerce and his return to anticapitalism and hence to moral high ground when with ? liberalidad ? he offers the heroine herself . One of the work 's many ironies is the incorporation of Leonisa into the same male-engendered system , when she finally corresponds to his apparent generosity by marrying him , in effect extracting herself from the disturbing market in which she has been an object of repeated exchange . Ricardo hence finds his confirmation in the valiant , or ? leonine , ? posture of Leonisa at the end , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and summons the resolve to marry the man who has relentlessly insisted upon the priority of his claims to her throughout the novela . Readers can not help but notice , however , that this resolution in favor of social stability through the carefully staged representation in the narrative of a generous , or ? liberal , ? affirmation 69400 @qwx479400 <p> The Tyranny of Love in El amante liberal <p> 121 <p> of ( aristocratic ) class , ( European ) race , and ( Christian ) religion ? the work 's exemplarity ? is accomplished by the very ungenerous construction of those excluded : all women ( as subjects ) , other religions ( Moslem and Judaic ) , other races ( Arabs , Jews , Turks , Greeks ) , less privileged classes , and the geography that links the heroes ' tiny homeland to the rest of the world . Cervantes 's narrative leads us to doubt the degree to which its heroes ' portrayed exemplarity adequately defines the scope of the novela 's lesson , for it resounds with the echoes of misplaced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words about the discursive ? irregularities ? of Cervantes 's novelas , ? revitalize perceptions blunted by the tyranny of familiarity and appearance ? ( 29 ) . In reading for exemplarity , we are forced to reconsider the validity of many stereotypes . While infidels collectively are cast as the perpetrators of Trpana 's sufferings , in the kidnapping of its heroes , individually they often do not fit the cultural models that we are led to expect ; in fact , they betray a number of surprising virtues . Leonisa 's first master , the renegade Yzuf , intends to marry rather than to enslave her ( 149 ) ; upon his death she is saved from the shipwreck and cared for by a band of Turks who protect her as a sister rather than enacting vile desires upon her ( 171 ) ; Mahamut proves to be a loyal and disinterested friend to Ricardo despite his brand as religious mercenary ; and Halima loses much of her estate and nearly her life in escaping with Ricardo to become a Christian and ? she mistakenly believes ? marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative evidence of ? liberalidad ? among peoples criticized discursively in the novela for motives of interTs . Both the opening and the conclusion of the tale locate the causes of protagonists ' trials in the heart of their own culture , Trpana . The qualities quickly projected onto the cultural Other , infidels from the East , are initially manifest in the island community 's own leading Christians and in the end still persist among them . Leonisa 's beloved Cornelio proves to be a cowardly sensualist whose love of wealth and himself come first ; he flees her foreign abductors and never makes a move to pay her ransom , although his wealth far exceeds that of Ricardo . Her own parents , who have supported his suit over Ricardo 's , are equally guilty of mercenary motives . The ? effeminacy ? with which Cornelio 's un-Christian self-interest is rendered in the narrative even makes an appearance in the description of Ricardo himself during the escape .

We are forced by the many representations of ? liberalidad ? in Cervantes 's El amante liberal to consider the symbolic nature of that exemplarity itself , as a signifier whose meaning is not clearly delimited . In effect , we are obliged to consider the ideological motives that constitute the cautionary allegory at work in the novela . The collision of two literary forms ? the chivalric and Byzantine romance ? and the worlds that they represent leave readers with the nagging impression that the issue of liberalidad is far from resolved by the return home of the protagonists and the narrative 's rejection of foreign horizons . The problem of exemplarity , rather than being placed in negative relief by their sojourn among barbarous peoples , begins and ultimately still resides in Ricardo and Leonisa themselves . The tale 's final , abrupt discursive shift to a chivalric register ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of consonance with Cervantes 's other literary works ? is only superficially supported by the narrative of their behavior , for Ricardo 's ? liberalidad ? and Leonisa 's correspondence through marriage are for them , as well as for readers , enacted , consciously promoted public postures ? mercenary in terms of the work 's definition of economy , even as they constitute ? doing the right thing. ? 9 While the discursive organization of Cervantes 's lover 's tale clearly upholds Christian guidelines for social order and mutual respect , its narrative thus appears simultaneously to question the constitution through liberalidad of exclusionary discourses that invert its very meaning . <p> WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY <p> 9 I have consciously played upon the use of this expression in Spike Lee 's film , ? Do the Right Thing , ? for this film impresses me as an excellent example of a cautionary narrative whose representation of racial , class , and sexual relations contains elements that are at once visionary and retrograde , in a confusion of discourses that leaves American viewers anxiously pondering the correct interpretation of the film and its implications for their world . 
@@40786744 @786744/ <p> John Phillip Reid 's extended essay on rule of law in the Anglo-American world of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries points to the modern shift in the meaning of the rule , its movement from a substantive restraint on arbitrary power to a procedural safeguard on individual rights . In telling his story , he brings into sharp relief the difference between Bracton 's thirteenth-century dictum that the king is under the law and the modern Austinian doctrine of law as the command of the sovereign . According to Reid , the Bractonian vision , as interpreted and embraced by the common lawyers of the seventeenth century , was the essence of the rule in early modern England . Law , not the king , was understood to be sovereign and , to the extent that this understanding prevailed , there would be an effective restraint on the exercise of arbitrary royal power . It was , Reid posits , " the cornerstone of the jurisprudence of liberty in the years when liberty was struggling to survive " ( p. 93 ) . Only in the nineteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty of parliament emerge without challenge and thereby make rule of law an imperfect restraint on the power of parliament and , by extension , a weaker guarantor of individual liberty . In America , on the other hand , the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution deprived the legislature of an effective claim to sovereignty . <p> In larger compass , Reid rehearses the familiar interpretation of common law as the reservoir of custom , the expression through precedent of an ancient constitution with political claims to immutability . What was drawn from that reservoir was always selective and controversial , sometimes specious , and often confounding . Common lawyers who routinely asserted that law was merely declarative of custom and , as such , not made new , found themselves at odds with Stuart kings who insisted that it was kings who made the law . The Stuarts promised to obey the laws they made ; however , they insisted , should they not abide by their laws they were answerable only to God . The difference , neatly underscored by Reid , was found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal heritage of Europe beyond the pale of Roman law had been law as restraint , not law as command " ( p. 12 ) . It was the difference between the rule of law as a " bridle " on monarchical power and the power of royal government as discretionary , arbitrary , and unrestrained . <p> Yet , much of the time the controversy was obscured by rhetoric of seeming constitutional agreement . In seventeenth-century England both sides of the growing political divide between parliamentarians and royalists made obeisance to the law , but whether and to what degree law limited the prerogative and , more important , who was to be the interpreter of the law , were matters that widened the divide . Each recognized the existence of the prerogative , the king 's unilateral hegemony in certain matters of state , but whether the prerogative was under the law or outside the law was the essential question , not to be decided until the interruption of a mid-century civil war and the conclusion of a late-century revolution . After 1689 the prerogative was clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspending powers had disappeared and parliament was effectively guaranteed to meet regularly . As a result , the law was no longer subject to the discretion and abuse of kings , but there was now the new and emerging danger that control of the law might become the exclusive instrument of parliament . In the opinion of the Tory polemicist Charles Leslie in 1709 , the law had already become " nothing else but the Declar 'd Will and Pleasure of the Legislature " ( p. 69 ) . <p> Reid , however , is only tangentially interested in the modern problems of the rule of law . His principal concern is to demonstrate through two seventeenth-century case studies , one in England and one in the colonies , that both societies understood the rule of law as a brake on governmental power . In England , his discussion focuses on the offer of the crown to Oliver Cromwell in 1657 . In that case , Cromwell , as Lord Protector , was effectively king in all but name , but when he was formally offered the crown he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the political constraints operating on him : the army was resistant to monarchy and Cromwell , in turn , was dependent on the army for political support . Significantly , the emphasis in this explanation is on the practical reasons for the refusal . Although by no means ignored , less attention has been focused on the rule of law reasons for the offer . Put simply , there was concern in parliament about the absence of any constitutionally recognized restraints on the power of a protector . A king and his limited prerogative were known to the " ancient constitution " ; a protector and his unbounded power were not . The fear was that of the ruler being free to act outside of the rule of law . As one contemporary observed , " We yet waite upon God and upon his Highness Cromwell to establish government by a lawfull authority , and that necessity may bee laide aside " ( p. 53 ) . <p> In America , Reid examines the rule of law in the controversy over discretionary sentencing in the early years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much that sentences were unduly harsh . On the contrary , many of Governor John Winthrop 's sentences were considered too lenient . That , however , did not remove them from the shadow of being arbitrary . However reasonable it may have been for Winthrop to want freedom for judges to prescribe individual sentences that would be both Christian and fair , discretionary sentencing was seen as arbitrary . In the end Winthrop was obliged to back down . The result was a victory for " the settlers of Massachusetts who forced their reluctant leaders to codify the law and specify criminal punishments because they wanted to be governed by known rules , not by magisterial discretion " ( p. 50 ) . <p> Reid writes , as well , of two other British expressions of the early importance of the rule of law , the trial of Charles I in 1649 and the Declaratory Act of 1766 . In the earlier instance Charles , on trial for his life , had made an eloquent defense of the rule of law . He refused to plead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoc High Court of Justice had not been established by any known legal authority and had no jurisdiction by which to try him . Charles , who had been accused of subverting " fundamental law " and choosing to rule by his arbitrary will alone , effectively turned the charge against his accusers . In a prepared speech that he was not allowed to give , he wrote of the people 's liberty as residing in the law and of there being no hope for the preservation of that liberty " so long as power reigns without rule of law " ( p. 30 ) . The king 's argument would be of no help to him personally , but it laid down a marker for an understanding of the distinction between the arbitrary exercise of power and the restraints upon that power by the law . <p> A century later , the Declaratory Act asserted the right of parliament to legislate for the colonies and led , within a decade , to the American Revolution . Parliament had enacted a stamp tax , which was resisted by the colonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be taxed without the consent of their own representatives . That resistance , ultimately successful , marked the watershed between parliamentary sovereignty in Britain and the emergent shield of fundamental law in America . In consequence , Reid sees the American Revolution as the vindication of the rule of law on one side of the Atlantic at the same time it was in full retreat on the other . The rule of law would survive in Britain , but as something other than as a brake on the exercise of sovereign power . It came to mean something significantly different . Reid concludes that " it may even be that in Great Britain rule-of-law was no longer substantive . It had become procedural only , requiring at most that governmental actions must conform to legislative command while that command could change at legislative will and pleasure " ( p. 78 ) . <p> Reid 's treatment of the rule of law and its significance for liberty is tightly focused and largely persuasive . If it is to be faulted , it is for two reasons . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the confines of a small book . Treating critical episodes in the Anglo-American story of the rule of law in less than one hundred pages of text , he has necessarily touched only briefly on those episodes , and not at all on the developments that occurred between them . Still , it is a credit to Reid that he has established an important conceptual framework which will invite others to explore it further and go much deeper into detail . The other fault , often found in studies that propound a watershed thesis , is the propensity to see things on either side of the divide in terms more clear cut than they actually were . In equating the early modern rule of law with the autonomy of the law , and seeing the law as determinative rather than subject to will or power , Reid confuses rhetoric for reality . Contemporary paeans to the law , whenever they arose across the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries , were never really serious about insisting on the law 's autonomy . In the early modern culture of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of its own . Politicians and controversialists of every stripe who routinely spoke of the sovereignty of the law , understood that the idea of an autonomous law was polemically powerful but nonetheless a fiction . The critical question , therefore , was not whether the law was sovereign , but who in the end would control it .

" The report castigated Hugh Gusterson , an MIT anthropologist , and other scholars for failing to respond to the September 11 attacks with proper jingoistic fervor . After declaring that " America and Western civilization " are " under attack , " the report tagged academics like Gusterson who " invoked tolerance and diversity as antidotes to evil " as part of the " Blame America First " crowd . The report had little effect ; indeed , the about-the-author blurb on Gusterson 's People of the Bomb : Portraits of America 's Nuclear Complex boasts of Cheney 's disapproval . <p> In 1996 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End of the Cold War , an ethnography of nuclear weapons scientists at Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Laboratory . Gusterson 's new collection of essays provides greater context for his previous work by aiming " to understand on a broad canvas the functioning of American military ideology , particularly nuclear ideology , during the cold war and the turbulent decade or so following the end of the cold war " ( p. xvi ) . <p> Using the methods of history , media studies , science and technology studies , women 's studies , and anthropology as his tools , Gusterson has assembled an insightful collection of essays that show the influence of nuclear weapons on vastly different areas of thought . He introduces the concept of " securityscapes " -- " asymmetrical distributions of weaponry , military force , and military-scientific resources among nation-states and the local and global imaginaries of identity , power , and vulnerability that accompany these distributions " --as a way to see the contemporary world ( p. xxi ) . People of the Bomb places under a microscope members of the securityscape : weapons scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Those familiar with the literature on nuclear weapons and culture might compare People of the Bomb to another excellent collection , Paul Boyer 's Fallout : A Historian Reflects on America 's Half-Century Encounter with Nuclear Weapons ( 1998 ) . Boyer 's essays discuss various aspects of culture that nuclear weapons have influenced , from museum displays to movies to activism . Both collections argue that the bomb has shaped our identity , though they differ in timeframe and disciplinary approach . While Boyer surveys the past , Gusterson looks at America 's continuing encounter with nuclear weapons , arguing that nuclear weapons loom as large in the post-Cold War era as they did in the past . <p> People of the Bomb also shares much with Spencer Weart 's Nuclear Fear : A History of Images ( 1988 ) . Weart , like Gusterson , takes an interdisciplinary approach , combining psychology , biography , anthropology , sociology , and history . The two differ in their conclusions , however . Gusterson argues that militarism and nuclear weapons have directly influenced American thought and identity . Weart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than facts , have shaped the way people view nuclear weapons . <p> Gusterson organizes his essays into five thematic groups in order to show different realms that have been altered by the nuclear complex . Although this organization has its strengths and weaknesses , each essay , considered on its own , offers unique and at times priceless insights . <p> First , Gusterson begins with a section that brings to life the bomb 's power to define " The Other . " The essay " Becoming a Weapons Scientist , " based on anthropological observations of and conversations with a Livermore scientist , explores the socialization process of nuclear weapons scientists . The weapons labs create a community and mindset allowing scientists of all political persuasions to see themselves as working for peace . A weapons scientist 's job is to make weapons to deter international aggression , and deterrence , in their minds , reduces the likelihood that the weapons will be used . Thus , scientists can see their work as preventing nuclear war even as they build nuclear weapons . <p> The end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view other nations by increasing anxiety about nuclear weapons falling into the hands of so-called rogue states . According to Gusterson , the most important essay in the book is " Nuclear Weapons and the Other in the Western Imagination " ; this essay deconstructs the most prevalent arguments against proliferation , maintaining that they are informed by an Orientalist point of view . Here Gusterson uses Edward Said 's construct of Orientalism as the West 's tendency to view the East as its opposite : rational vs. impulsive , modern vs. retrograde , honest vs. treacherous . Gusterson identifies the most common arguments against proliferation : third world nations can not afford nuclear weapons , deterrence will be unstable in the third world , and the third world lacks the technical and political maturity needed to have nuclear weapons . Rather than representing an informed debate , the proliferation discourse reveals a mishmash of double standards and irrational assumptions . Gusterson rebuts these arguments by turning them against the United States . " Third World countries are often represented in the discourse on proliferation as countries lacking impulse control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might misuse nuclear weapons , " he writes in one rebuttal ( p. 36 ) . Gusterson turns this idea on its head by citing numerous examples of influential U.S. politicians and military officials who ceaselessly and seriously advocated use of atomic weapons ( Curtis LeMay and Barry Goldwater , among others ) . Simply put , " in Western discourse nuclear weapons are represented so that ' theirs ' are a problem whereas ' ours ' are not " ( p. 24 ) . Like Weart , Gusterson recognizes that discourse about nuclear weapons is not based on facts about nuclear weapons . For Gusterson , Orientalist thinking drives the discourse ; for Weart , it is salient cultural images . <p> Second , Gusterson turns his eye toward the mass media . In " Hiroshima , the Gulf War , and the Disappearing Body , " he draws on the memoirs of scientists and media coverage to show how the state manipulates language and images of war in order to maintain its legitimacy . This process of manipulation , Gusterson argues , can be traced from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . Looking at scientists ' memoirs , he finds that analysis of the effects of the Hiroshima bomb took on a hyperscientific , rational tone . Bodies became " numerical aggregates " ( p. 68 ) dismembered from actual people who suffered and transformed into " a set of components " ( p. 72 ) , allowing scientists to distance themselves from the human consequences of their work . Hiroshima , according to Gusterson , marked a turning point in the relationship between language and war , " whereby , even as the destructive power of weaponry has increased , there has emerged a sudden public discretion about the effects of these weapons on the human body " ( p. 64 ) . <p> Since Hiroshima , the media and government have adopted the rational-scientific manipulation of language to make suffering and death invisible . These changes culminated in the media coverage of the 1991 Gulf War , where the media and government broke new ground " for the extraordinary visual and thematic absence of dead , maimed , mutilated , strafed , charred , decapitated , pierced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 72 ) . This discourse implies that the government believes the American people will support a war if evidence of human suffering is erased . <p> In Nuclear Fear , Weart locates the first use of technical language to hide evidence of suffering somewhat earlier in World War II : at the development of strategic bombing campaigns , which turned civilians into military targets . Even before Hiroshima , the government and media framed the firebombing of Japanese cities as aimed at enemy industries and morale rather than living humans . Perhaps Hiroshima was a turning point for scientists , but the state already knew to hide the bodies . <p> In the third section Gusterson confronts the ideology of realism as embodied in the intertwined worlds of diplomats and international relations ( IR ) theorists . Much like weapons labs , this world makes up a highly influential and nebulous part of the securityscape . This section hardly mentions the bomb . Instead , it offers a jeremiad against the ideology of realism , nestled within a skillful analysis of an elite part of the securityscape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests are self-evident . Instead , he argues , " national interests and identities are socially constructed through the functioning of dominant discourses " ( p. 86 ) . Gusterson then criticizes IR theorists , arguing that they suffer from a " blind spot " and exist in a paradigm of circular logic ( p. 104 ) . IR studies , he writes , " is a discourse that gives interpretive meaning to events but can not be tested by them " ( p. 120 ) . <p> Fourth , Gusterson examines the activism and debate surrounding nuclear weapons that has centered on nuclear tests . The antinuclear movement of the 1950s demanded a test ban ; the first major nuclear arms control measure banned above-ground tests in 1963 , and the Clinton administration agreed to a comprehensive test ban ( CTB ) in 1996 . At the same time , weapons scientists--even those who support arms control--have steadfastly opposed test bans . In " Nuclear Weapons as Scientific Ritual , " Gusterson finds that scientists want tests to continue because they act as powerful rituals that reinforce for scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weapons labs . Consequently , the 1996 CTB threatened to upset the social , political , and economic life of the weapons labs . In " The Nuclear Weapons Laboratory in the New World Order , " based on interviews with government and weapons lab officials , Gusterson describes how the labs came to accept the drastic upheaval of the CTB . Instead of traditional tests , the labs were offered " virtual testing , " an intricate and expensive system of computer-simulated tests . The sophisticated equipment needed for virtual tests guaranteed U.S. superiority in weapons development , since few other nations could afford such a program , while the $5 billion for " science-based stockpile stewardship " ( p. 168 ) secured the labs ' cooperation . <p> The fifth and final section looks at the way the nuclear establishment has influenced the lives of those who work and live in and around weapons labs . Fundamental to these lives are the efforts of the state to control knowledge about and perceptions of nuclear energy . In " The Death of the Authors of Death , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of national security . Weapons scientists are rarely allowed to publish , literally removing them from the academic , historical , and scientific record . Scientists do not receive credit for their work , and their intellectual achievements become the property of the state . <p> While the state controls knowledge inside the labs , the meaning of nuclear energy is highly contested on the outside . " How Not To Construct an Incinerator " shows how local opposition in Livermore , California , from 1998 to 1990 , prevented Livermore Laboratory from building a nuclear waste incinerator . Gusterson , a witness to the struggle , recounts how activists countered the lab 's positive discourse about nuclear power and halted the incinerator project . Gusterson sets himself apart from analyses of the antinuclear movement that see ( as Weart does ) fear of nuclear power as merely a displaced fear of nuclear weapons . Instead , he frames the fight as the new class division over who shall bear the burden of risk in society . His discussion is based on Ulrich Beck 's vision that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pollution ) . According to Beck , future class struggles will be waged not over the distribution of wealth , but over the distribution of risk ( i.e. , which groups will have to live closest to the toxic byproducts of industrialization ) . <p> Gusterson concludes with a pointed postscript on the George W. Bush administration 's " radical shift " in the discourse about nuclear weapons ( p. 221 ) . The Bush administration has surprisingly adopted the rhetoric of antinuclear activists , including the claim that deterrence and arms control do not make the world safer . Instead of the utopian vision of the peace movement , however , the Bush vision has subverted these arguments to justify calls for a new generation of nuclear weapons ( bunker busters ) and defenses ( a missile shield ) . But this tactic is not as new as Gusterson argues . When millions of Americans demanded a Nuclear Freeze in the early 1980s , Ronald Reagan essentially agreed with them , saying that deterrence created instability . Instead of advocating a freeze , however , he escalated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of Reagan administration veterans still in Washington , one should not be surprised that the government has again co-opted peace rhetoric . <p> Aside from the five thematic sections of the book , Gusterson mentions several other themes , including the power of language to make weapons seem safe and erase suffering , the national security state 's ability to define reality , and emotion and reason in war discourse . Furthermore , the securityscape is the new great divide , but so also is the class division of risk . <p> Gusterson uses plenty of jargon , although most of it is explained clearly . Those unfamiliar with anthropological writing might be peeved by Gusterson 's frequent use of the first person and personal anecdotes--at one point he even discusses his own nightmares . Yet these asides never seem irrelevant . At any rate , Gusterson spends plenty of time explaining his methods . He also writes in a lively and engaging style , despite a weighty theoretical approach . <p> People of the Bomb is " intended to help bring the profound influence of militarism on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It succeeds on multiple levels because of Gusterson 's wide-ranging interests , vast knowledge , skillful readings , and unique perspective . Gusterson wants these essays to show how the bomb has become " our identity , " though they fall a little short of this ambitious task . Gusterson 's focus is on elites : the only time we read about the general public is in the final essay . The book does not have as broad a canvas as some readers might like ; for instance , the economy is ignored , and popular culture is discussed only briefly . Still , Gusterson has offered an eye-opening investigation of the intellectuals , media , politicians , and scientists who control the birth , public face , and use of the bomb .

@@40786749 @786749/ <p> Like " sacred geography , " the phrase " mapping paradise " might sound somehow paradoxical . On the one hand , " mapping " bears a pragmatic connotation , suggesting an active engagement with physical territory , with the world " out there " ; on the other , " paradise " evokes flickering images of distant , ungraspable , even immaterial utopian realms . And yet , the history of western civilization has been paralleled by a continuous search for paradise : not just metaphorically , but also in the literal sense of the word . In Judaeo-Christian tradition , Paradise was not a disembodied entity or a mere spiritual condition , but rather a real , material place located somewhere on the earth 's surface , and therefore potentially able to be pinned down on the world map . In this highly informative and profusely illustrated book , the product of fifteen years ' research , Alessandro Scafi explores the more than one-thousand-year-old quest for paradise in the Christian West . <p> Conceived by ancient Greeks and Romans as remote blessed islands , paradise nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a dreamland in the tropical seas where to escape the stress of everyday life . However , " long before travel agencies promised the urban masses of the West a paradise on earth , generations of Christians believed in the early existence of a pristine spot where God had placed Adam and Eve at the dawn of time , and which was supposed to have been the ideal and perfect habitat for mankind " ( p. 12 ) . Both the nature and the geographical location of paradise have shifted through the centuries . Paradise has moved on the world map from the Far to the Near East , from Africa to the North Pole , from a walled island in the desert to an island lost somewhere in the ocean , or on an equally inaccessible mountain top . Paradise has also changed in form and temporal dimension : from a terrestrial garden of Eden lost to mankind , to heavenly Jerusalem attainable in the faithful 's afterlife . Paradise can thus be envisaged as a moving horizon in western history , or maybe even as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritually and intellectually . In this sense , the story narrated by Scafi sheds light on broader cognitive processes in different historical and cultural contexts . While the book focuses primarily on Medieval mappae mundi ( the most relevant context in which the mapping of paradise originated and developed ) , it also includes later historical periods and a variety of cartographic media : from Renaissance atlases and Enlightenment historical maps to contemporary art mappings and the internet . <p> The book is structured into eleven chapters , complemented by a prologue and an epilogue . The first introductory chapter offers a survey of past scholarship on mapping paradise . There follows a detailed philological and theological discussion on Eden in the original biblical texts and early Church Fathers ' debates on the allegorical versus literal understanding of paradise . Chapter 3 shows the consolidation of the literal meaning in the western Middle Ages via the influential figure of Saint Augustine . Resting on the Saint 's historical interpretation of Genesis , prominent theologians such as Isidore of Seville and Bede ( seventh and eight centuries ) , or Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Eden on earth yet beyond human reach . <p> The following five chapters explore how this Eden was graphically rendered on Medieval mappae mundi in all their variants : from the early T-O to the zonal and later transitional type. 1 On these cartographic representations , paradise occupied an important place . If in modern mapping " it is measurement that matters ... a millennium ago a world map was expected to reflect what was written in the Bible and not to dispute fundamental Christian doctrine .... Paradise was accepted as a place no less real than Rome or Paris " ( p. 19 ) . Medieval mappae mundi worked in a way and served a function radically different from that of modern maps . Resting on the contiguity and visual prominence of what Giorgio Mangani named " topoi " ( icon-events ) , rather than on the actual distance between geographical locations , mappae mundi constituted powerful mnemonic tools able to imprint biblical narratives in the mind of the faithful. 2 Their function , however , was not purely didactic . Conflating different temporal dimensions ( e.g. classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intangible features of history , mappae mundi offered themselves as devices for meditation and moral self-improvement . The presence of Eden on the map , for example , reminded the faithful of the Fall and the consequent necessity for redemption . It thus constituted a " key station " in the spiritual path between past , present , and future traced on the map ( p. 127 ) . <p> This mnemonic-meditative function of the map changed with the Reformation and the popularization of coordinate-based Ptolemaic mapping . Unlike Medieval mappae mundi , Ptolemaic maps were not immutable containers for universal history , but rather provisional documents to be filled with data from the new geographical discoveries : they portrayed a moment in time . As such , they no longer offered a place for paradise , except in their historical variants ( such as Ortelius 's Parergon , for example ) . By the sixteenth century , the idea of a contemporary paradise distant in space shifted to the notion of a lost paradise distant in time and thus equally inaccessible . Theologians ' growing belief that Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed by the Flood led to new and ( somehow paradoxically ) ever more detailed mappings of paradise . Until the eighteenth century , cartographic authority was used by reformed Biblical exegetes to defend the authority of the Scriptures against allegorical interpretation ( p. 284 ) . Chapters 9 and 10 explore this dramatic shift in the conceptualization and representation of paradise on the map in the light of the proliferation of post-Reformation paradise theories , including Luther 's and Calvin 's . <p> From the eighteenth century onwards , however , the location of paradise exited the realm of mainstream theology and became domain of non-professional enthusiasts . The last chapter of the book considers different alternative approaches : from late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century mappings , paralleling the quest for the cradle of civilization , to contemporary paradise maps on the web . Further modern approaches to paradise , such as in modern art , are discussed in the epilogue . <p> If , in the course of the twentieth century , mapping paradise continued to be dismissed by scholars as a bizarre curiosity that flourished in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on several fronts . Scafi 's work is emblematic , for example , of the recent shift in the understanding of the history of cartography from simplistic " linear progression " to culturally specific set of practices advocated by Matthew Edney and Christian Jacob , among the others. 3 From this new perspective , Scafi notes , Medieval mapping becomes more approachable , as the corpus of medieval maps , until recently rejected as absurd and irrational , comes to represent an alternative and valuable cartographic system ( p. 28 ) . In this sense , the author is successful in showing how the quest for localizing paradise on the map was not obliterated by geographical discoveries and scientific progress , as one would assume , rather it was continuously renegotiated . In other words , it changed but it did not disappear . <p> Independently from the historical period , mapping paradise has always represented a challenge and a paradox : that of mapping a place that is out of human reach , of making the invisible visible . The pursue of this enterprise can be read as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also one not confined to paradise itself . After all , the history of exploration is full of " paradises . " As John Gilles notes , every great geographical discovery has been preceded by the creation of " islands of the mind , " utopian paradise islands onto which mainlanders projected their fears and desires , and through whose mappings they made the newly discovered lands familiar. 4 Scafi 's book shows how , even in its most extreme manifestations , mapping is first of all a cognitive practice , a typically western attitude to rationalize the unknown , to grasp the ungraspable through its localization , circumscription , and visualization . This process has been recently researched by Gilles in terms of " islanding . " In this sense , Eden 's insular nature does not come as a surprise . <p> Mapping Paradise can be situated within a growing body of cartographic literature aimed at re-contextualizing and re-evaluating the relationship between the map as a cultural artefact and its context of production , moving from a merely political-instrumental Harleian reading to a moral-persuasive understanding of maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirical contribution to contemporary scholarship in the history of cartography , but it is also particularly timely within broader contemporary debates fuelled by a revived interest in the geography of beliefs and the sacred. 6 Besides geographers and historians of cartography , Scafi 's book , however , will interest a broader audience of theologians , art historians , and medievalists . <p> Byzantinists will also find in Mapping Paradise an interesting " western " counterpart to Henry Maguire 's work on representations of paradise in the medieval Christian East. 7 Scafi does refer to eastern Christian tradition ( i.e. Patristic writings and , briefly , to Cosmas Indicopleustes ' map ) , but mainly in contextual terms , in order to trace the origins and better locate the " mapping paradise saga " in the West . Insisting on the opposition between the literal understanding of Eden followed by western Medieval theologians and Eastern symbolic interpretation , he does not mention , for example , the production of Edenic " material geographies " in the Christian Orient ( from the desert Fathers ' cultivated plots in the wilderness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantinople ) , or the impact of iconoclasm on Byzantine perceptions of paradise . While going beyond the scopes of the book , a temporally broader comparison between the understanding and representation of paradise in the eastern and western traditions would show a far more complex panorama than that hinted at by Scafi , and produce another compelling tale . <p> Mapping Paradise offers the reader a rich bibliography and a wealth of detailed notes and illustrations , although unfortunately most in black and white . Reproductions of mappae mundi are accompanied by series of unique diagrams drawn by the author . These are helpful not simply to locate paradise within their complex graphic textures , but to make sense of the maps themselves . Overall , the book makes for a compelling reading , even though it often tends to be a little repetitive , while the chapter and paragraph titles ( lacking any historical indication ) do not always function as effective narrative signposts . Mapping Paradise nevertheless remains an enjoyable book and a great scholarly achievement deserving special interdisciplinary attention . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

In Reversing Sail , however , Michael Gomez shows that the integration of Africa and Africans into Europe and the Americas resulted in more than the exploitation of African slaves . In his new work , written as an undergraduate textbook , Gomez explores the duration , complexity , and agency of the African Diaspora in a way that lays the foundation for interesting in-class discussions of the issues raised . <p> Gomez examines the history of the African Diaspora by dividing his work into two sections . Part 1 , consisting of three chapters , explores the " Old World Dimensions " while part two , consisting of five chapters , examines " New World Realities .

Gomez then addresses biblical Africa(ns) in chapter 2 to explain the place of Africans in scripture , interpreting figures such as the Queen of Sheba while also setting up the role of Christianity in the African Diaspora . In chapter 3 Gomez considers the other monotheism that influenced Africa and , like Christianity , played a role in the enslavement and movement of Africans : Islam . The overarching point that Gomez makes in these early chapters is that Africans were not passive peoples without a history , but rather played a dynamic role within each of the contexts he examines . <p> From Africa , Gomez moves , in chapter 4 , to the western Atlantic basin and the realities of the Europeans ' New World . As Europe expanded into the Atlantic , the focus of West Africa shifted from the north , and the trans-Saharan trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , laid the foundations for the transatlantic slave trade .

In the remainder of this chapter , Gomez creates a general history of the transatlantic slave trade that has a short section on the various coastal regions followed by a longer section on the Middle Passage . Changing scene but not focus , chapter 5 explores what happened to the Africans after they arrived , as slaves , in the Americas . Dominant themes within this chapter involve the regional variations of slavery coupled with the rise of race--a construct with important repercussions for the African Diaspora . <p> After recounting Africans ' experiences of enslavement , Gomez guides the reader through the development of the abolitionist movement , with the ingenious agency of slaves in challenging the peculiar institution providing an apt counterpoint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relies upon the existing historiography to create a general but insightful history of the struggle for freedom .

Chapter 7 builds upon the theme of freedom by exploring how , in post-emancipation societies , the peoples of the African Diaspora attempted to reconnect to Africa in an attempt to better define themselves . This reconnection , often centered on the Caribbean , involved migration , labor organization , religious development , and the growth of specific political , ideological , and intellectual traditions . The section on religion , in which Gomez looks at the Africanization of Christianity , the continuity of African traditions in the Americas , and the creation of new religions such as the Rastafarian movement , is especially interesting .

While at times the work appears broad , through his selective sections within each chapter Gomez still manages to elaborate upon some of the debates surrounding the Diaspora . Although an obvious strength , these disquisitions are at the same time one of the work 's problem areas in that Gomez raises numerous questions that he never fully answers . While this approach serves the purpose of the " New Approaches to African History Series " of which Reversing Sail is a part , too often it also lends the work an unfinished quality . A typical example of this tendency involves how Gomez treats the issue of culpability for the transatlantic slave trade .

From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yet this is such a complex question , with such a multiplicity of answers , that students will need more than just a very general introduction to the issue to formulate their own answers . A second issue concerns Gomez 's specific choices in terms of content .

Yet here , in my view , we must deal with the work that Gomez created and it is obvious that all of his inclusions were well thought out and clearly contribute to the larger goals of his work . In sum , while the above observations should be kept in mind by those teaching this text , the work 's utility as an undergraduate text is unquestionable . <p> One of the text 's greatest strengths is that it shows that the people affected by the African Diaspora were not passive participants .

For those familiar with the history and historiography of the African Diaspora the text adds little , but that is not its purpose . 
@@40786751 @786751/ <p> San Antonio is famous the world over as the Alamo City . But few know that alamo is Spanish for " cottonwood . " What San Antonio history looks like when climate , water , trees , animals , and diseases are placed front and center--in other words , from the point of view of environmental history--is the subject of this anthology . <p> American culture tends to view cities as places where nature is most noticeable by its absence ; to find it , you must escape the city to the countryside , leaving San Antonio for the Hill Country , San Francisco for the Sierra , New York for the Adirondacks , and so on . This is a conception that hides more than it reveals , for cities not only transform nature , but are shaped by it in fundamental ways . Cities must get their water from somewhere , must find places for their waste , must manage the rain or snow that falls on them . Their roles as market and finance centers shape the countryside around them . Their residents often demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of city parks or prim suburban lawns . Animals , including those that bear deadly epidemic diseases , still live in their bounds . Environmental history is thus important in the making of cities , and cities play an important role in the field of environmental history . <p> On the Border , nicely addresses a wide range of environmental themes in San Antonio 's history . After an opening chapter that places the city at the crossroads of several ecological zones , two chapters deftly analyze colonial Spanish views of the area that became San Antonio and the ways in which the nineteenth-century city and its hinterlands mutually evolved . Part 3 , " Social Ecology , " turns to the interactions between the urban environment and different racial and ethnic groups , treating such topics as the creation of city parks , rates of homicide and infant diarrhea , and the environmental legacy of the city 's many military bases . Part 4 , " Water Fights , " examines the controversies over urban water supply , efforts to protect the critical Edwards Aquifer , and recent mediation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractious set of water-users . The last section , " Land Marks , " turns to the built environment and the connections between its history and San Antonio 's natural setting . <p> San Antonio 's environmental history , as treated in this volume , has some distinctive features that should make it of interest to a wide range of urban and environmental historians . Like so many western cities , San Antonio must contend with highly and unpredictably variable rainfall , a pattern which sometimes leaves the city parched and other times subjects it to destructive floods . But unlike many western cities , it has not gone to extraordinary lengths to secure itself surface water supplies . Early in the last century , Los Angeles pioneered this strategy by famously capturing the Owens River and bringing it over hundreds of miles and several mountain ranges . Even smaller and less powerful sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Albuquerque have taken aggressive steps to gain access to the waters of major regional rivers such as the Colorado . In contrast , San Antonio continues to rely exclusively on the Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States to be entirely dependent on groundwater for its public water supply ( p. 32 ) . This reliance makes San Antonio deeply reliant on the continued purity and abundance of the aquifer , which has been threatened by the last few decades of suburban growth , most of which has occurred near the aquifer 's recharge zone north of the original city boundaries . <p> The social and environmental histories of San Antonio are bound together in distinctive and important ways as well . Unequal distribution of its public water supply and the lack of a modern sewage infrastructure took an enormous toll on the traditionally Hispanic west side until the 1940s . As David Johnson , Derral Cheatwood , and Benjamin Bradshaw show in their essay , for example , in the 1930s the city 's mortality rate from infant diarrhea was the highest in the nation , with Mexican-descent children almost seven times more likely to die than Anglos ( p. 103 ) . On the other hand , Char Miller and Heywood Sanders show that a powerful black political machine , whose support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively high public health indicators and a fine system of neighborhood parks , even at the height of Jim Crow in Texas ( p. 86 ) . <p> While the strongest contribution of this volume lies in the ways in which it entwines the social and environmental histories of the city , it is also notable for its integration of the built environment with such classic environmental history questions as the control of water . The historic preservation movements that saved the Alamo , the missions , and other notable public sites from destruction also had environmental aspects , according to Lewis Fisher and John Hutton in their chapters . The city 's famous river walk is the best indicator that San Antonio has been able to manage environmental threats and create useful and attractive public spaces in the process ; although a massive flood control dam has transformed the flow of the San Antonio River , the city never reduced the waterway to a merely utilitarian use . The contrast with Los Angeles is again telling ( although not mentioned ) : L.A. flood control meant the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles River , with its virtually complete transformation into the sterile concrete bed familiar to millions as the scene of races in Grease Lightening and Terminator . <p> On the Border has its shortcomings as well . Like most edited volumes , the essays are uneven in quality . The chapter on epidemic disease and homicide as well as several of the chapters on water control are written from a more narrowly technical and policy orientation than is the rest of the volume . The book would have held together better as a cohesive whole had the essays been better integrated with one another . The main attributes of the Edwards aquifer , for example , are described in at least four of the chapters . Some of the essays could have been much more explicitly tied to environmental questions . Lewis Fisher 's description of efforts to preserve San Antonio 's built environment , for example , could have been much more explicit about the environmental ideas and impulses connected to them .

" ) It is worth the attention of all scholars of urban environmental history and anybody interested in the history of San Antonio or south Texas . Some of the specific essays would work quite well as assignments in urban studies or regional history classes . <p> The subscribers of H-Texas have particular reason to pay attention to collections such as this .

This army looms large in the historical imagination of race and power in contemporary Morocco , and El Hamel 's book considerably widens and deepens our understanding of Mawlay Isma'il 's " project " while simultaneously challenging the notion that slavery in North Africa was benign .

These scholarly skills and sensitivities help make El Hamel 's new book an important contribution not only to the study of slavery but also to the field of North African history , which has until recently paid little attention to trans-Saharan connections , and whose periodization has tended to treat the appearance of European colonial powers as a sharp historiographical boundary . <p> Black Morocco is divided into two parts . The paired chapters of part 1 consider slavery within the broad Islamic legal and moral framework , on the one hand , and , on the other , within a specifically North African and Moroccan context during the medieval and early modern periods . Chapter 1- examines- legal and moral perspectives on slavery in the Qur'an , +ad-th literature , and Sunni legal traditions . El Hamel argues that interpreters of Islamic law chose to accommodate existing institutions of slavery and concubinage , ignoring the Qur'an 's counsel against such practices . In- chapter 2 , - the- author thinks broadly about notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the medieval and early modern periods . El Hamel points out longstanding continuities in North African perceptions of racial difference and hierarchy , so that despite the enslavement of many different groups , and the possibility for the child of a male master and an enslaved woman to inherit or attain a high social status , " blackness " came to be associated with servitude . At the same time , he discusses the existence of non-enslaved , autochtonous black communities in Morocco . <p> Part 2 considers the " diaspora " of sub-Saharan Africans in North Africa in the early modern and modern periods . It begins with a chapter that traces the medieval roots of the slave trade to Morocco . Sub-Saharan Africans constituted a distinct category of captives that increased in size with the intensification of North African ties to West Africa through trade , conquest , and religious networks . The flow of captive West Africans into Morocco reached a peak with the conquest of the Songhay Empire at the end of the sixteenth century . Many of the Songhay captives were directed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nascent sugar industry . This southern enslaved population would form the central pool for the ' Alawi dynasty 's creation of a racialized army several generations later . <p> The three chapters that follow use a variety of European travelers ' accounts and unpublished Arabic manuscripts to narrate the creation , functioning , and eventual dissolution of Mawlay Isma'il 's social and military project . These chapters are the core of the book and its most original contribution. - Chapter 4- treats Mawlay Isma'il 's conscription of black Moroccans . This conscription , which began in the 1670s , was deeply controversial , in part because it often meant the enslavement of an established , non-slave Muslim population from within Morocco , and in part because it destabilized established relationships of clientage and servitude outside the royal circle . El Hamel deftly traces the debate regarding the legality of Mawlay Isma'il 's actions , which brought the sultan into conflict with many of the country 's leading religious scholars and in some cases ended with black non-enslaved populations escaping conscription . <p> Chapter 5 focuses on the everyday life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-reproducing , all-encompassing aspects of this institution during Mawlay Isma'il 's reign . El Hamel describes the life- cycle of the conscripted population , including the separation of girls from boys- and their education in crafts and services , boys ' contributions to construction projects- and their eventual integration into the army , and the sultan 's role in pairing slaves for purposes of marriage and procreation . El Hamel vividly evokes the way in which this novel institution , inspired in part by the Ottoman Janissaries , constituted an internal military force dedicated to the suppression of the sultan 's challengers . In this respect , it was highly significant that the conscripts came from situations in which they were largely not integrated within the kin relationships that tribes depended on , and had furthermore been removed from their home regions and from the social networks they shared with other Moroccans . <p> Chapter 6- tells the story of this military force after Mawlay Isma'il 's reign . The immediate aftermath of the sultan 's death confirms El Hamel 's assertion that this force constituted the ruler 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases raided by newly empowered tribes , some conscripts dispersed . Nevertheless , the " black army " did not disappear , instead becoming one important component in a shifting military apparatus that now drew on tribes as well . In this configuration , the " black army " came to play a role in the struggles over dynastic succession . Its fortunes very much depended on the interests of the ruler . In some instances , it was seen to be a political and economic liability , and its members dispersed . In other instances , particularly at the end of the eighteenth century , it came to play an important though nonexclusive role within the military apparatus . This section of the governmental structure was partly replenished with newly enslaved West Africans in the nineteenth century , even as a sense of an original core dating to Mawlay Isma'il 's reign remained . <p> The final two chapters of Black Morocco move away from the " black army " to consider the disappearance and afterlife of slavery in Moroccan society . Chapter 7 details the whittling away of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , with the institution gradually disappearing during the French Protectorate period . Chapter 8 looks at the collective memory of slavery among adherents of the musical and spiritual order of the Gnawa . El Hamel synthesizes much of the scholarly literature on the Gnawa , emphasizing their status as bearers of a subaltern memory of enslavement , slave trading , and their- West African- origins , and he enriches this discussion through interviews with a leading family in Moroccan Gnawa circles and through a philological exploration of the term " Gnawa . " <p> Black Morocco offers us the most sustained and in-depth discussion of Mawlay Isma'il 's army to date , and provides a solid overview of slavery in Morocco beyond this particular sultan 's reign . El Hamel worked- with some very rich , often previously untapped sources , but he also faced the difficult task of dealing with a lack of documents that might fill in our sense of slavery , freedom , labor , and social status outside the palace . At times , I suspect that El Hamel could have- done more with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ethnicity , and status a bit more . For example , in a- few passages , he describes early modern black Moroccans as " an economically underprivileged class , " echoing Mawlay Isma'il 's convenient treatment of them as an undifferentiated bloc- ( p. 159 ) . There are also- instances , such as El Hamel 's discussion of some of the cultivators whom Mawlay Isma'il attempted to conscript , when the " free black " populations sound rather un-free , even before conscription . Then- in other instances , such as Mawlay Isma'il 's " black army , " the notion of enslavement is complicated by the payment of wages . I suspect that some of the ambiguity of status that arises in various places in this work is connected to the question of naming , since here , as in- some- other- contexts , " slave " and " black " came to be interchangeable . Some of this ambiguity in naming no doubt arises in turn from ambiguity in relationships of dependence , descent , and clientage , and militates for a conceptual vocabulary that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book , El Hamel embraces the complex , variegated situation that his sources tend to suggest , and- it is wonderful to be able to raise these questions in the first place , which would simply not be possible without this book . 
@@40786753 @786753/ <p> The Lie of the Land is an excellently titled book . Its eleven essays probe science and policy based on unfounded narratives of environmental degradation--a " lie of the land " in a new sense . Alarmist accounts of environmental change are a tendency in some environmental thinking. 1 In colonial Africa , fears of environmental decline grew up among the scientists and policy makers who had the authority to act against " irrational " and " wasteful " African land use . In independent Africa fears of crisis and interventionist policies continued , sustained by governments , scientists and international aid agencies . This volume , edited by Melissa Leach and Robin Mearns , shows how such fears could be poorly grounded . <p> These essays consider the explication of environmental degradation as " received wisdom , " an " orthodoxy , " a " narrative " or the " mainstream . " References to Thomas Kuhn appear in several chapters , and the book intends to promote an alternative paradigm in African environmental studies . The conclusions are convincing ( and may be surprising to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those concerned with colonial science , African environmental history and development policy . <p> Social and natural scientists have questioned degradationist narratives before now. 2 There are two themes in such thinking , that environmental change is not necessarily degradation , and that African farmers and herders are not the wastrels of stereotype ; rather they intervene in environmental processes to benefit their production . <p> This book brings together case studies which reinforce these points , but its more original contribution is to problematize the " received wisdom " of environmental crisis in Africa . The first chapter , " Environmental Change and Policy : Challenging Received Wisdom in Africa " ( pp. 1-33 ) , by the editors , introduces the critique of degradationist narratives as received wisdom . Thinking which casts Africans as perpetrators and victims of environmental change has obscured other views , and the essay explores how this has been possible . The result is a consideration of the production of knowledge and how it relates to power . Here , the received wisdom was based on scientific authority , even while it lacked scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having authority and skills to act upon its conclusions , they also had an interest in sustaining degradationist thinking . Finally , the media spread the alarm . Left out of the discourse , ( as understood by Foucault ) were the people who lived and worked in these environments . <p> The following chapters develop these ideas in case studies of many aspects of the environment--soil , water , vegetation , wildlife , forests . The essays typically explore how mainstream thinking developed , how anecdotal evidence took on powerful argumentative force and what factors entrenched poor science and inappropriate policy . They then suggest alternative understandings of the ecological issues , and different priorities for policy . Especially recommended are the chapters by Swift , Fairhead and Leach , Stocking , Tiffen , and Hoben . <p> Chapters Two through Five explore the situation with regards to pastoralists , probably the group who have been considered the most destructive . Ian Scoones 's chapter " Range Management Science and Policy " ( pp. 34-53 ) looks at the history of scientific range management in Zimbabwe . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock limitation and rotational grazing , policies whose success he questions . He lays out how climax-based grazing science became so influential and provides an accessible introduction to arrange science of disequilibrium which challenges these ideas. 3 The next chapter outlines a different relation between degradationist thinking and political power , for the degradation is said to have occurred in the South Africa Karoo , home to white sheep farmers . In " Soil Erosion , Animals and Pasture over the Longer Term " ( pp. 54-72 ) William Beinart considers the case of the Karoo , a semi-arid region , which is popularly held to have encroached onto grassland because of abusive farming. 4 Beinart 's contribution is to show that the historical forces which could have supported Karoo expansion have not always been in place . He also shows how accounts of degradation can serve the political left , for activists against apartheid used alarmist accounts of environmental change . <p> " Desertification : Narratives , Winners and Losers " ( pp. 73-90 ) , by Jeremy Swift , offers a treatment of scientific and governmental response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : desertification . Swift shows how arguments about desertification rested upon questionable uses of data and a conflation of separate processes of change . Politics also played a role here , for concern about degradation strengthened the hand of national governments , development agencies and scientists ( the " winners " of his title ) . The received wisdom of progressive desertification has given way to more nuanced views , which Swift hopes will promote policies friendlier to local farmers and herders ( the " losers " of his title ) . The last chapter on herding , " Wildlife , Pastoralists and Science " ( pp. 91-104 ) by Daniel Brockington and Katherine Homewood , looks at the Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania . They deftly refute the stereotype of irrational pastoralists destroying the commons and give a concise table contrasting the received wisdom and alternative views about pastoralists and parks . <p> The next two chapters are about forests and people 's impact upon them . Readers should take note of " Rethinking the Forest-Savanna Mosaic " ( pp. 105-21 ) by James Fairhead and Melissa Leach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Landscape. 5 Their argument is that the " forest islands " in the savanna of Guinea are not remnants of a wider forest cover , but that the islands are created and sustained through human action . Their work shows that colonial science was based on assumptions rather than evidence of the earlier wide cover . Their historical research shows that forests have not diminished and their fieldwork reveals how people promote tree cover . Yet they show how intellectual , social , political and financial structures have sustained the image of a half-empty savanna . They close with an interpretation of the landscape based upon an ecology of disturbances rather than equilibrium . The chapter by Reginald Cline-Cole " Dryland Forestry : Manufacturing Forest and Farming Trees in Nigeria " ( pp. 122-39 ) contrasts " expatriate " and " indigenous " forestry systems . Expatriate forestry , first promoted by none other than Frederick Lugard , separates forests from farmland and pasture and also regulates uses in each context . In contrast , the indigenous system involves multiple uses . The chapter evaluates the failings of expatriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come or may yet come together . <p> The next two chapters consider very basic elements : water and soil . " Soil Erosion : Breaking New Ground " by Michael Stocking ( pp. 140-54 ) is a lively discussion of six myths of soil erosion . Stocking presents and convincingly refutes widely accepted truths about erosion , such as " gullies are the worst , " " vegetation protects " and " soil conservation is the answer . " This chapter is the volume 's best introduction to the alternative non-degradationist thinking . W. A. Adams 's essay " Irrigation , Erosion and Famine , " ( pp. 155-67 ) sets out to consider indigenous knowledge as incorporated into received wisdom . He looks at the Kerio Valley in Kenya , where colonial officials were impressed with pre-existing irrigation works , yet all the same intervened into local land use . Actually , indigenous knowledge does n't differentiate the received wisdom here from the other cases . <p> The last two chapters in the volume are not about theories of environmental degradation , but about how the politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Land and Capital : Blind Spots in the Study of the ' Resource-Poor ' Farmer " ( pp. 168-85 ) Mary Tiffen , a co- author of More People Less Erosion returns to the Machakos District of Kenya to consider non-environmental resources , land ownership and capital , and how development research can be blind to these needs and how people fill them . The problem stems from the structure of development agencies and the fashions of development . As other writers have stressed that African farmers have well-adapted farming techniques , she argues that they have resources unrecognized by experts . Furthermore , farmers have the skills to invest wisely . The closing essay by Allan Hoben is most disturbing . " The Cultural Construction of Environmental Policy : Paradigms and Politics in Ethiopia " ( pp. 186-208 ) considers the development policy before and after the 1985 Ethiopian famine , a true catastrophe which stands out from the false alarms in the rest of the book . He describes how national and international political forces gave legitimacy to a Malthusian narrative that soil erosion reduced agricultural production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conserve trees and soil , and also the poverty and repression which created hunger . Sadly , this received wisdom motivated a great effort towards soil reclamation after 1985 , which Hoben says was wasted or worse , detrimental . <p> This volume challenges social and natural scientists as well as development planners to question their assumptions , to check whether their narratives echo received wisdom . The volume gives no easy formula for escaping the trap , 7 but the writers are not cynical . Throughout the volume non-equilibrium ecology ( which is based on theories that natural systems are not directed towards a self-regulating climax state ) , empirical historical research and indigenous knowledge are offered as correctives . Furthermore , the writers promote an attitude that decision-making must become more inclusive . Barring that , those who have power to comment upon African farmers and to intervene in their work must , as Tiffen puts it , " fight their inclination to nanny . There will always be the unskilful or the unfortunate , who need special help , but they should not be conceived as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by the empirical evidence that Maasai herders have not threatened the survival of game , that villagers in Guinea 's forest-savanna mosaic have not ravaged their woods , and that Machakos farmers have conserved their soil . <p> Yet , are there no environmental concerns ? Scattered through the volume are references to issues which some writers consider to be problems . ( See for example , pp. 86 , 142-43 , 189 ) . Michael Stocking 's treatment of soil erosion is indicative of the new thinking . While he disputes the myth that gullies represent serious erosion , he admits that sheet erosion removes more soil than is sometimes recognized . This essay does not address under what conditions sheet erosion is a problem , or how to slow it . In fact , he practically discourages such questions : <p> " Of course , in many places erosion is bad ; crops yields are crashing ; land is being abandoned ; people are migrating ; and a cycle of degradation is commencing on marginal lands as population pressure is transferred . However , to claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evidence from Machakos district in Kenya citing More People , Less Erosion shows indisputably that erosion may be a passing phase in a farming landscape , during a transition to different land uses , higher populations and new technologies . In these terms , erosion may be good , if it forces populations to adjust " ( p. 154 ) . <p> " Universal links of cause and effect " is too simplistic , but it is legitimate to ask at what point environmental change degrades human livelihoods and threatens biodiversity . Perhaps it might be advisable to provide assistance during the adjustment to new land uses . Intensification can involve more restricted access to resources , and poorer people can lose their livelihoods . Erosion may not always be bad , but " adjustment " is not always neutral . This volume has given its attention to refuting the received wisdom of alarm rather than giving positive answers to the question of how to evaluate environmental change . In less principled circles , this could support tendencies toward denial and opportunism .

Rafuse ( Department of History , United States Military Academy ) Published on H-South ( January , 2002 ) <p> Race , Gender , and the Contested Memory of the Free State of Jones <p> Race , Gender , and the Contested Memory of the Free State of Jones <p> In her new book , Victoria E. Bynum demonstrates that our knowledge of Mississippi 's legendary Free State of Jones , like so much else associated with the Civil War that has inspired contention and controversy , has been shaped as much by the agenda of those who have attempted to tell the story as by actual events . This much is known : in the fall of 1863 , in the Piney Woods region of southern Mississippi , Confederate deserters led by Newton Knight organized an anti-Confederate guerrilla band that eventually dominated its community and , according to legend , proclaimed Jones County 's independence from the Confederacy . To deal with the Jones County rebellion , Confederate authorities dispatched two cavalry expeditions into the region that launched devastating attacks upon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserters . After the war , members of the Knight Company participated in Reconstruction politics and a mixed-race community emerged with Captain Knight as the focal point . <p> Beyond this , the record is more muddled . An 1880 courthouse fire destroyed records that could have shed light on the subject . Prominent accounts of the Free State of Jones , such as James Street 's novel Tap Roots ( 1943 ) , which was made into a 1948 movie , two books by children of Newt Knight , and a 1984 study by Rudy Leverett , offer significantly different takes on the virtues and motives of " Captain Newt " , his followers , and the Free State of Jones . To Street and Thomas J. Knight , whose book The Life and Activities of Captain Newton Knight was published in 1935 , Newt and his followers were gallant , principled defenders of a community that had had enough of the Confederacy and its " rich man 's war but poor man 's fight . " Aware of the racial sensibilities of Southern readers , however , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the postwar mixed-race community over which he presided . <p> In her The Echo of Black Horn ( 1951 ) , however , Ethel Knight made the miscegenation issue a central one in order to discredit her father . Published as a response to the release of Tap Roots and her brother 's work , Ethel Knight 's book portrayed her father and his company as traitors to their community , their race , and the Lost Cause who were motivated merely by greed and the prospect of plunder . In Legend of the Free State of Jones , the first book on its subject to be published by an academic press , Leverett , a descendent of one of Newt Knight 's victims , echoed Ethel 's portrayal of the Knight Company as a criminal band that victimized good , law-abiding southerners . <p> In The Free State of Jones , Bynum , a professor of history at Southwest Texas State University whose " ancestors were deeply involved on both sides of the conflict " in Mississippi 's Piney Woods , provides a balanced and compelling chronicle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mixed-race community ( xi ) . Bynum skillfully connects the story and those who have endeavored to tell it to broader social , cultural , and political developments . Bynum demonstrates that underlying the story were enduring conflicts over race , gender , and class in southern society that traced back to before the American Revolution . She illustrates how , in the first round of a long struggle to defend their yeoman society against the encroachments of a slave-based commercial economy , ancestors of the Knight Company were active in the Regulator Movement of the 1760s and 1770s . They then carried an antiauthoritarian impulse west to Mississippi , along with a healthy republican suspicion of wealthy planters . <p> Bynum skillfully examines how experiences on the raw southwestern frontier before , during , and after the War of 1812 further fostered an egalitarian spirit , distrust of the wealth of slaveholders , and a sense of nationalism among the families who would ride with Captain Knight . Between the founding of Jones County in 1826 and the Civil War , however , slaveholding families increasingly became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reflect a widening " gulf between this region 's nonslaveholding yeomanry and a rising class of slaveholding farmers , planters , and merchants . " ( 69 ) Especially insightful is Bynum 's description of how these divisions were further fueled by conflicts over religion , particularly efforts by the slaveholding cultural elite to use the Leaf River Church to promote their ideal of true womanhood . Issues of gender and the critical role women played in supporting the Knight Company are continual themes in Bynum 's analysis . <p> Then came secession , war , and conscription , which most Jones County men , including Newt Knight , initially submitted to . Adding to a continually growing body of scholarship that documents significant class conflict in the wartime South , Bynum demonstrates how by late 1862 resentment of conscription among nonslaveholding yeoman families , and particularly toward exemptions for slaveholders contained in the " Twenty Negro Law , " had grown to the point that desertion became a major problem . After suffering through the siege and surrender of Vicksburg , so many from the Jones County region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area to deal with the problem . The murder of the Confederate officer responsible for the effort to round up deserters , allegedly by Newt Knight himself , in October 1863 led to the formation of the Knight Company and touched off civil war along the Leaf River . <p> After her excellent description of the broader forces and specific events that provoked Jones County 's inner civil war , Bynum offers an intriguing analysis of how women and slaves contributed to the Knight Company 's operations , the factors that shaped their efforts , and how memories of their roles reflected postwar agendas -- providing further evidence of the critical links between military operations and the social context within which they take place . This analysis continues through Bynum 's compelling account of the cavalry raid of Colonel Robert Lowry into the Jones County region and the efforts of the Knight Company , with the assistance of their female and slave allies , to defend their community from Lowry 's operations . <p> The clash between Jones County 's yeomanry and the rest of Mississippi 's white power structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Knight Company and their supporters expected to play a prominent role in the postwar South . Knight and his men entered politics and , Bynum points out , began the process of shaping the memory of the Free State of Jones by staking their claim to leadership on an image of themselves as heroic defenders of their yeoman community against an illegitimate Confederate government . Bitter pro-Confederate Mississippians , as part of their campaign to redeem the South , attacked this image of the Jones County deserters and instead portrayed the Knight Company as a band of degraded poor whites for whom the war had simply provided an opportunity to indulge their proclivity toward lawlessness and violence . Although the question of Reconstruction was ultimately settled , Bynum shows that Mississippi 's " redemption " did not eliminate class conflict within Jones County , as sons of Knight Company members would play prominent roles in Populism . <p> As the conflict over the Knight Company 's memory and the role of its members in Mississippi politics raged , Newt Knight added another twist to the story by establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former slave named Rachel , and the children he fathered with both women . How this community survived and prospered and the trials ( literal and figurative ) its descendants endured as they lived their lives within the racial order of the post-Reconstruction and twentieth-century South is a fascinating story , and one that Bynum tells with skill and perceptiveness . <p> This is a work of value to anyone with an interest in the interplay of race , gender , and class in Southern history . However , military historians will be disappointed that Bynum did not devote more attention to the Knight Company 's operations . They may also wish Bynum had attempted something in the way of comparative analysis that would place the operations of the Knight Company in the context of guerrilla operations in the Civil War in general , an aspect of the war that has received increased attention from Civil War scholars in recent years . Others may finish the book wishing that Bynum had devoted a bit more space to the political maneuvering that led to the proclamation of Jones 's County 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . Overall , this is an excellent book and Bynum deserves much praise for her ability to negotiate the minefield of myth and legend to produce a study that not only makes a tremendous contribution to scholarship but is a compelling read as well . Thoroughly researched , thoughtfully argued , well written , and unfailingly interesting , Bynum 's work further demonstrates the potential of local studies to she 'd light on broader forces that have shaped the American past . It deserves attention from those interested in the Free State of Jones , the Civil War in history and memory , and the enduring impact of race , class , and gender on Southern history .

Representation of Places : Reality and Realism in City Design , makes ample use of this experience to examine the role of simulation technologies in urban planning , and to illustrate the techniques and professional roles of the group of planners whom he calls " simulators . " A suite of three case studies undertaken by the ESL demonstrates the use of computer modeling to predict the effects of development on a host of environmental and experiential factors that affect the users of urban spaces forms the centerpiece of this richly illustrated text ; they were originally presented to local decision-making bodies evaluating the planned development in New York 's Times Square Theater District ( 1985 ) , San Francisco 's Mission Bay and downtown area ( 1984 ) , and downtown Toronto from the edge of the existing downtown to Lake Ontario ( 1990 ) . The primary purpose of these studies is to represent aesthetic effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ESL also calculated such environmental factors as downdrafts off skyscraper ( using wind tunnels ) and sunlight obstruction ( a polar grid superimposed on a fish-eye photograph of the sky from mid-block at noon allowed that calculation ) . Combined with information on a city 's average temperature , humidity , and wind velocity , street-level conditions can be read against " bioclimatic charts " ( reproduced on p. 141 ) to determine the effect of construction on the comfort of " a person dressed in a business suit , taking a leisurely walk in the shade " ( p. 140 ) . This central section of the text is well-focused and informative , although I did on occasion wish for a closer relationship between words and images and for explanations of notations in the illustrations and charts . <p> The review of ESL projects is situated between an opening section that recounts the history of professional representations of urban space and the search for new visual-verbal languages that will prove more efficient information delivery systems , and a final section that is primarily concerned with the new technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technical specifications for accurate visual representation , a review of a simulation project undertaken by the ESL for the California Department of Transportation to solicit reaction from Bay-Area residents to different densities of residential development in areas near rail stations ( marred somewhat by an error in tabulation that distorts the results1 ) , and a chapter that reflects on the professional obligations of urban simulators . That chapter is particularly relevant to the overall plan of the book because subtextually Representation of Places is a story of triumphant progressivism . Cast as " providers of objective information , not policy advisers " who maintain " a neutral stance toward the parties in a dispute " ( p. 201 ) , simulation professionals carry the day against interested parties in " the adversarial context of city design and planning " ( p. xiv ) ; new techniques are cause for " professional optimism " ( p. 176 ) . <p> Notwithstanding its undoubted wider appeal as an historical introduction to urban representation , Bosselmann intends Representation of Places " primarily for urban designers , architects , and landscape architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they do " ( p. xiv ) . " Concrete " seems a curious term to describe computer models of hypothetical developments , and it is part of a larger problem with terminology in this volume . He uses that adjective regularly to describe . While many of the factors studied by the ESL are material and measurable , visual experience is the touchstone to which the title 's key terms all refer . Typically , " reality " means how a building appears or will appear to a viewer located at some point in urban space . Therefore , " realism " names the goal of physical or digital models faithfully and objectively to represent , or to predict these factors ; the best representations are " complete , accurate , engaging , detailed and true to the sense of those who will experience the designs once they are built " ( p. 199 ) . <p> Bosselmann might object to my assertion that his concept of experience is thus circumscribed . To be sure , his brief Introduction avows " the richness and complexity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the word ' places ' broadly in all its dimensions--physical , social , psychological , economic , and political " ( pp. xiii , xiv ) . But he does so only in fits and starts . More often , he seems to follow Kevin Lynch 's method in The Image of the City , making " his first order of business what might be called ' public images , " and leaving " individual differences , interesting as they might be , to a psychologist " ( Lynch , p. 7 ) . Bosselmann avers that " the thoughts of those viewing the information may differ greatly because viewers examine what they see in relation to their own concerns " directly after enumerating engagement and truth to experience as qualities of successful representation ( p. 199 ) and he finds " most innovative " Camillo Sitte 's conviction that " urban places respond to the inhabitants ' psychic state sic " ( p. 35 ) , which I take to mean something along the lines of the power of buildings to affect mental states. 2 But he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social and psychological dimensions of place . Quite the opposite ; Bosselmann repeatedly returns to the question of how a particular pattern of development would appear to an objective eye viewing it from some point on the city 's sidewalks ( e.g. : pp. 112 , 122 , 126-27 , 137 , 170-71 ) . We might say , then , that the simulator 's reality is deficient by design . <p> In the first and third sections , Bosselmann is at his best when he is discussing mapping techniques and their history . The opening chapters frame a distinction between " Concept and Experience " as " Two Views of the World " ( p. 2 ) that have dominated the representation of urban space in the West since the Renaissance . Leonardo da Vinci 's plan view ( or ichnographic representation ) of the Italian town of Imola first represented a city as an abstract form , not as the sum of its important structures or as a fragment of a larger space viewable from a single position within the urban space . The plan view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a map could imagine the city as a system " ( p. 22 ) and conceive the means to manipulate its parts in order to achieve desired effects . The polar opposite of the apprehension of the city as system , the representation of individual experience , is brilliantly instanced in Brunischelli 's trompe l'oeil exercise in linear perspective , a view of the Baptistery and Piazza del Duomo from the main portal of Florence 's Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore . Viewers looked through a small hole in the painting , believing it a portal to the city itself ; what they actually saw was the painting reflected in a mirror. 3 <p> The rest of this chapter and the two that follow describe refinements of these techniques and attempts to combine them in order to render the visual experience of an engaged viewer . Multiple-point perspective may be used to make the viewer seem " part of the picture because with every move of the eyes a correct perspective is seen " ( p. 9 ) . Sitte and Lynch are praised less for their inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their innovations in representation , Sitte 's " insistence on a three-dimensional survey of urban form " that compounds the abstract and experiential representational forms , and Lynch 's attempt at a " unified " visual and written language in a diagram that charts patterns for future development on the several terrains of Martha 's Vineyard ( reproduced on p. 46 ) . The Martha 's Vineyard project , which concludes the second chapter , demonstrates the potential for new forms of " professional representation " ( p. 47 ) to convey considerable planning detail to non-specialists . Neither perspective nor plan , Lynch 's diagram of is not even representation per se ; its presentation is devoid of any visual correspondence to the Vineyard 's geography . <p> On account of their collective nature and their ability to register the effects of class , race , or other group affiliation on the perception of urban space , Lynch 's " cognitive maps " deserve more study . Described as " essential to people 's actual functioning and important to their emotional well-being " ( Bosselmann , p. 42 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban landscapes offer an alternative to the poles of single-point perspective and plan view . Because they show how people who navigate urban space everyday represent structure to themselves , they may be said to convey how the city functions . More importantly , these maps are capable of representing differences in the experience of urban space by members of different racial or socio-economic groups , which adds texture to our image of the social and economic " reality . " A series of " citizen images " of Los Angeles drawn by residents of several urban and suburban neighborhoods as part of a City of Los Angeles Planning Department study of The Visual Environment of Los Angeles ( pp. 9-11 ) revealed stark differences that , given the volume 's political function , the authors of the study did not pursue .

Whyte undertook on pedestrian activity in New York , Gehl 's work ( or Bosselmann 's representation of it ) makes no distinctions among urban types , as Whyte did . Bosselmann 's interest lays in the use of these studies for " designing permanent , expanded pedestrian networks in other cities " ( p. 45 ) , but we never learn how successful the transfer of the model to other cities has been or what changes had to be made , given social , cultural and climatological differences among cities . Certainly , the annals of planning are filled with examples of such failed transfers . It would be interesting to learn what economic and social factors ( p. 44 ) , in addition to the climate and the distribution of objects in space , determine the success or failure of public space projects . Here again , map of " citizen images " likely can tell us a lot about those three key determinants of such projects ' success : location , location , and location . <p> Leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chapter on " Images in Motion . " The destination of this excursus is clear enough , the virtual urban realities that the ESL began producing in the early 1970s . We read a history of that undertaking , the labor that went into the creation of a virtual " view from the road " and the problems it encountered , such as the camera 's narrow field of vision , cornering that viewers found too abrupt , virtual structures that were too uniformly new . The bulk of the chapter , however , is devoted to a different sort of attempt to represent motion through space . Combining representations of " experience " and " concept , " Bosselmann creates a series of drawings that record what he saw on a regular walk through Venice , a path also represented as a dotted line on an ichnographic projection of that part of the city ( pp. 54-60 ) . This presentation is followed by a series of fourteen other ichnographic maps with walks of equivalent length marked on them , accompanied by captions that record the itinerary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed in comparison with his Venetian stroll . <p> The series of maps is at once too much and too little . Too much because they covered twenty-eight pages ( a map on one page and a brief paragraph alone on the facing page ) . Too little because the essential point is that walks seem to take more or less time depending on the diversity of the scenery ( p. 91 ) ; ichnographic projections do little if anything to prove this point , which is both intuitively obvious and on the evidence of this chapter not susceptible of objective representation . After all , the qualities of a built landscape that engage a particular stroller will vary greatly among individuals and classes . The choice of itineraries in the other cities is also curious ; certainly , San Francisco offers quarters with a visual complexity closer to the Venetian experience than the chosen trip from the lobby of the St. Francis Hotel across Union Square Park to the Circle Gallery ( pp. 64-65 ) . Finally , while it may be true that " Western art traditionally represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with it ... in the upper portions of pictures " ( pp. 50-51 ) , placing the past at the bottom of the canvas , the fact makes reading the strips from bottom to top of seven successive pages no easier . Indeed , why should Bosselmann bow to convention when he seeks an improved realism and when E. H. Gombrich ( mistakenly identified in the text as " Erich Gombrich " ( p. 187 ) showed us years ago , ( Art and Illusion , pp. 68-74 ) , how convention has functioned in urban representation as a barrier to " realistic " representation ? <p> Bosselmann 's conclusion from these experiences , that designers in fact " have remarkable power to affect the perception of time by arranging objects in space , by setting dimensions , designing textures , selecting colors , and manipulating light " ( p. 91 ) , seems at once a logical consequence of the research and an overstatement . Manipulation of the listed variables seems equally a recipe for an unrewarding experience of " postmodern " superficiality . I particularly wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing in the built landscape , the visual and cognitive traces of actual history that designers are powerless to simulate . The question for the designer might instead be to imagine ways of not creating an ensemble . Years ago , Lynch suggested that because " the city is not built for one person but for great numbers of people , of widely varying backgrounds , temperaments , occupations , and class , " that urban environments must be diverse , non-specialized , and plastic ( pp. 110-11 ) . More recently , Richard Sennett contrasted " places full of time " with New York 's Battery Park City , which " is planned according to the present enlightened wisdom about mixed uses and diversity " ( p. 193 ) but is too much a whole to allow striking variation or anything unpredictable . Someone interested in the subjective experience of time should compare the experience of duration on a city street , a typical mall , and the Universal CityWalk , which represents an extreme manipulation of visual variables . <p> I do think that Representation of Places would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the issues it raises with respect to the subjective experience of time and space and the epistemological foundations of environmental simulation . Bosselmann could have done so without making the book that much longer ( or larger , considering the number of full-page illustrations and the amount of white space on many pages ) . He might have spent more reflection on words like " reality , " " realism , " and " representation , " 4 particularly because the questioning of these terms ( in the social sciences and the humanities , anyway ) makes problematic the " neutrality of position " that he recommends to simulation professionals . In what sense is a presentation " neutral , " instead of more or less persuasive ? How does one distinguish professional neutrality from a " neutrality of values--that would be neither possible nor desirable " ( p. 201 ) ? Bosselmann writes as if the politics of disinterest had not been problematized . Venice and power .

@@40786763 @786763/ <p> How do we explain and interpret the rise of English experimental philosophy that occurred during the seventeenth century ? This question has inspired some of the best writing on the period , going back at least as far as Charles Webster 's The Great Instauration , and has become , if anything , more relevant with the erosion of scholarly confidence in the notion of the scientific revolution . Barbara Shapiro 's book will certainly contribute to the debate , for it is a complex and engaging story of the gradual construction of a culture of fact , from the early sixteenth century when the word ' fact ' was occasionally used in the law courts and historical writing to refer primarily to human acts , through the Restoration , when it became central to many discourses , and referred to both human acts and to the natural world . This is a timely book , coming onto the scene as many modern scholars question the existence of a fact free from theory , and when social constructionists argue that truth , including the truth about facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies significantly from time to time and place to place . While respectful of the innovative work of Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer which established the importance of the notion of the " matter of fact " in Restoration natural philosophy , Shapiro 's work challenges some of their key arguments. 1 <p> Shapiro rounds up the usual suspects here , Bacon , Boyle , Newton , Hook , Oldenberg , and others , but her real characters are not so much individuals as six " discourses of fact " which serve as her chapter topics . The first and most important of these is the English legal tradition . Perhaps the most original contribution of the book is her argument that the law was the earliest and most influential factor in establishing a culture of fact , and that natural philosophy only later adopted the notion . The common law clearly distinguished between " matters of fact " and " matters of law , " with the former being the province of the jurors and the latter of the judges . Coke was fond of quoting the Latin maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non respondent juratores ( judges do not respond to matters of fact and jurors do not respond to matters of the law ) . Charged with determining the truth and forced to consider the credibility of evidence and , by the end of the sixteenth century , of the testimony of witnesses , jurors helped to define a set of standards for judging the veracity of assertions . <p> Once established in law , the notion of factuality began to influence other areas of English life such as historical writing . Shapiro notes several important lawyer-historians of the period , including Bacon , Clarendon , and Seldon . Though history had long been associated with both fiction and rhetoric , there was still a fundamental conviction that it ought to be concerned with finding the truth of events as they occurred , a conviction that Shapiro sees as gaining depth during the seventeenth century as historians acquired more sophistication in evaluating eye-witness accounts , historical documents , and material objects . <p> After law and history , Shapiro then considers travel writing and chorography . Works like Stowe 's Survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of county histories , fall into this genre . Later , the Royal Society would draw up guidelines for " inquiries into foreign parts " which would find their way into the Philosophical Transactions , forming part of a larger plan to collect accurate information about societies from the far reaches of the globe . Another discourse of fact was the popular genre of news , and its fascination with marvels and wonders . Though the English generally lagged behind the continent in the publishing of news reports , the tremendous increase in publication associated with the breakdown in censorship during the Civil Wars helped close the gap . The growing news media are important to Shapiro 's story . After the Restoration , they , along with the chorographical works , " treated both human affairs and natural phenomena as facts , thus fostering the shift of ' fact ' from the older legal and historical meaning of human deeds to a newer , more encompassing meaning " ( p. 104 ) . <p> It is only at this point , more than a hundred pages into the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , and the consolidation of the notion of a scientific fact . This is significant , because her view is that the legal tradition and the various discourses of fact had already prepared the way for the widespread acceptance of a culture of fact . Bacon , the lawyer-historian-natural philosopher was key in " transforming the ' human fact ' into the ' natural fact ' by applying the legal witnessing criteria to particular natural events and experiments " ( p. 137 ) . By asserting the primacy of Bacon over Boyle and by arguing that the culture of fact was well established before the Restoration , Shapiro challenges the chronology of Shapin and Schaffer . In her words , " as treated by Shapin and Schaffer , ' matter of fact ' is associated particularly with Boyle , and his predecessors and contemporaries are largely ignored " ( p. 142 ) . She then goes on to question their " gentlemanly thesis , " the notion that gentle status was the key factor in establishing scientific credibility and that the Royal Society reproduced the social status of seventeenth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyle from the common technician such as Hooke . Shapiro points out that many members of the Royal Society , clergymen , government officials , and physicians among them , would not have been considered gentlemen by contemporary standards . Moreover , she asserts that , while high social status was one factor that could and did enhance scientific credibility , " skill and experience played a greater role in the creation of the model of the scientific investigator than birth , and mutual trust and civility among investigators increased once fact moved beyond the contentious , self-interested setting of the court " ( p. 166 ) . <p> Shapiro then examines the way in which matters of fact played an increasingly important role in post-Restoration religious discourse . " Matters of fact " were used particularly by latitudinarian theologians to support a wide range of theological positions , including the accuracy of biblical accounts , natural theology , and various anti-Catholic arguments . In some ways this chapter seems out of keeping with the chronology of the rest of the book . While Shapiro is doubtless correct in asserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread the notion through the broader culture , by her account it had little to do with establishment of the notion itself . By contrast , Peter Dear has seen a more creative role for some theological ideas , arguing , for instance , that different attitudes towards miracles in French and Anglican theology helped to produce a fundamentally different view of experience . Religious propositions thus encouraged a culture of experimentation in England and a more deductive and mathematical scientific culture in France. 2 A final chapter looks to the eighteenth century and examines the role of John Locke in making more general the notion of fact and rigorously incorporating it into a broader philosophical theory of empiricism . <p> Like many historians , Shapiro has been intrigued by the research of the social constructionists without entirely accepting their methodology . While open to the argument that social groups establish and articulate notions of truth , she finds the internal cognitive development of the various discourses of fact to be of more importance in making the notion of " a matter of fact " a widely accepted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with the common law and their knowledge of the discourses and genres that she considers produced a sort of practical epistemology in the general culture , an epistemology that was neither generated completely by the gentle class nor limited to it . <p> This book is text-based without being focused on a few great texts . It is clearly aware of the social setting in which various claims to truth were articulated and yet it argues for the partial independence of truth claims from socio-economic conditions . It is concerned with the dissemination of ideas as well as the ideas themselves and yet clearly argues that it is possible to separate the two . ( In these respects it is akin to Andrew Wear 's recent Knowledge and Practice in English Medicine , 1550-1680 . ) As such , A Culture of Fact well represents the richness of contemporary cultural history . 
@@40786765 @786765/ <h> Kaufmann on Appiah , ' The Ethics of Identity ' <p> Reviewed by Eric Kaufmann ( Lecturer in Politics and Sociology , Birkbeck College , University of London ) Published on H-Nationalism ( June , 2006 ) <p> Kwame Anthony Appiah is very much a figure of our time . A Ghanaian immigrant of Ashanti and English ancestry , he is also a member of three other key " outsider " communities in America : gays , liberal Democrats and African Studies scholars . If the personal is the political , one would expect Appiah to make a perfect multiculturalist . But no multiculturalist can take solace from this book . Appiah 's sophisticated tour de force is sensitive to the bonds of community , but reads as a paean to John Stuart Mill , individual autonomy and the western Enlightenment . In short , this book demonstrates just how far the ethical goalposts have moved in the past decade . <p> Multiculturalism can mean several things . For many , it simply refers to the demographic fact of having many different cultural groups inhabiting one space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy which assigns rights , recognition and privileges to individuals differentially , based on their group membership . A final form of multiculturalism is ideological . The flipside of postmodernism , orthodox multiculturalism is offered as a relativistic political philosophy which emphasizes the toleration of non-western values ( even if illiberal ) and the preservation of traditional cultures . These are considered liberating and authentic when held against the dry backcloth of a globalizing western modernity . <p> The period from the late 1960s through the late 1990s represents multiculturalism 's high-water mark . During these decades , western populations became more diverse through increased immigration from non-white sources and the increased participation of repressed minorities in public life . Demographic fact soon led to public policy change as the " equal opportunities " focus of the early civil rights movement ( associated with Martin Luther King Jr. ) gave way to quota-based social programs , like affirmative action , and federal contract compliance in the early 1970s . Ethnic Studies Heritage programs , bilingual education and Afrocentric curricula followed in the 1970s and 1980s . Introduced into American life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racial minorities , most progressive thinkers sincerely believed that such programs were needed in order to further liberal goals . The civil rights agitation of black Americans also shaped ethnic minority movements from Northern Ireland to Quebec . Nationalism and ethnic identity , long associated with backwardness or reaction , were now seen as ingredients in the progressive oeuvre . Once again , politics influenced policy , and Canadian public policy embraced first " biculturalism " ( in 1966 ) and then " multiculturalism " in 1971 . These public policies involved recognizing the political autonomy of French and aboriginal Canadians , providing funding for the cultural activities of immigrant minorities and defining the nation 's identity as constituted by its diversity . In Europe , developments lagged somewhat behind , but by the 1970s and 1980s , most EC nations had moved beyond anti-racism to multiculturalism . Though policies differed by country , immigrant minorities were generally now part of the " multicultural " identity of their nation . Their collective rights to language and culture were often financially supported through grants to parallel ethnic/religious institutions , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The 1980s brought Reagan to power in America , and his five Supreme Court appointments of 1981-92 dealt a blow to the public policy advance of multiculturalism . The landmark City of Richmond v Croson ( 1989 ) case proved pivotal , with the new Rehnquist court striking down a 30 percent quota for minority contractors on a public project . Meanwhile , in just twenty years , the Official English movement made English Only the constitutional watchword in over half the states of the Union . State referenda which rejected affirmative action culminated in two 2004 Supreme Court cases involving the University of Michigan , which ruled out quotas and watered down the degree to which minorities can be favored in admissions policies . <p> Intellectual trends seemed to follow , rather than presage , political developments . Thus the political ferment of the sixties touched the imagination of postmodern social theorists like Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault in France . The older ideas of modernization , based on the Enlightenment touchstones of rationality , de-traditionalization and individualism were tarred with the brush of Eurocentrism , racism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassed and in their place a multiplicity of difference was to reign , even if--as with illiberal traditions--distasteful to the western palate . Postmodern ideas gained currency within the humanities and " softer " social sciences in universities throughout the West and dominated left-wing political thought . In political philosophy , the abstract liberal-egalitarianism of John Rawls 's Theory of Justice ( 1971 ) was subjected to a withering attack in the eighties and nineties by communitarians like Michael Walzer and Charles Taylor , and **25;401;TOOLONG like Will Kymlicka . <p> Appiah 's book enters this fray with a polished preface and , from then on , adroitly blends hair-splitting logic with literary verve and a cornucopia of examples from around the world . Appiah 's book will undoubtedly stand the test of time , distinguished by its elegant prose and insuperable thoroughness . Its first two chapters are mainly concerned with the idea of autonomy , namely that liberalism should be concerned not only with " negative " procedures to regulate behavior , but should promote a " positive " ideal to which we can aspire . This foregrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diversity and an Enlightenment liberalism which holds forth the ideal of the rational , emancipated individual . Appiah identifies John Stuart Mill as a bridge between these two species of liberalism , and the shadow of Mill haunts many parts of the book . Here Appiah seeks to rescue Mill 's reputation from the clutches of his communitarian critics , contending that Mill managed to balance the competing claims of autonomous choice and our diverse identities within his conception of individuality . <p> This is not to say that Appiah goes as far as Rawls . Far from doing so , Appiah accepts the importance of relationships and identities in constituting our individuality and criticizes the schizophrenic obsession with choice that can be found among existentialist thinkers . On the other hand , Appiah 's " peacemaking " account can veer toward stretching the concept of individuality to its breaking point in order to make it an inclusive club . For instance , Appiah introduces Kazuo Ishiguro 's character of Mr. Stevens the butler as an example of an unsung individuality simply because the man upholds received standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains to convince us that the stories of collectives like ethnic groups provide narrative models for us to enhance our individuality or that social opprobrium can lead us toward individuality . Even received wisdom is occasionally touted as superior to reasoning ! Will Kymlicka tried to provide a similar " win-win " solution to the liberal-communitarian dilemma by suggesting that cultures provide contexts whose options enhance rather than restrict individual choice . I am convinced by neither Kymlicka nor Appiah on this . Though one may agree with Appiah 's ontology , it may be more useful to work with a narrower definition of individuality and accept that there are real tradeoffs between individuality and community which individuals need to make . <p> Appiah 's work moves on to navigate the choppier waters of identity and here are some of the best chapters of the book . He argues that identities matter , but endorses what he calls " neutrality as equal respect " in which the state accommodates difference where it can , but is not bound to preserve particular cultures . Appiah takes Charles Taylor to task for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to violate the individual rights of non-French Quebeckers in order to preserve the French language . For Appiah , Taylor 's politics of recognition " gets things the wrong way round " and fails to appreciate the constructed and fluid nature of ethnic identity . Appiah 's next chapter on culture provides a much-needed corrective to the literature : for too long , normative political theory has conflated " culture " ( as a set of symbols , beliefs and practices ) with ethnic group--an identity which uses culture but is largely independent of it . This sleight-of-hand allows many multicultural theorists to weave liberalism into their arguments . Appiah neatly separates these two usages , drawing on an impressive array of cases from Africa to North America to illustrate his point that multiculturalists reify culture . At times , the tone is uncompromising , as with " you may indeed ensure that the dispossessed enjoy a stable and distinctive cultural community ... the most efficient method goes by the name of segregation " ( p. 127 ) , or " culture talk is not so far from race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then returns to questions of individuality which Mill mulled over in the mid-nineteenth century . In what promises to be a contentious chapter on " soul-making , " Appiah proffers his view that the state has a role to play in shaping the " souls " of its population . This may sound like a libertarian 's nightmare , but much of it goes on already under the guise of liberal education or safety guidelines which aim to make us think and behave more rationally and independently . Appiah suggests that illiberal groups should reform their practices to conform to liberal standards and individuals should be exposed to the virtues of autonomy , i.e. self-criticism , tolerance , dialogue , openness to change and self-control of one 's life . Certainly the state must respect people as they are , but it can legitimately try and improve them through a non-intrusive civic education . The book concludes with a call for a " rooted " cosmopolitanism , based on a common humanity which we express through shared understandings of narrative , local attachments and experience as much as through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Appiah correctly argues that most critiques of the Enlightenment ( i.e. , its Euro-centrism ) are really arguments that it was " insufficiently Enlightened " and hence can not sustain throwing the rationalist baby out with the racist bathwater . <p> Overall , Appiah 's work is impressive in the way it digests competing authors and debates to produce a streamlined defense of individuality which in turn exposes many of the fallacies of liberal multiculturalism . On the other hand , Appiah fails to lock horns with some of the thornier issues of affirmative action , assimilation , ethnic conflict regulation and civic nationalism . To excuse oneself from this charge , as Appiah does , by claiming the role of explorer , does not make the task any less urgent . There is also room for a legitimate communitarian counterattack . Appiah 's cosmopolitan background and easy acceptance of constructivist theories of ethnicity can blind him to the fact that many people are strongly attached to concrete ethnic boundary markers like language . They gain a measure of existential stability by believing in the intergenerational continuity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment to an ethnic proper name , is what underpins identity . It seems to me that any philosophy of individuality which takes community seriously needs to accept that the desire to preserve particular symbols in perpetuity need not be an illiberal illusion . <p> Whether you agree with Appiah or not , his work will stand as a magisterial contribution to political theory . This is a serious rebuke to multiculturalism which heralds the return of Enlightenment universalism to the center of western philosophy after a hiatus of more than thirty years .

@@40786772 @786772/ <h> Beilke on James T. Patterson , ' Brown v. Board of Education : A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy ' and Patterson , ' Brown v. Board of Education : A Civil Rights Milestone and its Troubled Legacy ' <p> This volume is the first in a series edited by David Hackett Fischer and James M. McPherson in which " each book will examine a large historical problem through the lens of a particular event and the choices of individual actors " ( p. xi ) . Judging by James T. Patterson 's book Brown v. Board of Education : A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy , the series is off to an impressive start . <p> The impending half-century anniversary of the decision rendered by the U.S. Supreme Court in the matter of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka invites a reconsideration of the themes of school integration , affirmative action , and the anticipated--but unrealized--ability of education to effect social change . Readers in search of a thick description of the Brown case should be directed to Richard Kluger 's definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Court in a singular decision , Patterson 's book is a political history of strategic decisions , court directions , and manipulation of the Court by opponents of the decision . Patterson examines broadly the primary events , actors , and social changes that coalesced around the decision itself including the end of Jim Crow , southern resistance , and black disillusionment . <p> Legal challenges to segregated schooling were originally directed toward graduate and professional education . That circumstance perhaps takes on added meaning in the wake of the recent decision in Grutter v. Bollinger ( 2003 ) , in which the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan 's use of affirmative action in its law school admissions program . In Missouri ex. rel . Gaines v. Canada ( 1938 ) , the first case to directly challenge school segregation , Lloyd Gaines petitioned the court for admission to the University of Missouri Law School . Ruling on the case , the Supreme Court upheld the precedent of " separate but equal " established by Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) . Although not specifically addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on the practice of southern states to meet the provision of " equality " by awarding out-of-state tuition scholarships to black students . In lieu of providing equal facilities , blacks were expected to use the scholarships to defray costs associated with attending northern institutions . Southern states universally ignored the Court 's ruling that the scholarships did not equalize the conditions . <p> During the 1940s , the legal arm of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) argued successfully for the admittance of blacks to white graduate schools in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education ( 1950 ) and Sweatt v. Painter ( 1950 ) . The NAACP subsequently turned its attention to public schooling at the elementary and secondary level due to , first , resignation on the part of blacks that whites would never grant equality , and second , the intransigence of white southerners . As Patterson points out , this decision did not have universal black support . A significant number of African Americans were less troubled by separate schools than by unequal schools . Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received an equal share of the school funds . <p> Consistent with its title , Patterson devotes much of the book to the legacy of Brown . An outgrowth of the case was a policy shift for the Court itself , whereby " the Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren would henceforth interpret the Constitution in light of changing circumstances , not as a fixed document whose meaning had always to be found in the intent of the Founding Fathers or of politicians in the 1860s " ( p. 69 ; a reference to " equal protection " under the Fourteenth Amendment ) . Another result was an orchestrated pattern of white resistance to the ruling through the intimidation of black students who attempted to enroll in all-white schools and the wholesale closing down of white school systems by southern governors . The most pervasive of these strategies was the use of " pupil placement " laws--a ruse to perpetuate segregated schools--that assigned students to schools on the basis of psychological and " academic " criteria such as morals , behavior , and health ( p. 100 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanes in response to political winds . During the 1960s , the presence of a coherent federal policy and the social ferment of the Civil Rights Movement influenced the Court to side with the black plaintiffs in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County , Va . In a sense , this decision placed a coda on the Brown decision by finally defining the meaning of " all deliberate speed " and thus significantly ending de jure racial segregation in southern and border states . As the Court membership shifted in the 1970s and 1980s , so did its ideological base . Populated by more conservative members , the Court began a systematic rollback of earlier court-ordered busing plans . In addition , reports by Daniel Patrick Moynihan and others began to lay the blame for black failure at the door of black families and communities rather than segregated schooling . As blacks continued to seek redress through the courts , whites fled to the suburbs , setting into motion a process of school resegregation bolstered by the persistent traditions of local control and a concomitant school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the legacies of the Brown decision is the use by both blacks and whites of school choice as a means of educational self-determination . <p> Although Patterson does not present a social-class analysis , resegregation is an economic as well as racial response to Brown . The plaintiffs in the major cases were members of the black bourgeoisie . Oliver Brown , for example , was a welder for a railroad company and a part-time assistant pastor . The graduate students , parents , and primary caregivers who pressed for school desegregation represented an emerging black middle class whose belief in education as a means of social mobility was unwavering . Likewise , social scientists will want to expand Patterson 's discussion of the use of social-scientific techniques ( Kenneth and Mamie Clark 's doll study ) . Deflecting the argument away from school segregation as apartheid , the argued link between integration and black self-esteem continues to be controversial . In the words of Zora Neale Hurston , " The whole matter revolves around the self-respect of my people . How much satisfaction can I get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not wish me near them ? " ( p. xxvii ) . And last , although education is at the heart of this case , it is not at the center of Patterson 's book . Educational historians may well wish for a more fulsome inclusion of black educational history , case studies of black schools , and narratives of black teachers and administrators who often lost their positions as the result of integration . <p> Thurgood Marshall , Earl Warren , and other architects of the decision believed that desegregation was an academic , social , and economic good ( p. 201 ) . Over the last fifty years , petitioners have lost faith in litigation as the means of ensuring educational equality . A half-century later , the question remains whether or not social change can be litigated . Patterson 's eminently readable book not only reminds us of the enduring tension between equality and meritocracy in the American democracy , but also questions the role and efficacy of education as an engine of social change . <p> Patterson 's book joins an expanding canon of works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irons , author of the book Jim Crow 's Children , include suggested readings on the subject. 2 Although scholars may be frustrated by Irons 's lack of citations to page numbers in his references , his narrative approach complements Patterson .

Eaton of the Harvard Project on School Desegregation. 3 Orfield and Eaton join Patterson and Irons in their assessment of Brown as an unfulfilled promise . 
@@40786774 @786774/ <p> The literature on gender relations in Latin America and the Caribbean offers abundant historical and contemporary evidence of women 's exploitation under prevailing patriarchal social formations . But an exhaustive catalog of the everyday exercise of male domination can not in itself reveal why women in any given society continue to endure their subordination or how and under what conditions some women mobilize , successfully or not , to redress their individual and collective predicaments . To elaborate such an understanding requires clarifying how gender , race , ethnicity , class , and nation interpenetrate , often in contradictory fashion , in the simultaneously local and global historical processes of their sociocultural , ideological , and political-economic transactions . <p> Throughout Latin American history , the economic roles of women and men respectively illustrate structural disparities that have conditioned gender values and ideology in everyday social practice to subvert women 's potential equality and autonomy . Variables of history , race , ethnicity , class , nationalism , and the effective sexual division of labor have produced distinct outcomes from one society to the next , but insofar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the systematic under-valuation of women and their work reinforces their material and ideological vulnerability as marginalized social , economic , and political actors . <p> This fact impinges most heavily upon poor women , whose need to work , as a matter of objective survival , entails diverse and invidious forms of exploitation , exacerbated by the constancy of women 's culturally prescribed domestic and reproductive responsibilities . The pressure to balance income production against labor-intensive domestic roles and to maintain one 's public reputation imposes severe constraints on women 's social and economic autonomy , and induces their ideological collusion to perpetuate the normative conditions of female subservience . Given systematic economic , political , and legal gender disadvantages , women 's accommodation to their subordinate cultural , socioeconomic , and political status is usefully approached by analyzing the survival value that their ideologically and historically conditioned behavior patterns confer within the prevailing societal matrix . <p> These observations are clearly borne out in Irma McClaurin 's ethnography , Women of Belize : Gender and Change in Central America , a contribution to Latin American women 's testimonial literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted cultural and historical crossroads . Belize ( a former British colonial enclave carved from the Caribbean littoral of Spanish imperial Yucatan and Guatemala ) remains enmeshed in an often antagonistic effort to reconcile its hybrid Anglo-African , Latin , and Amerindian cultural and social-historical pedigree with its Central American geopolitical destiny , and a growing economic and cultural dependence upon the United States . <p> Drawing on women 's life narratives , McClaurin explores how her subjects assign cultural and political meaning to their experiences , how changing self-understandings serve to refashion the social category " woman , " and how they work to alter the material conditions of women 's lives . She describes the culture of gender in terms of prevailing beliefs , values , and behaviors , and seeks to articulate how conventional and emergent understandings of gender roles , relations , and stereotypes inform women 's varied responses . Hence McClaurin 's work is a pioneering contribution that marks out the terrain for the future study of gender in Belize . <p> McClaurin 's initial interest was women 's grassroots organization , and , consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's sense of social isolation , creates new opportunities , and expands their cultural horizons , while also engendering new cultural and political challenges . But in a survey of some sixty participants in women 's groups and their awareness of Belizean public policy on women , McClaurin was taken with the personal insights of several especially eloquent respondents . These women she interviewed in depth , and " the three most articulate " narratives " form the core of this work . " McClaurin thus acknowledges that her ethnography is " biased toward women who are activists " ( p. 7 ) . <p> McClaurin 's analytical concern is with gender theory , oral narrativity , and ethnographic reflexivity . In her approach , the scrutiny of self in recitals of female transformation is intended to serve didactically as a means of individual and collective liberation . Rather than " an elaborate study of kinship , political institutions , systems of reciprocity , or the exotic ' Other , ' " McClaurin builds on narratives of " the individual lives of a few Belizean women . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sense that they make out of how the culture of gender in Belize is both constructed and lived " ( p. 9 ) . <p> The work comprises an eclectic blend of interviews , field-note transcriptions , ethnographic reflection , a survey of NGO and official reports on women 's status in Belize and the region , an interrogation of Belizean fiction , and the author 's own poetry . This is a reflexive , deeply personal , and politically engaged ethnography . As such it joins a long tradition of first-person narratives , especially by female anthropologists , written against the grain in a critique of the norms of positivist social science . In this era of postmodern scholarship the researcher 's self-positioning is obligatory , and McClaurin states her political position unapologetically : " In this work I do not pretend to be detached--I owe no allegiance to scientific objectivity . Instead I insist that in any fieldwork experience we are always involved , despite any posturing we may do to the contrary " ( p. 17 ) . <p> McClaurin 's experimental approach asserts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries between ethnography , fiction , and personal narrative are often difficult to perceive . As Kamala Visweswaran ( 1994 ) notes , anthropologists as diverse as Sapir , Kroeber , Malinowski , Boas , Benedict , Zora Neale Hurston , and Elsie Clews Parsons all experimented with narrative and fictional modes , establishing a little-noted tradition that persists into the present . McClaurin herself makes instructive use of the classic Belizean coming-of-age novel , Beka Lamb ( Edgell , 1982 ) to illustrate how young girls are socialized to domestic compliance , to examine " Creole " notions of gender respectability and sanctions against unwed motherhood , and to take note of women 's involvement in the Belizean nationalist movement . <p> But a deeper interrogation of Edgell 's novel would further elaborate the contradictory gender , racial , ethnic , class , and nationalist complexities of Belizean society and history . The country 's long and uneasy relationship with its Spanish-speaking neighbors ( dating from the seventeenth-century genesis of the Anglo-Spanish imperial regional struggle ) informs the vexed nature of ethnic discourse and cultural-nationalist politics into the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Zoila Ellis ( 1988 ) illustrates the multiple dimensions of women 's subordination in Belize , including such matters as Creole identity ( cf. Bolland , 1992 ) ; prevailing ideologies of feminine beauty ( cf. Wilk , 1993 ) ; sexuality and prostitution ( cf. Kane , 1993 ) ; race , class , and gender in the social context of domestic service ( cf. Moore , 1988 ) ; kinship and class ( cf. Smith , 1990 ) ; the supposed " Spanish " plague of machismo and the plight of Mestizo women ( cf. Ehlers , 1991 ) ; and the Guatemalan diplomatic impasse ( cf. Payne , 1990 ) , as each informs the social-historical construction of gender , race , and nation in Belize . <p> McClaurin is most interested in the narrative analysis of women 's difficult relationships with men , and women 's commentary on popular gender ideology and institutionalized forms of gender discrimination . Her research focus and approach preclude reflection on women who ( due to a variety of family , ethnic , and linguistic constraints ) do not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary insights into the culturally subordinate status of Mestizo women ( typically Spanish-speaking and of Mexican , Guatemalan , Honduran , or Salvadoran descent ) , and of Maya and Mennonite women ( the two most endogamous ethnic groups , and those least likely to be drawn into political activism ) . Collectively , these largely rural groups now comprise well over half the total Belizean population , so this ethnography of urbanized women who assert Creole , Garifuna , and East Indian ethnicity can not be taken as representative of the overall national situation , as McClaurin herself acknowledges . <p> McClaurin is candid regarding her research interests and methods , which predilections inevitably curtail other potentially productive investigative avenues . Compare Visweswaran , who suggests the value of a feminist ethnography keyed on analyzing women 's relationships with one another , and the inevitable power differential that conditions all such encounters . Such an approach she contrasts with feminist anthropology 's early positing of a universal sisterhood , which endowed an untenable position . To counterpoise a universal gendered or racial self against a dominant ( i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic integrity of cultural difference , and favors appropriation in the guise of an empathetic identification with and " rescuing " of subordinate voices . <p> The potency of McClaurin 's research relationships with the women she interviews can not be diminished , built as they were upon the parallel autobiographies ( e.g. , common issues of marriage , children , economic struggle , divorce , gender politics ) of the researcher and her subjects . But McClaurin overlooks the patent dimension of power in the amicable relationships she reports with her impoverished respondents , each of whom , it should be noted , is highly motivated to improve her individual situation . <p> Surely , McClaurin 's empathy and interest in the plight of women , her own status as a mother , her professional rank , her U.S. citizenship , and her potential as an employer position her as an ideal patron for many Belizeans . As she herself notes , Belizeans immigrate to the United States to work ( legally or illegally ) , and commonly , U.S. travelers and tourists invite Belizean women to come work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( acknowledged or not ) that McClaurin 's own status as a mother and U.S. professional will have stimulated in at least some of her field encounters . <p> Ethnography as " fables of rapport " ( the term is Visweswaran 's ) can mask how ethnic , racial , class , cultural , and national differences operate in the context of specific historical struggles to reproduce structural relations of domination , both between men and women , and between women of disparate origins . To downplay such palpable differences masks the inevitably unequal relationships between subjects ( including the anthropologist and her interlocutors ) , and sustains a dubious pretense of understanding that favors essentialist representation and the acute flattening of historical specificity and insistent cultural difference . <p> McClaurin 's deliberation of her own position as a researcher is also instructive as it informs a discussion of the ethnographer 's duality of status as an outsider who seeks an insider perspective . Regarding " the difficulty of finding a community that might allow an anthropologist to ' go native ' " ( which McClaurin regards as a decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my gender , I believe that my ' race ' /ethnicity was ... a significant factor in my fieldwork " ( pp. 14-15 ) . This favored " my acceptance by most Belizeans as a kindred spirit in a way they assured me could not happen for white anthropologists , no matter how empathetic they may be . " McClaurin attributes her entree to " being black in a country where people of African ancestry had dominated the population " ( p. 15 ) . Such essentialist assertions of cross-cultural insider status would benefit from a perusal of Zora Neale Hurston 's work in Jamaica ( cf. also Narayan , 1993 and Visweswaran , 1994 ) . <p> Notwithstanding , every ethnographer will recognize the emotional buoyancy of this singular fieldwork moment , the flush of cross-cultural " arrival , " the symbolic conferral of honorary native membership . But concurrent claims of ethnographic authority and other-identification are problematic for any anthropologist invested in the concept of cultural relativism , and the radical proposition that all human difference is culturally ( not naturally ) endowed , and socially prosecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racial and ethnic relations in Belize . The legacy of African slavery , a deliberate policy of fostering a diverse immigrant labor force , and the conscious crafting of a complex and contradictory racial aesthetic and ethnic hierarchy rooted in the colonial experience demand careful deliberation in order to avoid conflating the usefully distinct concepts of race and ethnicity . <p> " Race " ( a common human fixation on classifying sociocultural groups on the basis of physical characteristics , with an implicit premise of racial inferiority and superiority ) is not a self-evident quality . It is a sociocultural artifact inscribed in the folk taxonomies of particular societies , cultures , and histories . Ethnicity entails a broader human classificatory principle of a self-prescribed or externally ascribed combination of endogamy and common descent , place of origin , language , religion , and phenotype . So ethnicity may ( but does not always ) draw on conceptions of " race " in the social construction of identity , but in a more encompassing and culturally " coherent " way . <p> The validity of " race " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its everyday usage in ethnic discourse endures to fuel tenacious forms of racism . And precisely because racial classifications persist in popular practice , the analytical challenge remains to interrogate the historical and geographical specificity of their emergence , and to understand racism 's power to collate tenacious ethnic divisions in any given society , and to complicate other gender , class , and status differences . <p> Certainly , U.S. varieties of racism , the culturally and historically specific product of an involuntary hemispheric African Diaspora , remains a harsh reality . But racism takes its own particular forms in Belize , and " race " assumes different specific meanings as well , meanings which may well elude the easy comprehension of outsiders . <p> For instance , McClaurin reports people 's frequent speculation " that I must have a Belizean ancestor somewhere in my past " ; with her denial " they settled upon the idea that our ancestors must have come from the same area in Africa but ended up on ships with different destinations " ( p. 16 ) . The assertion of fictive kinship assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " shipmate " relationship as an enduring principle of social organization in the shaping of social relations in many African American cultures and societies ( cf. Mintz and Price , 1992 ) . But the invocation of kinship may have even broader symbolic and instrumental foundations , and the presumption of cross-cultural racial solidarity in the abstract is rarely capable on its own strength of sustaining personal relationships for very long . In this respect it would be more useful to know something of the evolving texture and content of the personal relationships between McClaurin and her female respondents . <p> What remains is the constructed nature of race and the fact that " national " identity ( long assumed to be an exclusive Creole prerogative in Belize ) has been and remains a highly negotiable , opportunistic , and elusive endowment of social belonging in the post-colonial era . A conspicuous racial aesthetic ( with collateral symbolic and metaphorical content ) certainly persists in popular Belizean discourse , but its conceptual openness and contradictory content favor a conflation of race and ethnicity conducive to purposes that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience that McClaurin presumes between herself and Belizeans of African descent . This lesson became clear to university-educated Belizeans who , returning from overseas study during the 1960s , discovered the fundamental inapplicability of the U.S. Black Power movement to the Belizean social reality , which grew out of a distinct historical trajectory ( e.g. , Hyde , 1970 ) . <p> This issue resides in McClaurin 's own reportage that her conditioning in the U.S. racial formation ( see Omi and Winant , 1994 ) often led to unfounded assumptions about an individual 's presumed ethnic identity . In one example , " At first I thought A.B . was Mestizo because of her looks and her Spanish-sounding last name , as well as her fluency in Spanish . But she is adamant about her origins . She is of African ancestry and states she is proud of her heritage . She tells me today she is ' of white and African mixture which makes me Creole . ' She speaks three languages , Creole , English , and Spanish .... She also has an adopted Maya daughter " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " makes cultural sense " given the social-historical fact that an ability to claim Creole identity ( notably , Anglo affinity ) and to speak Belizean Creole were prerequisites to social mobility and government employment under the British colonial regime . Such ideals die hard ; many self-identified Creoles perceive their ascendancy and privilege to be in decline since independence in 1981 , as the government and society at large come more to reflect the country 's actual ethnic diversity . McClaurin notes the salient Belizean debate over whether an " authentic " Creole culture exists , an argument given certain popular urgency by recent Asian and ( Spanish-speaking ) Central American immigration , which many see as threatening the very ethnic and cultural identity of the nation . The Belizean dilemma has its universal dimension , as seen in comparison with the punitive anti-immigration and anti-welfare tone of popular discourse on cultural and national belonging in the United States today . <p> It is thus the hemispheric perspective that finally demands consideration . McClaurin 's wariness of " traditional ethnographic writings that focus primarily on the analysis of structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of her undertaking , but the Belizean experience is most enlightening in precisely the comparative context that such an approach enables . Consider the tendency of many Belizeans ( especially Creoles ) to downplay the marked diversity of the nation 's collective ethnic and cultural roots , as inscribed in individuals ' actual genealogies and the bi- and multilingual abilities of many . This is a nation whose demographic and cultural mix reflects an unbroken history of forced and voluntary immigration from Africa , Asia , Latin America , and Europe . Hence the reported readiness of Belizeans to assimilate McClaurin to their personal lineages is compatible with the society 's long history of cultural , linguistic , and ethnic hybridity , a condition that essentialist appeals to " race " or the persuasions of personal sentiment and empathic identification are incapable of explaining . <p> In this regard , McClaurin is best read as an experimental ethnographic assessment of the contemporary gender status of women in Belize . She presents impressive testimony to illustrate women 's strategic adaptation to their continued subordination in Belizean society .

Some time ago , Sidney Mintz made clear the critical value of comparative socio-historical research in building analytical subtlety into an ethnographic and structural comprehension of Caribbean cultural and social phenomena . He wrote , " I am necessarily concerned with the processes by which Caribbean societies were simultaneously given their distinctive , individual character on the one hand , yet made importantly alike , on the other .

But as should also be clear , the cultural formations that emerged were unique and genuinely Caribbean in character . <p> Most acutely , Mintz observed that the Caribbean " present is , for better or worse , much of the rest of the world 's future " ( 1989 1974 , xxi ) . The Caribbean social experiment 's structurally dependent character stands as an imperative materialization of the skewed social relations of capitalist modernity . The flattening of cultural diversity , the devaluation of vital social roles and their reduction to categories of oppression , the unmitigated social displacement concealed in the ideology of " development , " and the utter commoditization of human potential that emerge from Caribbean social history require that any politically committed analysis engage the full range of evidence at hand , and situate the concerted struggles for individual and group self-determination in the context of broader social processes , if there is to be any chance of countervailing Mintz 's prescient apprehension . <p> @ @ @ is given the author and the list .

El Caballero de la Triste Figura , ? ? El Caballero de los Leones ? ) . The willful deceivers of Don Quixote , like the priest and the barber , Dorotea , Sans=n Carrasco , the duke and duchess , and Altisidora , are also readers of the books of chivalry and thus know very well how to invent chivalric plots that fit Don Quixote 's expectations .

Nowadays , however , with a few notable exceptions , out of the fifty-some Spanish chivalric romances , even the most dedicated Cervantistas seldom go beyond Amadfs de Gaula.4 Since Diego Clemencfn 's monumental edition of the 1830 's , with its extensive footnotes identifying possible chivalric sources for incidents in Don Quijote , there have been few scholarly attempts to match particular chivalric material <p> 3 See Daniel Eisenberg ( 1987 , 3-44 ) on this point as well as the possibility that Cervantes wrote his own romance of chivalry .

Also see Michael McGaha 's perceptive summary of the current situation in source studies , as p. 64 opposed to intertextuality ( 149 ) . Rafael Altamira defended reading chivalric romances on the grounds of better understanding the epoch in which they were popular , but he was speaking mostly of the Breton and Carolingian material . <p> 64 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> continued neglect of the texts indicates that these are minority opinions.9 Some critics even seem to argue against reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , citing +mile Gebhart 's identification of about sixty Amadisean episodes in Don Quijote , asserts that ? the many parodic reminiscences of Amadfs may stand for all ? ( 37 ) .10 Luis Murillo ( 1988 ) states that it is unnecessary actually to read the Spanish romances of chivalry to find out what they are like because ? any reader of Don Quixote can find out for himself : no one has given a more vivid idea of them than Cervantes ? ( 13 ) . Perhaps , but it strikes me as rather like trying to reconstruct a typical Western by watching ? Blazing Saddles ? . Most important , however , it is simply not true that we can know the romances of chivalry solely by reading Don Quijote . For example , after one reads most of the romances , it appears that at least two types of chivalric adventures are experienced by most knightly heroes but not by Don Quixote . First , Cervantes 's hero never engages in the typical enterprise of a Christian knight : the forcible conversion of a ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually after defeating him in battle.11 Likewise , Don Quixote never undergoes that classic chivalric episode in which an enamoured maga ( enchantress ) works her <p> 9 See Daniel Eisenberg 's criticism ( 1975 ) of Armando Durn 's Estructura y tTcnicas and its limitations which for Eisenberg derive partially from reading only unrepresentative works , including Amadfs . A number of modern scholars have read Montalvo 's work , of course , but few have read the other romances.10 Interestingly , Riley , like Murillo , then proceeds to cite examples from other romances which are quite unlike Amadfs ( 38-44 ) . Perhaps the most egregious example of mistaken generalizations about the Spanish romances is Roger Walker 's 1964 article . Eduardo Urbina 's excellent article on ChrTtien de Troyes and Don Quijote might at first glance be construed as recommending against reading the Spanish romances of chivalry , but in reality he simply cautions against what he calls ? la mi=pica consideraci=n de fuentes en los libros de caballerfas ; ? in favor of considering the place of Don Quijote within the larger medieval chivalric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quijote-as-imitator point of view but does not advocate reading the romances , while Howard Mancing indirectly recommends reading them ( Ch. 1 ) .11 Cf. Whitenack ( 1988 ) . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 65 <p> erotic magic on the hero so that he remains out of action and in thrall to her ? often for years.12 This is especially intriguing when we consider the constant presence of magic , enchantment , and the erotic in the novel . These two major omissions raise the question of how Cervantes decided on which chivalric material to use or not to use in Don Quijote and more specifically , whether we can come to any conclusion concerning why these particular incidents might have been omitted.13 We might assume that his choice to include certain material was governed by each incident 's comic/parodic possibilities ? dependent first upon instant reader recognition and then upon what could be done with it in a parody . But it is much more difficult to understand why Cervantes omitted certain material , particularly the kinds of incidents just mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Quijote . Cervantes surely was aware of chivalric conversion episodes ; there occurs , after all , at least one in the majority of books mentioned or referred to in his novel : Tirant , Esplandin , Lepolemo ( El Caballero de la Cruz ) , Belianfs , Cirongilio de Tracia , Clarin de Landanfs , Florambel de Lucea , and others.14 Even Amadfs de Gaula , not always typical of the Spanish romances , includes a kind of conversion episode , which we will outline here since Amadfs appears to have been Don Quixote 's favorite . The hero ( Amadfs ) threatens the defeated enemy ( the giant Madarque ) with death if he does not agree to convert to Christianity : <p> Other elements typical of such episodes include the promise that the future Christian will convert all of his relatives and that he will perform good Christian deeds while desisting from what <p> 12 I am presently engaged in a book-length study of the enchantress figure in the Spanish romances of chivalry and elsewhere.13 There are other omissions : for example , see Avalle-Arce ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among many others , for comments on the knight 's missing childhood scenes.14 For more detail on chivalric conversion episodes ( through 1524 ) , see Whitenack ( 1988 ) . <p> 66 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> ever ? mala costumbre ? has attracted the hero 's attention ? in this case the practice of not allowing anyone , ? caballero , ni duea ni doncella , ? to enter his domain without killing or imprisoning them . But unlike equivalent figures in most other romances , this giant apparently never intended to keep his promise : <p> Since Amadfs has saved his brother Galaor and King Cildadn from the giant and freed 100 captives , all of whom he sends to his lady Oriana , this adventure is an overall success . However , even though Madarque promises again , he is obviously not going to convert , since we also hear that his savage sister Andandona not only tries to kill Amadfs and company as they depart but will eventually turn her brother into as great an enemy of Christians as she is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? como adelante se dir ? ) , but this information , along with the earlier ? l tenfa en el corat=n , ? tells us that Amadfs has failed in his only attempt at enforced conversion.16 <p> 15 In Amadfs , the few times Andandona is mentioned , it is invariably in association with the devil , emphasizing that she is the sworn enemy of all Christians : ? era muy fea de rostro , que no semejava sino diablo ? ( II , 980-81 ) ; ? aquella endiablada giganta ? ( II , 981 ) ; ? algn diablo era ? ( II , 981 ) . The scene in which Amadfs 's squire Gandalfn finally kills her ( a knight can not kill a woman ) , abounds in references to the devil ( II , 1025-27 ) .16 While many pagans appearing in the romances are ? endurecidos ? and refuse to convert , it is interesting that the only conversion episode mentioned in Amadfs is an unsuccessful one . Perhaps this phenomenon is another indication of the work 's probable medieval origins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in conversions of infidels , as in so many other ways , author Montalvo has Amadfs 's son Esplandin outdo his father in the sequel . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 67 <p> Because there are so many of these conversion episodes in the romances , it is neither necessary nor possible to establish that Cervantes was familiar with this particular one , although there is some evidence that would suggest that he was.17 For example , Madarque is not mentioned in Cervantes 's novel , but Sancho Panza praises his evil sister Andandona ( who only appears in this section of Amadfs ) in a comically inappropriate comparison with Teresa Panza : ? a no ser celosa Teresa , no la trocara yo por la giganta Andandona , que segn mi seor , fue una mujer muy cabal y muy de pro ? .18 Also , when Don Quixote is certain that Juan Haldudo will keep his promise regarding AndrTs ( I , 6 ) , it is reminiscent of Amadfs 's strangely naive acceptance of the giant 's promise.19 The ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of course a variation on the classic chivalric demand , echoed in several ? surrender or die ? moments in Don Quijote , for example at the defeat of the vizcafno : ? le dijo que se rindiese ; si no , que le cortarfa la cabeza ? ( I , 9 , 146 ) , or of the bachiller Alonso L=pez : ? llegndose a Tl , le puso la punta del lanz=n en el rostro , diciTndole que se rindiese ; si no , que le matarfa ? ( I , 19 , 232 ) . In each of the two battles between Don Quixote and the disguised Sans=n , we again see the demands of the victor over the vanquished : Don Quixote to Sans=n : ? ? Muerto sois , caballero , si no confesis que la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso se aventaja en belleza a vuestra Casildea de Vandalia ? ( II , 14 , 144 ) ; and Sans=n to Don Quixote : ? ? Vencido sois , caballero , y aun muerto , si no confesis las condiciones de nuestro desaffo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knights of his books , Don Quixote issues peremptory demands on several occasions : for example , that the Toledo merchants acknowledge the supremacy of Dulcinea 's beauty : ? Todo el mundo se tenga si todo el mundo no confiesa que no hay en el mundo todo doncella ms hermosa . . . . ? ( I , 4 , 100 ) or that no one follow Marcela : ? ? Ninguna persona , de cualquier estado que sea , se atreva a seguir a la hermosa Marcela . . . . ? ( I , 14 , 188 ) . <p> 17 Avalle-Arce , for example , says that Cervantes knew Amadfs de Gaula ? al dedillo ? ( 65 ) .18Don Quijote , II , 25 , 236 . These and all subsequent references will be to the Luis A. Murillo edition.19 When Amadfs orders all of the freed captives to present themselves to Oriana it also reminds us of the galeotes episode in Don Quijote ( I , 22 ) , even though there are countless other such episodes in Amadfs as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cervantes <p> Given all of these demands , one might wonder why , then , Don Quixote never issues an ultimatum of ? convert or die. ? 20 He even demonstrates his awareness of chivalric conversion scenes in the rebaos episode , where he describes the two combatants as a Christian king who is fighting his ? pagano ? counterpart ( in this case a Moslem ) in order to force him to convert to Christianity before marrying his daughter ( I , 18 ) . While this scene is clearly of chivalric inspiration , it contains a humorous twist : a more usual sequence of events in the romances would be for a pagan to request baptism in order to marry someone , rather than for a Christian father to go to war in order to force conversion upon a prospective future son-in-law.21 Before converting anyone , Don Quixote would first have had to imagine meeting a non-Christian knight , as in Fernndez de Avellaneda 's apocryphal Quijote , where the inconsistent protagonist first mistakes a nobleman in Madrid for Perianeo , a pagan prince from Belianfs de Grecia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in pagan territory ( ch. 30 ) . Within Don Quixote 's variety of madness , however , the scene is almost always rooted in seventeenth-century Spain , so that even considering the way that he takes the prostitutes for doncellas or the innkeeper for the master of a castle , it would have required another kind of logical leap to take the vizcafno or Alonso L=pez for a pagan knight.22 Perhaps it is a question of the permissible bounds of humor : it is comical and even plausible when the vizcafno is insulted at Don Quixote 's remark that he is no gentleman or when the bachiller , angry about a sprained ankle , excommunicates Don Quixote by citing Tridentine dicta . However , in such a sensitive society , where even to imply that someone was not of Old Christian ancestry was both insulting and dangerous , one wonders how easy it would have been to make ? convert or die ? humorous.23 In Avellaneda 's Quijote , the actors force the cowardly <p> 20 I am indebted to Amy Williamsen for the interesting suggestion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parodies of the typical ? convert or die ? demands of the romances.21 It is odd that Efron , who insists that Don Quijote is a follower of chivalric patterns rather than an ? individual , ? calls this a ? stock scene ? without mentioning this comic inversion ( 30 ) .22 An exception could be Don Quixote 's destruction of Maese Pedro 's puppet show ( II , 25 ) , during which he is temporarily taken over by the illusion and transports himself back to the Middle Ages.23 Note that in the Avellaneda Quijote , while Sancho freely throws around the insults of ? paganos ? and ? luteranos ? ( actors ' episode , Ch. 26 ) , p. 69 and the false Don Quijote fights with the gentleman 's page over whether he really is a pagan or not , he never tries to convert anyone . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 69 <p> Sancho to become a Moslem upon threat of death ( ch. 27 ) , and the protagonist concocts a chivalric fantasy in which he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ch. 36 ) , but such farcical scenes do not have quite the resonance of a threat with sword point to neck . Then again , the entire problem could be avoided by having Don Quixote defeat and convert some giants ? frequent targets of proselytizing in the romances ? as long as they were not windmills ( or wineskins , as in I , 35 ) . There are other points to consider : for instance , despite the low regard which contemporary churchmen had for the entire chivalric genre , a given author 's inclusion of conversion scenes may have come from genuinely pious motives , so that parody would have been unwise . Making the conversion battle comic might even have verged on the dangerous . In Don Quixote 's relatively few opportunities to issue demands , at sword point or otherwise , perhaps it would have been inconsistent of him to alternate between sending some people to render homage to Dulcinea and demanding conversions of the others . Cervantes also may have decided to avoid the entire problem by not involving his hero directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moros in the rest of the novel , where no one sets out to convert anyone : for example , in the story of the returned morisco Ricote and his family , and in the tale of Zoraida , the Muslim daughter who deserts her father because of her devotion to the Virgin Mary and desire to live in Christian Spain.24 Similarly , in ? El amante liberal , ? as we will recall , the good turco Mahamut wishes from the beginning to become a Christian . One might also account for the absence of episodes in which the knight is the agent of conversion by applying Marie Cort Daniels 's conclusions on Feliciano de Silva , i.e. , that the distinct lack of enthusiasm for conversion in his Amadfs de Grecia and others of his chivalric romances might be explained by his converso heritage ( 257-71 ) .25 Certainly it would be difficult to discern <p> 24 On the interpretation of the Zoraida tale , see Mrquez Villanueva 's analysis in Personajes , 115-46 . Also see Alison Weber 's interesting article on the subject.25 That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Don Quijote is noticeably unenthusiastic on the subject of Christianity might also point to the lack of conversion episodes . On Cervantes 's religious p. 70 views and their possible reflection in his literary work , see Daniel Eisenberg 's extended commentary and references in his book on the Quijote ( 1987 ) , 13-15 , n. 40 . In the same book he also cites the major evidence for Cervantes 's converso heritage ( 148-149 ) . Also see Canavaggio , Ch. 1 . <p> 70 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> any stand taken in the novel on the theological debate still raging over the question of enforced conversions . In the rebaos episode , for instance , are we to approve or laugh at the Christian king 's effort to effect a conversion by force , or at the idea of two armies fighting an entire battle for such a reason ? Or is this irrelevant to the comic center of the episode : Don Quixote 's ill-advised assault on the sheep ? Another key issue left open in the novel also applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of expediency versus sincerity . In the morisco conversions just mentioned , sincerity never seems to be in question . No one appears to doubt the sincerity of Zoraida 's prospective conversion from Islam ( I , 39-42 ) , for example , perhaps because of her extreme fervor , or perhaps because she is such a standard literary type : the woman who flees with her father 's captive.26 As many modern readers have noted with dismay , the morisco Ricote defends the recent expulsion of his people , forcibly converted generations before , even though he also cites the presence of a few sincere Christians among them : ? no porque todos fuTsemos culpados , que algunos habfa cristianos firmes y verdaderos ; pero eran tan pocos , que no se podfan oponer a los que no lo eran , y no era bien criar la sierpe en el seno , teniendo los enemigos dentro de casa ? ( II , 54 , 450-51 ) .27 Ricote 's condemnation of the majority might even be a way of separating himself from his compatriots , lending credence thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her parents are exceptions : ? sin que me aprovechase decir que era cristiana , como , en efecto , lo soy , y no de las fingidas ni aparentes , sino de las verdaderas y cat=licas . . . . tuve una madre cristiana y un padre discreto y <p> 26 On the other hand , there seems to be evidence that Zoraida was based upon a real person , the daughter of Agi Morato . Cf. Eisenberg ( 1987 ) , 102 , n. 87 . Also see Mrquez Villanueva ( 141-42 ) on the tradition of the enamoured saracena.27 In support of the possibility that Cervantes had a ? moderate ? attitude toward this minority , Mrquez Villanueva ( 1975 ) remarks that no one in the Quijote uses the traditional epithets against moriscos ( although there are various slurs against moros ) . Ellen Anderson has been doing a great deal of interesting work in this area lately . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 71 <p> cristiano ? ( II , 63 , 527 ) .28 This episode resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim woman with a cristiano viejo and because both women 's futures are left unresolved at the end ( like that of Doa Rodrfguez 's daughter II , 56 ) .29 What Cervantes meant by this indeterminacy is uncertain : it could even be caution on his part , to avoid putting himself in the position of defending the sincerity of a morisca 's Christianity . It is also interesting in the case of the renegade that despite earlier doubts by the admiral and the viceroy regarding his trustworthiness ( II , 63 , 531 ) , once he has decided to rejoin the fold , no one seems to question his decision to reembrace Christianity : ? Reincorpor=se y redjose el renegado con la Iglesia , y de miembro podrido , volvi= limpio y sano con la penitencia y el arrepentimiento ? ( II , 65 , 539 ) .30 But finally , considering all of the possible complications outlined here , the most likely conclusion is that for Cervantes , no advantage in including a conversion episode would have outweighed the inherent disadvantages and even dangers.31 As puzzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more puzzling is the fact that despite the ubiquitous presence of enchantment in the novel , no enamoured maga ever enchants Don Quixote . The first observation to be made in this context is that the only woman of continuing importance to the protagonist throughout the novel is the lady Dulcinea , who <p> 28 When Zoraida ( I , 40 , 490 ) denounces all moros as ? marfuces , ? in contrast , it is in the context of one about to leave the group ( and join that of Ricote , incidentally ) , rather than one seeking to be considered an exception to the majority.29 We will remember that Ana FTlix will remain with her father in Barcelona , while Don Antonio tries to arrange permission for her to stay in Spain and her lover goes off to visit his parents ( II , 65 , 540 ) . Mrquez Villanueva also reminds us that Cervantes in his old age was not fond of haply endings ( 335 ) .30 Perhaps the distinction between the cases of the renegade and of the moriscos may be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podrido ? who became ? limpio y sano ? through ? penitencia y arrepentimiento ? ( II , 65 , 539 ) , while Ricote 's apparent use of the same metaphor calls the entire cuerpo rotten : ? todo el cuerpo de nuestra naci=n est contaminado y podrido ? ( II , 65 , 540 ) . In contrast , in Guzmn de Alfarache we will remember the vast doubt Guzmn casts upon the sincerity of his renegade father , who converted easily from Christianity to Islam and back again as it suited his financial advantage . See Whitenack ( 1985 ) , Ch. 2.31 For more on Cervantes vis a vis marranos as well as moriscos , see Canavaggio , Eisenberg ( 1987 ) , and Mrquez Villanueva . <p> 72 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> never appears directly.32 However significant this lack of women might be for those trying to analyze the psyche of Don Quixote ( or that of his creator ) , we should not forget the chivalric model which shapes the novel.33 As one might expect , in the chivalric tales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not play a major role.34 As suggested in recent studies by Edward Friedman and Anne J. Cruz on the male-authored picaresque novels with female protagonists , the pfcaras are very much male creations . Clearly it is difficult for authors to keep their own stereotypes , prejudices and fantasies from being reflected in characters different from themselves . If this is true of novels which concentrate on female protagonists like the pfcaras , it would seem even more likely when women are only shadowy , insignificant characters like those characteristically found in chivalric romances.35 Most women in the romances are incidental to the plot , whether appearing only once or more frequently , for example , mothers , other older women and relatives , wives and fiancTes of other knights , servants , and so forth . The most important woman , the hero 's lady , is typically an inaccessible beauty from a higher position on the social scale than the hero , so that to win her represents upward mobility for him.36 Often she is , for example , the sole heiress to a kingdom , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Constantinople or Niquea , as in Tirant , Esplandin , various of the Amadfs series , and many others . As important as the idea of this lady is to the hero , she intervenes little in the action . Her main functions , other than to provide inspiration for the hero , is to remain aloof during most of the narration before finally accepting his proposals , <p> 32 Good places to start for commentaries on Dulcinea are Edwin Williamson , 128-31 , 171-5 , and Arthur Efron.33 Important recent studies on the problem of women and Don Quijote ( and Cervantes ) are those of Combet , Johnson , Rossi , and El Saffar ( 1989 and 1984 ) . Also consult Efron , especially Ch. 2.34 Much could be said about the role of women in Beatriz Bernal 's Cristalin de Espaa ( 1545 ) . See Sidney Park 's introduction.35 Several chivalric romances feature Amazon or ? woman warrior ? types who despite their physical strength and military prowess are rarely important in more than one or two episodes in the plot . An exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Sidney Park 's introduction to his edition.36 Ruth El Saffar ( 1989 ) sees this pattern ( in which ? the male aspirant is given power through the woman ? ) in several chivalric episodes recounted in the Quijote but does not mention the connection with the chivalric romances . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 73 <p> to drive him crazy with irrational jealousy at least once , and possibly to be rescued by him from capture or enchantments . Because the lady often maintains her inaccessible stance until almost the end of the narration , and because the hero spends much his time away from her , he is subject to the temptations represented by what we would now call ? groupies ? ? the many women who fall in love with him and seek him out.37 One might have fallen in love with him ? de ofdas , ' ' as in the case of a queen of some distant ( often pagan ) land . She might be the daughter of the highest authority of wherever he spends the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the palace of a king or emperor ? or she might be the proverbial damsel in distress whom he has rescued or to whom he has restored a usurped kingdom . Frequently such a lady ? most often still a virgin ( doncella ) ? comes to the hero 's bed , often when the knight is resting in a castle , recovering from battle wounds ? wounds which have often been tended recently by the very same lady.38 In some romances one has the impression that every unattached young woman is potentially ready to offer herself to the knight , and many , like Amadfs 's brother Galaor or Amadfs de Grecia , cheerfully indulge in one or more sexual indiscretions with these available ladies.39 However , there are also various models of knightly fidelity like Amadfs , Esplandin , Arderique , or Lepolemo , and others who use their fidelity as a metaphorical shield to protect them . Some of the extremes to which a faithful knight will go in order to avoid any contact with another woman are almost comical : consider the prolonged agonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) simply because he once allowed <p> 37 Less typical are several heroes , notably Belianfs , who spend a large part of the narration trying to decide between two ladies . Even rarer is a type like Florindo , a confirmed woman-hater who rejects all idea of love and marriage until the end , when he is virtually forced to choose a bride for dynastic reasons . See Rfo Nogueras on Florindo.38 Let us recall , for instance , Queen Briolanja in Amadfs , who in the lost medieval version might have succeeded in persuading Amadfs to sleep with her ? an incident quite unlike Montalvo 's more reserved fifteenth-century version . Other examples are the Amazon queen Calafia in the Sergas de Esplandin and several women in Lepolemo , Floriseo , Felixmarte , Tirant , the Clarin series , and many others.39 We will remember one of the barber 's arguments for Galaor over Amadfs : ? tenfa muy acomodada condici=n para todo ; que no era caballero melindroso ? ( I , 1 , 73 ) ; also that the comic epitafio suggests that Don Quijote did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . en muy poquito a Galaores tuvo ? ( I , 52 , 605 ) . <p> 74 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> a lady to kiss him briefly . When one of these ladies is rejected , she is left with few options : she can kill herself , she can waste away from sorrow ( as Altisidora pretends to do in II , 70 ) , she can give up and marry someone else ( rare ) , or she can resort to magic.40 For example , in Palmerfn de Olivia and in Clarin I , 1 we find rejected women who commit suicide , and one who even leaves orders that after her death , her eyes and heart are to be cut out and sent to Clarin in a box ? a rather dreadful chivalric motif echoed in the Cave of Montesinos episode.41 Among the various rejected ladies in each libro de caballerfas there is often a maga who , determined to have the hero , casts an erotic enchantment over him , i.e. , philocaptio.42 This maga is almost invariably a non-Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagana , like the Queen of India in Floriseo . Not only erotic enchantments but all kinds of magic spells are built-in hazards of the knight 's life , as seen by the way so many knights arm themselves with a magical object or charm , often a small piece of jewelry ( for example , a ring in Cristalin , a bracelet in Lepolemo ) , or a magic sword or shield , which must be removed if the enchantment is to work . No metaphorical shield of fidelity is sufficient against the enchantments in the Spanish romances , but often the maga can not enchant the knight because she is unable to divest the knight of his protection . We will remember that after Don Quixote claims that enchantment has prevented his rescuing Sancho from his blanketing at the inn , he proclaims his <p> 40 For examples of dying for love , see Platir , Clarin , I , 1 ; Polismn ; and Amadfs VII , among many others . Needless to say , those who do commit suicide are almost invariably non-Christians.41 If the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to another knight , but if he has accepted her attentions for a night or two and perhaps engendered a child with her , he typically either endows her with a castle or other property or simply abandons her . If no child is involved , she might , again , waste away from sorrow , commit suicide , or devote her life to good works , but she rarely marries anyone else . Once the lady has borne the hero 's child , she behaves almost like an eternally bereaved widow ? devoted solely to raising her child . Worthy of future examination is this apparent authorial reluctance to have any of the hero 's ex-mistresses become involved with other knights . For the ? Oliva ? vs . ? Olivia ? problem , see Eisenberg , Bibliography.42 On philocaptio , consult P. E. Russell 's classic Celestina article ( 1978 ) and M. E. Perry . Some of the best on magic and enchantment : Caro Baroja , Garrosa Resina , Maravall , Pavia , Thorndike , and Winkler . A few examples of enchantment episodes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Polismn ; Belianfs ; Floriseo ; Polindo ; and Florambel. 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 75 <p> determination to carry in the future a sword which will protect him against enchantments : ? que al que la trujere consigo no le puedan hacer ningn gTnero de encantamentos ? ( I , 18 , 217 ) .43 The magas use various devices to enchant the hero : often the same kind of item which protects against enchantments , or sometimes a love potion , a candle , music , a magic cloud , or a trick of disguise or metamorphosis , usually to make the knight think that the maga is his lady love.44 Like Calypso in Homer 's Odyssey , with whom Odysseus spent eight years , or Circe , with whom he spent one year , a maga might keep the hero enchanted for a long time ? although sometimes only the nine months required <p> 43 Other such objects include the magic swords of Amadfs , Reymundo de Grecia , Primale=n , and many others ; Lisuarte 's scabbard in Amadfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 the knight has a magic ring which cures all wounds as well as keeping him from enchantments , and it is not until Clarin III ( by a different author ) that Daborea succeeds in removing it . Lepolemo has a magic brazalete which protects him from all of the ladies in love with him , and no one ever succeeds in removing it . A maga might also use a similar object to keep him enchanted , in which case the hero 's rescuers must remove it to disenchant him . See Giamatti for an analysis of the role of the enchantress in the Italian and English verse epics of the time . We will also remember that in Alcina 's enchantment of Ruggiero in Ariosto 's Orlando furioso ( Canto VI ) , the knight foolishly does not use his magic shield to protect himself ( also , a magic ring is required for his disenchantment ) .44 In Arderique , for example , Blancheflor keeps him in thrall with a ring on each of his little fingers and a stone on a silken cord around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a love potion ( Polismn ) , or another liquid , like the ? agua de desacuerdo ? in Florambel de Lucea or the sleeping draught ( Palmerfn ) , a magic mirror ( Polindo ) , a ring ( Florindo ) , a book ( FTlix Magno ) , a magic cloud or fog ( also Polismn ) . Sometimes it is simply generic artes mgicas ( Beliflor in Clarin IV ) , while sometimes these artes are used to deceive the knight , most often to make him think ( as in Lancelot-Elaine episodes ) , that the maga is his lady ( Belianfs IV ) or that he is only dreaming of the encounter . Interestingly enough , although magas and magos ( and often their books ) are sometimes burned for heresy in the romances ( Floriseo , Clarin II and III , and Amadfs VIII , for example ) , the magas who succeed in enchanting the hero ( and therefore having sexual relations with him ) are rarely punished ? Arderique is a major exception . Rather , their fate often resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting away from sorrow , etc . If they bear the hero 's son , they are treated especially well , the most exaggerated example being in Floriseo , where Queen Lacivia ( ! ) of In dia bears Floriseo a son and later becomes a great friend to him and his wife , the Queen of Bohemia .

It is important to observe that in the Spanish romances , enchantment by a maga is viewed as an unassailable excuse for infidelity , because the unprotected knight can not resist the magic spell , however strong his desire to remain faithful . As perhaps an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should note the contrast with contemporaneous Italian and English verse epics , which condemn those who allow themselves to be taken in by erotic enchantments.46 The maga initially would seem to be the most powerful figure in the love triangle she forms with the knight and his lady , because she can have any man she wants . However , she is the ultimate loser , first because of the obvious emotional limitations of love induced by magic , 47 and second , because sooner or later the spell is broken and the knight returns to his heroic career and to <p> 45 The chivalric author 's apparent attitude toward the enamoured enchantress varies considerably .

This litter type resembles the maga Cenotia in Persiles ( II , 9 ) .46 See Giamatti on the moral implications of erotic enchantment in the works of Ariosto , Tasso , Spencer , and others . We should also note that while in the pseudo-medieval Spanish romances of the sixteenth century , the Christian conversions are distinctly different from their medieval predecessors , the enchantments retain their medieval quality . Notable as well is the reversal of the conventional enchantment in Zayas 's ? La inocencia castigada , ? where the authorities absolve InTs , but her husband does not.47 Johann Weyer , in his 1583 De praestigiis daemonum , quotes Plutarch on this subject : ? Those who seek sexual pleasures from their spouses by means of amatory arts and love charms , spend their lives in company with persons who are stupefied , demented , and totally ruined ? ( 278 ) . Although Weyer is quoting Plutarch in the context of denying ( with multiple classical references ) the efficacy of occult amatory arts , the Plutarch passage is ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffective , or that they induce stupor ? 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 77 <p> his true love , leaving the maga alone , often to raise his child.48 In these male-authored texts , the ubiquitous presence of so many beautiful and willing women could well represent some form of masculine wish fulfillment , particularly the fantasy of irresistibility to the opposite sex . However , although the enchantment episodes would seem to offer illicit sexual interludes with no blame attached , they also have nightmarish aspects for the male , not the least of which is that he is captured , imprisoned , dominated , and kept away from his heroic mission by a woman . The fear of women 's powers , particularly insofar as they might neutralize the hero 's effectiveness , seems to be universal in heroic literature going back to Homer.49 Mihoko Suzuki goes so far as to say that all of the female characters in heroic literature ? exemplify the personal impulse that opposes public imperatives ? ( 144 ) . In this sense erotic enchantment may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seductive powers . Richard Predmore actually makes the logical connection between literary enchantment and ? real world ? romantic love , but without mentioning the chivalric magas ( 45-46 ) . Odysseus 's dalliance with Calypso , that of Aeneas with Dido , or even the ? Joie de la Court ? episode in ChrTtien de Troyes ' Erec et Enide are fine examples of the male perception of the dangers of ceding to a woman 's love , with or without magic spells . For example , even if the knight had intended to be faithful to his lady , he can be made to betray her simply by the casting of a magic spell . Classical heroes like Odysseus were little concerned with sexual fidelity to one woman and simply viewed women as part of the spoils of war , but by the Christian Middle Ages , to force a knight to be unfaithful is significant , as we have already indicated . We will remember , for example , Lancelot 's absolute fidelity to Guinevere and his despair at the enchantment which causes him to betray her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Galahad.50 Especially horrifying for many <p> 48 Pierre Ullman has reminded me that a maga might well wish to bear the hero 's child as an end in itself ? something that will be well worth investigating in the course of further research book on magas.49 See Lederer , for example.50 Malory 's might be the most famous rendering of this version of the tale . El Saffar ( 1989 ) also finds significance in Don Quijote 's use of Lancelot as a model , but more in the context of his being a knight more faithful to his lady than to his lord . <p> 78 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> Christian heroes is the idea of sex with a non-Christian , so that some rejections of enamoured ladies ( magas and others ) have dimensions beyond the wish to remain loyal to one lady . This kind of horror finds a famous echo in the dismay of Sir Walter Scott 's Ivanhoe when he learns that the beautiful Rebecca is Jewish.51 Also in Cervantes 's early play El trato de Argel , Aurelio cites Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ? En mi ley no se recibe / hacer yo lo que me ordenas ; / antes con muy graves penas / y amenazas se prohfbe ? ( I , 12 ) . Returning to the absence of magas from Don Quijote , let us first consider the peculiarities of Don Quixote 's reactions to the women he meets in the course of his travels . If we consider the expectations he derives from his romances of chivalry , we can see that as a knight without any special magical protection he will be subject continually to enchantments of all kinds . And as any reader of the novel knows , Don Quixote uses enchantment as an excuse for almost everything inexplicable or unacceptable , especially personal failures.52 He can also expect to be assailed at every turn by erotic temptations which he must overcome if he is to remain faithful to Dulcinea . And among knights he is , as he says , of the faithful variety : ? no soy de los enamorados viciosos , sino de los plat=nicos continentes ? ( II , 32 , 283 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Don Quixote 's attitude toward women , ? they are a combination of Eve and Pandora , not to be trusted , intent on seducing him ? ( 163 ) .53 Within the context of chivalric <p> 51 It is worth recalling that Rebecca 's considerable medical skills were regarded as sorcery . Ackerlind is also instructive ( 14-32 ) on the connections between women 's healing skills and sorcery or magic . On sex with an infidel , there were also chivalric heroes like Palmerfn , who had few scruples about making love to various ladies but was nonetheless horrified at the thought of sexual contact with a mora . On the other hand , these dark ladies with obvious sexual desires not only fulfill male various fantasies , but they provide a contrast to the pure future wife of the hero , who rarely admits to sexual feelings and indeed , often is described as having been overcome by him against her will.52 Richard Predmore remains possibly the best place to start on Don Quijote and enchantment ( 36-52 ) . Also see n. 41 , above.53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Quijote 's wariness/reticence in the presence of women would require many pages . Weiger comments extensively on his ? sexual timidity ? ( 34-40 ) , while Efron devotes most of a chapter to it ( 22-64 ) . The theories of Carroll Johnson regarding the importance of Don Quijote 's teenaged niece , and the homosexual interpretations of Combet and Rossi are well-known . For an p. 79 excellent summary , see Ruth El Saffar ( 1979 ) . Also see Frye on ? chastity and magic ? in the romances ( 153 ) . 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 79 <p> expectations , for example , the presence of the two prostitutes at the first castle/inn almost certainly suggests to him an erotic opportunity like those in the romances . That this chivalric scenario might have been on his mind is also suggested by the lines he quotes from the romance ( ballad ) of Lancelot ? a knight renowned for his fidelity to Guinevere , but also , in many versions of the tale , for having conceived Galahad while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , in the line immediately following the ones partially quoted in Don Quijote ( ? donzellas curaban dTl / princesas del su rocino ? ) , Guinevere takes him to bed with her : ? la linda reina Ginebra / se lo acostaba consigo ? ( Romancero General , I , 198 ) . Don Quixote 's prediction of a future time when he will come to the rescue of these ? doncellas ? also has erotic undertones because of the kind of gratitude so often shown by rescued damsels : ? tiempo vendr en que las vuestras seorfas me manden y yo obedezca , y el valor de mi brazo descubra el deseo que tengo de serviros ? ( I , 2 , 86 ) . We should also note the word curar , which with its dual meaning of caring for and curing appears frequently in these chivalric scenes of arrival at a castle . It is at the second castle/inn where his erotic fantasies become even more obvious . When the innkeeper 's wife and pretty daughter , aided by the grotesque Maritornes , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Quixote 's immediate response , with the appropriate rhetoric of regret at a previous romantic attachment , sounds almost as if the daughter had already offered herself to him , as in his books : ? pluguiera a los altos cielos que el amor no me tuviera tan rendido y tan sujeto a sus leyes ? ( I , 16 , 200 ) . When later that night he is lying awake , he makes the not illogical assumption that the pretty lady who had helped to cure him would soon arrive at his bed . And it is with the greatest enthusiasm that he seizes the ? incomparable fermosura ? ( Maritornes ) , in no hurry to release her from his arms until he has explained at length his loyalty to Dulcinea.54 Of course part of the humor of the scene derives from the contrast between Don Quixote 's self-designation as one of the faithful knights and his evident enjoyment of the rejection scene . Although Don Quixote does not refer here to magic spells the spurned lady might <p> 54 See Efron on this and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52-4 ) . <p> 80 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> later cast upon him , he clearly connects magic with erotic rejection in the other Maritornes episode , where , left hanging by one hand ( the only part of his body he would allow the eager damsel ) , he wishes for Amadfs 's magic sword , ? contra quien no tenfa fuerza de encantamento alguno ? ( I , 43 , 529 ) . When he later rejects Altisidora , he clearly associates both episodes with the magas of chivalric romance : <p> He mentions specifically both her imagined despair at his rejection ( ? desespTrese Madama ? ) and the palace of the ? encantado moro ? where it all took place . And even more significantly , his final statement proclaims his defiance of the powers of enchantment : ? a pesar de todas las potestades hechiceras de la tierra , ? which further suggests that he had the chivalric maga episodes in mind . Don Quixote 's assertion of moral strength is not simply directed against the ? caterva ? of lascivious ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also against magic spells . That Altisidora also connects magic with rejected ladies is demonstrated when at the end of his disastrous encounter with the maddened cat ( which Don Quixote sees as an evil spirit ) she proclaims that all of the magical harm that has come to him is because of his ? dureza y pertinacia ? as an ? empedernido caballero ? ( II , 46 , 386 ) . We might also just note the resemblance of ? empedernido ? to the earlier ? pedernal. ? The most specific connection between lovelorn damsels and magas occurs shortly afterward , when Don Quixote is surprised by Doa Rodrfguez 's late-night appearance in his bedroom , and we see once again where his mind inclines . He imagines that Altisidora , ignoring his previous rejection of her , is about to make another assault on his honestidad : ? sinti= que con una llave abrfan la puerta de su aposento , y luego imagin= que la enamorada doncella venfa para sobresaltar su honestidad y ponerle en condici=n de faltar a la fee que guardar debfa a su seora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Then , when he sees the 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 81 <p> mysterious form of Doa Rodrfguez , swathed in white from head to toe , his immediate reaction relates to magic spells and magas : ? Mir=la Don Quixote desde su atalaya , y cuando vio su adelio y not= su silencio , pens= que alguna bruja o maga venfa en aquel traje a hacer en Tl alguna mala fechurfa , y comenz= a santiguarse con mucha priesa ? ( II , 48 , 396 ) . Why , with all of the other kinds of enchantment in Don Quijote , does the knight never speak of being enchanted by an enamoured maga ? As we can see by the events just discussed , as well as the presence of all those magas in the romances of chivalry , it is not because the author is unaware of magas . On the contrary , the world of magic and enchantment , as AmTrico Castro observed long ago , seems to have fascinated Cervantes , which might partially explain his attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also contain various references to magic and the supernatural.56 Naturally in those days of Tridentine strictures on imaginative literature and the dangers of Inquisitional investigation to suspected practitioners of magic , an author could hardly allow the presence of efficacious magic in his works , and Cervantes therefore always weakens or questions its effects within his plots . The best example is Don Quijote itself , where ubiquitous invisible enchanters are safely located in the mind of a deranged knight . But also , after Berganza 's lengthy description of the powers of the witch Camacha in ? Coloquio de los perros , ? Cipi=n immediately calls the account a ? grandfsimo disparate ? ( 309 ) . It is also very interesting in this context what James Parr ( 1988 ) says about Don Quixote 's lifelong chastity and his determination to remain faithful : the author ? never puts him to any real test ? ( 86 ) . Or , in the context of this discussion , no maga casts an irresistible spell on him . In person he has only to resist Maritornes ( confused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the first and most erotically dangerous scene she is rescued by the ? encantado moro ? and in the second , he completes the rejection and suffers enchantment , which although not erotic , certainly immobilizes him ) . Although he must reject both marriage to the Princess Micomicoma and the advances of Altisidora , in neither case is he in as close physical proximity to the lady as he is to Maritornes . With Doa Rodrfguez , <p> he evidently observes ? after the initial based upon the resemblance between the nighttime visit and countless similar chivalric episodes ? he evidently recognizes that she represents no erotic threat . Moreover , when it comes to Don Quixote 's own possible enchantment by a lascivious maga , it almost seems that the knight was aware of a theological conflict . Catholic doctrine defended the preeminence of Christian faith over diabolical ( ? black ? ) magic and of free will over enchantment , and this was echoed in seventeenth-century literature . For instance , we will recall that the devil in Calder=n 's El mgico prodigioso can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she is a Christian endowed with free will . Similarly , in Marfa de Zayas 's miracle tale , ? La perseguida triunfante , ? the magician 's powers over Beatriz are limited because she is under the Virgin 's special protection , like a character in a Marian miracle tale from the Middle Ages . Evidence from emblem collections as well as poetry from the period also consistently defends free will over the powers of erotic magic , and we see the same in several of Cervantes 's works . In Persiles , for example , it is because of the free will of Periandro/Persiles that Hip=lita can not attract him through magic spells and must content herself with employing an hechicera to make Auristela/Segismunda deathly ill : ? no que mudase la voluntad de Periandro , pues ya sabfa que era imposible ? ( 450 ) .57 Even the maga Cenotia ( in the same work ) defends the preeminence of the will over magic : ? Puesto que en mudar las voluntades , sacarlas de su quicio , como esto es ir contra el libre albedrfo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de yerbas que lo alcancen ? ( 202 ) . Similarly in El trato de Argel , when the Moorish slave Ftima tries on behalf of her mistress Zahara to cast an erotic enchantment on Aurelio , a devil actually arrives from hell to tell her that she is wasting her time because Aurelio is a Christian and not subject to these kinds of spells ( II , 40 ) . And in ? El licenciado Vidriera ? there is a moment which resembles all of those chivalric rejection scenes : a woman spurned by Toms takes the advice of a morisca and gives him a Toledan quince with a magic potion in it , which only serves to make him i 'll for six months and then to derange him ? but not to attract his love . The narrator , commenting on such hechizos , makes fun of the idea that they could be effective against free will : ? como si hubiese en el mundo yerbas , <p> encantos ni palabras suficientes a forzar el libre albedrfo ? ( 33-34 ) . And importantly , within Don Quijote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old alcahuete in the galeotes episode : ? Aunque bien sT que no hay hechizos en el mundo que puedan mover y forzar la voluntad , como algunos simples piensan ; que es libre nuestro albedrfo , y no hay yerba ni encanto que le fuerce ? ( I , 22 , 269 ) . He also defends free will in the Golden Age speech , when referring to young ladies whose ? perdici=n nacfa de su gusto y propria voluntad ? ( I , 11 , 157 ) . The underlying implication of these assertions is that someone who is enchanted is in some way susceptible , consciously or not , and is therefore morally responsible , as is the moral stance in the earlier English and Italian verse epics , as mentioned above . A Roman Inquisitional manual of the time states that the Devil can not coerce the will , although he can ? stir human fantasy , either by way of charms , or by inflaming the blood and the humours . . . . ? 58 The idea that an erotic enchantment can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Italian and English verse epics of the sixteenth century , is far from new . When Santa Teresa recounts in her Vida ( Ch. 5 ) the tale of a priest enchanted by his mistress , she considers him deluded but also morally responsible . However , in the creative literature of the Middle Ages , reflected in the later , pseudo-medieval Spanish romances of chivalry , the prevailing convention is that knights are powerless against erotic enchantments , unless protected by their own magic . We should also note , however , that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , the victims of other , non-erotic magic spells and enchantments ( curses on their crops or livestock , casting of the ? evil eye , ? etc. ) , might be considered deluded , but hardly deficient in will power . In most seventeenth-century literature the cases of magic and enchantment ? so much to the taste of both author and public ? are tempered in some way . In Zayas 's ? La inocencia castigada , ? for example , there is the strong suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchantment because of her husband 's neglect of her sexual needs , and in ? El desengao amando ? the supposed victim of enchantment is shown to be a money-hungry philanderer whom the maga might have attracted easily enough without resorting <p> to magic.59 So also with Castillo Sol=rzano 's ? La fantasma de Valencia , ? which plays upon the rage for ghost stories but avoids any possible accusations of giving credence to magic by revealing that the fantasma is only an ordinary human being in disguise . It is also worth recalling in the ? Escrutinio ? chapter of Don Quijote the priest 's much-cited condemnation of Montemayor 's magical solution to problems of love in La Diana : ? soy de parecer que no se queme , sino que se le quite todo aquello que trata de la sabia Felicia y de la agua encantada ? ( I , 6 , 118 ) . Avalle-Arce has noted ( 1974 ) that Cervantes 's rejection of supernatural solutions is also implicit in the episodes of Juan Palomeque 's inn in Part I , a place where as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without resorting to the supernatural.60 And with regard to the authorial distance maintained from the magic elements in Persiles , Stephen Harrison has recently suggested that Cervantes went back and added rationalizations to all of the magical elements after completing the novel . Once again , when magic is discounted , erotic enchantment may be seen as a metaphor for seductive power , in which the complicity of the victim is more likely . To return to Don Quixote 's case , then , for him to assert the presence of evil and envious enchanters represents no theological or moral problem within his chivalric fantasy world . On the other hand , Inquisitional censors were alert to possible heresies in Don Quijote as well as in other works , as we see in the censors ' well-known demand that Cervantes modify the Duchess 's remark to Sancho on faith versus good works in II , 36.61 Then again , it is possible that both Don Quixote 's remarks to the alcahuete and his pattern of behavior with what he perceives as predatory women mean that the omission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? attenuation ? of magic in several of Zayas 's tales but curiously does not mention the erotic enchantment that is most intricate and difficult , the one found in ? La inocencia castigada. ? Cf. Whitenack 's Zayas article , forthcoming in the Williamsen and Whitenack volume.60 As Avalle-Arce remarks in this context , ? Se hace obvio que la soluci=n ofrecida por Montemayor no es tal en opini=n de Cervantes ? ( 89 ) . Avalle-Arce also refers to what AmTrico Castro said on this subject in El pensamiento de Cervantes : ? Como explic= hace aos AmTrico Castro , el amor , fuerza vital , no puede ser desviado por medios sobrenaturales ? ( 89-90 ) . I am indebted to Michael McGaha for reminding me of Avalle-Arce 's remarks.61 On this point see AmTrico Castro , Hacia Cervantes. 69400 @qwx479400 <p> Don Quixote and the Romances of Chivalry <p> 85 <p> lascivious maga has less to do with authorial concerns with Inquisitional censors than with consistency in Don Quixote 's own moral code . Despite the many irresistible enchantments of faithful lovers depicted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when mad , that he can not be thus enchanted because he can not be susceptible , or else his whole self-created identity as a faithful lover is destroyed . Given the prevailing view on erotic enchantment , to allow himself to be enchanted by a lecherous lady would reflect upon his virtue by implying that he is not truly committed to sexual fidelity . Of course his resistance actually makes him superior to all of his model knights , since almost none of them could resist enchantment without magical help . Hence the significance of his defiance of spells in the Altisidora episode : he is usually only too willing to cede all power to enchanters and enchantments ( particularly when it is to his advantage to do so ) , but he can not damage his identity as the faithful lover without also damaging the essence of what makes him Don Quixote . In conclusion , as we look at two episodes not parodied by Cervantes ? the knight 's conversion of paganos and his enchantment by magas ? we can conclude that there is nevertheless some trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby Cervantes ) is demonstrably aware of both types of episode . The questions raised by the transformation of major episodes into shadowy references are in themselves a justification for reading the romances with care . Christian conversion and the ? purity of blood ? issues were so explosive at the time that having the mad knight try to convert someone to Christianity might have been seen as denigrating the Christian obligation to spread the faith and convert all unbelievers ( even if one doubted their sincerity later ) . Even Avellaneda , we will recall , makes his ? conversion or death ? scene into a burlesque ? just one more trick on his doltish Sancho , and while his erratic Don Quixote creates a pagan knight out of a Castilian nobleman , he never mentions converting him.62 Perhaps the most attractive thought is that Cervantes himself rejected enforced conversion as a modus operandi , but as a reasonable , humane man , rather than as one of converso <p> 62 Of course in ? El retablo de las maravillas ? Cervantes parodies people 's concerns about their ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far short of criticizing current Purity of Blood laws , although we might wish that we could find evidence of such criticism . <p> 86 <p> JUDITH A. WHITENACK <p> Cervantes <p> heritage.63 Certainly there is no evidence that he approved of conversions for convenience , and at the very least , it seems as if he did not wish to have his knight responsible for trying to turn a moro into a morisco , with the attendant complications.64 Cervantes may well be offering a vision of the moriscos which , however unsatisfactory to modern tastes , was quite open-minded for his time . As Mrquez Villanueva notes , just the presence of one sympathetic morisco is in itself original in the period.65 In the case of the enamoured maga , as we have said , one should first recall current beliefs on erotic enchantments , since Don Quixote tends not to go explicitly against any Catholic doctrines , no matter what his state of mind . Even more significant is the question of the ethical consistency of Don Quixote as a character . One of the most disturbing aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hard to imagine Cervantes 's Don Quixote doing the same ? the only possible interpretation of his falling victim to an erotic enchantment . As in the case of his attitude toward moriscos , Cervantes appears here to be approaching a modern idea : enchantment as a metaphor for seduction . And finally , this kind of study raises possibilities of alternative readings ? possibilities which can not be made certainties but still remain intriguing . If nothing else , a glimpse into the mind and creative methods of the all but inaccessible Cervantes would seem to be sufficient reward for reading all of those chivalric romances . <p> UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA , RENO <p> 63 On this point see Allen , II , 102-3.64 Mrquez Villanueva comments that neither Zoraida nor Ana FTlix is shown living happily ever after with her Christian husband . Does this represent Cervantes ' doubt on the sincerity of moriscos , or is it simply realism , in terms of possible happiness for such couples , or does it reflect his decreasing fondness for happy endings ? 65 See Personajes , 229-335 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ackerlind ( 33-56 ) on the moriscos and other marginal social groups in the period .

Along with the bound collections of their papers , there are single volume monographs , collective biographies ( e.g. , Joseph Ellis 's Founding Brothers ) and multi-volume collections ( Dumas Malone and Irving Brant 's respective studies on Jefferson and Madison ) . Finally , there are the biographies that are not really biographies at all . These books deal with the enduring influence of the founding generation on the nation 's political debates , its collective memory and its myth-making . While the legacies of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are firmly established in the nation 's consciousness , Stephen F. Knott 's highly readable work makes a persuasive case that Alexander Hamilton deserves to be included as well . <p> Knott 's book is organized around a survey of American politics and history from the founding period to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence and popularity of Hamiltonian ideas . Not surprisingly , Hamilton 's ideas carried the day during periods of rapid economic expansion and increased executive authority . The Civil War offered Hamilton his greatest vindication , particularly in the North , because of his commitment to the Union and the expansion of the federal government . Hamilton also enjoyed enormous popularity among business leaders during the Gilded Age because his prescient economic policies were credited with laying the groundwork for the nation 's prosperity . <p> While Knott does an admirable job in establishing Hamilton 's influence , Knott can never fully separate Hamilton from his chief rival , Thomas Jefferson . Over the past two centuries , their reputations and popularity have risen and fallen in opposition to one another . Yet , Jefferson has always overshadowed Hamilton , remaining the more popular and celebrated figure . Herbert Croly 's observation that the progressive era represented the triumph of Hamiltonian government through Jeffersonian means defines Hamilton 's dilemma . Although Hamilton 's ideas prevailed , Jefferson won the nation 's heart . <p> Hamilton 's seeming hostility towards democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unpopularity and one of the greatest challenges Knott faces in resurrecting Hamilton 's enduring legacy . Knott confronts Hamilton 's unpopularity from several angles . First , he describes the public 's reverence for Hamilton , as measured by the enormous crowds that gathered on the streets of New York City to witness his funeral procession . He also blames Jefferson 's longevity ( and careful cultivation of his reputation ) for Hamilton 's unpopularity . Knott cites the twenty-two year gap between Hamilton 's death in 1804 and Jefferson 's in 1826 in which the latter could " portray their differences in a most favorable light without fear of rebuttal " ( p. 9 ) . <p> The greatest damage to Hamilton 's popular reputation was allegedly inflicted by Hamilton himself and then widely repeated by his enemies . According to Henry Adams in his History of the United States of America During the First Administration of Thomas Jefferson ( 1889 ) , Hamilton , while attending a dinner in New York with John Adams , slammed his hand on the table and declared : " Your people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 ) ! The original source for this statement was the 1859 memoirs of Theophilus Parsons , a Massachusetts Federalist . Because Parsons did not attend the dinner and received this information fourth hand , Knott questions its veracity . As additional proof , Knott mentions that Parsons was an Adams supporter and Henry Adams , of course , was the great-grandson of Hamilton 's rival , John Adams . <p> Was Hamilton really an enemy of the people ? Aside from debunking this statement , Knott never tells us , other than to concede that Hamilton was no great fan of democracy . One of the weaknesses of this form of biography is that the individual gets lost amidst the mythology . If Knott hopes to resolve this issue definitively , he needs to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Hamilton 's statements and writings . <p> Myth-making also benefits politicians , while making a less certain biographical contribution . Knott cites numerous examples of the use of Hamilton ( as well as Jefferson ) by contemporary politicians over the past twenty years . While it is reassuring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invocations do justice to their ideas ? Would Thomas Jefferson be appalled that many Americans do not have affordable health care , as Bill Clinton has claimed ( p. 204 ) ? I wish Knott had devoted more attention to analyzing the myths rather than just documenting their existence . In the later chapters , his strong historical analysis collapses amidst a tedious compendium of contemporary references to Hamilton . Knott falls victim to this approach as he conjures a politically useful Hamilton . He concludes his otherwise strong book with the unexplored claim that a " return to Hamiltonianism could help fix what ails modern American politics by restoring the possibility for statesmanship and deliberation " ( p. 232 ) . <p> Combining historiography , political history and biography , Knott largely succeeds in taming Hamilton 's excesses and Jefferson 's shadow in order to establish Hamilton 's enduring influence on American politics . Remarkably , the debate between Jefferson and Hamilton over the appropriate size and role of the federal government continues to define the nation 's politics .

@@40786781 @786781/ <p> A Guest Who Brings Sharp Tweezers : Rights , Freedoms and Disempowerment in the New Malawi <p> For most Malawians , the biggest news story of 2006 was the adoption of the thirteen-month-old baby boy David Banda by the mega pop star Madonna . The adoption caused a storm both in Malawi and outside , but for very different reasons . Most of the views expressed in the mainstream media and on blogs in the West focused on whether Madonna was adopting David for reasons to do with enhancing her own media image ; yet in Malawi , the debate was on why human rights non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) were opposing the adoption . As far as comments expressed in the Malawian media and on the street went , human rights NGOs opposing the adoption were doing so for reasons that had little to do with baby David 's welfare , and everything to do with the NGOs ' own image . Many Malawians saw the NGOs ' actions as defending themselves from accusations that all they cared for was for their pockets and prestige , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists , from expensive SUVs to mansions in Malawi 's big cities . <p> Underneath the storm was a thinly veiled anger against NGOs that went beyond David Banda , an issue that has not received the adequate analytical attention it deserves . What were the many Malawians who expressed their anger at the human rights NGOs reacting to ? Was it the mere fact that the NGOs were seen as jealous of baby David , as many simplistically put it ? Was it the larger undefined nature of what has come to be seen as civil society in Malawi and their tendency to criticize the Malawi government in everything it does , and despise Malawian culture and traditions at every turn ? Or , was it a much more nuanced , much more epistemological difficulty arising from what Harri Englund in Prisoners of Freedom : Human Rights and the African Poor has called the abstraction and individualization of human rights as " freedom , " whose consequences so far have been the further marginalization of the African ( especially Malawian ) poor , and the entrenchment of elitism amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of a number of studies that examine the impact of NGOs since the 1994 advent of multiparty democracy in Malawi , few , if any , of them do what Harri Englund does in this book . Malawi 's 1994 transition from the thirty-year one-party dictatorship , under Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda , to multiparty democracy has been the subject of numerous studies both inside Malawi and outside . Change in Malawi was long coming , taking the form of movements and political parties largely outside Malawi . But it was 1992 that saw the first real bold move to criticize openly the government , through a lentern pastoral letter written by the country 's seven Catholic bishops . The several studies that have examined the transition period and the democratic process since then have been in fields such as theology , cultural and literary studies , politics , and education. 1 There have also been studies on the issue of language and how the insistence on English as the official language of government , politics , business , and education keeps the majority of Malawians , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the democratic process. 2 <p> Englund 's study is based on an engagement with Malawi that starts in 1999 , and becomes concentrated between 2001 and 2003 , when he does an ethnographic study that focuses on three particular aspects that capture the discourse on democracy , human rights , and freedom : the translation work on key documents in the political transition ; a civic education NGO ; and a legal aid NGO . Englund arrives at the conclusion that the human rights discourse on freedom and democracy , rather than empowering the ordinary Malawians that it takes as its main preoccupation , actually disempowers the very people it seeks to empower . It is a powerful and persuasive argument made painstakingly and eloquently throughout the study , relying on both fieldwork and critical analyzing . Englund uses what he terms " ethnographic witnessing " to expose how the disempowerment is operationalized in the way terms such as freedom and human rights have been translated into the national language , Chichewa . He further shows how the disempowerment operates in the way civic education and legal aid are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied . <p> The author organizes the book 's eight chapters around the above-mentioned three case studies of translations and the two human rights NGOs . Englund uses the acknowledgements section to demonstrate his near perfect facility with the national language of Malawi , writing half of it in almost flawless Chichewa with the syntax that characterizes the central region of Malawi , the arbiter of its linguistic excellence . Englund ventures into his thesis right there in the acknowledgements , saying human rights NGOs in Malawi have preoccupied themselves with technical , abstract , and neoliberal definitions of terms such as freedom and human rights in ways that do not carry much meaning in the lived lives of ordinary Malawians . The sense of elitism with which many Malawian youths have taken to their mission of educating the masses about democracy characterizes ordinary Malawians as ignorant of what democracy is , and lacking the wisdom and knowledge with which to live their daily lives . The manner in which the concepts of freedom and human rights have been translated into Chichewa means that the young people carrying civic education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of their own rights and benefits , rather than those of the ordinary people . <p> Still using Chichewa in the acknowledgements , Englund describes his main aim in writing the book as reminding his target audience that , in order to gain deeper insights into the lives of the poor , there is a need to live among them for sustained periods , with the aim of learning from them . That requires learning their language and their culture , and the hardships they experience . Englund says all this was lost on the young Malawians who were " unleashed " on to the masses , as the civic educators became more interested in their own freedoms and rights . He deploys a Malawian proverb that draws on folklore and talks about how it sometimes takes a guest coming in from the cold , seeking a place for the night , who has a sharp pair of tweezers , to remove a thorn from the foot of a child after the parents ' tweezers have failed . Englund was that guest , but one who had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still warmly welcomed into the communities in which he conducted his ethnographic witnessing . <p> The introduction to the book identifies the sources that inform Englund 's intellectual framework , ranging from Michel Foucault to Megan Vaughan to Amartya Sen to Jean and John Comaroff , and African and Malawian thinkers such as Tiyambe Zeleza , Thandika Mkandawire , Kings Phiri , Francis Nyamnjoh , Edrine Kayambazinthu , Pascal Kishindo , and James Tengatenga , among many others . The first chapter takes up where the introduction leaves off and continues the discussion of intellectual sources of the study , defining the Foucauldian notion of " governmentality " and how it works to situate human rights as individual freedoms in an African postcolonial context . Chapter 2 discusses how a major factor in the way that the " rights " and " freedom " discourse disempowers the poor can be discerned in the way these concepts have been translated into Chichewa in Malawi , and Chinyanja in Zambia . One revealing finding in Englund 's linguistic analysis is how , when translated back into the English language in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , far removed from the realities of the people the civic education endeavor is aimed at . For example , the Chichewa translation for " human rights " has been given as " maufulu achibadidwe , " which in English means something close to " birth freedoms , " and not quite human rights ( p. 49 ) . <p> Englund argues that this kind of ( mis ) translation arises from the undue emphasis on political and civil freedoms in both Malawi and Zambia ( p. 53 ) , to the exclusion of people 's local wisdom , relationships , and aspirations . He cites Pascal Kishindo , a leading linguist at the University of Malawi , who has argued that the Chichewa translation for human rights , " maufulu achibadidwe , " is in fact a new coinage , and that " zomuyenerera za munthu " would have been a more accurate and contextually relevant translation . The elitist , cavalier attitude with which the translation exercise was undertaken is put into sharp relief in the way Englund , a white researcher , was treated for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malawian human rights activists . " Where will you go with it " asked one activist ( p. 25 ) , in a dismissive tone that typifies the reaction of many educated Malawians towards Malawian languages . Many others treated Englund 's preference for Chichewa with unveiled mirth . And the problem of what Englund terms " poor translations for poor people " ( p. 54 ) , with key governance documents being written in European languages and translations into indigenous languages being merely a formality , can also be found in many other African countries. 3 <p> Chapters 3 and 4 draw on the implications of the manner in which the translations were done , demonstrating how human rights activists viewed themselves as a privileged class set apart from the villagers whom they saw as illiterate , uneducated , and primitive--prone to misunderstanding democracy . The human rights NGO in question in these chapters , the National Initiative for Civic Education ( NICE ) , European-funded and run by the German Technical Agency for Development ( GTZ ) , trained its activists to maintain political neutrality , a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was otherwise required to empower ordinary Malawians . Englund describes a training session in which villagers exhibited their impatience with the abstraction of " human rights " and " freedoms " and began shouting to the young activists facilitating the training about their material needs and economic problems . In keeping with the position of neutrality , the young activists stayed close to their script of how to define " freedoms " and the villagers ' need for more civic education . <p> By far the most compelling narrative in the study is introduced in chapter 5 and culminates in chapter 6 , in a detailed , heart-wrenching account of the flagrant abuses and open exploitation that a Malawian man working for a Malawian of Indian origin went through , with the active complicity of the legal officer of the legal aid human rights organization , the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation ( CHRR ) . Englund foregrounds the story of Yamikani Chikondi , who worked for Hassam Patel , with a section titled " The Politics of Complexion , " in which he provides some facts and figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A long but necessary quote buttresses his argument : <p> " Complexion remains an index of wealth and opportunity , with most Europeans and Asians enjoying vastly higher standards of living than most black Malawians . Virtually all expatriates , as well as those Asians who have acquired Malawian citizenship and the black elite , live in urban residential areas that the impoverished majority visit only as servants , guards , petty traders , laborers , and occasionally , armed robbers . Although apartheid was never formally instituted in Malawi , segregation is also evident in diet , modes of transport , pastimes , and numerous other everyday contexts . Foreign professionals also tend to be paid more than similarly qualified Malawians . Expatriate aid workers , in turn , usually wallow in their luxury , exempt from tax and employing domestic servants and other support personnel " ( pp. 132-133 ) . <p> Yamikani Chikondi worked for Hassam Patel as a lorry boy , whose duties entailed accompanying the driver of Patel 's hardware store on various trips ferrying truckloads of customer merchandise to various parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month ( MK900=Malawi Kwacha ) , about two-thirds of the stipulated minimum wage in the 2001-2003 period . Yamikani was never told in advance of any impending trips ; instead , he was abruptly ordered to accompany the lorry whenever such trips came up . Many times the trips lasted two weeks , during which time he did not even have a change of clothes , let alone a chance to inform his wife and children before leaving . On such trips , Chikondi 's responsibilities included sleeping in or near the lorry as a guard . He was given the equivalent of about US $1.70 to survive on for those two weeks . The government 's stipulation was US $8.00 per day , but none of this was known to Chikondi . Chikondi was fired from the job after three months , on unproven suspicions that he may have connived with other workers who were caught stealing electrical switches sold in the shop . Englund dedicates a good amount of his gripping and touching storytelling and social justice analysis to this particular case , painting an alarming picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of their European , Asian , and elite Malawian employers . <p> Englund 's " ethnographic witnessing " led him to uncover the double contempt workers such as Chikondi suffer , first from their employers who treat them as " something less than human " ( p. 153 ) , and then from the Malawians who are supposed to represent and stand up for them in their recourse to justice . The legal officer handling Chikondi 's case chose not to disclose to Chikondi that his salary and travel allowances were below the minimum wage in the first place . The case dragged on for several months , during which time Chikondi had no income , yet he was required by the CHRR legal officer to keep coming back at his own expense , and to provide the legal officer with money for transporting him to carry out his investigations . <p> When the case eventually ended , the legal officer had ostensibly taken the side of Patel in assigning blame to Chikondi for causing the whole problem , and in denying him just recompense . The legal officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MK317 ) as salary and unpaid allowances , which Patel extracted from a thick bundle of crisp new MK500 banknotes , while complaining , without any sense of irony or even remorse , that freedom of employment was creating problems for employers like him . The last two chapters of the book deal with the issue of human rights and mob justice , and a recapping of the study 's main arguments and conclusions . <p> In the concluding pages , Englund focuses on the project of " Redeeming Freedom , " the title for the last chapter . He writes , " Sticking to the idea of freedom is more than a mere concession to the realpolitik of neoliberalism . The need is to reclaim freedom from its abuse in neoliberal projects , which carry , in many parts of Africa , uncanny similarities to the late-colonial orders of exclusion and exploitation " ( p. 200 ) . Such a comparison , while accurate , to a large extent , is apt to be viewed differently amongst the different groups that constitute the audience for the message Englund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seen as making a persuasive argument for those who see NGOs as having pulled the carpet out from under the feet of African governments , in the way NGOs absorb not only donor money but also the foreign ideologies of the places where the money comes from . <p> Englund 's argument will also be equally favorable to those who see the educated African elite as a major player in the perpetuation of the poverty and disempowerment of the majority of African masses , seen as illiterate , uneducated , and in need of civic education as to what democracy , human rights , and freedom entail . Here is where this study might also manage to please an unlikely audience probably not intended by Englund--the Afro-pessimists . The depiction of the powerful moneyed elites with the ideological and financial backing of Western donors pitted against powerless , poor , illiterate villagers will appear to some to be a disavowal of whatever vestige of hope was remaining for a neoliberal economic order . The near absence of the role of government in the study gives the appearance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , as Englund has attempted to represent , is quite different , but this point can easily be lost in the quagmire of rigid debates about African hope and despair . <p> Since 2004 , with the holding of Malawi 's third multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections , the sense of national pride and confidence amongst Malawians has palpably been on the rise . Inflation has come down to single digits , the food reserves are registering their most abundant amounts , donor confidence is back , and Malawi has been forgiven US $1.4 billion of debt under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative. 4 The country has always been stable , and has never experienced any civil conflict . Problems such as HIV/AIDS , infant mortality , and poverty are still rampant , but the government 's positive presence can be felt especially among the middle class in as far as fiscal responsibility and economic stability go . A number of high-profile corruption cases have been and are still being prosecuted . There is a general sense amongst many Malawians that their country is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full potential . Malawi 's transition to multiparty democracy has over time come to be seen as one of the best examples of peaceful handovers of power on the African continent and elsewhere . Very little of the advances the country has made since the transition , however ( especially the resurgence after 2004 , not to mention the peaceful transition in 1994 ) , receive the due acknowledgement they deserve . Many scholars and commentators still find it easier to focus on the problems and failures. 5 Also lacking from analyses is the resurgence of the indigenous philosophy of uMunthu and its collective responsibility for the well-being of the community , which is gaining scholarly attention especially among theology and psychology scholars , as well as in the popular media . <p> The appearance of the absence of government in the daily affairs of Malawians in Englund 's study partly derives from the tendency by Englund to lapse into opaque theorizing , in what some may see as an apparently overzealous attempt to ground the study in Foulcauldian analysis . In quite a few places , Englund 's choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases the lexicography does not live up to the standards that otherwise undergird much of the study . This is illustrated when Englund begins the narrative of the dehumanization of Chikondi : " Critical analysis subverts its own objectives if it does not include activists ' contradictory position in regard to human rights " ( p. 145 ) . Englund wants to simply state that his critical analysis also includes contradictions between what the subjects in his study said and what they did in practice , an example being a constant refrain from the legal officer in Chikondi 's case who kept insisting that he had no mercy for Asians who abused the rights of less-privileged Malawians . Yet in practice , these activists and other elites collude , albeit unwittingly , with the rich and powerful tormentors of poor Malawians . <p> The introduction of the book and its first two chapters are the most difficult to read , owing to Englund 's attempt to foreground a theoretical framework of the contradictions in the discourse on democracy , human rights , and freedom . In quite a few places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their analytical pedigree in the annals of Western theorizing , make little sense to African practicalities . The penultimate chapter of the book deals with a case of mob justice and the street-vending scene in Chinsapo , a township of the capital city Lilongwe , but it is difficult for the reader to actually understand what the relevance of the discussion is to the gist of the book 's argument about the disempowering effects of elite discourse on democracy , human rights , and freedom . <p> I opened this review with the story of the furious debate caused by Madonna 's adoption of a Malawian child , David Banda . The question I posed at the beginning was about the origin of the anger expressed by Malawians at NGOs opposing the adoption. 6 While not providing the definitive answer to that narrow question ( after all the adoption occurred after the book was already published ) , Englund 's ethnographic witnessing of the actual practices of human rights NGOs in Malawi is quite revealing of the tensions that have surfaced about the manner in which the concepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both into indigenous languages , as well as into well-intended , activist fieldwork among the poor .

Worrall ( University of Sheffield ) Published on Jhistory ( March , 2016 ) Commissioned by Robert A. Rabe <p> As the sheer size of Margaret Blanchard 's 1998 encyclopedic work would testify , histories of mass media in the United States face the immediate problem of balancing scope with reader accessibility . This problem intensifies when , as Jim Cullen attempts in this work , you try to talk about the topic directly to high school students . To try and encompass centuries of history across various forms of media in under three hundred student-friendly pages is a daunting challenge , and it comes as no real surprise that this work stumbles a couple of times along the way . However , that does not take away from what is ultimately an ambitious and engaging text that largely succeeds in delivering academic discussion to that most stereotypically unreceptive of audiences . <p> Formatted in the traditional model of a history textbook , A Short History of the Modern Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " literature , radio , theater , television , cinema , and the Internet " with selected case and genre studies that highlight significant examples of each . Through his introduction , Cullen stresses the importance of connectivity in this definition of media . Not only are his forms of media defined as the " medium " between performer and audience , but he also stresses how individual mediums must be seen as part of a wider " media " and as parts of a wider cultural phenomenon ( pp. 2 , - 3 ) . This emphasis on connectivity between media forms is something impressively reinforced throughout this work , as his chapters discussing each individual media form manage to touch upon key relationships with the others without the chapters losing their individual focuses . Perhaps his best example of this is his discussion of television , wherein he notes its direct relationship with radio , and how the two genres first competed and then found distinct individual voices into the early 1960s . He then continues this- into his discussion of the television sitcom , and shows- how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers ) originated their careers in radio . <p> Each of his chapters therefore acts like the gradual adjustment of a film projector , as general histories of a medium smoothly focus onto first a genre and then a particular " text " in that genre that serves as a case study . While individual choices of " relevant " case studies will always leave some dissatisfied , Cullen 's selection finds a smart balance between the classic ( Edgar Allen Poe ) and the refreshingly modern ( Taylor Swift ) . Much like his genre studies , each manages to stay broadly focused on the genre in which it is situated . However , there is a deliberate and intelligent through line that reinforces both its overarching discussions of inter-medium connectivity and the particular relevance of each chosen source to both its genre and those it connected to . <p> This he perhaps best demonstrates through his analysis of the hit single Beat It from Michael Jackson 's landmark album Thriller . Not only is he keen to stress the obvious impacts of visual media on the chosen song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in his wider reflections on the album he also- continues discussions of the supernatural and storytelling that were first referenced in the case studies for theater ( the American musical ) and literature ( horror ) . Through that , he convincingly outlines how elements of classic media can be seen in the genesis and execution of one of the modern pop music 's most iconic pieces of art . When one skims over this text 's contents page , his choice of case studies seems as scatter-shot as anything . In reality , each is delicately linked to others without ever feeling overly contrived or forced. - <p> Throughout the text , Cullen successfully walks a fine line of intellectual accessibility without ever getting too lost in either academic obtuseness or an over-eagerness to simplify . There are , however , occasional moments when the attempts to talk directly to the student jar ; " reading does remain a way to have fun . Seriously " ( p. 30 ) .

Moreover , the concluding discussions on digital media lack the depth and texture of the previous chapters , perhaps in part because its ever-changing modernity makes it a harder medium to tie together- as concisely . <p> Such issues , however , do not detract too much away from what is ultimately an impressive and useful work .

@@40786789 @786789/ <p> Madeleine Zelin from Columbia University explores in great detail the Zigong salt industry in southern Sichuan from its rise in the early nineteenth century to its decline in the late 1930s . Zigong 's economic importance peaked in the late nineteenth century when it became the largest industrial center in China . This was mainly due to the ability of Zigong merchants or entrepreneurs to mobilize capital , develop and utilize new technologies to exploit the rich deposits of brine and natural gas , capture markets , and build and sustain corporate business organizations . Thus , the phenomenal rise of Zigong 's industry provides a rare opportunity to examine China 's indigenous industrial development independently of foreign influences . Greatly expanding our knowledge of business organization and practices in late imperial and twentieth-century China , Zelin 's monograph is an eye-opener for this indigenous process. - <p> Zelin 's research is based on three types of historical sources : first , official compilations , such as salt gazetteers , salt administration histories , collections of essays on salt administration , and local and provincial gazetteers ; second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case records of legal suits and salt business accounts ; and third , transcribed oral histories . Zelin begins her study by examining the specific business environment of Sichuan until the 1870s . Operating under circumstances not dissimilar to a free market economy , salt merchants were allowed to regulate themselves and utilize contracts to run their businesses . Significantly , the breakdown of the Qing Empire 's salt administration during the Taiping Rebellion ( 1851-64 ) caused the Zigong salt industry 's rise to dominating the market for salt in the southwest and in parts of central China . At the same time , salt yards in the districts of Fushun ( aka Ziliujing ) and Rongxian ( aka Gongjing ) , an area today known as Zigong , achieved a competitive edge through technological innovation . As the author argues , both politics and technology worked together in creating conditions favorable to industrial expansion in Furong ( i.e. , Fushun and Rongxian ) . It is important to note that from the 1820s onward , improvement of deep drilling technology allowed for the excavation of highly productive black-brine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . These black-brine wells produced more brine and in much higher concentration than the yellow-brine wells in former times . On account of its greatly increased efficiency of the salt production process , the development of these black-brine wells represents a milestone in the history of the salt industry in southern Sichuan , particularly at Furong. - <p> Although deep drilling promised high profits , it was a labor-intensive as well as capital-intensive undertaking with considerable attendant risks . Despite slender private wealth and a lack of industrial banking , investment in the productive capacities of the Furong salt yard remained robust just because of the promise of high profits and market expansion . Thus , the Furong salt yard wells became the focus of complex business partnerships that attracted the capital of both kin and non-kin , locals and outsiders . The management of these partnerships , which encompassed factors of capitalization , land ownership , drilling equipment , technical expertise , and managerial talent , had many characteristics in common with the management of modern industrial firms . Elaborating on the evolution of these business partnerships by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both small and large holders of capital were willing to tie up resources for long periods of time , thereby challenging long-held assumptions about Chinese preferences for quick returns. - Zellin deals with the growth of these business partnerships in chapters 2 and 3. - <p> In chapter 4 , her discussion turns to the four merchant families who dominated the Zigong salt industry between the 1850s and 1930s . As Zelin shows , lineage-based trusts were the organizational foundation of the major salt firms . They allowed for the development of vertically integrated holdings with minimal outside investment . Zelin argues convincingly that these Chinese lineage trusts were as successful as many Western counterparts in capital formation , managerial organization , and innovation . Chapter 5 deals with the labor environment of the Furong salt yards . The central point of this chapter 's discussion is that many features associated with the rise of modern industry--such as a permanent , full-time work force , division of labor , and substantial hierarchical managerial control over labor--may as well be seen as emerging from the nineteenth- and early twentieth-centuries Sichuan salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts in the late nineteenth century to force the Zigong salt industry under tighter governmental control . Zelin elaborates on the effects of market restrictions , the implementation of the guanyun ( official transport and merchant sale ) system , and an increase in revenue extraction from Sichuan salt sales on Sichuan salt producers . The last chapters deal with the changes that the Zigong salt industry underwent in the early twentieth century and its eventual decline . Along with political instability in early twentieth-century China , new technological developments--in particular , the exploitation of rock-salt and wide-diameter wells--resulted in a boom-bust cycle that finally led to the decline of the Sichuan salt market . Based on painstaking research , this comprehensive study provides new fascinating insights into the forces and networks that shaped Chinese business and industrial development in late imperial China and will give direction to further research in business history . Pointing to many striking similarities with the development in the West , it is also a great work in comparative history. - 
@@40786791 @786791/ <p> At bottom , Charles C. Mann 's wide-ranging and well-written book is an effort to debunk a series of myths about pre-Columbian America . According to Mann , the history he and millions of others were taught was " wrong in almost every aspect . Indians were here far longer than previously thought ... and in much greater numbers . And they were so successful at imposing their will on the landscape that in 1492 Columbus set foot in a hemisphere thoroughly marked by humankind " ( p. 4 ) . In three sections , Mann skillfully develops these broad points , synthesizing decades of scholarly work on pre-Columbian population numbers ; the impact of Old World pathogens , plants , and animals ; Ice Age migrations ; the formation and collapse of complex societies in North America , Mesoamerica , and South America ; and other topics . As this summation suggests , Mann 's work is very broad in scope , ranging in time and space from Ice Age Beringia to twentieth-century Amazonia and drawing on the secondary literature in history , anthropology , and archaeology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , basing his conclusions on interviews , his own observations as well as the scholarly literature , and many of his findings will be familiar to academic historians . One of the most interesting features of Mann 's book for specialists is how little effect the scholarship of the last twenty-plus years has had in dispelling the tenacious and pernicious myths of what the Americas were like before the arrival of Europeans . Alfred Crosby outlined much of Mann 's argument about pathogens and domesticated animals forty years ago , while William Cronon argued more than twenty years ago that Indians routinely modified the natural world , especially with fire . The list could go on , and yet stereotypes of Native American life persist : undergraduates enter the classroom convinced that Indians lived in harmony with the natural world , that Indian polities were free of coercion , and that Indians for the most part shunned urban settings and complex , stratified societies in order to live in small groups scattered in isolation across a primordial wilderness . <p> The first virtue of Mann 's book is its skillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underpinnings of this view and showing how understanding Indians as paleo-hippies deprives them of the sort of human agency Europeans are always understood to possess . To cite only one example , in describing the disastrous environmental modifications that led to the demise of Cahokia ( clear-cutting and diverting waterways ) , Mann makes it clear that the great population center 's collapse was due primarily to catastrophic decisions on the part of its leaders . Placing responsibility in the hands of Europeans , Eurasian pathogens , or climatic forces like drought risks assigning Indians a passive role in their own history . <p> A third virtue is the clarity with which Mann summarizes the dense and tense scholarly arguments surrounding his various subjects , including their implications for present-day political questions . The presence of large pre-Columbian population centers in Amazonia , for example , might excuse continued development of the region , with possibly destructive effects on the region 's fragile ecosystem . The " overkill " hypothesis , in which early migrants to North America killed off all the Pleistocene megafauna , suggests in one view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , as stewards of the natural world , they were as wasteful as the Europeans and Americans who succeeded them . Efforts to arrive at pre-Columbian population figures are fraught with disagreement and controversy , much of it hinging on the scale of the slaughter that directly resulted from the arrival of the Europeans . In each of these cases , Mann 's book might prove valuable in an undergraduate classroom as a means to introduce students to the minutia and expansive implications of ( some ) scholarly debates . <p> Some of the most interesting assertions Mann makes center on foods and food production . Claiming that a complex of settlements at Norte Chico on the Peruvian coast dating from c. 3000 B.C. were the first cities in the Americas and the point of departure for later Andean societies , Mann dismisses the pat connection between the Neolithic Revolution , urbanization , and complex societies found in most World Civilization textbooks . Norte Chico had no need for food crops , and indeed cultivated only cotton systematically , since this dense , urban civilization was able to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current . <p> Another food-related point has to do with maize cultivation and the discovery of the fruitful combination of maize , beans , and squash from both a nutritional and horticultural perspective . This is an utterly familiar story , though one worth retelling . Here , it serves as evidence for one of Mann 's overarching themes : the somewhat strained assertion that the " New World " ( the term itself might be anomalous , if the Americas were inhabited before Europe ) was equal in its civilizations , population , and accomplishments to the " Old World . " In Mann 's view , the extraordinarily difficult and mysterious process by which maize was genetically engineered from obscure and unpromising wild grasses makes it a cultural achievement on par with those of ancient and classical Eurasian civilizations . <p> Certainly the most unfamiliar , and perhaps the most striking , assertion in Mann 's text is the evidence for large population centers in Amazonia . Given the region 's lack of stone and the harsh treatment climate and soil give to organic remains , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Olmecs . But Mann argues that a type of soil known as terra preta , ingeniously enriched with charcoal and therefore far more fertile and durable than the thin , acidic soils of the rainforest , appeared at roughly the same time as other evidence of human habitation and spread along with it . <p> Finally , Mann has an admirable eye for imagery and detail . Suggesting that Europeans entered a world transformed by disease and the invasions of non-native plants and animals is old news . Suggesting that the images Europeans used to express the bounty of the American continent--vast flocks of passenger pigeons and limitless herds of bison--were instead evidence of an ecology thrown out of balance is a new and striking way to express the point . <p> Despite its virtues , there are limitations in any effort to encompass so much in a single volume . First , in his comparison of American and Eurasian civilizations , Mann is quick to seize on the size of cities and their probable populations in order to compare , say , Cahokia with London . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stress that Cahokia played a very different role than London did . The fact that Cahokia was a dense concentration of farmers living near a temple complex made it a very different place than the medieval and early modern European city . <p> Those hoping to find in Mann 's book an overview of the empires of the Inca and Aztecs/Triple Alliance might find fault with his summary of those histories . Often in those sections , Mann downplays tensions and conflicts within Indian groups in order to maintain his focus on American/European comparisons , and as a result the Inca institution of the mita and the Mexica practice of human sacrifice are de-emphasized . <p> The book 's final section is disappointing . In it , Mann describes how European interactions with and observations of the Five ( or Six ) Nations/Haudenosaunee inspired the American ideals of freedom and individual liberty . Mann supports his argument in part by pointing out that English settlers consistently ran off to live with the Indians during the early period of settlement . Mann mistakenly assumes that these " White Indians " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when those in early Plymouth were equally likely to flee hunger , and those in Jamestown the " starving time " of 1609-10 and the brutal martial law regime that followed it . Moreover , neither group ran away to join the Haudenosaunee : the Jamestown settlers were far away , and the English in New England were terrified of the Mohawks , whom they regarded as fierce cannibals . Some were captured , but to support this point Mann would need to explain why many captives were equally unwilling to return from French families . <p> This reviewer 's disappointment with Mann 's " Coda " is not rooted only in its errors of fact . As Mann outlines yet another scholarly controversy , the so-called Iroquois influence thesis , he does so for the first time without naming it or acknowledging that there are arguments on both sides of the issue . Further , in this section Mann abandons the crucial distinction between firsthand accounts and later reminiscences . The Five Nations were not necessarily a " feminist dream " just because nineteenth-century feminists " drew inspiration " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston Tea Party might have disguised themselves as Mohawks not because they had declared themselves rebels seeking to establish a polity inspired by the Mohawk example , but because they sought to portray themselves as American , outside British law , and fearless . Once Indians ceased to play a vital role in everyday life , as a source of food , valued allies , and feared enemies , there were ( and are ) plenty of writers willing to look to them for misinformed inspiration , yet Mann places only Henry David Thoreau in this category . <p> It makes for a weak conclusion , but these minor points aside , the book remains a valuable option for undergraduate courses in Native American history , Atlantic history , or World Civilizations . 
@@40786793 @786793/ <p> Christopher Ehret is the latest senior scholar to weigh in with a new text for teaching African history to undergraduates . He limits the text to a time frame near his own specialty in early African history . The text covers what many instructors , myself included , cover in the first semester of a two-semester sequence of introductory courses to African history , or the first two quarters of a three-quarter sequence . Many instructors find this first part of the sequence very difficult to teach . It can cover everything from human origins to the origins of agriculture , Egypt , Africa and classical antiquity , the origins of metal working and " Bantu expansion , " Islam and increased trade , and the rise of the slave trade . Instructors often have great difficulty in finding coherence in such a large chunk of historical space and time . <p> Early African history , though , is the place where the innovative and interdisciplinary nature of the field of African history , within the discipline , has been most apparent . Lacking written sources , Africanist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral tradition from folklore and ethnography to historical source , and , most recently , data from the environmental sciences on climate change to pioneer new methods of historical reconstruction . For more than three decades , Ehret has been in the front lines of these battles . He has had a huge impact on the development of the field as a scholar , as a mentor ( together with his many distinguished colleagues at UCLA over the years ) , and as a member of the profession . Ehret 's work has been and remains controversial . Over the course of his career he has used linguistic history to create a grand narrative of African history before the modern era . Using what he labels the " comparative method , " Ehret has attempted to reconstruct the history of language change and movement . He has moved from original case studies in East Africa to a continental scale . His methods and conclusions have come under heavy criticism from historians , archaeologists , and linguists . Ehret 's willingness to put dates on his reconstruction of language divisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges of " crypto-glottochronology , " the discredited simple connection of language difference and time . His willingness to associate languages with archaeological cultures leads some archaeologists to fits , but not perhaps as much as his implicit and explicit calls for archaeologists to search for validation for his own linguistically derived conclusions . His willingness to emphasize language as a preeminent determinant of culture comes in for its share of attack . Given his willingness to focus on the grand narrative despite his critics , he would seem well placed to produce a survey text . <p> And so he has . This text provides a grand narrative for the period from about 30,000 years ago up to at least the rise of Islam and in many ways to the beginning of the modern era ( if one takes the maritime revolution as marking the beginning of that era ) . Ehret does so by taking the term " civilization " and using it to mean an association of linguistic and material items that can be linked together from linguistic historical analysis and archaeology . His civilizations are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afrasan ( or Afro-Asiatic ) , Nilo-Saharan , Niger-Congo , and Khoisan . He connects this schema to archaeological cultures in ways that specialists might find questionable if applied to every single archaeological site but seems broadly consistent with the evidence . He often judiciously notes where his conclusions lack full confirmation . He places at the forefront the development of subsistence strategies and technology , focusing on the spread of food production in Africa . Yet Ehret also provides a fairly detailed discussion of the development of political institutions and religious ideas and practices based on linguistic reconstruction . He follows the changes of his four civilizations as they spread across the continent . As Ehret moves his narrative closer to the present , he uses archaeological and documentary sources to inform more detailed discussions of particular societies at particular moments . Moving into the Islamic age , and hence into the period where at least some documentary evidence exists , he keeps the narrative firmly focused on the dynamics of African societies . By the beginning of what he calls the Atlantic Age ( after 1500 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as the histories of diverging separate societies differentiate themselves from his common civilizations . <p> Having outlined Ehret 's basic approach to African history in his text , the remainder of this review will address three specific questions . First , is Ehret 's basic approach valid as a meta-narrative for African history ? Second , if it is , does Ehret in this text make the best case for it ? And finally , how effective is this approach and this text in teaching undergraduates African history ? I will admit to having lived with this book for a while now . Several months before , I was asked to review the volume , I read the book and decided to use it in the first semester of a two-semester introduction to African history sequence at Texas Southern , a historically black university in Houston . I chose the volume over the available options because it emphasized the interaction between human societies and their environments over the very long run and provided a depth of detail about the very earliest eras of African history not found in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked my students to share with me their impressions of the volume . <p> The great strength of this volume lies in the robust analytical framework Ehret has developed . Yet that strength relies on what would seem to be the most contested element of Ehret 's work . He bases much of the work on the development of different languages out of mother languages as a sign of social and technological change . The amount of work he can draw on to make such conclusions is truly impressive . His own recent syntheses form much of the background to this volume , but it also draws on the work of his students and of many others in both linguistic history and linguistics itself. 1 He is extremely well read in the archaeological and environmental science literatures . <p> Ehret does an effective job of selling his model . The first four chapters lay out a comprehensive scheme for the development of African societies , from the beginnings of the development of his separate civilizations through the development of food production to the spread of Bantu languages across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of the data available . He consistently pushes the dates for the origins of crop cultivation back beyond those of most archaeologists . He begins with a date of about 13,000 BCE for intensive grain collection by Afrasan speaking peoples . He dates true food production to the Holocene optimum climate regime around 9000 BCE when speakers of Sudanic languages combined intensive grain collection with the domestication of cattle . He argues that cattle keeping then spread north into North Africa among Afrasan speaking peoples before the spread of goats and sheep into the region from southwest Asia . He dates the origins of yam cultivation to about 8000 BCE in West Africa . He charts the history of elaboration with influences spreading both north and south in the northern half of Africa . Along the way , he cites evidence for the second earliest invention of pottery and the earliest invention of cotton weaving . Finally , he claims the evidence shows an independent invention of iron working at some point before 1000 BCE in the area broadly between Lake Chad and Lake Nyanza ( Victoria ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs and social practices based on the reconstruction of retentions and borrowings in languages , arguing that Saharo-Sahelian generally believed in one high god , which he calls monotheism , while Afrasan speakers generally believed in clan deities . <p> This synthesis is truly radical ; but is it right ? For these early periods , many arguments are not yet supported by archaeology . Before the evidence from Nabta Playa in western Egypt became fully integrated into our understanding of these issues , few would have dated food production in sub-Saharan Africa before 3000 BCE , and most would have argued that cattle as well as sheep and goats diffused into Africa from southwest Asia . Since then , more have been willing to at least speculate that food production originated much earlier in Africa. 2 Yet the evidence remains indirect . While grindstones are common from sites in the Sahara , many point out that these can indicate intensive exploitation of wild grasses rather than true agriculture . Likewise , many of his conclusions concerning religious beliefs have been contested as having multiple interpretations . Finally , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled , with some scholars still seeing merit in younger dates for iron working allowing for diffusion from North Africa . As scholarship , Ehret 's conclusions are a valid enough starting place for questioning the evidence or designing research programs , but his conclusions are not all validated by detailed research . <p> Ehret 's presentation requires much from the instructor in terms of contextualization . Ehret presents his conclusions as valid without discussing the scholarship behind them or the debates about them . As an instructor , I felt compelled to spend much time in class outlining some of the debates around Ehret 's conclusions and the methods he and other scholars used in reaching them . Such an exercise proved a strength of the class , in my opinion , but it got little help from Ehret 's text . He provides very few bibliographic citations and only occasionally discusses the debates around his arguments . At the end of each chapter , he provides brief notes for students and teachers . These I found not particularly enlightening ; they could provide a perfect opportunity for discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ehret 's approach also becomes more problematic , especially as the book moves through time . While certainly alive to the ways people and cultures interact , the overall effect of much of his analysis is to focus on language as the carrier of culture . This focus , in turn , often overemphasizes retentions at the expense of innovations and borrowings . This problem arises more in the presentation of a volume like this one than in Ehret 's scholarship , but teaching this method to a classroom full of African Americans who do not feel that the Indo-European , Germanic roots of their language says much about their culture does give one pause . Again , I hope it has led my students to some productive discussions about these issues . <p> The last four chapters of the book which cover the period from 300 to 1800 were for me the most problematic to teach . Ehret retains his focus on the growing diversity of languages and cultures which leads to what seems , at times , an increasingly shotgun effect to the presentation . Each chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some details about each . Ehret 's original emphasis of " four civilizations " recedes , not totally out of the picture , but to the background , as it should , given the increasing diversity of African societies . Throughout these sections , Ehret also tries to maintain a focus on the internal dynamics of African societies . Again , this focus is laudable and useful for teaching . But sometimes I felt Ehret has over-corrected for the external orientation of popular conceptions of Africa 's past . I think it is important for students to understand the history of Islam in Africa from ca. 700 CE on and of the rise of the Atlantic world and the modern world system after 1500 . Ehret really only mentions these themes rather than making them a central part of his analysis . I believe both are central for different regions of Africa and can be made part of a cohesive survey of African history while maintaining Ehret 's focus on African dynamics . He makes very little mention of literate sources for African history . This lack reflects his emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for an imperfect but increasingly important source for African history as he moves through the volume , but also serves to de-emphasize the connections between Africans and outsiders from the beginning of the Islamic era on . <p> In particular , I think Ehret 's presentation of the Atlantic trade after 1500 , especially the slave trade , does not do justice to the importance of that trade for African or world history . He does more than adequately discuss the histories of several regions involved in the trade , but because he does not make trade with Europeans a compelling focus of the narrative , the issue gets lost . He does not even mention the numbers of Africans involved in the trade , a pointed absence given his willingness to go out on a limb about earlier periods of African history . Even given the contested nature of such issues , I have found that the slave trade is one of the entry points into African history my students have always brought to my classes and to de-emphasize it as a theme , where appropriate and given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical point of engagement between peoples inside and outside Africa . <p> Despite my comments above , I enjoyed using this book in the classroom . It spoke much better to the foundations of African civilizations than any other one available in field . It certainly gives the most comprehensive coverage to the very early history of the peoples of the continent . Trying to give students some idea of the debates surrounding issues like language change , the origins of agriculture and metal working , and the spread of Bantu languages challenged me to revisit some of the literature . Bringing a more thorough discussion of the impact of Islam and of the Atlantic trade would make it better , but the volume still gives more than enough information . Likewise more discussion of methodology and the debates about important issues , perhaps in the annexes to each chapter , would be helpful . The maps are very good and while the black-and-white pictures , mostly of African artifacts and art objects , are well labeled and sometimes striking , they do not always add a great deal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate to both how students reacted to the text and how much they learned using it . Here , based on my students ' comments , the text worked very well . Ehret 's structure gave them a solid frame around which to build their acquisition of new knowledge . Some students came into the class with some experience with African issues and others with none . Both groups seemed to find the text useful . Many came to understand the provisional nature of some of the arguments Ehret presents and were quite willing to pursue extra readings and debate them . <p> The result is that the strengths of this volume far outweigh its weaknesses , especially given its competition . It is the work of a veteran teacher speaking with both passion and authority . I will certainly use the volume again . I would advise , though , that others be prepared to use supplemental readings to fill in the gaps left here . 
@@40786796 @786796/ <p> Reviewed by Jan Marten Ivo Klaver ( Faculty of Languages , University of Urbino ) Published on H-Italy ( July , 2004 ) <p> Fare L'Italia Anche Col Diavolo ? <p> Derek Beales 's The Risorgimento and the Unification of Italy has long been a classic introduction to the unification of Italy . The book , originally published in 1971 by Allen &amp; Unwin in the series Historical Problems : Studies and Documents , offered students a concise overview of the complex history of the Risorgimento and its connection with Italian unification . Like all the titles in the series , the book offered students a fine series of contemporary documents , all in translation for those who could not read Italian . This primary material , which illustrated the themes treated in the main text , made up about half of the book . In conformity with the other titles in the series , Beales 's essay was merely entitled " Introduction . " In seven short sections Beales traced the history of the Risorgimento and its repercussions on notions of unity , starting from the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1832 , devoted considerable space to the period up to the revolutionary year of 1848 , and moved to the decisive phase of unification from 1859 to 1861 . In his preface Beales regretted that , in the compass of the series , he had found it impossible to illustrate the influence of the economic development of Italy on the process of unification . <p> Although Professor Beales 's study has long been a favorite textbook in courses on nineteenth-century Italy , over the years it has become clear that , besides economic development , there were many other themes that would merit inclusion in such an introduction . The new edition , co-written with Eugenio F. Biagini , Reader in Modern British and European History at the University of Cambridge , covers a much wider range of relevant issues for the unification of Italy . New chapters have been devoted to questions such as the Italian language and the role of women in the process of unification , as well as to a series of relevant issues after 1861 , such as the Venetian situation from 1862 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia . This much enforces the original project , as a complete unification of Italy had , of course , not yet been reached in 1861 . Moreover , Beales 's original chapters have been completely overhauled to include recent historical scholarship on the subject . The original set-up of the Historical Problems series has been maintained in this new edition . All the original primary material is reprinted , while the new topics are illustrated by further documents , which now grow from sixteen to twenty-three . A brief chronology of events between 1748 and 1876 has also been added . <p> When The Risorgimento and the Unification of Italy was first published in 1971 , Beales openly acknowledged his " overriding " debt to Denis Mack Smith . In the new edition ( although this phrase disappears from the preface ) the authors still say that Mack Smith 's influence is apparent throughout the book . He inspired its original approach , which , they maintain , is still valid . They see Mack Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as justly emphasizing " the disputes and uncertainties of Italian patriots during the critical phase of unification " while avoiding misplaced " patriotic grandiloquence " ( p. 6 ) . For example , they endorse Mack Smith 's analysis that Cavour doubted not only the practicability of Garibaldi and the Thousand sailing for Sicily , but also the desirability of Garibaldi conquering the South . Beales and Biagini also emphasize what had stood central in the first edition of The Risorgimento and the Unification of Italy , namely that the early part of the Risorgimento was characterized by reform which was mostly the work of foreign rulers , and that a feeling of Italian nationality emerged only in its later stages . The authors see this as a distinctly British contribution to Italian historiography , which , since the 1980s , has increasingly been accepted by Italian historians too . <p> The new edition often critically reflects the findings of later generations of Italian historians . They acknowledge that modern scholars have become less nationalistic and less conditioned by Idealism , but they still disagree with many new interpretations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view that commitment to the Risorgimento was an essentially generational phenomenon . Instead they doubt that any particular generation was decisive to the Risorgimento revival . Likewise , the authors have little sympathy for the recent revisionism of Roberto Martucci , whom they see as advancing a whole series of " conspiracy theories , " which argue that the whole process of unification was masterminded by Cavour , who , with Garibaldi as a puppet in his hands , controlled events from the start through the Piedmontese intelligence service . To Beales and Biagini this is hardly more credible than the old nationalist rhetoric in Italian historiography . <p> Of the new chapters the ones on the Italian language and on the role of women are of particular interest . Recent Women 's Studies has had little impact on the study of the Risorgimento and its relation to Italian unification . In the chapter " Women and the Risorgimento , " the book offers interesting new insights showing that women 's political horizons were not limited to the home . One paragraph shows , through a series of Macchiaioli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fully aware of the political connotations of the work they are doing . Moreover , written sources by upper-class and bourgeois women show that they could see the unification of Italy as part of a wider agenda of liberation . As to language , the authors disagree with literary revisionists such as Tullio de Mauro . Notwithstanding widespread illiteracy , the " nineteenth century must be regarded as one of the most brilliant periods in the cultural history of modern Italy " ( p. 75 ) , they argue . Moreover , when compared to the linguistic homogeneity in other European countries , it is perfectly legitimate to speak of Italian as a national language . The authors often sympathize with the Italian situation by drawing attention to similar situations in other European countries . <p> The new chapters in The Risorgimento and the Unification of Italy appear to be the work of Eugenio Biagini , although the preface leaves space for some ambiguity . It attributes to Biagini not only the chapters on Venice ( including the problem of brigandage ) and the Italian economy , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This seems unlikely . Again , there is no express claim of authorship for the new chapters on the Italian language and the role of women , while a non-existent eleventh chapter is referred to as written by Biagini . This confusion about authorship , however , is not indicative of the care and effort that went into writing the new edition . Beales and Biagini have produced an excellent and updated introduction to a complex period , a textbook that will appeal to new generations of British and American students on account of its clarity , completeness , and critical spirit . 
@@40786798 @786798/ <p> Texas Ranger John Henry Brown penned Indian Wars and Pioneers of Texas , 1822-1874 and History of Texas from 1685-1893 in the 1890s . His books mythologized Anglo-Texans as heroes and Texas Indians as savages . More importantly , Brown and Texas historians of a similar ilk turned Ranger hagiography and celebratory history into accepted truths for the next century . Academic scholarship , textbooks , literature , and film conformed to such biases and mythmaking , and only recently Texas Indian scholars such as F. Todd Smith , David LaVere , and Gary Anderson have begun challenging such myths . <p> In The Conquest of Texas Gary Anderson details the " culture of violence " that existed in Texas--especially Northwest Texas--from 1820 to 1875 . Land provided the impetus for conflict , a conflict masked in the rhetoric of race and the assumption that Indian territory was an available wilderness to be conquered and tamed by " civilized " whites . Members of all ethnic groups participated in violence in Texas , but Anglo-Texans formed a policy and strategy around racial violence that " gradually led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially people of color " ( p. 7 ) . <p> To justify this cleansing , Anderson argues that Anglos held to a " southern code " or " Texan Creed , " that represented a mindset that made violence " heroic and honorable " and made it almost impossible for whites to accept any idea of ethnic diversity . Gangs of whites dressed as Indians raided , raped , and murdered across the state and many men used Texas Ranger service as a chance to pillage . Ranger John Baylor , along with his men , thrived on citizens ' misconceptions about Indian behavior , taking advantage of the fear to intimidate and steal from Anglos and Indians alike . According to the documents elucidated in Conquest of Texas , the Texas Rangers reveled in the anarchy , disorder , and violence . <p> In addition to the theme of a " Texas Creed , " Anderson addresses the captivity narrative , or memoirs by whites kidnapped by Indian raiders . Early histories assumed native degradation of captive women , but recent scholarship reveals that female captives were rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having sex during raids , while Victorian etiquette prohibited many Anglos from talking about sex in general . There was a great cultural divide over sexual relationships . More often than not , Indians took good care of their female and child captives so that they could be ransomed . Several scholars , including Daniel J. Gelo and Scott Zesch , are beginning to re-evaluate these narratives . Cynthia Ann Parker became distraught when separated from her Comanche family . Bianca Babb described her captivity with the Comanches as a " holiday . " Anderson 's inclusion of this type of historical revisionism marks his scholarship as cutting-edge . <p> Beyond these themes , Anderson also moves chronologically , beginning with the Texas Revolutionary period from 1820 to 1846 . Most scholars have ignored Indians when interpreting the Revolution , but doing so removes important pieces of the puzzle . The Fredonia Rebellion , a botched attempt at an alliance between Cherokees , Anglos , and Tejanos to throw off Mexican rule , can not be understood without incorporating the Native American perspective . Anderson 's inclusion of the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Fredonia Rebellion a failure . <p> Although as a pragmatic Sam Houston treated the Indians more fairly than other Anglo-Texan politicians , he could not stop Anglo expansionism or draw boundaries for Indian lands . As Texas became a nation and then a state in the United States , growth exacerbated tensions between whites and Indians , and government leaders forced Indians from their ancestral lands onto reservations and opened those lands to whites . The reservations became concentration camps , and traveling beyond the boundaries sometimes meant death . At times Anderson argues Indians were not safe , even in on the reserves . Anglos were known to kill defenseless women and children within the limits of the reservations . <p> In the chapter , " Indians and the Civil War , " Anderson claims that " rustling rings and drought caused much of the destruction in West Texas , " an argument counter to traditional interpretations ( p. 328 ) . Offering a completely new interpretation of Texas Indian history during the Civil War , Anderson relies on tree ring data and drought history to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Native involvement in the Civil War is more complex than scholars once thought and the accepted idea that Indians took advantage of the war to raid white homesteads does not stand up against historical realities . <p> Anderson covers Anglo and Tejano politics in detail but shortchanges coverage of Indian politics . For example , by reading Thomas Kavanagh 's Comanche Political History : An Ethnohistorical Perspective , 1706-1875 ( 1996 ) one learns about the patrilineal and militaristic Comanche society . For all the dissimilarities Anderson points out , he fails to fully recognize all the similarities between especially patrilineal societies , such as the Comanches and Anglos . Glossing over Comanche politics and focusing so deeply on Anglo-Texan politics opens the author up to accusations that he made Indians victims without agency . Although I believe Anderson gives Indians some agency , a more thorough treatment of Indian politics would add balance . <p> Additionally , Anderson selectively chooses the events and characters to illustrate his story and speaks volumes through his omissions , leaving out massacres , in particular , that show Natives in a poor light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historian F. Todd Smith , especially his research on the Wichita and other groups of North Texas Indians . Leaving out Smith 's contributions represents a large omission . <p> Despite these small criticisms , the work is beautifully written with excellent photographs , maps , and illustrations that accompany the provocative prose , and the work will stand as a major contribution to the fields of Native American studies and Texas history for years to come . Not only does the work offer a significant contribution , it spearheads a new field within the study of the American West--that of ethnic cleansing . However , Anderson 's work says more about Euro-Americans , specifically Anglo-Texans , penchants for racial hatred , than it does about Texas Indians . David La Vere , in The Texas Indians , explores the Indian perspective more than does Anderson , providing scholars and the general reading public an excellent overview of the Native American experience in Texas . His work is not a history of Euro-Americans and their relationships to Texas Indians ; rather Texas Indians take " center stage . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agendas , strategies , and agency . Texas Indians , neither " noble savages " nor " red devils , " were humans with developed religious beliefs , political structures , kinship networks , economic strategies , and obligations of reciprocity . <p> La Vere approaches his survey of Texas Indians thematically , but moves chronologically within his themes . He covers all the major tribes and their situations , such as the collapse of the Jumanos , Apache displacement , the Coahuiltecans in the Rio Grande valley , the hunter-gathering Atakapas , the Tonkawas of Central Texas , and the Karankawas of the Gulf Coast . In his chapter " The Nations of the North , " La Vere succinctly covers Northwest Texas Indians , such as the Wichitas and Comanches . Immigrant Indians , including Seminoles , Choctaws , Chickasaws , Cherokees , and Creeks from the east also made a significant impact on Texas , especially after the Indian Removal Act of 1830 . Beginning with Paleoindians and moving continuously through removal from Texas , the reservation period , allotment , and the 1990s , he concludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> La Vere 's work is the current definitive survey of Texas Indians , replacing the more anthropological work of W. W. Newcomb , Indians of Texas : From Prehistoric to Modern Times ( 1961 ) . La Vere tells scholars in The Texas Indians that there is still " much historical and anthropological work ... to be done on Texas Indians in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries " saying , " it is an open field " ( p. xii ) . Relocation in the 1950s , gaming since the 1980s , and natural resource management in the twentieth century are just a few areas ripe for study . The recent works on Texas Indians suggest major revisionism in the field , including Texas Indians , Conquest of Texas , and F. Todd Smith 's From Dominance to Disappearance : The Indians of Texas and the Near Southwest , 1786-1859 ( 2005 ) . All three tell a story of Texas Indians figuratively and literally losing ground in Texas . 
@@40786799 @786799/ <p> ere Cervantes ' entremeses bad theatre ? If not , why were they perceived by both the writer and his contemporaries to be more suitable for reading than theatrical representation ? Such questions have surrounded the interludes since their initial rejection ( alongside eight full-length plays ) by unnamed autores de comedias in the early 1600 's . While it is certain that Cervantes ' theatre was judged inadequate for the seventeenth-century stage , it remains to be seen exactly how his entremeses departed from the theatrical standards of the time or what it was precisely in these plays that made them unacceptable . Critical evaluations of these elusive <p> texts have shown them to be much more complex than performed entremeses , but have not examined in detail the internal mechanisms responsible for their intricacy.2 Nevertheless , the reconsideration of the interludes in light of recent theoretical approaches , including Bakhtin 's theory of the novel and novelized genres , reveals that Cervantes ' extensive use of novelistic elements in his drama may have rendered his entremeses unperformable within the context of contemporaneous theatrical production . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work may also provide an important key to understanding his plays ' release as texts for reading . When Cervantes published his Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses nuevos , nunca representados in 1615 , he essentially readdressed his unperformed drama to a reading public . The appearance of dramatic work in print was not an entirely unusual practice in the time ; plays were frequently published ( more often than not without the direct intervention of the dramatist ) after their success had been proven on the stage . These collections , often plagued with inaccuracies and revisions , provided the means to extend the commercial windfalls of the seventeenth-century Spanish theatre beyond the lucrative business of public performance to include the reading market as well.3 Cervantes ' collection , however , stands as a unique example in that his plays had not been influenced by the process of interpretation and revision by actors and directors which accompanies any theatrical production . <p> Only after his comedias and entremeses had been deemed inappropriate for the stage did he sell his scripts to a bookseller with the intention of releasing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content of his collection until its publication , presumably submitting his authoritative version to the printer as if it had been a collection of short stories . In addition , he was able to draft a prologue as an explanation of his plays ' appearance in print and to direct the reader 's understanding of the dramatic texts that followed . The printed volume of his comedias and entremeses , therefore , can not be classified along with the published collections of commercially successful plays ( like those of Lope de Vega , for example ) , but rather pertains to a new practice of publishing drama based on its value as readable literature , as a dramatic form which has been redefined for initial consumption by a reading audience . In his prologue , Cervantes relates the roundabout manner in which his plays reached the press , thus beginning the debate over their allegedly problematic theatricality : <p> Clearly , Cervantes had originally intended his plays to be performed on the stage and , therefore , conceived each work initially with this end in mind . Only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks did he consider presenting them to the public through a different medium ? in printed form . The prologue conveys the frustration Cervantes must have felt as a dramatist , but it is tempered with the understanding <p> that he was respected for his non-dramatic work , which may have inspired him consequently to consider the release of his drama exclusively in print . In the ? Adjunta al Parnaso , ? a fictionalized Cervantes ( interestingly in the neo-dramatic form of dialogue ) provides additional reasons for the redirection of the unperformed works to a reading public . Citing the necessity of an educated reader 's undivided attention , the fictionalized dramatist ( ? Miguel ? ) offers the following explanation : <p> This passage anticipates the same sentiments Cervantes would express one year later in his prologue . In contrast with the latter , however , the disillusioned dramatist here justifies the redirection of his drama by referring to and , in effect , acknowledging the internal complexity of his plays . For Cervantes , releasing his plays in print would afford the attentive reader the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disimula , o no se entiende , cuando las representan. ? Certainly , Cervantes himself believed there to be more to his comedias and interludes than their entertainment value to a theatrical audience . He must have thought his dramatic work , if not in demand for theatrical representation , would be suitable as a form of privatized , even didactic , entertainment for a discriminating reader . Yet this must not prevent us from reading these works as pieces of theatre composed originally for the stage . The reader must bear in mind that Cervantes admits he had his comedias and entremeses ( or at least six of each ) already written before he decided to publish them , and that his decision to print them ( not to write them ) is <p> based on his desire to direct his plays to a more attentive and discerning audience.6 Any discussion of Cervantes ' interludes must therefore begin with the fact that they are in essence works of theatre , conceived in accordance with certain dramatic principles and conventions , and they must be analyzed as such . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fulfilled their artistic potential in performance , has led generations of scholars to underestimate the rich theatricality of Cervantes ' interludes . The failure of Cervantes ' entremeses in their theatrical context leads to an obvious , but puzzling , question : why were his interludes not performed during his lifetime ? Cervantes was recognized for his literary talent even in his own day , and today 's reader certainly understands his genius . Nonetheless , Cervantes ' mastery of literary prose and its conventions may , in fact , be partially responsible for the alleged theatrical inadequacy of his dramatic work . The writing of what we now call literature ( writing for a reading public ) is by definition substantially different from composition for the stage , where a number of complex semiotic systems are simultaneously at work . While the writer of prose fiction can ( and , indeed , must ) create a fictional world with verbal imagery and narrative style , the dramatist will also consider the languages of physical gesture and movement , voice quality , spatial relationships , and music , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived with all of these elements in mind , since each one is an essential component which contributes as much to the overall understanding of the work as does the written text . Keir Elam reminds us : <p> Literary critics have usually implicitly or explicitly assumed the priority of the written play over the performance , the latter being more often than not described as a ? realization ? ( actual or potential ) of the former . The written text constrains the performance in obvious ways . Since , chronologically , the writing of the play precedes any given performance , it might appear quite legitimate to suppose the simple priority of the one over the other . But it is equally legitimate to claim <p> 6 Cervantes does not say ? las escribf. . . ? but rather ? yo pienso darlas a la estampa para que se vea de espacio lo que pasa apriesa . . . ? The frequently-cited passage from the ? Adjunta al Parnaso ? thus explains why Cervantes sought to print his unperformed plays , but not why he originally wrote them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that his plays were conceived and composed for any purpose other than theatrical production . <p> 66 <p> CORY A. REED <p> Cervantes <p> that it is the performance , or at least a possible ? model ? performance , that constrains the dramatic text in its very articulation and that the dramatic text is radically conditioned by its performability . The written text , in other words , is determined by its very need for stage contextualization , and indicates throughout its allegiance to the physical conditions of performance , above all to the actor 's body and its ability to materialize discourse within the space of the stage.7 <p> As an aspiring dramatist , Cervantes most certainly understood the demands and practical restrictions placed on the written text by the intended performance , but his instincts as a novelist also affected the character of his drama . This is not to suggest that he in some way ignored the extra-literary dramatic codes while writing his drama , but rather that his highly developed sense of novelistic discourse may have overwhelmed the theatrical concerns of the interlude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected his plays . There undoubtedly was something about Cervantes ' interludes which set them apart from the performed entremeses of the time , something which at first brought about their rejection for theatrical purposes , and simultaneously made them suitable for release in printed form . The differentiating factor , as we shall see , was their overt reliance upon novelistic elements . Clear , simple distinctions between the ? novelistic ? and the ? theatrical ? are not easily made , especially today , when the aims and thematic concerns of each frequently overlap . Theatricality , as Elam suggests , can be defined by the need for stage contextualization , while the novel relies entirely on the written word for imaginative interpretation by a reader . Contrasts between the novelistic discourse and dramatic composition thus usually emphasize the fact that drama is a plastic , representational art , while prose narrative is a written art form . Each genre is also defined by its relationship to its audience : theatre-goers expect temporal , audio-visual entertainment while readers enjoy the more detailed private contemplation of the intricacies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences , however , there evidently existed in the seventeenth century practical distinctions between theatre and novelistic prose which , perhaps , were more noticeable than those commonly observed <p> today . The commercial success of Lope de Vega in effect defined a specific set of guidelines for Spanish theatre , requiring relatively simple actions , and presenting characters as the subordinated agents of plot.8 Any definition of character in the comedia is limited to those qualities that are necessary and relevant to the exposition of plot events . Thus Fuenteovejuna 's Comendador is narrowly-defined as a patently vile and dishonourable personage in order to make possible and justifiable his violent demise later in the work . Still , such subordination of character to plot does not require that each character be completely two-dimensional and devoid of internal conflict . Rather , the implication is that characterization in Golden Age drama typically serves to advance the plot . Conversely , novelistic prose examines the character as an individual and endows plot action with psychological and socio-historical relevance , the plot often serving to elucidate the complexities of character and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot consists of a carefully-constructed sequence of events , linked together by dramatic causality , which , once discovered , reveals the thematic meaning of the work as a whole . The full-length play thus ends with the restoration of a previously-disrupted order , often employing poetic justice to punish those responsible for the initial disturbance . In the entremTs , we see a further reduction of this neatly-composed formulaic style , necessitated by its situation between the acts of the comedia . As will be discussed later , characters are drawn almost exclusively according to stereotypical stock-figures , plots consist of one singular action , and the elucidation of thematic meaning is almost non-existent . In contrast , novelistic prose is not regularly constrained by formulaic structure . It is a freer , more flexible form that often explores the internal conflicts of its characters and favors the discussion of complex themes and issues . Novelistic prose is often characterized by thematic indeterminacy and openness , which requires the thoughtful collaboration of the reader for closure . These , precisely , are the elements that Cervantes developed not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing his dramatic texts to execute some of the more profound aims of the novel , while still remaining , essentially , works of theatre . <p> 8 Alexander Parker defined the formulaic structure of the comedia nueva in terms of the relationship between character , plot , and theme . See The Approach to the Spanish Drama of the Golden Age , Diamante , 6 ( London : Hispanic Council , 1957 ) . <p> 68 <p> CORY A. REED <p> Cervantes <p> Cervantes is best known ( and justifiably so ) as the father of the modern novel , who refashioned prose writing to such an extent that future generations of novelists would continue to follow his leads . Don Quijote and the Novelas ejemplares show his interest in experimentation and the exploration of the unlimited possibilities of narrative fiction . Nevertheless , Cervantes ' drama sometimes has been called excessively traditional , especially when compared to Lope de Vega , whose comedia nueva virtually redefined both the production and reception of the dramatic arts in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain.9 While Lope , in his Arte Nuevo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's precepts ( and , indeed , for many classical artistic concerns ) seemingly in order to cater to the tastes of an undiscriminating mass public , Cervantes continues defending the artistic integrity of more traditional drama , and explicitly defies Lope 's position in a number of his own writings , including the Quijote.10 The resulting literary polemic has fostered a prevalent and perhaps too convenient impression that Cervantes and Lope were in complete disagreement concerning the value of contemporary dramatic conventions , and that Cervantes the ? classicist ? refused to accept Lope 's innovations , continuing to reject them in his own theatrical works.11 Contrary to such reductionist critical <p> 9 Some scholars ( among them Castro 49-55 ) and editors of anthologies ( Linton Lomas Barrett , Five Centuries of Spanish Literature New York : Harper and Row , 1962 199 ) have repeatedly dismissed Cervantes ' drama as ? classical ? and therefore subject to failure in a market dominated by Lope 's innovative comedia . Cervantes did indeed write plays which were relatively classical in nature ( i.e. La Numancia ) during his early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a dramatist . Cervantes later abandoned his neo-Aristotelian style and actually adopted that of the comedia nueva . His comedias and entremeses pertain to this second period of dramaturgy.10 See Chapters 47-48 ( Canon of Toledo episodes ) in Part One of the Quijote.11 Such attitudes ( see note #9 ) have persisted . As recently as 1969 , for example , Edwin Honig described Cervantes as ? always on the outside of literary society and lagging behind its fashions ? in his ? On the Interludes of Cervantes , ? Cervantes : A Collection of Critical Essays , ed . Lowry Nelson Jr . ( Englewood Cliffs , NJ : Prentice Hall , 1969 ) 153 . Current scholarship in the field is breaking away from this mold . See Patricia Kenworthy , ? La ilusi=n dramtica en los entremeses de Cervantes , ? Cervantes : su obra y su mundo , ed . M. Criado de Val ( Madrid : 1981 ) 235-38 ; Bruce Wardropper , p. 69 ?

Much in the same way he redefines the novella and creates the modern novel , Cervantes also attempts a change in the seventeenth-century conception of drama in Spain , but in a manner far different from Lope de Vega . Cervantes , in short , brings many of the thematic and structural characteristics of prose narrative to the composition of his ? novelized ? drama . In his theatrical works as in his novels , Cervantes turns his critical eye inward in order to reconsider the mechanisms of plot , character , and theme : the mythos , ethos , and dianoia of Aristotelian tradition . As a result of changes in these internal components , Cervantes ' interludes resemble works of prose fiction in certain ways and depart radically from the accepted drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belong in some measure to the dialogued story of which Cervantes showed himself to be so complete a master in the Coloquio de los perros . It will be recalled that in speaking of one of his comedies , Cervantes says that it was found ? larga en los razonamientos. ? The same thing can be said of his entremeses . In this , he stands at the opposite pole from Lope de Rueda , but also it may be to some extent because of this that he could be the master who first really brought the form into literature of the highest class.12 <p> Pointing to the relationship between Cervantes ' interludes and the ? dialogued story , ? Jack confirms the innovative manner in which Cervantes composed his plays , adding a novelistic depth of plot , theme , and character .

What <p> 12 William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rise of a Dramatic Form ( Philadelphia : U of Pennsylvania P , 1923 ) 125.13 While Jack 's phrase ? literature of the highest class ? is clearly prejudiced toward the elite canon , it does signal the initial marginalization of the entremTs and that Cervantes ' works are understood as having some canonic , literary value beyond their theatricality . <p> 70 <p> CORY A. REED <p> Cervantes <p> was once primarily intended for a mass public is given an additional life as privatized entertainment for the educated reader . This is not to say that the interludes are more similar to novels in dialogue than to theatre , but rather that their novelistic elements include a greater development of the sketchy plots and character-types normally found in conventional interludes . Patricia Kenworthy has observed : ? Just as Cervantes extends the boundaries of the form of the genre by including ' novelistic ' passages , he extends the limits of subject matter available for dramatic treatment. ? 14 Thus , the presence of novelistic elements in Cervantes ' interludes not only allows the plays to function as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As could be expected , Cervantes builds upon the popular foundation of the entremTs by expanding its range of dramatic possibilities . To the traditional cast of rustic farmers , ruffians , sacristans , and barbers , he adds middle-class mayors , judges , doctors , merchants , and cleverly ingenious women to transform the stage into what Eugenio Asensio has called a ? procesi=n de deformidades sociales ? 15 constituted by characters from nearly all social positions . He then places these figures in original situations which extend far beyond the boundaries of the conventional entremTs . The ? malmaridada ? of traditional lore is now asking for a divorce , an impossibility in Cervantes ' Spain ( El juez de los divorcios ) . The beautiful women of the courtly love tradition are transformed into prostitutes , their male counterparts into pimps ( El rufin viudo ) . The exploration of the activity of the urban marketplace suggests a burgeoning middle class which reflects Spain 's belated but imminent acceptance of the capitalist system ( La guarda cuidadosa and El vizcafno fingido ) . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional entremTs and the more thematically profound composition of character and plot found in prose narrative . His characters are more complex and individualized , 16 his situations suggest possible psychological interpretations , and his thematic content invites socio-historical analysis . Such intricacies , common in <p> twentieth-century short drama , but typically characteristic of prose literature in Cervantes ' time , were entirely absent from the conventional entremTs performed between the acts of the comedia . In his insightful chapter titled ? El entremTs , fecundado por la novela , ? Asensio plainly states , ? Cervantes remoza el entremTs importando en su campo temas y tTcnicas de la novela. ? 17 That Cervantes redefined the entremTs by bringing to the theatre his masterful hand as a novelist is a sentiment shared by nearly all who have commented on his interludes . Jill Syverson-Stork sees Cervantes ' dual life as dramatist and novelist affecting both his dramatic and non-dramatic work , observing of the former , ? Cervantes ' primary attention to characterization and the desire to expose his nation 's problematical present may well have been the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do tend towards the novelistic. ? 18 Such novelistic elements may be particularly visible in the brief entremTs , where temporal restrictions which demand a short , simple action may be incompatible with any depth of character or theme . It seems Cervantes the dramatist was never far removed from Cervantes the novelist , and his proficiency in the creation of prose fiction helped to enrich his dramatic production as well , in effect making a critical literary form out of a previously rough dramatic diversion . Mikhail Bakhtin ( cited above ) argues that it is not at all uncommon for a work of drama to display certain characteristics of the novel . Indeed , he asserts that such ? novelization ? is almost unavoidable in any period in which the novel becomes a primary focus of literature . Consequently , aspects of novelization can begin to manifest themselves in other genres anytime after the appearance of the modern novel , but they do not reach a significant level of importance ? or canonical recognition ? until much later . This novelization is not due to any superiority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of plasticity inherent in the conception and execution of the novel . For Bakhtin , the novel defies canonization ; instead it functions as a working literary influence which affects all forms of literature and the manner in which their verbal imagery is composed . Novelization , therefore , can be seen as a liberating process <p> which gives new life to an old form . It is an enrichment of a different genre , in this case drama , which opens up new possibilities , and not an elimination or replacement of its systems and codes . In his essay ? Epic and Novel ? Bakhtin states : <p> The novelization of literature does not imply attaching to already completed genres a generic canon that is alien to them , not theirs . The novel , after all , has no canon of its own . It is , by its very nature , not canonic . It is plasticity itself . It is a genre that is ever questing , ever examining itself and subjecting its established forms to review . Such , indeed , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zone of direct contact with developing reality . Therefore , the novelization of other genres does not imply their subjection to an alien generic canon ; on the contrary , novelization implies their liberation from all that serves as a brake on their unique development , from all that would change them along with the novel into some sort of stylization of forms that have outlived themselves.19 <p> This idea of the novel representing an essence which seems unavoidably to permeate all types of literature is fundamental to the examination of the process of novelization in the time of Cervantes . Following Bakhtin 's line of reasoning , one can conclude that the same historical , social , and psychological conditions which constituted and affected Cervantes ' environment during the writing of the Quijote were also present during the composition of his drama . The same attitudes and thought processes that formed Cervantes ' creative genius should logically influence both his prose and theatrical texts . It follows that since Cervantes was one of the first to master novelistic discourse in his prose writing , and , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama would also display a certain novelistic quality . Cervantes ' interludes are not weakened , but rather strengthened by this occurrence ; as some of the earliest examples of novelized drama , his interludes can be seen as being ? ahead of their time. ? If the novelization of Cervantes ' drama , therefore , is not entirely unexpected or surprising , what effect , precisely , does this process have on his plays ? Bakhtin list a series of modifications which we can expect to encounter in any novelized genre : <p> Novelized genres become more free and flexible , their language renews itself by incorporating extraliterary heteroglossia and the ? novelistic ? layers of literary language , they become dialogized , permeated with laughter , irony , humor , elements of self-parody and finally ? this is the most important thing ? the novel inserts into these other genres an indeterminacy , a certain semantic openendedness , a living contact with unfinished , still-evolving contemporary reality ( the openended present ) .20 <p> At first glance , these attributes of novelized literature may not seem entirely unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their application to drama . Most modern drama displays all of these characteristics in some way . But although novelized drama is the norm in the twentieth century , it was only beginning to take root in Cervantes ' time . A permanent shift toward novelization in the mainstream short drama would not come at all in the seventeenth century . In Cervantes ' interludes , however , we can easily see a number of concrete examples of these qualities . Heteroglossia is visible in Cervantes ' entremeses , just as it is present in the Quijote . Furthermore , the concepts of heteroglossia and dialogism presented by Bakhtin are absolutely related to the famous ? perspectivism ? which AmTrico Castro and Leo Spitzer , among others , have seen as a fundamental characteristic of Cervantes ' works.21 All problems are ? dialogized ? and given perspective from which no single view of reality can be accepted as the entire truth , often by the simultaneous presentation of conflicting philosophies and language styles . The problematic ambivalence of language manifests itself most overtly in La elecci=n de los acaldes de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about correct and appropriate speech <p> 20 Bakhtin 7.21 Bakhtin defines ? dialogism ? as a crossing of two languages , attitudes , or styles which results in a dialogue between points of view ( see Bakhtin 76 ) . ? Heteroglossia ? describes the potential coexistence of many meanings or nuances within one word , phrase , or language , depending on its social or linguistic context ( Bakhtin 272 ) . For a detailed discussion of perspectivism , see Castro 68-109 and Leo Spitzer , ? Linguistic Perspectivism in the ? Don Quijote , ? ? reprinted in Leo Spitzer : Representative Essays , ed . A. K. Forcione , H. Lindenberger , and M. Sutherland ( Standford : Stanford UP , 1988 ) 225-271 . <p> 74 <p> CORY A. REED <p> Cervantes <p> and how it affects our perception of truth . Additionally , language is used to deceive in El vizcafno fingido ( whose trickster-protagonist employs a stylized Basque dialect ) , La cueva de Salamanca ( through the character of the wife who must convince her husband of her devotion , although she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's verbal expression of truth fools the jealous old man ) . In El retablo de las maravillas the power of the artistic word is shown not only to be capable of manipulating the characters on the stage , but also of deceiving the theatre-going ( or reading ) public , much in the same way the Maese Pedro episode in Don Quijote breaks through the borders of fiction to incorporate the reader as well.22 The increasingly illusory world of El retablo 's play-within-a-play allows us to confuse the more verisimilar fiction of its framework play with reality itself , mirroring the characters ' own relationship with the drama they are watching . As in Cervantes ' prose creations , truth is rendered subjective in the interludes by the dramatist 's novelistic and dialogic stance . Multiplicity of language styles is , of course , common in the interlude as a genre , but the fact that Cervantes problematizes language is an important feature related to the process of novelization . Cervantes is not content with the mere presentation of polyglot language in the entremTs as empirical reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his drama in a manner not unlike the presentation of language in the Quijote . In pursuing Bakhtin 's claim that humor and irony permeate the novelized text , one must proceed with caution , bearing in mind that the entremTs as a genre itself capitalizes on the maximization of laughter and the comic . In the interludes of Cervantes , however , humor is indeed made ironic , and the above-mentioned ? elements of self-parody ? do enter the scene . Such irony in Cervantes ' entremeses seems to be a characteristic quality which distinguishes his drama from more mainstream plays.23 The most overt examples are El retablo de las maravillas , La cueva de Salamanca , and El vizcafno fingido , three plays of deception in which the audience maintains a full awareness of the dramatic <p> trickery taking place on stage , while the characters themselves remain in ignorance . Such irony generates much of the humor in these works ; the audience or reader can laugh at the foolishness of the characters as they walk readily into their respective traps , seeming at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , this broad-based ironic humor allows Cervantes to engage in satirical self-deprecation . In El retablo de las maravillas , the charlatan Chirinos gives the Governor a lengthy speech on the vices of poets , and particularly dramatist , and La guarda cuidadosa has as its protagonist a foolish soldier-poet frequently identified as a semi-autobiographical figure of Cervantes himself.24 Juan Luis Alborg sees the presence of such satirical wit as the principal factor differentiating Cervantes ' entremeses from their prototypes , the pasos of Rueda : <p> The satirical criticism of seventeenth-century Spanish institutions , prejudices , and hypocrisy is precisely the innovative brand of analytical profundity which sets Cervantes ' interludes apart from the traditional entremTs , and which is certainly more characteristic of prose fiction ( as exemplified in the time by Cervantes ' own Don Quijote ) than of the teatro menor . Most important , as Bakhtin has suggested , is the openendedness of novelized literature . Cervantes ' interludes , much more so than mainstream interludes , take place in the ? openended present ? of which Bakhtin speaks . The results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed until the following day . The resolution of the student 's deception of the nearly-cuckolded Pancracio in La cueva de Salamanca is never shown . The consequences of Lorenza 's adultery in El viejo celoso <p> are left unexplored . In contrast , looking at some performed entremeses of the time somewhat similar in theme to those of Cervantes , we see a tendency to conclude on a note of thematic closure . La sacristfa de Mocej=n ( anonymous ) resolves an election , ending the interlude in the celebration of the chosen sacristan , and in the EntremTs de un viejo que es casado con una mujer moza ( anonymous ) , adultery is concealed , the deception of the old man reaches a well-defined and climactic conclusion , and the play concludes on a self-congratulatory note by those who have successfully fooled the jealous old man.26 Furthermore , the openness of the Cervantine interlude was not to be incorporated in the subsequent development of the gTnero chico . Later in the seventeenth century , the stylized works of Quiones de Benavente would come to define the conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single actions , one setting , and complete closure which ensured ? and perhaps , reinforced ? their subordinate relationship to the comedia . His version of El retablo de las maravillas not only significantly reduces the scope of the Cervantine work ( five characters and two secular ? apparitions , ? as opposed to Cervantes ' eleven personages and six visions of socially and religiously symbolic importance ) , but also avoids entirely Cervantes ' chaotic ending of beatings and thrashings , opting instead for a traditionally closed conclusion which includes a celebratory song and dance . In addition , Quiones de Benavente 's work does not address the problematic themes of blood purity and racial intolerance which Cervantes leaves unresolved in the audience 's mind and demanding attention.27 The structural and thematic open-endedness of Cervantes ' interludes is thus entirely unique within the short drama of his <p> 26 Both interludes may be found in Emilio Cotarelo y Mori 's Colecci=n de entremeses , loas , bailes , jcaras y mojigangas desde fines del siglo XVI a mediados del XVII , 2 vols .

It should be noted that Quiones de Benavente ( 1593-1651 ) was not exactly a contemporary of Cervantes , having begun his writing career in his early 20 's around the time of Cervantes ' death . He is frequently credited with being a prolific writer of entremeses in a stylized verse form which often appeared to reduce the interlude to a sort of ? commedia in embryo. ? See Hannah E. Bergman , Luis Quiones de Benavente ( New York : Twayne , 1972 ) 14 . <p> 11.1 ( 1991 ) <p> Cervantes and the Novelization of Drama <p> 77 <p> time and is consistent with the novelistic indeterminacy frequently expressed in his prose works . It is due in part to this irresolution that the interludes invite the intellectually contemplative analysis to which Cervantes referred when he suggested reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-endedness of Cervantes ' interludes require the collaboration of the reader/audience in order to make sense out of the plays ' thematic indeterminacy . These plays often leave the reader or spectator in a state of suspense , which can only be resolved by a thoughtful analysis of the works after they have concluded . In short , the thematic concerns of Cervantes ' entremeses frequently extend beyond the structural framework of the plays themselves , and requires the active participation of the reader to provide closure . This open-endedness contrasts directly with the traditional entremTs , whose location between the acts of a comedia required a closed conclusion that rendered its simple plot readily comprehensible to a passive audience ? and easily forgettable by the beginning of the play 's second act . Since the interlude is generally a drama of action and the novel is frequently devoted to the presentation of character , the function of character in Cervantes ' interludes also provides a glimpse into his process of novelization . Asensio notes the importance of the two-dimensionality of character in the traditional entremTs , calling it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of stock types more closely resembling the mechanical puppets displayed in the traveling retablos of the time.28 Of Cervantes , however , Asensio claims , ? Pinta no entes de una pieza ? lo que llamo figuras ? sino seres con una sombra de complejidad , con una alternancia de sentimientos que con intenci=n moderna tendrfamos la tentaci=n de llamar caracteres. ? 29 These characters are not the faceless stereotypes of the traditional interlude , but are based on realistic , probable situations which could happen in everyday life . They have individual names ( Leonarda , Lorenza , Pancracio , Cristina , Ortigosa , etc. ) , instead of being denoted by the generic terms ? bobo , ? ? rufin , ? or ? sacristn ? and , although directly descended from the traditional stock-types of the entremTs , they are put into individual circumstances which require often unique and original solutions . Amelia Agostini Bonelli de Del Rfo claims : <p> Cervantes ' entremeses , consequently , make frequent use of the individualized character and not the ? type ? of the traditional interlude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , transforming them into characters . For example , Caizares in El viejo celoso is a character drawn from the novella tradition ( and particularly reminiscent of Cervantes ' own Carrizales in El celoso extremeo ) , and the ? vizcafno ? in El vizcafno fingido is not the stereotyped Basque of unintelligible speech , but rather an impostor ? a Castilian who imitates the stereotypical Basque ( an entremTs stock-type ) and uses stylized speech as a deception . As in Cervantes ' other works , the simple base of the entremTs tradition is problematized , encrusted with layers of artifice which establish each character 's individuality on the stage . Another example is El juez de los divorcios , in which Cervantes presents the male characters as types ( ? vejete , ? ? soldado , ? ? cirujano , ? and ? ganapn ? ) and the females as individualized characters ( Mariana , Guiomar , Aldonza de Minjaca ) who literally attempt to break out of the confines of their dramatic situation by asking for divorce . In La elecci=n de los alcaldes de Daganzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect personal qualities ( Estornudo , Panduro , Humillos , Pedro Rana ) , each of which is a slightly differentiated version of the stock-type of the fool . Even when Cervantes chooses to include traditional , stereotyped characters in his works , he modifies them slightly , often using the type as an agent of novelistic theme . In El retablo de las maravillas , for example , he links the names and personalities of the characters ( Juan Castrado , Teresa Repolla , Juana Macha , etc. ) to the play 's thematic concerns of illegitimacy and limpieza de sangre , thus providing a continual , comic reiteration of the characters ' anxieties.31 <p> In brief , Cervantes bases his characters on the two-dimensional types of the interlude tradition , but he ? novelizes ? them along with the other elements of his drama . He enlarges his cast ( up to fourteen characters in one play , in comparison with Lope de Rueda 's maximum of six ) 32 and he places them into a series of plots , subplots , and frequent scene changes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the traditional entremTs . His characters , situations , and themes are just as vivid and fascinating in his drama as they are in his novels and short stories , and perhaps this is why his interludes were not seen as performable in 1615 . While novelistic profundity is commonplace in today 's drama ( particularly in one-act play ) , Cervantes ' novelized entremeses , with their many layers of textual complexities , may have been too intricate to function in a position subordinate to the then still ? un-novelized ? comedia without overwhelming it . The appearance of novelistic elements in the composition of the interludes of Cervantes inevitably leads to a comparison between the short , one-act entremTs and its equally brief prose counterpart : the novella . Indeed , a case can be made for regarding the two as ? sister genres ? in light of the unique manner in which Cervantes redefines them both , and considering how these two short literary forms are each related to a larger form , the comedia or the novel . Cervantes ' novelization of the interlude thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the novella is to the novel as the entremTs is to the comedia . If the novella and the interlude as understood by Cervantes are so closely related , then it logically follows that the master of the Spanish novella would also have much to contribute to the realm of short drama . Novelization and the subsequent redefinition of drama as a purely readable literary work implies a change in both the literary and the theatrical horizon of expectations which must have been met with a certain element of curiosity . Yet the examination of Cervantes ' perceived relationship between the novella and the interlude reveals not only the alteration of the role of the dramatic work , but corresponding changes in the novella as well . <p> 32 Del Rfo 275 . Theatrical companies of the time employed between eight and sixteen actors , according to N. D. Shergold , A History of the Spanish Stage ( Oxford : Clarendon , 1967 ) 505 , 510 . The large number of roles in Cervantes ' interludes may have been impractical for smaller companies , contributing to their perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cervantes <p> The most obvious similarity between the interlude and the novella is their structural brevity . Both forms are , by definition , short . The practical necessity of brevity in the interlude is , of course , a temporal concern . Since the interlude was a form of entertainment presented during the intermission of the comedia , concentration of the dramatic action into ten minutes or less was an understood prerequisite for the composition of an entremTs . This alone may be one of the primary reasons the autores de comedias rejected Cervantes ' interludes , as his interludes tend to be , on the average , three times the length of contemporary entremeses . Brevity in the novella , by contrast , seems to be a stylistic concern of the genre , not a practical problem defined by its position within another form of representation . Length alone , however , does not justify drawing parallels between the two genres ; the analogous relationship depends on each form 's interaction with another , longer form . Certainly the entremTs exists as a counterpoint to the comedia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interlude as a dominated genre , subordinated by the comedia , but also sustained by it.33 Any examination of the traditional interlude must therefore bear in mind its relationship to the comedia and to the theatrical spectacle as a whole of which it is part . The novella , however , does not normally interact with the novel in any fundamental way . Yet in Cervantes , we find examples of a complete reversal of the dependence of the entremTs and the independence of the novella . The publication of his collected interludes at the end of the volume , separated from the text of his comedias and removed from the theatrical performance , extracts the interlude from its essential context , treating it more like a short story . Similarly , Cervantes inserts a completed novella , ? El curioso impertinente , ? in the middle of the text of his novel , Don Quijote , much in the same way the entremTs is embedded between the acts of the comedia.34 In a sense , Cervantes at time requires his interludes to act like novellas and his novellas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entremTs seems to be the ? novella ? of drama ? a brief dramatic form in which a single thematic issue can be explored in depth . If Cervantes was able to recognize structural and functional similarities in the interlude and the prose short story , then the publication of his entremeses must have helped this perception to be seen by others as well . Furthermore , the very act of printing his interludes creates an entirely new possibility for their reception which otherwise would have been impossible : the differentiation between a first and second ( or subsequent ) reading of the text . As Hans Robert Jauss points out , the second reading of a text allows for a more detailed analysis of meaning : <p> From now on , the reader will seek and establish the still unfulfilled significance retrospectively , through a new reading , from the perspective of the fulfilled form , in a return from the end to the beginning , from the whole to the particular . Whatever initially resisted understanding manifests itself in the questions that the first going-through has left open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particular elements of significance ? in various respects still indeterminate ? a fulfilled whole may be established on the level of meaning.35 <p> The idea of a meaningful , ? fulfilled whole ? is precisely one of the goals Cervantes intended to achieve by the publication of his dramatic works , as is evidenced by his above-mentioned comment ? pienso darlas a la estampa , para que se vea de espacio lo que pasa apriesa , y se disimula , o no se entiende , cuando las representan. ? While the dramatic representation only allows a superficial analysis of the interlude by the one-time spectator ( and this is further complicated by the interlude being physically surrounded by the comedia ) , the reading public Cervantes hoped for would be able to join the whole and the particular in a more comprehensive second reading . Such constraints of performance do not normally present a problem for the conventional entremTs in that it is superficial by nature and should not require a ? second reading. ? In addition , the theatre utilizes a variety of communicative systems which assist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play as comprehensive as possible . The ? reading ? of the spectator is therefore different by definition than the analysis of a reader . The information contained within the theatrical piece must be understandable to the one-time theatre-goer , and a series of redundant theatrical codes helps the audience to process the information correctly . The sheer simplicity of the traditional entremTs assured this proper reception would occur . Cervantes ' interludes , in contrast , are more complex and indeterminate . The author 's very mention of wanting ( in fact , demanding ) a second reading , or at least a contemplative first reading , signals that he felt their content was capable of withstanding more intense scrutiny than a purely theatrical reception could afford , and that such a reading may be necessary to provide closure . This seems to imply that Cervantes was aware of the novelistic qualities of his interludes , and that they might be well received as reading texts . Cervantes ' publication expands the reception of his entremeses , shifting his audience to the reader , and away from theatre-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospective analysis of the works is not possible . Moreover , publication allows the interludes to be examined separately , free from the restraints of their position within the comedia , so they can be seen for what they are individually . This is a critical difference regarding Cervantes ' plays in comparison with novelized drama in general . Whereas most of the novelized drama written after Cervantes ( particularly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ) has remained in the theatre as texts for performance , Cervantes ' drama made its first appearance in print , as a text for reading . The redirection of his drama to the reading public may also explain , at least in part , why Cervantes ' novelistic innovations did not influence the subsequent development of the teatro menor in Spain . The extent of Cervantes ' influence on the dramatic form itself is limited to the borrowing of only his most basic of plot elements , and sometimes characters , by those who later worked the genre into its definitive form . Just as Quiones de Benavente ( mentioned above ) eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metatheatrical scope of the internal drama in his version of El retablo de las maravillas , ? less is more ? seemed to be the prevalent rule of thumb for the commercially successful composition of entremeses in the seventeenth century . Imitations of El viejo celoso and La cueva de <p> 11.1 ( 1991 ) <p> Cervantes and the Novelization of Drama <p> 83 <p> Salamanca were composed by other dramatists as well , but without the novelistic ? baggage ? which was probably viewed as superfluous in the context of theatrical performance . Cervantes ' novelistic art was apparently not well understood or appreciated in the numerous imitations and appropriations of his drama . Ironically , despite these minor contributions to future entremesistas , it was Cervantes ' non-dramatic work which provided the most sources for theatrical imitations by other dramatists in the seventeenth century.36 Perhaps Cervantes ' Comedias y entremeses continued to be received as reading texts , just like his prose work , throughout the remainder of the seventeenth century and therefore did not influence dramatic composition any more than his other works of non-dramatic nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interiorization of character generally associated with novelistic prose , Cervantes anticipated a movement which would not affect the performed drama of the canon for more than one hundred years after the appearance of his Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses . The resulting works display a level of thematic profundity and structural complexity radically innovative in their time , and fully modern even when judged by the standards of the twentieth century . Certainly , the characteristic elements of novelization in the entremeses do not approach the intricacy afforded the novel itself by its length and narrative style . In comparison with their counterparts in the novel , Cervantes ' dramatic characters may seem more two-dimensional , his themes less fully developed , and his plots less involved . Yet , when compared with the traditional entremTs , Cervantes ' personages display additional dimensions , and his themes and plots seem highly developed . This is the effect of novelization ; the conventional components of drama begin to take on qualities usually associated with the novelistic discourse without sacrificing their theatricality . Cervantes may have succeeded in creating a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice , but while the modern reader or theatre-goer recognizes his ingenious innovations , they were evidently not appreciated in the seventeenth century . Here the question which opened this <p> study must again be addressed . Why was his drama not considered appropriate for performance and rejected by the producers and directors of his time ? Certainly his entremeses may have been too complex to function as mere intermission entertainment between the acts of the comedia . The individualized characters , the overt satire of contemporary society , the double-entendre of heteroglot language , and the labyrinthian games of structure may have been excessively intricate for successful juxtaposition alongside ( or , more precisely , within ) the traditionally dominant comedia . The novelized interludes of Cervantes , in short , may have become too autonomous to succeed as a form subordinate to the conventional full-length drama . Yet the most complicated aspect of Cervantes ' interludes is their novelistic open-endedness , a quality which in itself may have been responsible for their poor reception as performance-oriented scripts . As Alban Forcione points out , Cervantes was obsessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? often refusing ? to endow his works with the rigid structure of definitive pronouncement. ? 37 Indeterminacy seems to be a characteristic of his writing in general , not exclusively of his dramatic works . What , then , is so disturbing about the indeterminacy of Cervantes ' interludes ? The key distinction seems to be one of location , not some inherent problem with open-endedness in the genre of drama . Whereas open-endedness could conceivably conclude a theatrical performance ( and , in effect , frequently does in modern drama ) , the irresolution of the entremTs and its thought-provoking demands on the audience occur between two acts , in the middle of the performance . Since indeterminacy requires the collaboration of the audience to provide closure , this would be acceptable at the conclusion of a play , but would be problematic in the middle . Many comedias open their second acts with lengthy monologues which not only provide actors with the necessary time to change costumes , but also serve to reintegrate the audience into the plot of the play , after having been momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these monologues reflect the reality of an audience which needed to be reminded of <p> the comedia 's action , even after having watched the closed , traditional interlude . An open-ended entremTs which left the audience to contemplate its themes after its conclusion would be disastrously distracting as intermission entertainment . In order for an entremTs to be effective in its context within the comedia , therefore , its thematic scope would have to be limited and closed so that the audience could make the rapid shift in attention to the comedia without leaving any loose ends from the interlude untied . The novelistic indeterminacy of the Cervantine interlude is thus perhaps too complex to allow the audience to redirect its attention to another work ( already in progress ) immediately following its conclusion . The single plots , stereotyped characters , lack of intricate themes , and closure in the traditional entremTs ensured that it would entertain , but distract as little as possible when the moment came to focus on the full-length play 's second act . Cervantes ' interludes violate this essential simplicity , breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . The novelization and resulting indeterminacy of the Cervantine interlude disrupt the ? spell ? of mass entertainment , causing unrest and anxiety instead of holding the audience together while they wait for the main play to resume . The open-endedness may also help explain why Cervantes ' drama has enjoyed relative success in the twentieth century , when one-act plays are either performed as independent , autonomous works or nearly always followed by an intermission if a series of one-acts is presented as part of one program . What may have been perceived as ? bad theatre ? in the 1600 's due to its unconventional open-endedness is quite acceptable by today 's standards , which encourage indeterminacy as a method of inspiring critical reflection in the audience . As some of the earliest examples of novelized drama , Cervantes ' interludes could not function within the definitive constraints imposed on theatrical production by seventeenth-century dramatic conventions . Yet while the novelization of Cervantes ' drama appears to have been at least partially responsible for their rejection as theatrical scripts , the adoption of a more novelistic stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative ) texts for reading . The very fact that his once-marginal interludes are today considered part of the literary canon , while the traditional , once-successful entremTs has <p> 86 <p> CORY A.

@@40786801 @786801/ <p> Cervantes and the Decameron : A Note on the Sources and Meaning of Don Quijote 's Prototypical Chivalric Adventure ( I , 50 ) <p> DONALD MCGRADY <p> he reader of Don Quijote has at his disposition a veritable banquet of delights , for beneath the surface of almost any of its episodes there lies a wealth of literary allusion , as well as implicit observations about the human condition in general and that of the novel 's protagonist in particular . A case in point is the prototypical adventure that Don Quijote improvises as a reply to the Canon of Toledo , who , to the hidalgo 's infinite chagrin , professes not to believe in the historicity of books of chivalry ( Part I , chapters 47-50 ) . It will be remembered that , to substantiate his claim for the truthfulness of romances , Don Quijote relates ( I , 50 ) an adventure that actually illustrates precisely the opposite , because it epitomizes the most fantastic elements of the genre : <p> A knight standing near a boiling lake hears a woman 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praising his valor . He accepts her challenge to plunge into the roiled waters , and at their bottom finds an Other-Worldly realm , placed in an eerie but beautiful landscape ; in this setting there arises a marvelous castle overlain with all manner of jewels , including emeralds and rubies . A group of persons issues forth to welcome the intrepid knight , and to lead <p> 141 <p> 142 <p> DONALD MCGRADY <p> Cervantes <p> him into the palace ; there the hero is entertained by music , and served a lavish banquet by beauteous maidens dressed in stunning attire , but who remain utterly mute all the while . <p> To be sure , such descriptions of a Nether World abound in the romances of chivalry as in few other literary genres , 1 but all the features just enumerated in Don Quijote 's account proceed directly from a similar episode in the Libro del caballero Zifar.2 But there is more here : taking the adventure of the Caballero Atrevido in the Zifar as his basic text , Don Quijote then goes on to embroider additional decorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other chivalric descriptions . To cite one such example , the notion of having serpents swimming around in the frightful lake may well derive from Feliciano de Silva 's Amadfs de Grecia Part II , chap . 47.3 However , by far the most striking modification made by him of the Rueful Countenance to his basic Zifar model is the following passage : <p> It is decidedly shocking that an elderly and apparently staid gentleman such as Don Quijote should indulge his imagination in a scene as salacious as this , in which a knight errant allows himself to be bathed nude by a young maiden , who then anoints him with fragrant unguents . This highly erotic description is redolent of Oriental sybaritism , calling to mind the perfumed bedrooms of the Song of Songs , or the baths administered by slaves of the opposite sex ( eunuchs , in the case of males ) in the Arabian Nights . It seems likely that Don Quijote has suppressed here the sexual licence that probably would have been present in his source of inspiration ? only in a work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young warrior be laved by a young girl without any sensuous ideas passing through his mind . But what would have been those pieces that provided Don Quijote a model for the epicurean washing accorded to his prototypical cavalier ? First of all , it is apparent that Don Quijote has introduced the present bathing scene to replace a segment of the Zifar episode from which he takes his entire tale . In the latter book , the Caballero Atrevido , after attending the sumptuous banquet in the enchanted palace , is invited to participate in yet another pleasurable diversion : <p> Later on , the Bold Knight once again lives up to his name , making another amorous conquest ; however , upon returning to the presence of his irate lady , he is informed by her that she knows of his infidelity , and expels him from her realm . It is highly understandable that Don Quijote should want to change the unedifying end of his source tale : the conduct of the Caballero Atrevido is at opposite poles from that of the Manchegan hidalgo 's ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , was to replace the Bold Knight 's two amorous escapades with a less indecorous action , avoiding unseemly philandering . His solution was the bathing scene , which retains all the sensuousness of his <p> 4 Indeed , the Caballero Atrevido 's inclinations are comparable to those of the licentious Galaor , Amadfs ' disreputable brother . <p> 144 <p> DONALD MCGRADY <p> Cervantes <p> model ? indeed , Don Quijote 's description is far more suggestive than any in the Zifar ? but without the sex act as its culmination . This attitude of have-but-have-not parallels exactly Don Quijote 's earlier deportment in his adventure with Maritornes at the inn ( I , 16 ) . In this episode the old gentleman had worried about ? el peligroso trance en que su honestidad se habfa de ver , ? and yet ? a pesar de sus bizmas y con dolor de sus costillas , tendi= los brazos para recebir a su fermosa doncella . . . tirndola hacia sf . . . la hizo sentar sobre la cama . Tent=le luego la camisa . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this were not enough , he had then stated that if he did not owe allegiance to Dulcinea , ? no fuera yo tan sandio caballero , que dejara pasar en blanco la venturosa ocasi=n en que vuestra gran bondad me ha puesto ? ( I , p. 433 ) . In other words , despite the idealized image created by Romantics ( the poets of the nineteenth century , and numerous critics of the twentieth ) , Don Quijote most certainly is a sensualist , 5 although his libido is held in check by devotion to his lady . The problem now arises of where in his readings Don Quijote would have encountered the bathing scene that served as inspiration for the passage cited above.6 A priori , the most likely possibility would of course seem to be one of the innumerable books of chivalry that our hidalgo so loved ; however , no specialist in that area ? Diego Clemencfn among them ? has ever proposed a source or analogue from the genre . A model does exist , nonetheless , and in a work so widely read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can plausibly be assumed to have known it : the Decameron.7 Story VIII , 10 of Boccaccio 's masterpiece relates how the young merchant Salabaetto is at first fleeced by the clever and attractive courtesan Iancofiore , and then wreaks his revenge upon her . The only part that concerns us here is the lovers ' initial tryst : <p> 5 Don Quijote 's frankly unchaste behavior toward Maritornes was foreshadowed in the previous chapter ( I , 15 ) , where Rocinante , in accordance with the folkloric rule that a man 's personality is reflected in his possessions , breaks away and runs after some mares ( ? a Rocinante le vino en deseo de refocilarse con las seoras facas . . . ? I , 401 ) . Much has been written about Don Quijote 's erotic impulses ; for bibliography , see Carroll B. Johnson , Madness and Lust : A Psychoanalytical Approach to Don Quijote ( Berkeley-Los Angeles-London : University of California Press , 1983 ) .6 In her book Women in the Medieval Spanish Epic and Lyric Traditions ( Lexington : University of Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Even the noblewoman was expected to devote her time to the care of her husband when he was at home . She had to make sure his guests had all the necessary conveniences , and sometimes she even undressed and bathed the male guests ? ( p. 2 ; emphasis added ) . I have been unable to substantiate this statement both in my own readings and in consultation with medieval specialists , and hence regard it as unfounded . <p> 5.2 ( 1985 ) <p> Cervantes and the Decameron <p> 145 <p> Iancofiore instructs Salabaetto to meet her at the public baths , and the merchant there sees two female slaves arrive , bearing a fine mattress , sheets , a quilt , pillows and assorted foodstuffs . The servants ? apparently in total silence ? proceed to make the bed and then undress to scrub the bath . At this point Iancofiore enters with two more slaves ; she bids Salabaetto to disrobe , does likewise herself , and they enter the water together with the two naked maid servants . Iancofiore next bathes Salabaetto with perfumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her slaves . The sweethearts are then wrapped in scented sheets by the maids , carried to the bed , sprinkled with fragrant waters , served delicious confitures and wines , and finally are left alone to enjoy the fruits of love . <p> The presence of the slave-girls ( doubtless of Eastern origin ) , the nudity , the copious use of perfumes , the luxury of bedclothes and dainty refreshments , the nearly total silence in which everything transpires , and submissiveness and desire to please of the wealthy and beautiful lady , all this combines to produce an ambience that is at once Oriental in savor and reminiscent of the Nether World . Indeed , the narrator emphasizes the unreality of the episode by remarking that Salabaetto has the sensation of being in Paradise.8 Although the rest of the tale is realistic in tone , the otherworldliness of this section would have served to connect it in Don Quijote 's mind with similar descriptions from books of chivalry , and in particular , that of the Zifar . Let us now turn to that portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 7 Several different versions of the Decameron , in Italian and Spanish , were available in Spain . Expurgated editions of the Italian original appeared after 1573 , but mainly with the purpose of eliminating references to licentious clerics ; see Nancy L. D'Antuono , Boccaccio 's Novelle in the Theater of Lope de Vega ( Madrid : Porra , 1983 ) , pp. 10-12 and 15-16.8 ? A Salabaetto pareva essere in Paradiso . . . ? ( Ed . Vittore Branca , in Tutte le opere , IV Milan : Mondadori , 1976 , 767 , 19 ) .9 ? After this , Iancofiore was pleased that both of them should disrobe and step into the bath , and two of the slave-girls with them . Next , without p. 146 allowing the slaves to touch him , she herself washed Salabaetto all over with marvellous care , using a soap perfumed with musk and cloves ; and then she had the slave-girls bathe her and rub her down . This being done , the slaves brought two very white and finely-woven sheets , which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed full of roses ; and one girl wrapped Salabaetto in one of the sheets , and the other girl wrapped the lady in the other . . . ? ( my translation ) . <p> 146 <p> DONALD MCGRADY <p> Cervantes <p> The crucial coincidence between this text and that of Don Quijote cited at the beginning of course lies in the key detail of the young lady who , having just met the youthful hero , proceeds to have him undress , and then bathes and rubs him with perfumes . But there are other minor coincidences as well : the ? buen nmero de doncellas ? that accompany Don Quijote 's heroine could be seen to correspond to Iancofiore 's four slave-girls , the maidens ' ? galanos y vistosos trajes ? may be compared to the precious bedclothing in Boccaccio 's story , 10 the ? templadas aguas ? used to wash the knight may recall the variety of waters sprinkled upon Boccaccio 's lovers , 11 and the perfumed shirt and the mantle so carefully described by Don Quijote have their counterparts in the scented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath . Thus , given the complete agreement between the central situation in the Decameron tale and Don Quijote 's story , plus the general resemblance of several accompanying particulars , it seems safe to assume that the Spanish knight did indeed incorporate part of Boccaccio 's narrative into the account which he took chiefly from the Caballero Zifar . No less interesting than the fact that Don Quijote borrowed a motif from the Decameron , is the light that his imitation throws on his own character : upon deciding that the Bold Knight 's amorous triumphs were inappropriate for his rendition of an ideal chivalric adventure , Don Quijote could easily have omitted all sexual <p> references from his story . That he chose to insert a toned-down version of another lustful episode from the Decameron says much about his own suppressed libido . This important aspect of his character was perceived by some of the earliest readers of Part I of Don Quijote ? those in Part II : when the invincible knight arrives at the palace of the Duke and Duchess , in chapter 31 of Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pajes ? ( VI , 16 ) ; then , doubtless recalling and imitating Don Quijote 's own chivalric tale , ? pidiTronle que se dejase desnudar para una camisa . . . ? ( VI , 17 ) . However , the gentle knight refuses , showing much more modesty than the hero whom he himself had created : ? nunca lo consinti= , diciendo que la honestidad parecfa tan bien en los caballeros andantes como la valentfa. ? What are we to make of this ? Are we to understand that already ? en los nidos de antao no hay pjaros hogao ? ( VIII , 257 ) ? No , not that , but probably that our knight , despite his reiterated contentions that his beloved books of chivalry were but truth incarnate , was quite capable of appreciating the difference between life and fiction , long before his final defeat and disenchantment .

Missing is the historical context from which these voices echo ; the social and political meaning behind the familiar melody . As a result , citizens are left in the awkward and disarming position of feeling as if they know a great deal about the era , when in fact , they know very little . Perhaps more than any other period , the 1960s are in need of good historians , scholars who can sort through the rhetoric and emotions , who can move beyond the advertising jingles and misrepresentations to provide historical clarity and context .

The book , relying mainly on secondary literature , stays close to the established narrative of the decade and devotes solid chapters to essential subjects like the civil rights movement , Vietnam , the Great Society , youth culture , and the New Left . Three year-specific chapters -- on 1963 , 1965 and 1968 -- depict the way Americans experienced a multitude of events simultaneously .

Although it is not woven smoothly into the broader narrative , the analysis of the New Right illustrates the ways youthful activism was not the sole purview of the left . Ultimately , then , the authors are successful in arguing that " liberalism was not as powerful in the 1960s as is often assumed ; nor , equally , was conservatism as much on the defensive " ( p. 4 ) . <p> Similarly , Kazin 's and Isserman 's lengthy discussion of the Great Society includes compelling evidence bearing out Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan 's claim that sixties social welfare programs were " oversold and underfinanced to the point that their failure was almost a matter of design " ( pp. 187-203 ) .

To their credit , the authors place the civil rights movement squarely at the center of their analysis and allow it to stand on its own terms rather than defining it solely in relation to white New Left student activism or the anti-war movement as other authors , like Todd Gitlin and James Miller , have tended to do . In addition , Isserman and Kazin understand the spiritual and existential restlessness that characterized much of the youth culture activism on the right and left during the 1960s . As a result , SDS 's cry for a more " authentic mode of being " and the counterculture 's experimentation with drugs and alternative ways of living make sense along side the more traditional anti-war and anti-Communist politics of the day .

To an extent , northern struggles over de facto school segregation , police brutality , employment discrimination , and housing connect us more directly to the pernicious and still unresolved issues of racism in American society today than the fights against de jure segregation and the blatant racial discrimination of the South . Central to these northern civil rights struggles was the proliferation of black nationalism , a topic this book largely ignores . Similarly , the authors ' reliance on secondary material keeps them close to the well-worn stories of Berkeley , Madison , Birmingham , and Selma , and thus neglects the way the currents of the sixties played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand is that there may not be a linear narrative of the sixties that proceeds in an orderly fashion from one locale to another , but rather that there was a more general flowering of a particular set of values and consciousness that manifested itself similarly ( or differently ) throughout the nation . Lastly , in an aesthetic and stylistic sense , America Divided 's text-like tone fails to convey the vitality and exuberance that permeated the decade , the profound , kaleidoscopic , sometimes silly and sometimes just plain weird outpouring of human expression . There is very little in the book from the alternative press , from the artwork of the time and from speeches we have not already heard numerous times before . Perhaps these criticisms are not necessarily the fault of the authors given their methodological emphasis on secondary sources . <p> There are ultimately more serious and fundamental problems with Isserman and Kazin 's analysis than their reliance on secondary literature . While the authors do emphasize the African-American freedom movement , the New Left , the student movement , the women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmentalism , they fail to survey the full spectrum of activism during the sixties , particularly among non-African American people of color and the working-class . For instance , nowhere do we find the Chicano Movement ( with the exception of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers Union ) , the American Indian Movement , Asian American activism , or the GI coffeehouse movement . In addition , the book does not adequately explore the way advertisers and consumer culture appropriated the slogans and stylings of the student movement and counter culture to sell products and bolster consumerism . At the same time , television and film , so critical to the making and unmaking , to the style and presentation of much of the decade 's social protest , makes hardly an appearance despite the availability of work on this subject . In these omissions , the authors fail to take up basic connections between our current cultural landscape and that of the past . This leaves the contemporary reader isolated and disconnected from those events and wondering how we got from there to here . <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Left 's critique of American foreign policy and its treatment of official reaction to activism of all stripes . Dwelling primarily on the New Left 's opposition to the war in Vietnam , the authors fail to explore the dynamic confluence between these aspiring radicals and developments in other places , particularly China , Cuba , France , and Czechoslovakia . Nor do they sufficiently explain the ideological underpinnings of New Left thought in authors like Franz Fanon , William Appleman Williams , C. Wright Mills , and Herbert Marcuse . As a result , Isserman and Kazin do not fully explicate the broader New Left critique that linked a powerful global " system " of American expansion and " imperialism " not only to Vietnam but also to Japan , Russia , and Latin America . Another puzzling omission is the book 's silence on the numerous and well-documented counterintelligence operations that led to official repression , misinformation , and disruption of a host of progressive movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s by federal , state , and local authorities . This glaring oversight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap in our understanding of how and why progressive and radical movements declined and disintegrated , and thus misses an opportunity to link these developments to the lasting mistrust of government that continues to permeate society . <p> Admittedly , Isserman and Kazin have selected a daunting task for themselves in a single volume and the criticisms here should be viewed in that light . Within the constraints of their methodological approach , the authors do present a refreshingly balanced version of the past that is written in simple , lucid , and straightforward prose . America Divided offers a good introduction to the main contours of the era and will be useful in lower and intermediate level undergraduate courses . Nevertheless , while the book is effective as an overview and synthesis of much of what we currently know about this turbulent decade , particularly on politics , and while it does clear away some of the basic misinformation about the sixties floating around today , my feeling is that we are not yet ready for the grand narrative the authors are striving for . There is much research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavated . We do not have all the pieces of this puzzle , and thus can not present a definitive portrait . So , politicians , pundits , and admen will probably continue to hold sway over the public understanding of the decade , at least for a little while longer . America Divided makes it clear , though , that historians are gaining on them . 69404 @qwx479404 
@@40786808 @786808/ <p> In Worlds of Women , Leila J. Rupp captures the century-old origins of women 's international organizing from their founding to the Second World War . She takes as her focus the three groups that " held center stage " ( p. 4 ) in the world theater during the early years of the twentieth century : the International Council of Women ( ICW ) , founded in 1888 ; the International Alliance of Women ( IAW , initially the International Woman Suffrage Alliance ) , an offshoot of the Council established in 1904 to focus on suffrage ; and the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom ( WILPF ) , created in 1915 . <p> The International Council of Women , " the first lasting multipurpose transnational women 's organization " ( p. 15 ) , grew out of an international conference in Washington , D.C. in 1888 , called by the National Woman Suffrage Association , the Stanton-Anthony wing of the U.S. suffrage movement . The ICW , which came into being before there were national councils of women , prodded women to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join the ICW . Between 1888 and 1893 , only the U.S. and Canada created those bodies . By 1939 , thirty-six councils had affiliated with the ICW . Thus , the ICW helped to organize domestic women 's movements . In addition , the ICW established committees as vehicles for the international work of women . In 1899 , it created standing committees on peace and international arbitration and on the legal position of married women . Eventually , the ICW coordinated committees on suffrage , the " traffic in women , " work , public health and child welfare , and immigration . <p> By 1933 , the Council had adopted a wide-ranging agenda . To minimize conflict , it permitted other organizations to take up contentious questions . In light of its waffling on suffrage , in 1904 some of its members established the International Woman Suffrage Alliance , with a clear pro-suffrage stand . By 1929 , the IAW comprised fifty-one national suffrage auxiliaries . <p> The WILPF emerged from World War I. Although the war disrupted international communications , a remarkable International Congress of Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 1 , 1915 . Women from neutral and belligerent nations took a stand in favor of enfranchisement for women and a peaceful resolution of the international conflict . The Hague Congress established an International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace which , by the end of the war , had renamed itself the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom . By 1921 , it had twenty-two national sections . According to Rupp , " as the most radical organization , WILPF played a vanguardist role in lauding international loyalty above what traditional notions of citizenship might consider appropriate support for one 's country " ( p. 119 ) . <p> Women united internationally on the same bases that brought them together in their home countries : women 's special role as mothers and propensity for nurturing , the need to protect the poorest working women from exploitation by employers , the movement for moral reform and against enforced prostitution ( " white slavery " ) and sexual violence , the quest for suffrage and political rights , and the pursuit of peace . Says Rupp , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nurses &amp; preservers , ' ' Mothers of the Human Race , ' ' carriers of life , ' ' MOTHERS OF THE NATIONS , ' ' guardians of the new generations , ' women assumed that their gender united them behind the cause of peace " ( p. 86 ) . <p> But , as Rupp points out , distance created special constraints in forging such alliances . International associations of women , even more than the domestic kind , resulted in exclusions based on means , religion , language , race , and nationality . Most active members of the international groups tended to be elite white Christian women with substantial resources , overwhelmingly from North America and Western Europe . <p> Such uniformity in personal characteristics did not generate consensus in views . Women 's international organizations , like the national ones , split over the politics of equality for women . The fissure between advocates of strict legal equality and proponents of special treatment for working women that divided women activists in the United States also split them in the international setting . The International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dispute over special laws for women . A failure of women 's groups to concur on how to determine citizenship for women married to foreign nationals permitted an unsatisfactory draft from the Conference on Codification of International Law in 1930 to carry the day . Differences were not limited only to women 's issues . Members also divided over whether nationalism had a claim above internationalism or vice versa , with still others contending that no conflict obtained between the two loyalties . <p> However divisive , the conversations that women had toward resolving these disputes themselves fostered identity as internationalists among these women . These women shared both an international and a feminist consciousness , although members constantly contested the meaning of both terms . Internationalism was vaguely defined as " a sentiment like love , or religion , or patriotism , " in the words of Carrie Chapman Catt ( p. 108 ) . Feminism was similarly inchoate . According to Rupp , women were united by " a sense of themselves as a group with interests distinct from those of men ; a perception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to country , disadvantaged women in relation to men ; and a commitment to improving the situation of women " ( p. 130 ) . The organizations most likely to identify themselves as feminists were those that sought equal legal rights for women and that opposed sex-specific protective labor laws . Of the three major organizations , only the IAW used the term " feminist , " which was generally eschewed by the WILPF and the ICW . But the term changed its meaning over time , with some activists equating feminism and humanism and other calling a reaffirmation of women 's traditional roles " new feminism . " <p> Rupp focuses especially on the development of " women 's international collective identity " within these organizations , examining the role of the women who staffed the headquarters and served on committees , the creation of special symbols ( badges and banners ) , the connections established through newsletters and conferences , as well as personal relationships among activist women . Although her focus is on the Europeans , Rupp touches on the challenges to their Eurocentric world view posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rupp takes up the impact of these organizations chiefly in the Conclusion . She maintains that the publicity these organizations engineered made women 's issues salient to an international community of women . One of the several coalitions formed by women 's international groups , the Peace and Disarmament Committee--with members from the International Federation of Business and Professional Women , Soroptimist International , the International Federation of University Women , the World YWCA , the World WCTU , and the three major international women 's organizations--collected eight million signatures from fifty-six countries on a petition to present to the League of Nations in 1932 . They lobbied both the League of Nations and the United Nations , forcing these bodies to take account of their perspective and to appoint at least a few women to relevant committees . The United Nations charter ultimately did include the principle of equality between women and men , a result for which the International Alliance of Women took credit . By 1946 , a UN Commission on Women served as the foundation for an examination of women 's status that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . But the aftermath of World War Two changed the international terrain . " The years between the world wars represented the high tide of internationalism , " Rupp observes ( p. 34 ) . The bi-polar world created after the Second World War proved in some ways less hospitable to international organizing . But the efforts of women in the years before offered an alternative model for living in the world and generated enduring institutions and precedents for acting on behalf of women in the second part of the twentieth century . <p> Rupp 's work rests upon wide-ranging consultation of myriad archives in London , Paris , Amsterdam , and Berlin as well as on domestic archives and printed primary and secondary sources . Her discussion is therefore authoritative and her clear organization and writing makes the volume accessible to all readers . Some cavils : One wishes that she had included more about the workings of the International Council of Women of the Darker Races , founded in 1920 , and that she had devoted more space to the effectiveness of women 's international organizations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States against these women , which labeled them left-wing subversives , willing to sacrifice their country 's well-being for peace and feminism , a view that helped to undermine the national women 's movement in the 1920s .

@@40786811 @786811/ <p> When it was first published in 1977 , One Kind of Freedom ( or 1KF , as the popular shorthand has it ) constituted a relatively late entry to the corpus of the " new economic history , " whose adherents were prone to issuing solemn pronuncimientos regarding the impending " cliometric revolution " in historical studies . In retrospect , its practitioners ' occasional hubris ironically may have helped provide fodder for a more durable counterrevolution of sorts , the one fomented by " new social historians " during the 1970s . In southern history , nowhere was this more the case than in the politically charged and often shrill polemics of the Time on the Cross controversy a few years prior to One Kind of Freedom 's release. 1 In this imbroglio , Robert W. Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman 's conceptually flawed analysis of slavery as a viable , efficient economic system served as intellectual roughage for a generation that at times seemed more concerned with moral slam-dunks than with promoting fair and accurate scholarly debate . By the time One Kind of Freedom appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a straw man , an already vanquished and slightly ridiculous opponent , by the ascendant mainstream of the profession . <p> This historiographical context helps explain the relatively quiet and even respectful reception that One Kind of Freedom was accorded in the late 1970s , but only in part . More substantively , the argument of One Kind of Freedom was on the surface quite commensurate with the drift of the new social history . Its overall thrust was that the long-term persistence of African American ( and , by extension , regional ) poverty was a result of the perverse economic effects of white racism . In particular , Ransom and Sutch 's analysis of credit mechanisms and the furnishing merchant tended to lend support to the description of sharecropper " peonage " in the works of then-young historians like Pete Daniel , William Cohen , and Jonathan Wiener . <p> Helped by its not-inconsiderable virtues of being clearly written and closely reasoned , One Kind of Freedom has thereby enjoyed a fairly privileged position in the historiography regarding the postbellum southern economy for over a generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student reading lists in southern history . To be sure , objections have been raised to various aspects of One Kind of Freedom over the years , but the book has always seemed to display a rather Teflon quality that has helped it to endure against attacks . However , Ransom and Sutch 's insistence on characterizing southern sharecropping as a form of farm tenancy has put their work increasingly at odds with much of the scholarly literature over the last two decades that views cropping as part of an emergent free labor system for the region . <p> So when a second edition was announced , the interest of many was piqued to see how Ransom and Sutch might alter their views on " the economic consequences of emancipation , " given the passage of two decades in which to absorb and reflect on criticisms . Indeed , a symposium was organized well in advance of the new edition 's publication , held at Lehigh University in 1999. 2 For those of us who did not attend this symposium , however , it came as a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally released--that the new edition of One Kind of Freedom contains very little that is , on the face of it , " new . " There is a new five-page preface , a new twenty-nine-page epilogue , and an updated bibliography of relevant works in the field . But the text of the original book is completely unchanged ; even the pagination remains the same . ( The new cover does feature a different painting by the artist Robert Gwathmey , as striking and appropriate as was the last one . ) <p> Ransom and Sutch explain in their new epilogue that " rather than addressing our critics on matters of detail , we feel it would be more useful " to show what " we can do today that we could not do twenty-five years ago " ( p. 317 ) . Essentially , they have gone back to their original data sets--first collected in the days of bulky mainframes and punch cards--cleaned them up , and converted them into formats manipulable on PCs ( a CD-ROM containing the revised data is supposedly available , but unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also expanded their revised data set beyond their original focus on the " Cotton South " to identify " peripheral " southern regions that were more or less devoted to cotton production : a " Cotton Penumbra , " " mixed farming , " and " general farming " areas , for example . <p> In the new epilogue , they subject this data to some limited re-analysis , mostly on questions that they thought especially important ; for example , the cotton-corn mix and its contribution to what they call the " lock-in mechanism " of cotton overproduction . More extensive analysis of these peripheral regions might have helped to widen the context of their original study , which focused on the former slave-plantation Black Belt and thus admittedly neglected the somewhat different ( if no less disastrous ) experience of the upcountry white yeomanry after the war . <p> As Ransom and Sutch sum it up , since their " overall assessment of the impact of emancipation " was " not ... greatly altered " ( p. 317 ) by either the cleaned-up , now-easily manipulable data or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , they felt no need to revise or expand the original text at all , not even in light of a quarter-century of respectful criticisms and subsequent scholarship. 4 One might have hoped that they would have revisited the text using their reconfigured data , perhaps using it to expand or refine their analysis at certain key junctures . For example , furnishing merchants ' ostensible " territorial monopolies " ( chapter 7 ) and the " debt peonage " ( chapter 8 ) that resulted from them are not re-examined at all , even though Ransom and Sutch admit in the new preface that these topics were the subject of " most of the controversy relating to the first edition of the book " ( p. xx ) . 5 While it is admittedly not completely unusual for a " new " edition to remain largely unchanged , the relative hoopla surrounding the book in its lengthy pre-release stages led at least this reader to expect a little more in the way of an updated version that would indeed directly address various critical " matters of detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be pointed out that cleaning up , reformatting , and adding to the original data sets was clearly an enormous undertaking , even with the help of new technology . Ransom and Sutch should be commended for ensuring that their data set ( still surely the largest and widest-ranging one yet collected for postbellum southern economic history ) will become readily available for the next generation of scholars to access , amend , and also use as necessary to challenge One Kind of Freedom 's various unrevised conclusions . In this sense , the new edition represents a generous effort on the part of two scholars who have never been reluctant to engage with other historians , and the CD-ROM of the revised data set--if it ever hits the market--may even be helping supply their critics with future ammunition . <p> The unrevised central argument of One Kind of Freedom was ( and is ) admirably and succinctly stated up front in the book : " Our thesis is that the lack of progress in the postemancipation era was the consequence of flawed economic institutions erected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This declared focus on " institutions " remains vital to understanding the argumentative context of the book . Institutions , for Ransom and Sutch , are not merely organizations ( like banks ) or groups ( like furnishing merchants ) , although both of these come in for critical analysis in One Kind of Freedom . But institutions are also the wider formal and informal systems that shape and restrict behavior and decision-making--the law , for example , is an institution . Most importantly in the case of One Kind of Freedom , the system of sharecropping is described and contextually analyzed as an evolving economic institution , albeit a profoundly " flawed " one . <p> Ransom and Sutch 's overall approach is derived from the contemporary school of institutional economics , and it is important to understand the distinct status that this school occupies in modern economic theory . 6 Although institutional economics is a diverse school that encompasses a wide variety of thinkers , it tends to be more or less explicitly opposed to the more restrictive market-privileging models of neoclassical economics . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic development is an emphasis on process and context . " The fundamental institutionalist position , " writes Warren Samuels , is " that the market gives effect to the institutions ( or power structure ) which form and operate through it . " 7 This basic assumption of a broadly conceived , interwoven , and shifting institutional playing field for economic behavior is distinct from both the neoclassical perspective , which insists on the primary importance of the rules of an ahistorical , abstract " free market , " and the Marxist view , which tends to view institutions as " superstructural " to the mode of production . <p> The institutional approach has proven to be especially popular among economic historians . The most prominent current American practitioner of the " new " institutional economics , Douglass C. North ( who taught both Ransom and Sutch , and was the former 's thesis adviser ) , declared in his speech accepting the 1993 Nobel Prize for Economics , " Neoclassical theory is simply an inappropriate tool " for historical analysis , because " it is concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 8 <p> On the one hand , therefore , the precepts of institutional economics are quietly contrapuntal to ( even as they parallel certain sociological assumptions of ) Marxist class analysis ; terms such as proletariat , peasantry , and bourgeiosie play little role , if any , in institutional economics generally , or in One Kind of Freedom specifically . But on the other hand , and just as importantly , properly situating One Kind of Freedom 's approach on a historiographical continuum requires a degree of precision in the other direction : by understanding institutional economics ' largely revisionist relationship to neoclassical orthodoxy regarding market economies . It is not accurate to argue , as did Jonathan Wiener in his famous 1979 article on southern " class structure and economic development , " that Ransom and Sutch " start from neoclassical market theory . " Ultimately , Wiener would correctly characterize the conclusions of One Kind of Freedom as " occupying a middle ground , " but the reason why this should be the case seemed to puzzle and elude him--precisely because he , like others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic thought from which Ransom and Sutch drew their initial assumptions , methods , and ways of framing questions. 9 <p> One of the probable reasons for the long-term durability of One Kind of Freedom is because of this " middle ground " that it occupies between true neoclassicists ( like Robert Higgs and Stephen DeCanio ) and neo-Marxists ( like Jonathan Wiener and Harold D. Woodman ) . The institutional approach employed by Ransom and Sutch allows them to maintain much of the methodological rigor of mathematically inclined economics , yet its built-in emphasis on historical context and development leaves room for the acknowledgment and incorporation of so-called " exogenous " factors--like racism , political power , and even class structure--that neoclassical economists are prone to underestimate or ignore ( perhaps largely because such factors are so resistant to quantification ) . Indeed , from the standpoint of its insistence on the influence of structural and other " exogenous " factors ; its relative attention to contingency and unanticipated consequences in social settings ; and its lack of faith in the behavioral underpinnings of neoclassicism ( particularly the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , institutional economics looks a lot more like the sort of objective , multicausal , and rather skeptical form of inductive inquiry that most non-economist historians tend to associate with their craft . Indeed , Ransom and Sutch 's institutional approach might be said to represent an economic form of what has been called " moderate historicism , " a characterization which also serves to underscore the lengthy intellectual kinship between institutional economics and American pragmatism. 10 <p> Ransom and Sutch 's conclusions , which bluntly condemn " flawed economic institutions " and their long-term effects , certainly are quite distinct from those mainstream neoclassicists who see southern sharecropping not as an exploitative and markedly inefficient system but as--to use one memorable phrase -- " an understandable market response . " 11 From the standpoint of some of their critics on the historiographical left , however , Ransom and Sutch did not go far enough in their critique to merit full distinction from the neoclassicists . Why is this the case ? <p> It is not merely that Ransom and Sutch fail to speak the patois of class analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very notion of a " flawed " system is taken to assume the sort of normative " free market " associated with neoclassical theory . Ransom and Sutch , in this view , are more offended by perversions of free-market mechanisms such as territorial monopolies than they are by the qualitative injustices of the system they are analyzing . But Ransom and Sutch 's methodology attempted to " measure " injustice in an economic setting while allowing for the significant effects of cultural and political factors , particularly racism . Even if this nearly Sisyphean task is attempted in part by comparing what we know about southern sharecropping to abstract models of " perfect " market behavior that rarely ( if ever ) exists in reality , that does not necessarily either obviate their methods or their conclusions . Certainly their fondness for number-crunching should not justify placing them , ipso facto , in the company of those neoclassicists with whom their conclusions are in such obvious disagreement . <p> It must be admitted that many " pure " historians may not be overly impressed by the distinctions between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist is an economist , " they might cynically huff . Southernists , however , would do well to heed another telling example of the difference between Ransom and Sutch and those who tend to slot One Kind of Freedom in the neoclassicist camp . The dispute centers around whether sharecroppers should be regarded as tenant farmers who paid half of their production to a landlord as rent ( Ransom and Sutch 's position ) , or whether they were wage workers who received half of the crop as compensation ( an argument most compellingly articulated in the work of Harold Woodman ) . 12 <p> I will not delve into what I see as the weaknesses of this emergent historiographical consensus in this review , but clearly such disputes over the fundamental nature of southern sharecropping --and , by implication , the entire postbellum South--are of profound importance , and they deserve closer evaluation even by non-economic historians , many of whom often casually adopt aspects of the " New Capitalist South " interpretation without careful consideration of the assumptions on which they apparently rest . Interestingly , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beholden to neoclassical theory , the notion of a somewhat inexorable movement of the postemancipation South toward deeply imbricated capitalist social relations , especially as a result of changes in labor organization , actually seems far more redolent of a neoclassical sense of " free market " development and primacy than does Ransom and Sutch 's insistence on the causal priority of " flawed institutions . " <p> It is a shame that Ransom and Sutch did not enter into this fray with their second edition of One Kind of Freedom . In the original , still-unrevised text of the book , the two economically trained historians work from within a social-scientific discursive tradition that circumvents rather than directly addresses such fundamental differences between them and more Marxist-influenced interpretations . And , as previously mentioned , they consciously chose not to address these and other critics on more specific " matters of detail " in their new edition .

@@40786818 @786818/ <p> A hitherto uncited facet of the second part of Don Quijote is Cervantes ' use of traditional Midsummer rituals as context for chapters thirty-four and thirty-five.1 As noted by Frazer in The Golden Bough , these festivals occurred throughout Europe and North Africa from prehistoric times into the present . Such ritualized events were important to primitive man because of their astrological significance : the sun , at its zenith during the longest day of the year , was thought to bestow special purificatory powers upon fire , water , and plants.2 Chapters thirty-four and thirty-five present the ducal couple 's comically involved introduction of a formula whereby the ? enchanted ? Dulcinea may be disenchanted , a function ? essentially one of purification , even concretely of un-bewitching , as we shall see ? universally associated with the Midsummer Eve 's ritualized celebration . The appropriateness of introducing Midsummer elements into the story at precisely that juncture of Don Quijote is , therefore , unquestionable .

Curiously enough , we hit upon this heretofore unnoticed Cervantine intention while teaching the Quijote in English , where J. M. Cohen accommodatingly translates Cervantes ' passage by ? Midsummer. ? Cervantes himself was not accommodating to the reader , for he purposely offers a confusing chronology . Shortly after the episode studied , Chapter thirty-six , a ducal letter is dated July 20 , and shortly thereafter , in Chapter forty-seven , another is dated August 16 . Finally , he goes back ( II , 60-61 ) to St. John the Baptist 's day , June 24 , for the protagonist 's arrival in Barcelona . But any reliance on this chronological data ? or any chronology at all ? for rejecting our dating of the episode in question is in large part defeated by L. A.

After Sancho faints , being the person most affected by the fire and the noises , he is revived by having water thrown in his face . Although the aspersion of water on the face of a person in a <p> dead faint would today seem a natural mode of behavior , its origin ( if one could envision an ignorance concerning such a state that would lead to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paragraph with which Cervantes closes out the entire episode heavily stresses the ritual liquid .

The entire affair begins at dusk , precisely at dusk , and its presentation , as we have noted , is suffused with the basic elements ( fire , noise , water ) associated with the un-bewitching purificatory functions of the Midsummer ritual . Even those Cervantine ( or ducal , if one wishes ) elements that might appear to have the least connection to Midsummer Eve 's festivals , such as the appearance of the devil or of that series of literary enchanters , are in no way out of place . The devil , although not necessarily in person , was thought in some Iberian communities10 to be visible at Midsummer 's Eve ; and the myriad enchanters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all removed from the witches that were about on , and targeted by , 12 the Midsummer rituals . <p> 9 In any event , the sprinkling of water on the face and eyes continues to this day to be practiced on the eve of St. John the Baptist 's day throughout rural Spain.10 Frazer , X , 208 . The Devil 's presence is presupposed , naturally , wherever witches are considered present.11 This need for recognizable enchanters ( witches ) , of which Merlin was of course the most renowned , may well explain Cervantes ' decision ( noticed and commented upon by Sancho ) to have Merlin take the place of the previously announced Montesinos.12 Curiously enough , the eve of Midsummer was one of the major sabbats , or witches ' festivals . See M. Summers , The History of Witchcraft and Demonology ( London : Routledge and Kegan Paul , 1969 ) , p. 112 1st ed. , 1926 . <p> 4 ( 1984 ) <p> Midsummer Eve and Dulcinea <p> 83 <p> Significant , of course , is the parallel , which holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midsummer rituals ( purification via the driving off of witches ) and the plot as developed by the novelist . The reader must remember , as the duke and duchess undoubtedly do , that Sancho is responsible for the ? enchantment ? of Dulcinea at El Toboso . It is only appropriate , therefore , that he , as enchanter-witch , be the primary object of the purificatory rites , their primary victim . In effect , Sancho is frightened into unconsciousness by the fiery and noisy events , and his dousing at that point may well be seen as a comic parody of the purification rituals involving water practiced in Southern Europe and North Africa . It is only logical , as well , that Sancho , the enchanter of Dulcinea , should perform the purificatory penance , and the self-flagellation hit upon by the ducal pair is riotously comical because it simultaneously serves as disenchanting formula and as just punishment ( in the most universal and pedestrian manner ) for his naughtiness . Even more significant , as it is so often with the Quijote , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , upon analysis , so clear a use of the Midsummer rituals . He had little hesitancy in referring very explicitly to the matter upon don Quijote 's arrival in Barcelona , where it in fact has a minimal role as such . A reasonable answer may be found in the novelistic context in which the incident takes place . As is the case with so much of the second part of the work , chapters thirty-four and thirty-five reflect a make-believe world , created for the protagonist 's benefit ( and the merriment of its creators ) by other characters in the novel . By offering no explicit indication , on the occasion in question , of his character-creators ' manipulation of the most appropriate moment and the most appropriate traditional ritual , Cervantes may well be making a most significant statement : behind the burlesque creativity of his characters , deepening and enriching that creativity with dimensions of his own experienced soul , there is always the writer himself . 
@@40786820 @786820/ <p> ontemporary philosophy of language views discourse as a form of action , as a human practice not simply regulated but constituted by conventions we collectively accept or ? agree upon. ? Truth is no longer defined as something to be measured exclusively by objects or events outside of language , but as residing as well in those shared procedures and binding conventions by which we agree to talk to each other in certain ways and name the world with certain words . In his Philosophical Investigations , Ludwig Wittgenstein has an imaginary listener ask : ? So , you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false ? ? To which he answers . ? It is what human beings say that is true and false , and they agree in the language they use . That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. ? 1 Within this view , sincerity or even sanity is no longer a matter of inner thoughts or feelings holding the ultimate truth or rationality of our words . It is rather a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Knowing how to use a language , knowing how to talk is , among other things , having learned what thoughts and feelings are conventionally represented in the words we use . Contemporary philosophy of language holds a view of human reality in which self , thoughts , feelings come neither before nor after language but in it . <p> The ideas I want to sketch and briefly explore are the following . First , that this conception of language and discourse is contemporary but not new : it is presupposed in everything we call fiction , and it was extensively explored in Don Quijote . Second , that Don Quijote explores this view by embodying the opposite view in the figure of its hero and by letting his rather solipsistic practice of discourse literally bump against the community that surrounds him and against the shared procedures and binding conventions that hold that community together . Third , that Don Quijote 's madness is precisely his inability to recognize and honor the agreements that constitute our inevitably shared forms of life . Fourth , that the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , language and the practice of discourse . Fifth , that the key to Don Quijote 's undertaking is the question of telling , which is the question of language and also the question of fiction . In another , well-known passage of his Philosophical Investigations , Wittgensten puts the question of telling in its simplest , most compelling form : <p> Something happens ? and then I make a noise . What for ? Presumably in order to tell what happens . ? But how is telling done ? When we said tell anything ? ? What is the language-game of telling ? I should like to say : you regard it much too much as a matter of course that one can tell anything to anyone ( I , 363 ) . <p> There are many different things we can tell : we can tell what happens or where to find something or how to go somewhere ; we can tell the time , the difference , the truth or a lie ; we can tell a story . These different kinds of telling cover some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in most cases , only in language : referring , describing , giving instructions , distinguishing and identifying , representing and , of course , understanding . All these uses of language that make telling possible and fiction intelligible are also the stuff of which the world of Don Quijote and Don Quijote 's madness are made . Now , Don Quijote 's madness is highly implausible : in the world we know , most people do not go crazy from reading books of fiction , although some are suspected to have committed suicide after reading Werther or Thus Spoke Zarathustra . But if it is hardly credible that somebody would go mad Don Quijote 's way , it is not altogether impossible . This ? implausible ? possibility engages us in the story , <p> 8 special issue ( 1988 ) <p> The Archeology of Fiction in Don Quijote <p> 119 <p> while keeping us somewhat distanced from the hero ; it teases us into feeling reassured that , unlike Don Quijote , we can certainly tell what is the case and what is not . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dons ' , which accounts for all the instances in which we are mistaken , duped or taken in . The text of Don Quijote exploits precisely the duplicity of language which , by the exercise of the same abilities , allows somebody to identify windmills as windmills but also misidentify them as giants , to get the right idea but also the wrong idea , to refer to something that actually exists but also to something that does not exist anywhere . With gestures , we are restricted to pointing only to what is present and perceptible ? here ? and ? now. ? With language , we are free to refer not only to what is present and perceptible but also to everything that is absent . What is absent may simply be somewhere else or may have happened at another time ; but it may neither be ? here ? nor anywhere else ; it may never have happened . This ability to refer to absent things endows us with a world , a conception of an objective space that we share with others . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes both truth and lies possible . It opens to us the possibility of fiction . One way to see how this possibility works and also how it works in the text and in the world of Don Quijote is to consider both the writing and the reading of fiction as a dialogic game of make-believe not unlike the mud-pie games we used to play in childhood.2 Fiction shares with the mud-pie game the ? seriousness ? of its pretense and the need to understand conventions and respect procedures , not so much because misunderstandings and abuses could spoil the fun of the game , but simply because they would abolish the game altogether . The name of the children 's game gives away the material substitution on which the game is based : dry mud instead of pie . The children act out a cross between metaphor and collage , in which mud is placed in the customary context of pies and is handled as a pie : it is literally decorated , sometimes with pebbles , sometimes with ? real ? raisins ; it gets metaphorically baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut into pieces , offered and exchanged ; usually it is only metaphorically tasted . While playing , children are constrained as well as protected by the material limits of the game : in order to have <p> 2 I have borrowed the concept of games of make-believe and some general ideas about mud-pies from Gareth Evans , The Varieties of Reference ( London and New York : Oxford University Press , 1982 ) , pp. 353-63 . <p> 120 <p> IN+S AZAR <p> Cervantes <p> their ? pie ? they have to remember all along that it is dry mud . The game calls for discrimination and care in the handling of things ; it enforces duplicity but makes no room for confusion : only those who really know the difference between mud and dough can play the game , and play it well . The pretense can not be properly upheld unless it is consciously acknowledged . The general rule of the game is that , by agreeing to abuse the normal procedures for reference in ordinary language , we will point to a piece of dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a pie , and act accordingly . In order to enter the game we must understand and agree to its conventionalized abuse of reference , to its pretense . Conversely , an abuse of the pretense , say , the ? realistic ? demand that the make-believe pie be edible , that it actually taste like a real piece of pie and that we act accordingly , will immediately shift us from the game into reality , where we will find ourselves with plain mud in our mouth . While engaged in their game , children may be accurately described as willingly and knowingly misidentifying the mud they call ? pie ? and treat as a pie , the pebbles they call ? raisins ? and handle as raisins , the board they call ? oven ? and use as an oven ; they just pretend that something that exists and is there is other than it is . The abuse of reference that fiction invites us to indulge in is of a more radical nature than mere substitution of misidentification , since , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as something is named or described in the text , we get all ? pies , ? as it were , and no ? mud. ? Unlike the children 's game , the pretense of fiction is not based on material substitution but on the creation of existence from scratch . I can imagine no single rule which could account for the creative power of our game . But for the sake of symmetry and contrast I would suggest , very tentatively , the following : the general rule of fiction is that by the conniving abuse of reference we are able to say and understand that there is something which in fact is not there , something which plainly does not exist . The game that Don Quijote invites us to play is not only of fiction , but also about fiction . This much we all know and agree upon . Our disagreements arise when we try to account , for instance , for the relationship between the novel and the books of chivalry , between their respective heroes , worlds and modes of narration . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition : Amadfs de Gaula is purported to be the negative model of Don Quijote : the adventures of the hidalgo are viewed as the adventures of the world of chivalry turned upside down . <p> 8 special issue ( 1988 ) <p> The Archeology of Fiction in Don Quijote <p> 121 <p> Yet Amadfs de Gaula and the books of chivalry are not simply the ? negative models ? for Don Quijote . And , in spite of Cervantes ' own words , the novel does not , or not simply , ? demolish the authority and influence that books of chivalry have in the world and among common people. ? First , because in Don Quijote ? common people ? become readers , characters who interpret texts , understand them rightly and wrongly and , in doing so , make them their own ; second , because the books of chivalry call up in Cervantes ' novel the presence of other books . And all these books , passionately read , believed in , misunderstood , critically examined or censored and burned , evoke in the end Literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? Don Quijote questions . And what it questions is not the fleeting authority of one particular genre , but the way in which readers confer authority upon the institution itself , upon literature and the written word . Thus , books of chivalry become the exemplary form of the contract between reader and institution that Don Quijote , the new text , presents as ? the old model. ? The classical genres , the ? old models ? are closed systems of rules that prescribe and set up a particular form of reality , an order of things . These rules direct and fulfill the reader 's expectations ; they promise and in effect deliver the prescribed order . The model that Amadfs and the books of chivalry offer to Don Quijote is a space with the structure of one of those board-games where the player has to move his pieces along a fixed path . The path has its points of arrival and departure and its ? accidents , ? all perfectly determined . In a board-game , each piece ? like the knight-errant ? has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsters , giants , rival knights , all the ? other ? characters in the books of chivalry are the obstacles that the hero must confront and overcome . The road is no more than the apparently contingent order in which these obstacles meet the knight . The characters and the road are the devices by which the text of chivalry displays and at the same time conceals its paradoxical coupling of chance and necessity , of destiny ? already established ? and action ? free only in appearance . The general rule of the game of chivalry is that the knight-errant must be on the road , that his encounters must take place , that the obstacles he confronts must in the end surrender to his heroic virtue . The sallies and encounters , the unequal distribution of victory ( the hero ) and defeat ( all his opponents ) , the implausible workings of magic itself must appear as ? natural ? events that call for no explanation . <p> 122 <p> IN+S AZAR <p> Cervantes <p> Cervantes ' novel does not stand in opposition to the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigm of difference . The strategy of this difference is , like dialogue itself , all inclusive and seemingly paradoxical : it assimilates without repeating and questions without demolishing ; it alters objects , concepts , relationships and other texts in order to make them intelligible . Thus , the books of chivalry are ever-present in the obsessive reading of the protagonist . But Don Quijote begins when the ? idle ? hidalgo has just stopped reading , which is precisely when we , the ? idle ? readers of the novel , begin to read . The contact between the protagonist and his books has been a process of mutual transformation : the books of fiction he reads drive Don Quijote mad , and in his madness he turns these fictions around and forces upon them the responsibilities of history and the authority of truth . From this transformed and transforming act of reading comes the project of yet another transformation : Don Quijote intends to become a knight-errant and to make his world a world of chivalry . Don Quijote 's enterprise begins when he realizes that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chivalry he found depicted in his books . The lack of traces of that ? old ? world may be explained in two different ways : either the state of affairs depicted in the books of chivalry never was that of the actual world and therefore the ? reality ? of chivalry is a mere fiction , or the state of affairs depicted in those books no longer is but was once that of the actual world . Don Quijote believes in the necessary truth of this second explanation . For him the discourse of chivalry books is referential , Amadfs actually existed , and the world once was as his books say it was . Moreover , the world of Amadfs ? the past ? had an order of its own , previous to language and unchanged by discourse , which is only its reflection . For Don Quijote , books of chivalry are not only historical evidence , they are all that now remains of the past , its only testimony . Now , the traditional archaeologist begins his undertaking with material objects ; old coins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities and civilizations . The new ? archaeology of knowledge ? proposed by Michel Foucault begins its reconstruction not with coins and shards but with texts from the past.3 These texts <p> are fragmentary evidence of a past practice of discourse ( parole ) . The undertaking of the new archaeologist is to reconstruct , out of this fragmentary evidence , the whole system of conventions ( langue ) that once made that form of discourse possible . Like the new archaeologist , Don Quijote begins his undertaking with texts , in his case , books of fiction which he believes to be accurate descriptions of past objects and events . He certainly does not plan to describe the objects he may find but to find in his immediate context the objects which fit the descriptions in his books . In order to accomplish his task , Don Quijote needs now to reverse the relationship he himself had established between language and reality : if the discourse of chivalry was tailored to the old order of things , it is now the world that must be adjusted to the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes for Don Quijote the necessary prescription for things to come . His task is then a monumental attempt to reconstruct language and discourse , and with language , the world . Like the new archaeologist , Don Quijote has evidence of a prior form of speech ; but his archaeology of discourse is founded in the belief that his books are direct and complete evidence of the old abstract system and that his duty is to reconstruct the old practice itself and its context of reality . His inevitable failure is written into the terms of his undertaking : a past form of life is as impossible to recover as the circumstances and the acts that once brought it into being . Thus , Don Quijote 's enterprise can only be carried on in a displaced way . His new circumstances , his acts and his words will no doubt bring some practice of discourse into existence , but it will be a new practice , never the one he was trying to recover . Don Quijote 's undertaking is fated to produce almost any kind of discourse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . As evoked by this paradoxical enterprise , the books of chivalry are the privileged objects of the world of Don Quijote . Yet they are nothing but a pretext . Amadfs is Don Quijote 's goal but , in fact , he is only Don Quijote 's point of departure . From the model of chivalry , Don Quijote derives another paradoxical aspect of his undertaking : he not only must find identity through difference and permanence through change but he must also make chance the exclusive instrument of his necessary reconstruction . Thus , Don Quijote imagines his world as a vast collection of ? tuertos que enderezar ? and appoints himself as the agent who will bring about the perfect order of things that his world is calling for . Having imagined this much , he only needs to be on the road . <p> 124 <p> IN+S AZAR <p> Cervantes <p> Adventures will come to him , as they necessarily came to Amadfs . It should not matter where he goes , or rather it should matter that he be on the road without destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictable , as , according to his books , chance must be . And if Don Quijote is ever going to control chance , he must , paradoxically , let chance control his journey . To do otherwise would be to admit that specific times , places , persons and circumstances ? all the things that are contingent ? do make a difference , that chance can never be controlled . Like the mud-pie game , Don Quijote 's archaeology is based on material substitution , on a cross between metaphor and collage , in which a barber 's basin is put in the customary context of a knight 's helmet and is handled accordingly . Don Quijote abuses reference as the children do : he points to a windmill and calls it a giant , or to a pair of Benedictine friars and calls them evil enchanters ; and having named them so , he acts accordingly . His problem is , of course , that while he acts according to the new identities he has assigned to people and things , these things and people dons ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pies are pies and mud is simply mud . And this is necessarily so , because Don Quijote has no shared or public conventions to invoke , no game to play . He plans to succeed by prescription , since he expects that , as long as his behavior honors his words , other people and the world will oblige . But he faces reality with the utterances of a strictly private language , which he could never bring into agreement with other people or with the world . Don Quijote 's enterprise shares in only the ? seriousness ? of the children 's game but not its controlled pretense . Thus , like some untutored children , Don Quijote demands , on every occasion , that his mud taste like a pie , which explains how he ends up so many times and in so many ways with ? plain mud ? in his mouth .

The fundamental gesture of Cervantes ' novel , the gesture of fiction , is that those characters and events exist only in the words that name them , in the discourse we read .

@@40786821 @786821/ <p> Reviewed by David Rossell ( State University of New York at Buffalo ) Published on H-SHEAR ( September , 1997 ) <p> Progress and Culture along the Erie Canal <p> It is easy to envision The Artificial River becoming a staple of undergraduate survey courses . Although this is Carol Sheriff 's first book ( a revision of her Yale dissertation under the direction of William Cronon ) , her prose has a clarity and forthrightness more often found among journalists than historians ( this truly is intended as a compliment ) . The Artificial River engages and energizes the contentious historiography of the market revolution , but historians haunt only the end notes , leaving the main text to the people of upstate New York . While her list of sources shows Sheriff to be a careful and accomplished scholar , she kindly and without condescension explains issues that would be unfamiliar to non-specialists . In short , The Artificial River is a rare treat : a book with great intellectual depth , but accessible to the general public . <p> Sheriff argues that the residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide on each side of the Erie Canal and its tributaries ) eagerly sought long-distance trade and the consumer goods that markets brought to their homes . The fact that people supported the Erie Canal at all " suggests that at least some had aspirations to engage in broader market exchange " ( p. 11 ) . But while craving fresh oysters and other luxuries , they worried about the social costs to their communities . This was the " paradox of progress " : a desire for money and consumer goods coupled with an ambivalence toward the market processes that made their acquisition possible . " Yet , despite their disagreements and ambivalence , " Sheriff writes , " upstate New Yorkers generally shared a commitment to the notion that humans could improve and perfect the world around them " ( p. 8 ) . <p> In the first chapter , " Visions of Progress , " Sheriff describes the " culture of progress . " She argues that the denizens of the canal corridor , unlike their parents and residents in other parts of the country , combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a belief that " the goals of individuals should be subordinated to the common good , or the commonwealth " ( p. 14 ) . This ideology of " practical republicanism " eventually would become institutionalized in the Whig and Republican parties , and it formed the core of the culture of progress . <p> The next chapter , " The Triumph of Art over Nature , " explores in greater detail the republican beliefs of upstate New Yorkers . Canal supporters saw the project as the product of a peculiarly American art ( here Sheriff uses a nineteenth-century term for technology ) . " REPUBLICAN FREE MEN " built the canal , according to a capstone in Lockport , near Buffalo ( p. 35 ) . This said , western New Yorkers realized that most of the canal laborers bore no resemblance to republican free men . They were landless laborers with few prospects for advancement . Canal supporters consoled themselves that if the laborers were something of a permanent lower class , at least they were geographically mobile ( they moved on when the construction did ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vision of republicanism , they studiously ignored them and hoped that they would keep moving so their degraded status would not taint any one locale . But whom to praise , if not the men digging the mud and hauling the stone ? Through some neat rhetorical legerdemain , the canal 's sponsors lauded the politicians and officials for their vision and persistence ; skilled craftsmen praised themselves and their workmanship ; and " Laborers , meanwhile , gave a quick hurrah before moving on to another public works project " ( p. 51 ) . <p> Sheriff then discusses how New Yorkers and tourists conceived of the canal as part of the natural landscape . Transcendentalists such as Nathaniel Hawthorne mourned the ugliness of Clinton 's Ditch , and the devastation its construction had wrought . Few residents of upstate New York cherished such sensibilities . They praised the canal as progress embodied , a genuine " improvement " on the landscape . Sheriff argues that the canal juxtaposed the sublimity of nature with the ingenuity of man , reaffirming the belief " that it was not necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 62 ) . When western New Yorkers did complain about the canal , they groused about low bridges , not fewer muskrats . They were angered not by graveyards of rotting trees , but by circumstances that hindered them from exploiting to the fullest the canal 's economic promise . <p> The next two chapters , " The Politics of Land and Water " and " The Politics of Business " draw on the papers of the Canal Board , a state-appointed committee that oversaw the canal and heard grievances about its governance . Petitioners couched most of their appeals in rather republican terms , trying to show how the course of action they urged would serve the common good . But if claimants used a republican vocabulary , the meanings of the words had changed . Sheriff explains : " People still spoke of their republican rights , and they still lauded the common good or public interest . But to many of them , republicanism had come to mean ' fairness ' " ( p. 100 ) . They agreed that the state had a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensate those inured during the process . <p> By the late 1830s , however , New Yorkers were taking the Erie Canal for granted and seem to have assumed that it , like a natural river , was immutable , unchanging . They had invested time and money on the assumption that the canal always would follow the same course , considering themselves in an informal contract with the state to that effect . Rights , not fairness , became the issue . When the Canal Board considered changing the route of the waterway or the locations of important facilities , petitioners quickly reminded the state of its " obligations , " and how violating those promises would betray the public trust . By the 1840s , businessmen expected that the state would help shield them from declines in the economy . In return for this assurance , they acknowledged at least a theoretical responsibility to pursue ventures that served the common good . If businessmen did not always support the common good in their commercial practices , their sense of public duty found other outlets--in the widespread reform impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated thirty thousand canal workers provided the businessmen with a loud , profane reminder on the need for reform . Missionaries reminded the middle class that " religious , social , and commercial progress " could not be separated ( p. 151 ) . They warned the businessmen that unless that wanted responsibility for a depraved republic and a delayed millennium , they had best support Sabbatarianism and the Bethel Society ( an organization pledged to the moral reformation of canal workers ) . The middle class had a glittering dream of commercial progress , but the nightmare of European class conflict was settling like a shadow over the whole canal corridor . Reform , Sheriff argues , was the middle class ' way to " direct the market revolution away from the nightmare and toward the dream " ( p. 167 ) . <p> Although The Artificial River deals with a range of issues , including religion , reform and the environment , it most clearly addresses the historiography on the market revolution . The debate over the spread of capitalism through America has attracted a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is substantial disagreement over terminology , 1 the crux of the issue is this : when did America become a capitalist society in thought and deed ? Some of the earlier work in this area argued that many communities during the nineteenth century adhered to a pre-capitalist or use-value economic system . That is , they did not regard goods and labor as commodities to be sold with a market-set cash value , but as items to be exchanged based on traditional reciprocal relationships . Other historians see the American Revolution as unleashing the spirit of capitalism in the new nation , incorporating most of the nation into the market economy during the 1790s . Another group of scholars has argued that Americans may have embraced long-distance exchange for a variety of reasons , not necessarily capitalist or pre-capitalist. 2 Sheriff places herself in that last school , arguing in an end note : " most residents of what would become the canal corridor eagerly turned to market exchange in order to make their daily lives more comfortable and to provide economic opportunities for their children . Yet ... many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of allowing individuals to profit at someone else 's expense " ( p. 183 ) . <p> By classifying herself in such a way , however , Sheriff does not give her work the full credit it is due . The intellectual heart of the book is her description of what she calls the " culture of progress , " and with its presentation , she transcends the tired debates over the market revolution and begins exploring the early culture ( or cultures ) of capitalism . Unlike the historians of the moral economy school , Sheriff does not try to explain away people 's market activity . Instead , she shows how participation in long-distance markets was just one part of a cohesive world view that centered around a belief in mankind 's progress . Sheriff 's chapters initially seem somewhat disconnected for this very reason--she ranges over several ostensibly unrelated topics , only to show by the end of the book how they all fall together . <p> Americans , Sheriff argues , saw the Erie Canal as a true internal improvement--something that increased the financial value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... in a moral or social sense " ( p. 25 ) . The culture of progress emphasized monetary gain , but recognized other areas of improvement as no less important . Here lay the root of the republican concerns over the canal workers . If the laborers were doomed to manual work , unable to advance into less degraded occupations , then this situation undercut the popular faith that self-improvement was open to everyone . This is why the laborers had to disappear from the rhetorical landscape of the canal . By emphasizing how the canal blended into and improved the natural landscape , travelers also restated their faith that material progress ( the canal ) was compatible with moral advancement ( the sublime in nature ) . The culture of progress could be a demanding taskmaster . It not only required that people strive for financial advancement , but it also demanded that the community benefit from individuals ' quest for profit . The result was the persistence of the rhetoric of the common good in appeals to the Canal Board , and in the efforts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Johnson and Charles Sellers3 have linked the market revolution to religion and reform , but their works focus on reform as a means of controlling the working class . Persuasive as their arguments might be for some of the budding capitalists in this time period , such motives surely did not lurk behind the philanthropy and religious beliefs of all businessmen . Sheriff takes a more sensible approach . Certainly , she argues , landowners and businessmen scrambled for wealth , and were not above duping the state into subsidizing their efforts . But , as the rhetoric of the common good shows , their actions had great psychological costs in a nation just one generation removed from the Revolution . Evangelical religion and reform movements resonated with people in the canal corridor because they helped pay those costs , and because they helped reconcile material improvement with moral progress. 4 <p> This is a formidable argument , especially when Sheriff links businessmen 's participation in the Bethel Society to the culture of progress . Less persuasive is her claim that residents of the canal corridor still believed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a longing for it was part of the culture of progress . It seems that Sheriff hopes to find the moral economy someplace in the canal corridor , but she herself admits that all the talk about the " common good " could be rather self-serving . She writes how the rhetoric in petitions to the Canal Board oftentimes was little more than " a moral justification for pushing their commercial benefit at someone else 's expense " ( p. 134 ) . When discussing conflicts over changes in the canal route , she notes , " Although most upstate businessmen would acknowledge that the state could change the Canal route for ' good and substantial reasons , ' petitioners invariably failed to recognize the presence of such good reasons in case where their business investments depended on the waterway 's original route " ( p. 125 ) . Even farmers , she writes , " adopted the language of the ' common good ' in their appeals to the state , but they saw that good as being intimately connected with their own property investments " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a vestigial moral economy by describing anti-commercial feelings among landowners . The evidence for this , however , is somewhat contradictory . In one case , the Lansing family grew indignant when the Canal Board assumed that the opportunity to establish a tavern would compensate it for land and trees lost to canal expansion . Levinus and Abraham Lansing wrote a scathing letter , declaring , " it seems a libel upon the character of the State to say that a tipling shop is such a benefit to an individual or to a community that the State ought to compel persons to resort to the establishment of such places of immorality &amp; vice to get pay for the land taken from them for the use of the public " ( p. 106 ) . Yet , the Lansings ' feelings against taverns can not be construed as an anti-commercial bias , for as Abraham Lansing explained to the Canal Board , his brother Levinus grew " trees for the purpose of selling the fruit they yield him and not merely for his private use " ( p. 97 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a neighbor who refused him access to a bridge across the canal , with the goal of forcing him to sell his property at a reduced price ( p. 96 ) . Given that businessmen clearly had no monopoly on sharp practices , it seems that landowners complained not so much about commerce , but about situations in which commerce did not benefit them . <p> How , then , can we explain the petitioners ' constant recourse to the rhetoric of the moral economy if they did not believe in it themselves ? Certainly , one need not long for a moral economy to use the rhetoric of the common good . In modern America , not many people demand favors of the government purely on the basis of self-interest . To do so , even in today 's capitalist economy , would doom one 's efforts to failure . When corporations ask for tax breaks , they do not claim that their shareholders deserve the additional income . Instead , they emphasize the benefits that will accrue to the community thanks to the new jobs that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not indicative of the their beliefs at all , but rather the product of a political lexicon that had not yet changed to accommodate the new market conditions ( and remains remarkably resilient to this day ) ? The rhetoric of republicanism was alive and well in antebellum America , even though , as Sheriff indicates , its meaning had changed . People were familiar with the words and imagery of republicanism and the moral economy , so it is only logical that they would use the materials they had at hand to justify claims in the relatively new environment of long-distance exchange . Sheriff testifies that few people actually practiced the moral economy that they preached . Rather than ascribe mass hypocrisy or secret longings to the people of the canal corridor , and force on them beliefs that they did not seem to take to heart , perhaps we should consider that they had not yet developed a way to say what they meant . <p> If Sheriff has indeed exaggerated the extent that canal supporters longed for the moral economy while practicing capitalism , this does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture of progress . A more serious concern is the vagueness that surrounds her subjects , the people of the canal corridor . Sheriff divides these people into two general groups : landowners and businessmen . Sensibly , she does not try to establish rigid boundaries between the two groups , for merchants could own land and farmers could keep taverns . Nevertheless , it seems as though some sort of clarification is necessary , especially in the case of the Bethel Society . A crucial question is who supported the Society ? Sheriff indicates that some commercial men donated time and money , but where did the rest of the membership come from ? Did farm families support the organization ? Is there any correlation between membership and proximity to the canal ? It would be relatively easy for people living fifteen miles from the canal to forget about the workers plying its waters . If farmers living a distance from the canal did not support worker reforms , could they still be said to adhere to the culture of progress ? This is admittedly difficult research to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with city directories , tax valuations , and census data . Such an examination may have been beyond the scope of this project , but if the culture of progress is to fulfill its promise as an explanatory concept , historians will need to uncover more information on its adherents . <p> Another serious concern is the seeming inevitability of the culture of progress . Sheriff links it to the Whig and Republican parties and states that it was the wave of the future . The ultimate success of the culture of progress can not be denied , but evidence from Sheriff 's work and that of other scholars suggests that as late as the 1830s and 1840s , its future was not so certain . Donald H. Parkerson has argued that people migrated to the canal corridor to take advantage of market opportunities , and that people migrated away from the area in order to avoid such entanglements ( p. 5 ) . Between the distinctive culture of the canallers and the beliefs of those who voted against the culture of progress with their feet ( by moving out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture of progress might have been much less assured than Sheriff allows . This does not so much change Sheriff 's thesis as refine it . The book would be richer and more textured if readers had some feel for how adherents defended the culture of progress from the unconverted . It seems that the Bethel Society would be one such effort , but there could have been others . Were there any efforts to persuade people who truly practiced a moral economy ? If so , what shape did they take , and how successful were they ? <p> The Artificial River also would have benefited from a fuller discussion of how the law applied to the Erie Canal . As Theodore Steinberg has shown in Nature Incorporated , 6 legal documents can tell us much about the ways people thought about the environment in general and waterways in particular . Sheriff notes that people called the canal an artificial river , and differentiated it from the sublime waters of true nature . As time passed , however , she notes that landowners began to take the canal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true river . Changes in riparian law were occurring in New England during this time period as the owners of the Lowell mills consolidated their control over the Merrimack River , their source of water power . It would be interesting to see how the law regarded the canal--as a man-made object , as a natural one , or as something in-between--and if the canal changed in the eyes of the law during the time period Sheriff examines . This legal data might serve as a useful baseline , allowing scholars to link the ideas in upstate New York to those in other parts of the country . It also might help in establishing a clearer chronology for the development of the culture of progress . <p> These caveats and questions , however , do not seriously undermine Sheriff 's accomplishment . The culture of progress is a brilliant concept that synthesizes the best of the current literature on the market revolution , but strikes its own path where the historiography has failed to help us understand people 's reactions to the expansion of capitalism . The notion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the case with any exciting new idea . Like its namesake , The Artificial River is a resounding success . It leads us into new landscapes , and it is certain to inspire other projects to investigate the cultures of the marketplace in antebellum America . <p> 2 .

@@40786822 @786822/ <h> Baha'u'llah 's <h> Surah of the Companions <h> ( Surat al-ashab ) <h> By Juan R. I. Cole <p> How did Bahaullahs claims to be the promised one of the Bab become public and a matter of controversy among the Babi community ? Bahaullah made a private declaration of his messianic mission , of course , to a handful of family members and friends at the garden of Necip Pasa ( " the Garden of Ridwan " ) in Baghdad in April , 1863 just before he was exiled to Istanbul . But he continued to keep a messianic secret from most of the rest of the Babi community back in Iran for a further three years or so . The Surah of the Companions would play an important role in his ending of that messianic secret and the making public of his claims . <p> Mirza Husayn Ali Nuri ( 1817-1892 ) was a middle son of the Iranian government official and grandee , Mirza Buzurg Nuri . Mirza Husayn Ali joined the messianic Babi movement in 1844 and played a low-key role in it till after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a center of leadership for the Babis in the parlous 1850s , and although most Babis came to accept Bahaullahs younger half-brother Mirza Yahya Subh-i Azal as the primary leader of the movement , many formed a special attachment to Bahaullah , as well , moved by his mystical letters and treatises . Most Babis thought well of both figures and did not , in the 1850s , feel that they needed to choose among them . Bahaullah was exiled to Baghdad in Ottoman Iraq in early 1853 , after having been imprisoned on false charges of involvement in the Babi attempt on the shahs life of August , 1852 , of which he was cleared . Bahaullahs growing popularity in the early 1860s caused many pilgrims from Iran to seek him out in Baghdad when they visited the shrines of the Imams in Najaf and Karbala . This development annoyed the Iranian government , which put pressure on the Ottomans to exile Bahaullah farther away from Iran . <p> The Ottomans acquiesced , and decided to send him to Edirne from Baghdad , as is apparent from documents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so his brief stay in Istanbul in fall of 1863 had been intended to be only a stop-over . In winter of late 1863 , Baha'u'llah settled in the Muradiyyah Quarter of Edirne , first in a small house , then in a larger one opposite the Mawlavi sufi center . He lived in the Muradiyyah quarter for about six months ( circa mid-December 1863 through mid-June 1864 ) . He then moved to the house of Amrullah north of the great mosque of Sultan Selim . It is impossible to date with complete certainty the Tablets or letters Bahaullah wrote back to Iran announcing his mission publicly , but my best guess is that they date to around winter , late 1865 and early 1866 . They certainly precede , and in fact helped provoke the discord between Bahaullah and Subh-i Azal that led to charges against the latter that he attempted to poison Bahaullah or have him murdered . In the wake of these events , Bahaullah broke up the house of Amrullah and moved on 10 March 1866 to the house of Riza Bey. 1 It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated no later than Winter of 1866 , and more likely late 1865 . <p> The explicitness of the Surah of the Companions about Baha'u'llah 's station distinguished it from earlier proclamatory tablets . A work in which no explicit claim appears to have been made was the Arabic Tablet of Ahmad Yazdi , dated by Taherzadeh as 1282 ( 27 May 1865-15 May 1866 ) . Although Baha'u'llah speaks of the " news " ( naba ' ) , which we may now understand as his own advent , and although he refers to himself with lofty adjectives , the tablet could have been read as a Babi prayer . Baha'u'llah affirms the truth of the Bab , and includes himself among those " obedient " to him ( wa inna kullun li amrihi la-min al-amilin ) , urges the Babis to follow the laws of the Bayan , which he calls the " Mother Book , " and extolls the Bab as the " king of messengers " ( sultan ar-rusul ) . At the end of the tablet ( in a passage not translated in the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of the City of God ' ( Baghdad ) who had " believed in God and in Him , Whom God shall send forth on the Day of Resurrection . " The use of the imperfect tense ( yabathuhu allahu ) would seem to indicate that the advent had not yet occurred as of that writing . Although the Tablet of Ahmad makes Baha'u'llah sound more as though he were claiming to be the vicar of the Bab than a new Manifestation , these formal ambiguities appear not to have prevented Ahmad Yazdi from understanding that Baha'u'llah was making a messianic claim , at least according to the memoirs he recorded as an old man . The tablet actually reached him after he had already left Baghdad and come to Istanbul , and the Babis in Istanbul were well-informed as to the nature of Baha'u'llah 's claims , which would have provided a social context in the which the tablet was read less ambiguously as an assertion that he was He whom God shall make manifest . Certainly , he says that is the message he took in 1865-66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Baha'u'llah carefully crafted some early tablets so that a contextless reading of them by Babis not in the know would not raise a controversy . I bring all this up to indicate the difficulties that the hermeneutics of Baha'u'llah 's contextless tablets of any period face . In fact , the whole subject of how texts are read by their audience , and how authors employ ambiguity , which European historians have investigated at length , needs extensive investigation in the context of Islamic and Iranian culture , and obviously has implications for the study of the Babi and Baha'i movements. 3 <p> Among the most important tablets of this period was the Tablet of the Companions. 4 Adib Taherzadeh has usefully pulled together the available basic texts dealing with the reception of the Surat al-ashab back in Iran . It was written for Aqa Munib ( or Munir ) Kashani ( d. 1868 ) . Kashani , from a prominent merchant family of Kashan , was nearly killed by his father for becoming a Babi , but instead he expelled him from the household . Kashani went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courier to Tehran , Qazvin and Tabriz , to which he carried missives from Baha'u'llah and Azal . While still in Baghdad , Aqa Munib was informed by Baha'u'llah of his claims ( during Ridvan ? ) , and accepted them . Kashani accompanied Baha'u'llah to Istanbul in 1863 , holding a lamp before his howdah at times . Baha'u'llah sent him back to Iran from Istanbul some time between August and November , 1863 . My own conclusion is that it was in the winter-spring of 1865-66 that Baha'u'llah sent Aqa Munib Kashani the Tablet of the Companions . Kashani was then in Tehran , and Samandar says he was the first to make known Baha'u'llah 's assertion that he was He whom God shall make manifest in that city . From there he took took or sent the surah to Qazvin , where it provoked immediate tumult , according to Kazim Samandar , an eye-witness ( who is named in the surah , though apparently by another name " Ali ? " ) . 5 Sayyid Mihdi Dahaji , a companion of Baha'u'llah who lived in Baghdad from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1863 , wrote that he first heard in 1283 that he heard that Baha'u'llah had openly declared himself ( izhar-i zuhur farmudih and ) . 6 The Islamic year 1283 straddled 1866 and 1867 . Since news took time to travel , our dating of the Surah of the Companions therefore seems plausible . <p> Mirza Haydar Ali Isfahani was also in Tehran when Kashani received the Surah of the Companions : <p> In Tihran I again met Jinab-i Munir Munib . Since he knew of my convictions and my love for the Ancient Beauty , he showed me a Table called the Suriy-i-Ashab , which had been revealed in his honor by Baha'u'llah . As I read this Tablet , I felt in every verse a fire of enthusiasm , and I could not control my feelings . So I turned to Jinab-i-Munir and asked him whether Siyyid Muhammad had deceived Azal , or Azal had deceived Siyyid Muhammad , or whether the two of them had simply joined together in rebellion against Baha'u'llah . When Jinab-i-Munir heard these words he embraced me and kissed me on the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one thing alone , and that is to join forces against him. 7 <p> Isfahani 's account makes it clear that he read the Surah of the Companions as an open declaration that Baha'u'llah was He whom God shall make manifest , the promised one of the Babis . <p> Many of the phrasings in the Surah of the Companions resemble those of the Surah of Blood . In the Surah of Blood , written for Nabil-i Azam Zarandi , Baha'u'llah makes explicit that he held back his secret for many years : " O people , I bolted up the gates of paradise for twenty years , lest anything issue from My lips that might cause the fire of hatred to blaze forth in your breasts . . . O people , I verily am Ali the Bab , and this is but another Return after the first .

" Baha'u'llah singles him out at the only " man of insight " who accompanied him on his trip to Istanbul , which provides supporting evidence to the idea that most of those Babis Baha'u'llah took with him were persons , such as Muhammad Ali Salmani , who he feared would get up to some mischief if left alone in Baghdad . That Baha'u'llah did not bring with him more trusted and cultured companions , however , constituted a loss to historians , since the Salmani type produced inadequate memoirs of the period . We find Baha'u'llah castigating partisans of Azal for clinging " to the same arguments as did the people of the Qur'an in the past . " <p> Baha'u'llah 's early kerygma , as represented in this surah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in the Bab ( or earlier prophets ) who rejected Baha'u'llah , since Baha'u'llah was 1 ) the Return of the Bab and 2 ) the proofs he put forth for his station resembled those of the previous prophets . He likens the Babis who reject him to the Muslims who rejected the Bab , saying " This is , in truth , he whom you have sought from the beginning that hath no beginning . This is the visage toward which all faces turned " and " By God , He who appeared in the year 60 is manifest once more . " He at one point declares , " O people of the Bayan , Ali ( the Bab ) hath appeared in a new mantle . In truth , he was named Husayn in the realm of names , and Baha ' in the kingdom of eternity , and in the domain of the Unknowable Essence he was given this name . " The reference to the name Husayn can double as a prosaic one ( Baha'u'llah was Husayn Ali Nuri ) , and as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Imam Husayn . Baha'u'llah further adverts to his mystical experience in the Siyah-Chal , his " intimation " of future greatness , when he says , " People , in truth I am that good ' you were promised in the year Nine . " The year nine had been designated by some Shaykhis as the time for the advent , and it coincided with nine years after the Babs declaration , a time when Bahaullah was in the shahs dungeon and received his first revelations . In what is probably a reference to Baha'u'llah 's writings in the period 1853-1863 , which spoke highly of Azal and deferred to him as Babi leader , he wrote , " O people , see not discrepancies between the verses we have revealed , for these have all descended from one strong in power , from the realm of immortality , and differ according to various stations . " Baha'u'llah 's identification with the Bab may have made it easier to insist that the laws of the Bayan remained in force at this point " He revealed to you divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning it . " A similar commitment to the laws of the Bayan is present in the 1865 Tablet of Ahmad Yazdi . Finally , Baha'u'llah here for the first time defended his having kept a messianic secret , ' writing , " Whenever we have , at one time , concealed this Cause from you , and at another revealed it to you , this has been a mercy from us upon you , and upon all the worlds . For some of the people are weak and feeble , such that they would be unable to witness the light of the sun by reason of the infirmity in their eyes . " The gradualism in Baha'u'llah 's self-revelation is explained by the need to prepare his audience over time for the shock of the declaration . <p> Baha'u'llah instructs Kashani to tell others of his declaration only with extreme caution . He does , however , suggest persons whom Kashani ought to approach , by addressing them in the letter . Several of these had met Baha'u'llah in Baghdad , but had not formed any particular allegiance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written to Baha'u'llah from Tehran , or " Zaman , " to whom Baha'u'llah had earlier sent letters containing hints of his station . ( " Servant , read what we revealed to you aforetime , and smell in its ink the fragrance of musk from the tresses of the divine Beloved . " ) It seems clear that Baha'u'llah is capitalizing on a network of acquaintance and correspondence , hoping to mobilize these Babis into a loyalty to him . One of those addressed , Ibn Nabil , appears to be from a family that adopted Babism and then reverted to Islam , and Baha'u'llah now reaches out to regain such fallen-away Babis for his cause . The new believers in Baha'u'llah are instructed to bear all persecution patiently ( for now it would come , not only from Muslims , but from partisans of Azal , as well ) . <p> The Surah of the Companions contains some striking images and metaphors , and an explicit declaration of Baha'u'llah 's mission . It is not , however , a doctrinal statement . Rather , it is an intensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty .

@@40786828 @786828/ <p> Reviewed by David B. Danbom ( Department of History , North Dakota State University ) Published on H-Rural ( June , 1999 ) <p> The Fruits of Natural Advantage is the story of how highly specialized fruit growers , using intensive methods in limited geographic areas in which " natural advantages " could be obtained , brought forth what Steven Stoll calls " industrial " agriculture in California . By industrial , Stoll means an agricultural system that was highly capitalized , scientifically sophisticated , entrepreneurially astute , dependent upon cooperation among growers and between growers and government , sensitive to consumers ' desires , and dramatically divided along functional , class , and racial lines between employers and workers . <p> Stoll begins his tale with an impressively informed discussion of the agricultural regions of California and the numerous variations of climate and soil among them , variations that could spell doom for the careless--such as the wheat farmers who initially sought to actualize the state 's agricultural potential--but that offered the opportunity for great wealth to those who made the industrial countryside . The orchardists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crops , but that was not enough . They also had to learn the business of fruit , beginning with the packinghouse and concluding with the consumer . This involved them in understanding transportation , jobbing , distribution , canning , the shelf life of fresh fruits , promotion , brand names , advertising , and much else besides . <p> In the process of grappling with these business challenges , California fruit growers became much more sophisticated entrepreneurs than were other American farmers . Stoll poses agricultural economist Edwin Nourse against Country Lifer and horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey on the subject of California fruit culture . For the former , who saw farming as a business to which business methods should be applied , California was a utopia . For the latter , who understood farming as a way of life , it was a dystopia . <p> While they do serve Stoll 's didactic purposes , Nourse and Bailey were not the polar opposites he suggests . Nor did California represent the future of American agriculture , as Nourse suggested , simply because specialty crops and commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-California farmers all backward folk playing catch-up in the entrepreneurial game , as observers such as Nourse and Aaron Sapiro believed during the 1920s , and as Stoll implies . There were plenty of astute entrepreneurs growing wheat and cotton , but setting up a co-op and slapping a brand name on such crops does n't change the reality that these are commodities trading on a world market , not perishable specialty crops protected by high bars to entry . <p> Stoll can be faulted for not knowing enough about other places , but his knowledge of California fruit culture is most impressive . He has the rare ability to understand such difficult concepts as soil types and marketing systems and the rarer ability to explain those clearly to the reader . His explanation of the post-harvest life cycle of the pear , to cite just one example , is engrossing . Now I know why the yellow Bartletts I bought Saturday are turning into another life form as I pen these words . With apologies to Stephen Ambrose , just about anyone can make Lewis and Clark interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stoll counts on his ability to explain clearly and to write with simple elegance to carry him beyond the creation of the industrial agriculture of the fruit orchards and into the continuing challenges the growers faced . Creation of a monocropped landscape presented them with potentially devastating insect infestations which they countered--with a major assist from the California Agricultural Experiment Station--mainly with chemicals . Their need for abundant , cheap , usually non-white , and socially immobile ( but physically mobile ) labor was a continuous challenge , as was securing water at cheap rates . All of these problems compelled them to organize themselves politically and to mobilize government for their purposes . Much of this will be familiar to subscribers to H-Rural , some of whom will wish at times that Stoll would go a bit deeper and tell us something we do n't know , as he does with the pears . But a familiar story--even one that is likely to be challenged by David Vaught 's book , due out this summer from Johns Hopkins--is worth reading if it is well-told , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention about this significant book is the debt it owes to William Cronon . Nature 's Metropolis appears in the bibliography ( and Cronon is mentioned in the acknowledgements ) , but its shadow falls over the entire book . In Cronon 's terms , The Fruits of Natural Advantage is about how human beings applied physical and entrepreneurial energy to " first nature " and brought forth " second nature . " As such , it is a tribute to the author , but also to Cronon , who has given us a whole new perspective on the past and has moved historical discourse to a higher level .

Blackman , Ph.D . <p> Call for Chapters : - <p> Abstract Submission Deadline : May 1 , 2017 <p> Introduction : - <p> In 1967 , the Revolt of the Black Athlete , the appellation given to Civil Rights-Black Power era protests in sports , began in earnest : heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali refused induction into the U.S. military and continued to publically criticized U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War as imperialistic and racist and several groups of black athletes launched protests against discrimination in sports and society , including a campaign to raise awareness of black America 's discontent with the continuation of institutionalized racism by boycotting the 1968 Olympics . Their collective protest efforts led the media then and a few scholars since to examine the experience of blacks in sports and the nexus of race and sport in American society . Collectively , these works suggest that historically black communities have attempted to use sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus improving whites ' images of blacks , and consequently bettering race relations . Secondly , that protests in sports , especially an Olympic boycott , contradicted traditional black advancement means of using sports and thus , was unpopular and lacked the sufficient support to materialize . <p> Although these works have established that the Civil Rights-Black Power movements occurred in sports and influenced black athletes , our understanding of the Revolt of the Black Athlete is limited by several factors . First , scholars have accepted that black communities , without exception , accepted the myth of the black athletes ' accomplishments as a means of advancement and that sports have not served other advancement purposes in black communities . Most studies on black advancements ideologies and strategies , however , conclude that black advancement was often influenced by various factors and thus , was complicated and multifaceted . Studies of the Revolt have not asked or attempted to answer the impact that multiple advancement philosophies , including Black Power ( nationalism ) , had on the traditional black uses of sports . Secondly , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times replicate that media 's opinions . Most scholars , however , have not asked or adequately answer how the mainstream media influenced interpretations of the Revolt and what other critical sources , including the autobiographies of participating athletes , activists , and black media tell us about the Revolt . Third , although these works demonstrate that the Revolt occurred during the Civil Rights , Black Power , and Black Students movements , they do not adequately situate the Revolt within those movements by comparing its impetuses , goals , and impetuses to those of such movements . In particular , many of these studies are reluctant to examine if the activism of black athletes encountered the same kinds and degrees of opposition as those movements . Lastly , the study of the Revolt has mainly been limited to studies of Ali 's anti-war saga , the call for a black boycott of the 1968 Olympics , and a few studies of black student-athletes ' activism on campus . Yet , other scholarship has shown that black communities debated the utility of integration into white-sports institutions and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HBCU sports , used sports as a venue to protest , and that black athletes and communities supported Third World anti-colonial efforts to use sports to acquire their liberation , including supporting the anti-apartheid in sports movement .

In particular , the call seeks articles that complicate the narrative concerning how black and other minorities have used or viewed sports during the overlapping Cold War and Civil Rights periods . <p> Objective : - <p> In particular , the anthology will expand our understanding of the Revolt and the relationships of its various components ( Ali , the proposed Olympic boycott , ect. ) to the Black Freedom Struggle , Black Advancement Strategies , the Civil Rights Movement , the Black Power Movement , the Black Students ' Movement , the Anti-War Movement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Babi and Baha'i women have often acted as leaders in the community , holding its highest positions and participating in its most important decisions . In the first days of His Revelation , the Bab Himself appointed Qurratu'l-'Ayn , Tahirih , as one of His chief disciples - one of the nineteen Letters of the Living who were the first to believe in Him and were entrusted by Him with the mission of spreading His Faith and shepherding its believers . This remarkable woman would soon become one of the most radical and influential of the Bab 's disciples and the leader of the Babis of Karbala .

The Baha'is in the Holy Land instinctively turned to her as their guide and protector . And again , during the Guardian 's absences from his duties during the early years of his ministry , he repeatedly entrusted the affairs of the Cause to the Greatest Holy Leaf . 2 <p> After the passing of Shoghi Effendi , women were once more called upon to serve the Baha'i Faith at its highest levels .

Although a few exceptional Baha'i women have always set the example for their sex , the role of women on Baha'i institutions in the community as a whole has not been comparable to that of men . Traditional notions of inequality , as well as the restrictions of a hostile environment , have caused the participation of women to lag behind . Even to the present day , the participation of women on National Spiritual Assemblies , Boards of Counsellors , and Auxiliary Boards is not equal to that of men , as the charts show .

Virtually all Baha'i laws and practices have gone through a gradual evolution in Baha'i history . The recognition of the principle of the equality of men and women , and its gradual application in the development of Baha'i Administration is no exception . <p> The principle of progressive revelation , the concept of the gradual emergence of divine purpose , is a universal principle which applies within the dispensation of each Manifestation , as well as between dispensations . Baha'u'llah Himself has explained : <p> Know of a certainty that in every Dispensation the light of Divine Revelation hath been vouchsafed to men in direct proportion to their spiritual capacity . Consider the sun . How feeble its rays the moment it appeareth above the horizon . How gradually its warmth and potency increase as it approacheth its zenith , enabling meanwhile all created things to adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light . How steadily it declineth until it reacheth its setting point .

Dismayed and overpowered , they would cease to exist . 3 <p> The Universal House of Justice has demonstrated how this principle of progressive revelation has applied , and continues to apply , to the implementation of Baha'i law , particularly to the laws of the Kitab-i Aqdas . The Central Figures of the Faith have promulgated these laws only gradually as the condition of the Baha'i community would allow . 4 <p> Similarly , ' Abdu'l-Baha recognised that women could not take their rightful place in the affairs of the world all at once . Throughout history women have been deprived of education and opportunity . Therefore , it was impossible that they would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Abdu'l-Baha has insisted that all distinctions of sex will be erased once women attain proper education and experience . He says : <p> Woman 's lack of progress and proficiency has been due to her need for equal education and opportunity . Had she been allowed this equality , there is no doubt she would be the counterpart of man in ability and capacity . 5 <p> In a talk given in New York , ' Abdu'l-Baha again pinpoints education as the key to women 's equality : <p> ... if woman be fully educated and granted her rights , she will attain the capacity for wonderful accomplishments and prove herself the equal of man . She is the coadjutor of man ; his complement and helpmeet . Both are human , both are endowed with potentialities of intelligence and embody the virtues of humanity . In all human powers and functions they are partners and co-equals . At present in spheres of human activity woman does not manifest her natal prerogatives owing to lack of education and opportunity. 6 <p> In Paris He said : ... the female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed equal rights and privileges .

Why then should one sex assert the inferiority of the other ... If women received the same educational advantages as those of men , the result would demonstrate the equality of capacity of both for scholarship. 7 <p> On another occasion he made the same point : The only difference between them ie : men and women now is due to lack of education and training . If woman is given equal opportunity of education , distinction and estimate of inferiority will disappear. 8 <p> And again : Therefore , woman must receive the same education as man and all inequality be adjusted .

His own policies and actions concerning the service of women on the institutions of the Faith reflected this belief in gradualism . <h> The First Baha'i Institutions <p> Any investigation of the history of the development of the Baha'i Administrative Order will reveal that Baha'i women only gradually took their place beside the men in this area of service - and not without struggle . This has been especially true in the East , where women were most heavily restricted . But lack of education and other cultural circumstances have affected the participation of women on Baha'i institutions all over the world . <p> The first Hands of the Cause appointed by Baha'u'llah were , for example , all males . ' Abdu'l-Baha appointed no additional Hands , and it was only during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi that women were appointed to this rank . Even so , it has been only Western Baha'i women who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , when the first Auxiliary Boards to the Hands of the Cause were appointed , and then the first contingents of Boards of Counsellors , women were included . But circumstances dictated that it be mostly Western women who were appointed , and that their numbers were far fewer than those of men . As the above chart shows , that situation remains the same today . This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the institutions of the Faith , but simply due to historical circumstances . As the position of women improves - especially in Asia and Africa - with respect to education and experience , we can expect that the current situation will change in favour of more participation of women . <h> The House of Justice of Tehran <p> The struggle for the equal participation of women in Baha'i Administration has been played out most dramatically , however , in the arena of the development of local institutions . The first of these bodies was formed in Tehran , Iran , at the initiative of individual believers . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book , His book of laws . Here He established the institution of the House of Justice ( bayt al-'adl ) . The Kitab-i-Aqdas states : <p> The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice ( bayt al-'adl ) be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Baha i.e. , nine , and should it exceed this number it does not matter ... It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth . It is incumbent on them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God , for His sake , even as they regard their own interests , and to choose that which is meet and seemly. 10 <p> In the same book it is written : <p> O ye Men of Justice ! ( rijal al-'adl ) Be ye in the realm of God shepherds unto His sheep and guard them from the ravening wolves that have appeared in disguise , even as ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counsellor , the Faithful. 11 <p> There are other references in the Kitab-i-Aqdas to the House of Justice ( bayt al-'adl ) or the Place of Justice ( maqarr al-'adl ) which define its function and fix some of its revenues . In most cases , these references are not specific but refer to the general concept of a House of Justice rather than a particular institution . The Universal House of Justice has explained : <p> In the Kitab-i-Aqdas Baha'u'llah ordains both the Universal House of Justice and the Local Houses of Justice . In many of His laws He refers simply to " the House of Justice " leaving open for later decision which level or levels of the whole institution each law would apply to . 12 <p> Although the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed in ' Akka in 1873 , it was withheld for some time by Baha'u'llah before it was distributed to the Baha'is of Iran . 13 <p> It appears that it was not until 1878 that the Baha'is of Tehran received copies of the book and began to implement some of its laws in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asadu'llah Isfahani , a prominent Baha'i teacher living in Tehran , was particularly struck by the command of Baha'u'llah that a House of Justice should be established by the Baha'is in every city . <p> Mirza Asadu'llah is an important figure in Baha'i history : he eventually married the sister of ' Abdu'l-Baha 's wife ; he was ( as we shall see ) one of the earliest Baha'i teachers sent to America by ' Abdu'l-Baha to instruct the new Western believers and he later accompanied ' Abdu'l-Baha on his travels in Europe . In any case , in 1878 he was the first to undertake the organization of a local House of Justice in Iran . He took the initiative to invite eight other prominent believers to form a body , responding to the laws of the Kitab-i Aqdas , which they referred to as bayt al-'adl ( House of Justice ) or bayt al-a'zam ( the Most Great House ) . <p> The organization of this first House of Justice was kept a secret , even from the believers . However , it met sporadically in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting with this body , the prominent Baha'i men who had been invited to attend its meetings would seek to take action as individual Baha'i teachers that would implement its decisions . <p> Around 1881 , the Tehran House of Justice was reorganized and more members were added . The House adopted a written constitution and pursued its activities with more organization and vigour than before . The constitution mandated , however , that the meetings remain strictly confidential , hidden from the body of the believers . <p> This constitution also assumes that the members of the House would all be men ( aqayan ) . Naturally , considering the social conditions in Iran at the time , no other arrangement was possible . <p> Some of the minutes of this early House of Justice survive today . It was a gathering of the older and more prominent Baha'i men of Tehran . Meetings were attended by invitation only , and at times included fourteen members or more . Eventually , this meeting came to be called the Consultative Gathering ( majlis-i shur ) , while the house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice ( bayt al-'adl ) . <p> These meetings sought to assist and protect the Baha'is through consultation on various problems . The House in Tehran sent Baha'i teachers to other cities in Iran to organize Houses of Justice there . Again , the decisions of the House were always carried out by individuals , and the consultations remained secret . <p> The organization of this body eventually met with some controversy . One important Baha'i teacher , Jamal-i Burujurdi , who later - in the time of ' Abdu'l-Baha - would become a notorious Covenant-breaker , objected strongly to the organization of a House of Justice in Tehran . Because of these objections , the Baha'is involved on the House appealed to Baha'u'llah for guidance . Baha'u'llah replied with a Tablet in which He approved of the House of Justice and strongly upheld the principle of consultation in the Baha'i Faith . 14 <h> Early Organisation in America <p> When the first rudimentary local Baha'i institutions were organized in the United States , their membership was also confined to men . Later , as various forms of Baha'i organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women served together . But it was the understanding of the Baha'is at the turn of the century that consultative bodies in the Baha'i community should be composed of men . This understanding became firmly institutionalized in the largest Baha'i communities of New York , Chicago , and Kenosha , Wisconsin , and was sanctioned by ' Abdu'l-Baha . <p> A scholarly history of the beginnings of Baha'i organization in America has yet to be written . Many of the details of these events have yet to be uncovered . However , it appears that the early American Baha'is were moved to form local councils for the first time in 1900 , as a consequence of the defection of Ibrahim Kheiralla from the community . Kheiralla , a Lebanese Christian who had been converted to the Baha'i Faith in Egypt by a Persian Baha'i , ' Abdu'l-Karim Tihrani , had brought the Baha'i teachings to America and had acted as the head of the Faith in the West until that point . His repudiation of ' Abdu'l-Baha as the rightful leader of the Faith and chosen successor to his Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of 1899 , Edward Getsinger , a leading American Baha'i , appointed five men as a " Board of Counsel " for the Baha'is of northern New Jersey . 15 Isabella Brittingham was made the honorary corresponding secretary , but was not a member of the body . Later , in a letter dated March 21 , 1900 , Thornton Chase wrote from Chicago : <p> " We have formed a ' Board of Council ' with 10 members . " <p> In this letter , Chase lists the names of nine of these members , all of whom were men . 16 <p> In June of 1900 , however , it appears that the Chicago Board was reorganized . ' Abdu'l-Karim Tihrani had travelled to America at the request of ' Abdu'l-Baha and had arrived in Chicago at the end of May . The Baha'is of Chicago immediately asked him to draw up rules and regulations that would govern the affairs of their Board . 17 As a result , the Board of Counsel was expanded to nineteen members , some of whom were women . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board was being organized to replace Ibrahim Kheiralla , whom they repudiated as the leader of the Faith . 18 <p> Although ' Abdu'l-Karim remained in Chicago for only a short time , his nineteen-member Board appears to have functioned for about a year . However , on May 15 , 1901 , a nine-member , all-male House of Justice was elected in Chicago to replace it . This was done at the direction of Mirza Asadu'llah Isfahani , who had been sent to America by ' Abdu'l-Baha . Writing to the House of Justice in New York that had already been established , the Chicago House wrote : <p> Recently His Honor , Mirza Assad'Ullah , received a Tablet from the Master , Abdul-Baha , in which He has positively declared to be necessary the establishment here of the House of Justice by election by the believers with order and just dealing . According to this blessed Announcement , our believers have elected those whom they deemed best fitted , and thus The House of Justice was established. 19 <p> It was Mirza Asadu'llah who instructed the Baha'is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of men . He and his company appear to have regarded the nineteen-member Board as illegitimate , possibly because women served as members . <p> The change to an all-male institution was not accomplished without anguish . Writing years later , Fannie Lesch , who had served on the Board of Counsel , wrote : <p> We had a Council Board of men and women after Dr. Kheiralla left us ... Mirza Assad'Ullah ignored us , although they were all invited to meet with us , and he established a House of Justice of men only ... 20 <p> Only days after the election of the Chicago House of Justice , a Ladies ' Auxilliary Board was organized at the suggestion of Mrs. Ella Nash and Mrs. Corinne True . This Board was later to be known as the Women 's Assembly of Teaching . It appears that the Ladies ' Auxilliary was able to maintain control of the funds of the Chicago Baha'i community despite the election of the House of Justice. 21 <h> Men of Justice <p> The belief that women were not eligible for service on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages of the Kitab-i Aqdas which refer to the House of Justice . Of course , as we have noted above , these passages do not make a distinction between local , national , and international bodies . The institution as a whole is addressed . Baha'u'llah twice uses the Arabic word rijal ( gentlemen ) to refer to the members of the Houses of Justice . He says : <p> And : We have designated a third of all fines for the Place of Justice ( maqarr al-'adl ) , and exhort its members ( rijal ) to show forth perfect equity ... 23 <p> The word rijal ( plural ; singular is rajul ) is exclusively masculine in Arabic . A dictionary would render an English definition of rajul as : man , gentleman ; important man , statesman , nobleman . ( A related form of the word , rujula or rujuliyya , would be translated as : masculinity ; virility . ) Since Baha'u'llah addressed the members of the Houses of Justice using this term , it appears that it was universally assumed that only men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word rijal , meaning men , is used in the Qur'an and is part of an important passage which establishes the relationship between men and women in Islam ( Qur'an 4:34 ) : <p> Men ( rijal ) are superior to women ( nisa ' ) on account of the qualities with which God hath gifted the one above the other , and on account of the outlay they make from their substance for them . <p> However , Baha'u'llah has in His Writings clearly established the principle of the equality of men and women . It is therefore possible that when He used the word rijal He did not intend its normal meaning . <p> Although rijal is the normal Arabic word for men ( as opposed to women ) , there are passages in the Writings of Baha'u'llah that indicate that He may have used the term in a special sense . Such passages suggest that , in a Baha'i context , the word may be understood to include women . Baha'u'llah has stated that women in His Cause are all to be accorded the same station as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make this point . For example , He writes : <p> Today the Baha'i women ( lit. , the leaves of the Holy Tree ) must guide the handmaidens of the earth to the Lofty Horizon with the utmost purity and sanctity . Today the handmaidens of God are regarded as gentlemen ( rijal ) . Blessed are they ! Blessed are they ! 24 <p> And in another passage : Today whoever among the handmaidens attains the knowledge of the Desire of the World i.e. , Baha'u'llah is considered a gentleman ( rajul ) in the Divine Book . 25 <p> And in another place : ... many a man ( rajul ) hath waited expectant for God 's Revelation , and yet when the Light shone forth from the horizon of the world , all but a few turned their faces away from it . Whosoever from amongst the handmaidens hath recognized the Lord of all Names is recorded in the Book as one of those men ( rijal ) by the Pen of the Most High . 26 <p> Likewise , ' Abdu'l-Baha in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Baha'u'llah , women are judged as gentlemen ( rijal ) . 27 <p> However , such passages were not raised as an issue at the time , either because the believers were not aware of them , or because they did not find them applicable . Certainly , the American Baha'is had no access to these texts and had to rely on the understandings of the Persian teachers who were sent by ' Abdu'l-Baha to guide them . <h> Names and Terminology <p> In any case , it was the goal of Mirza Asadu'llah to establish a House of Justice among the believers in Chicago , as he indicated to the Baha'is that ' Abdu'l-Baha had instructed him to do . He had been at the centre of the organization of the first House of Justice in Tehran , and he assumed a similar role in Chicago . At his direction , the Baha'is in Chicago elected nine men by ballot to a new institution . Those elected were : George Lesch , Charles H. Greenleaf , John A. Guilford , Dr. Rufus H. Bartlett , Thornton Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane and Henry L. Goodall. 28 <p> At its first meeting , the House of Justice decided to raise the number of its members to twelve . The body appointed three additional Baha'i men to serve . The minutes of the meeting read : <p> Motion made and seconded that Messrs . Ioas , Pursels and Doney be selected as add'n additional members of this Board of Council . Said motion approved by Board . Secretary instructed to notify said members . 29 <p> This action was taken , no doubt , in accordance with the statement of Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i Aqdas that the minimum number of members for a House of Justice is nine , " and should it exceed this number it does not matter . " 30 <p> It is instructive to note that , in its first minutes , the secretary of the House of Justice refers to it as a " Board of Council . " This illustrates the fluidity of terminology that was used for Baha'i meetings and institutions at the time . <p> Standard terms for the Baha'i institutions did not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdu'l-Baha . Today , the elected local and national Baha'i institutions are known as " Spiritual Assemblies , " while the term " House of Justice " is reserved exclusively for the supreme , international institution . In the early years of this century , however , though these same terms were in use among the Baha'is , they were not used in the same ways . ' Abdu'l-Baha himself confirmed the legitimacy of the election of the first Chicago House of Justice . A Tablet , probably received in September 1901 , is addressed from ' Abdu'l-Baha " To the members of the House of Justice , the servants of the Covenant , the faithful worshippers of the Holy Threshold of the Beauty of El-Abha . " <p> Two such Tablets addressed to the House of Justice of Chicago are translated in the compilation Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas . 31Shoghi Effendi , writing much later in 1929 , has discussed the significance of these Tablets . He says : That the Spiritual Assemblies of today will be replaced in time by Houses of Justice , and are to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly confirmed by ' Abdu'l-Baha Himself . He has in fact in a Tablet addressed to the members of the first Chicago Spiritual Assembly , the first elected Baha'i body instituted in the United States , referred to them as members of the " House of Justice " for that city , and has thus with His own pen established beyond any doubt the identity of the present Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies with the House of Justice referred to by Baha'u'llah . For reasons which are not difficult to discover , it has been found advisable to bestow upon the elected representatives of Baha'i communities throughout the world the temporary appellation of Spiritual Assemblies , a term which , as the position and aims of the Baha'i Faith are better understood and more fully recognised , will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more appropriate designation of House of Justice. 32 <p> This " temporary appellation " was assumed at the instruction of ' Abdu'l-Baha about a year after the election of the Chicago House of Justice . The minutes of the House of Justice for May 10 , 1902 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mirza Assad Ullah to inform this Body that here after and until otherwise informed it shall be known as the " House of Spirituality , " in accordance with a Tablet recently received from our Master . Motion made and seconded that the command of Master changing name of this Body as transmitted by Mirza Assad Ullah be entered upon our records . Approved by House . Motion made and seconded that a copy ( translation ) of that portion of tablet setting forth the change as above mentioned be procured and placed on file . Approved by House. 33 <p> Extracts from this Tablet were indeed translated for the House of Justice , now the House of Spirituality . The heading to the translation indicates that the Tablet was received in Chicago by Mirza Assadu'llah on May 3 , 1902 . One extract reads : <p> The House of Justice of Chicago should be called " the House of Spirituality " ( or the Spiritual House ) . In short , no one must hurt the weak ones , there , but must treat them in kindness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all people. 34 <p> In what is apparently a second Tablet on the subject , ' Abdu'l-Baha explained the reasons for the change . This Tablet was , some time later , translated and published : <p> The signature of that meeting should be the Spiritual Gathering ( House of Spirituality ) and the wisdom therein is that hereafter the government should not infer from the term " House of Justice " that a court is signified , that it is connected with political affairs , or that at any time it will interfere with governmental affairs . Hereafter , enemies will be many . They would use this subject as a cause for disturbing the mind of the government and confusing the thoughts of the public . The intention was to make known that by the term Spiritual Gathering ( House of Spirituality ) , that Gathering has not the least connection with material matters , and that its whole aim and consultation is confined to matters connected with spiritual affairs . This was also instructed ( performed ) in all Persia. 35 <p> At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Abdu'l-Baha had instructed that the name of the Women 's Assembly of Teaching be changed to the " Spiritual Assembly . " He instructed that " Spiritual Assemblies " should be organized in every place . However , although the change of name for the House of Justice was effected immediately , the instruction to change the name of the women 's institution was ignored . This is probably because the translation of this command into English was so poor as to render it incomprehensible . 36And so we read the following in the minutes of the House of Spirituality three years later ( July 29 , 1905 ) : <p> Mr. Windust read portions of the Tablet received from the Master in May , 1902 authorizing change of name of this body from " House of Justice " to " House of Spirituality " ; as it also stated in said Tablet that the name of the Women 's " Assembly of Teaching " be changed to " Spiritual Assembly . " It was decided that this matter be spoken of at some future joint meeting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 37 <p> As we have seen in the Tablets quoted above , in the first year after the election of the Chicago House of Justice , ' Abdu'l-Baha Himself used various terms to refer to that body . ( Of course , we have quoted His Tablets in translation - the translations available to the Baha'is at the time . ) These Tablets reflect the use of at least three different designations during this period : House of Justice ( bayt al-'adl ) in the earliest Tablets , House of Spirituality ( probably , bayt-i rawhani ) in one Tablet , and Spiritual Gathering ( mahfil-i rawhani ) in another . <p> This last term , mahfil-i rawhani , can also be translated as " Spiritual Assembly . " However , it was usually translated as " House of Spirituality " in the publications and translations made at this time , even though this translation was in error . The Chicago body came to be known as the House of Spirituality from 1902 , and so the translators rendered ' Abdu'l-Baha 's references to it in these words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designation . This was because the term " Spiritual Assembly " had no fixed meaning in the early community and could refer to a number of different Baha'i meetings . ' Abdu'l-Baha had asked , for example , that the term be used for the Ladies ' Auxiliary . It was also used by the Baha'is of this time to refer to any Baha'i community as a whole , some weekly teaching meetings , any consultative body , or any gathering of believers . <p> Terms used to designate the local administrative body were also fluid in ' Abdu'l-Baha 's writings . In addition to the three designations above , the following additional names can be found : mahfil-i shur ( Assembly of Consultation ) , mahfil-i shur rawhani ( Spiritual Assembly of Consultation ) , bayt al-'adl rawhani ( Spiritual House of Justice ) , anjuman ( Council ) , anjuman-i adl ( Council of Justice ) , and marakiz-i ' adl ( Centres of Justice ) . 38 <h> The Women 's Struggle <p> The election of an all-male House of Justice in Chicago was a development to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never reconciled . It is Corinne True in particular who stands out in the struggle to overturn the exclusion of women from that body . After the election , she immediately helped to organize the Women 's Assembly of Teaching which worked side by side with the House - and not always harmoniously - for over a decade . Beyond this , she appealed directly to ' Abdu'l-Baha , asking that women be elected to the House of Justice . <p> Mrs. True 's letter , which has recently come to light , indicates clearly that the change to an all-male body was the cause of some dispute . She writes to ' Abdu'l-Baha : <p> There has existed a difference of opinion in our Assembly that is , the Chicago community as to how it should be governed . Every believer desires to carry out the Commands of the Blessed Perfection Baha'u'llah but we want to know from our Lord himself that is , ' Abdu'l-Baha what these Commands are , as they are written in Arabic and we do not know Arabic . Will Our Lord write me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interpretor sic in America and thus grant me the Authority to say the Master says thus &amp; so , for he has written it to me ... Many in our Assembly feel that the Governing Board in Chicago should be a mixed Board of both men &amp; women . Woman in America stands so conspicuously for all that is highest &amp; best in every department and for that reason it is contended the affairs should be in the hands of both sexes . 39 <p> She was , however , disappointed when the Master would not support her point of view . He confirmed the practice of electing only males to the Baha'i governing board of Chicago , admonishing her to be patient . She appears to have received her reply from ' Abdu'l-Baha in June of 1902 , but refrained from sharing this Tablet with the Chicago House until the fall of that year . <p> The Tablet is a famous one and reads in part ( in modern translation ) : <p> Know thou , O handmaid , that in the sight of Baha , women are accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humankind in His own image , and after His own likeness . That is , men and women alike are the revealers of His names and attributes , and from the spiritual viewpoint there is no difference between them . Whosoever draweth nearer to God , that one is the most favoured , whether man or woman . How many a handmaid , ardent and devoted , hath , within the sheltering shade of Baha , proved superior to the men , and surpassed the famous of the earth . The House of Justice , however , according to the explicit text of the Law of God , is confined to men ; this for a wisdom of the Lord God 's , which will ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at high noon . As to you , O ye other handmaids who are enamoured of the heavenly fragrances , arrange ye holy gatherings , and found ye Spiritual Assemblies , for these are the basis for spreading the sweet savours of God , exalting His Word , uplifting the lamp of His grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounty is there greater than this ? 40 <p> Since ' Abdu'l-Baha had confirmed that women should be excluded from the Chicago House of Justice ( later , House of Spirituality ) , this practice continued for some time , in Chicago and elsewhere . We might assume that the belief that women were to be permanently excluded from local Baha'i executive bodies was widespread , at least amongst the men . Women were to be involved in forming women 's groups , which ' Abdu'l-Baha had named " Spiritual Assemblies " in one Tablet . <p> That did not end the issue , of course . It appears that American Baha'i women continued to discuss the possibility of membership on governing boards , with Corinne True being prominent among them . In 1909 , Mrs. True received a Tablet from ' Abdu'l-Baha in response to her insistent questioning . It reads , in part : <p> According to the ordinances of the Faith of God , women are the equals of men in all rights save only that of membership on the Universal House of Justice bayt al-'adl ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text of the Book , both the head and the members of the House of Justice are men . However , in all other bodies , such as the Temple Construction Committee , the Teaching Committee , the Spiritual Assembly , and in charitable and scientific associations , women share equally in all rights with men . 41 <p> This new Tablet from ' Abdu'l-Baha to Corinne True appears to have opened up a nationwide controversy over the rights of women to serve on Baha'i institutions . The use of the term " Universal House of Justice " in this Tablet caused some confusion . Corinne True and others assumed that ' Abdu'l-Baha intended by this Tablet that women were now to be admitted to membership on local Baha'i bodies , and more particularly to membership on the Chicago House of Spirituality . <p> Thornton Chase related the controversy which erupted in Chicago in a letter written a few months later ( January 19 , 1910 ) : <p> Several years ago , soon after the forming of the " House of Justice " ( name afterward changed by Abdul-Baha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stated by Him - and because also of certain jealousies ) Mrs. True wrote to Abdul-Baha and asked if women should not be members of that House . He replied distinctly , that the House should be composed of men only , and told her that there was a wisdom in this . It was a difficult command for her to accept , and ever since ( confidentially ) there has been in that quarter and in those influenced by her a feeling of antagonism to the House of Spirituality , which has manifested itself in various forms ... ... Mrs True received a Tablet , in which it was stated ( in reply to her solicitation ) that it was right for women to be members of all " Spiritual Gatherings " except the " Universal House of Justice " , and she at once construed this to mean , that women were to be members of the House of Spirituality and the Council Boards , because in some of the Tablets for the House , it had been addressed as the " Spiritual Assembly " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so interpret the Master 's meaning ... 42 <p> The difference of opinion was deep and serious . It took place within a wider context of gender tensions within the American Baha'i community at the time . The Chicago House of Spirituality consulted on the new Tablet to Corinne True at its meetings on August 31 , 1909 , and September 7 , 1909 . While it seemed clear to them that the Tablet did not admit women to membership on the House of Spirituality , they decided to write to ' Abdu'l-Baha for a clarification of His meaning . 43 <p> It appears that no record of a reply to the House on this point has survived . But , in the event , the practice of excluding women from membership did not change . The men of Chicago assumed that ' Abdu'l-Baha 's reference to the " Universal House of Justice " intended the local Chicago institution . This is a reasonable assumption , given the lack of fixed terminology at the time . The word ' umumi , with which ' Abdu'l-Baha qualified His reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , or universal . Since it was known that Corinne True had asked about women 's service on the Chicago House - which was understood to be a House of Justice , even if designated a House of Spirituality for various reasons - His reply seemed to indicate that only men could serve on the general ( or universal ) body , while women could serve on all subordinate bodies , such as the Assembly of Teaching , the Philanthropic Association , and so forth . And this is the interpretation of the Tablet that would stand for some years to come . In May of 1910 , Thornton Chase wrote to a believer about this question , which was still being debated : <p> As to women being members of the House , there is no question at all . ' Abdul-Baha 's reply to Mrs True years ago , settled that , viz , that the members of the House should be men , and that the time would come when she would see the wisdom of that . This was in direct answer to her question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed that command , and He can not , because it is the command of Baha'o'llah also , as applied to such bodies of business controllers . But , in a Tablet to me , ' Abdu'l-Baha said " The House of Spirituality must encourage the women as much as possible " . There is the whole procedure . " Encourage the women as much as possible " . That is what He does : that is what we should do . Not to be members of the H. of S. , but to all good works in the Cause , which they can possibly accomplish . It seems to me that the matter of membership in H. of S. should be simply ignored , not talked about , but if it obtrudes itself too strongly , just get out that Tablet to Mrs. True and the one to me ( just mentioned ) and offer them as the full and sufficient answer. 44 <p> Chase 's views are undoubtedly representative of the understandings of the majority of Baha'is at the time . It was the common understanding that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that ultimately all local Baha'i boards should be similarly composed . This was a position which was repeatedly sustained by ' Abdu'l-Baha , but which was never fully accepted by some Baha'i women . In Kenosha , which had had an all-male " Board of Consultation " for some years , the issue of women 's service on the Board became a matter of dispute in 1910 , as a result of Corinne True 's 1909 " Universal House of Justice " Tablet . On July 4 , 1910 , the Kenosha Board wrote to the House of Spirituality in Chicago asking if they had any Tablets from ' Abdu'l-Baha which instructed that women should be elected to local institutions . They explained that two of the Baha'i ladies in their community had insisted that such Tablets existed . 45The reply from the House of Spirituality , dated July 23 , 1910 , is very instructive . 46 The House was able to find three Tablets from ' Abdu'l-Baha which had bearing on the subject . One was the 1909 Tablet to Corinne True which had opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1910 , in reply to more inquiries . In a Tablet to Louise Waite ( April 20 , 1910 ) , ' Abdu'l-Baha had instructed : <p> The Spiritual Assemblies which are organized for the sake of teaching the Truth , whether assemblies for men , assemblies for women or mixed assemblies , are all accepted and are conducive to the spreading of the Fragrances of God . This is essential. 47'Abdu'l-Baha goes on to state that the time had not come for the establishment of the House of Justice , and he exhorts the men and the women to produce harmony and conduct their affairs in unity . 48 <p> In another Tablet directed to the Baha'is of Cincinnati , where the question of women 's participation in local organization had also become an issue , ' Abdu'l-Baha wrote something similar : <p> It is impossible to organize the House of Justice in these days ; it will be formed after the establishment of the Cause of God . Now the Spiritual Assemblies are organized in most of the cities , you must also organize a Spiritual Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spiritual Assembly from among the men and women ; nay , rather , it is better , so that perfect union may result . 49The House of Spirituality concluded from these Tablets that : ... in organizing Spiritual Assemblies of Consultation now , it is deemed advisable by Abdul-Baha to have them composed of both men and women . The wisdom of this will become evident in due time , no doubt. 50 <p> By this time , Baha'is in different parts of the United States had established a variety of boards and committees as a means of local organization . Women had served on the Washington , D.C. , " Working Committee " since its formation in 1907 . They had been a part of the Boston " Executive Committee " from its beginning in 1908 . Women also acted as officers of communities in places where Baha'is had elected no corporate body . But these were regarded , for the most part , as temporary , ad-hoc organizations not official Baha'i institutions , which were thought to be properly all male . <p> ' Abdu'l-Baha 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assemblies " ( or Spiritual Gatherings , mahfil-i rawhani ) and by 1910 , He was urging that these Assemblies consist of both men and women . The House of Spirituality in Chicago was obviously puzzled by this command , though it expressed confidence that the wisdom of mixed Assemblies would " become evident in due time . " However , since it knew that the Kenosha Board of Consultation had been established as an all-male body in accordance with earlier instructions from ' Abdu'l-Baha , the House of Spirituality suggested that the Kenosha Baha'is might wish to take a vote to determine whether a majority of believers would be in favour of a change . 51 <p> Rather than do this , however , the Kenosha Board of Consultation submitted the question to ' Abdu'l-Baha . The " supplication " ( as they termed it ) was signed by all of the men of the Board . It asked if the Board should be dissolved , to be reelected with women as members . The Board members pledged to the Master that if it was His wish they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure at the founding of the Board and that it had been established in accordance with a Tablet that had been revealed for the House of Spirituality some years before . 52 <p> ' Abdu'l-Baha , however , would not support the idea of dissolving the all-male Board . His reply , received March 4 , 1911 , explains : <p> Now Spiritual Assemblies must be organized and that is for teaching the Cause of God . In that city you have a spiritual Assembly of men and you can establish a spiritual Assembly for women . Both Assemblies must be engaged in diffusing the fragrances of God and be occupied with the service of the Kingdom . The above is the best solution for this problem ... 53 <p> As in other Tablets , He stated that conditions for the establishment of the House of Justice did not yet exist , and He urged unity between the men and women of the Baha'i community . And so , through 1911 , the status quo that had been established by Mirza Assadu'llah in Chicago in 1901 , with the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All-male institutions continued to function in the most important Baha'i communities . These were supplemented by parallel women 's groups . A variety of committees and boards had been established in smaller Baha'i communities that included women as members , but these were regarded by most Baha'is as only informal groups . While ' Abdu'l-Baha was urging that new " Spiritual Assemblies " include both men and women , He would not sanction the reorganization of the longer-established male bodies . Baha'i women in various parts of the country continued to discuss the need for change . <h> The Change Comes <p> It was not until 1912 , during the visit of ' Abdu'l-Baha to America , that a decisive change was finally made . While ' Abdu'l-Baha was in New York , He sent word to the Baha'is of Chicago that the House of Spirituality should be reorganized and a new election held . He chose Howard MacNutt , a prominent Baha'i from Brooklyn , to travel to Chicago as His personal representative . MacNutt was instructed to hold a new election for a " Spiritual Meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . For the first time , women were eligible for election to this body . <p> MacNutt arrived in Chicago on August 8 , 1912 . At ' Abdu'l-Baha 's instructions , a feast was held on August 10 , at the home of Mr. and Mrs. George Lesch , where the entire Chicago Baha'i community was invited to be the guests of ' Abdu'l-Baha . MacNutt delivered to the community ' Abdu'l-Baha 's message of unity and love . The election was held the following day on August 11 . The Baha'i magazine , Star of the West , carried this account of that historic election : <p> On Sunday evening , the 11th , the Chicago Assembly meaning here , the whole Baha'i community selected a " Spiritual Meeting " of nine , composed of men and women , whose service - according to the wish of Abdul-Baha - is , first , to promulgate the teachings of the Revelation , and , second , to attend to other matters necessary to the welfare of the assembly . Mr. MacNutt was present and gave an inspiring address. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institutions in the East <p> From the time of the dissolution of the Chicago House of Spirituality and its reelection , service on local Baha'i institutions has always remained open to women in America . ' Abdu'l-Baha had made it perfectly clear that the restrictions placed on women in this regard were intended to be only temporary ones . From that point forward , women were fully integrated into the emerging Baha'i Administration erected in the West . <p> The same was not true in the East , however . In Iran and in the rest of the Muslim world , social conditions made it impossible for the restriction on women 's participation on local institutions to be lifted for some time . Local and National Spiritual Assemblies in Iran were limited to male membership during the entire period of the ministry of ' Abdu'l-Baha , and for most of the ministry of Shoghi Effendi . Again , the principle of gradualism was at play . <p> Of course , there were Baha'i women in Iran , as well in the United States , who campaigned for a greater role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only with participation on local Houses of Justice , but also with the elimination of other social restrictions , such as the use of the veil in public . In a Tablet to one such woman activist , ' Abdu'l-Baha urged restraint and recommended a gradual approach : <p> The establishment of a women 's assemblage ( mahfil ) for the promotion of knowledge is entirely acceptable , but discussions must be confined to educational matters . It should be done in such a way that differences will , day by day , be entirely wiped out , not that , God forbid , it will end in argumentation between man and women . As in the question of the veil , nothing should be done contrary to wisdom .... Now the world of women should be a spiritual world , not a political one , so that it will be radiant . The women of other nations are all immersed in political matters . Of what benefit is this , and what fruit doth it yield ? To the extent that ye can , ye should busy yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Word of God and of the diffusion of His fragrances . Your demeanour should lead to harmony amongst all and to coalescence and the good-pleasure of all ... I am endeavouring , with Baha'u'llah 's confirmations and assistance , so to improve the world of the handmaidens that is , the world of women that all will be astonished . This progress is intended to be in spirituality , in virtues , in human perfections and in divine knowledge . In America , the cradle of women 's liberation , women are still debarred from political institutions because they squabble . ( Also , the Blessed Beauty has said , " O ye Men rijal of the House of Justice . " ) Ye need to be calm and composed , so that the work will proceed with wisdom , otherwise there will be such chaos that ye will leave everything and run away . " This newly born babe is traversing in one night the path that needeth a hundred years to tread . " In brief , ye should now engage in matters of pure spirituality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take appropriate steps . Be assured . In the end thou wilt thyself exclaim , " This was indeed supreme wisdom ! " 55 <p> Baha'i women were not admitted to service on the institutions of the Faith in Iran until 1954 . But this restriction was understood to be temporary , to be removed as soon as circumstances would permit . As Iranian society allowed a greater role for women in general , and as Baha'i women became more educated and more prepared for administrative service , this restriction was lifted . The Guardian eventually made women 's participation on Baha'i institutions in the East one of the goals of the Ten Year World Crusade ( 1953-1963 ) . His hopes were rewarded by the signal distinction which some Baha'i women have achieved as administrators on local Assemblies and on the National Assembly of Iran . <h> The International House of Justice <p> The only remaining body within the Baha'i Faith whose membership continues to be limited to men is its supreme institution , the Universal House of Justice . First established in 1963 , the Universal House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assemblies of the world . Naturally , the electors include many women . But the members of the House of Justice itself , from its inception , have all been male . <p> Shoghi Effendi anticipated that the Universal House of Justice would be established as an all-male body , even though he passed away before he could see this implemented . He did not comment generally on the subject , and he does not seem to have devoted a great deal of time to the issue . But in answer to questions from individual Baha'is , some letters were written on the Guardian 's behalf by his secretaries which comment on the composition of the yet-to-be-formed House of Justice . For example , his secretary writes : <p> As regards your question concerning the membership of the Universal House of Justice , there is a Tablet from ' Abdu'l-Baha in which He definitely states that the membership of the Universal House of Justice is confined to men , and that the wisdom of it will be fully revealed and appreciated in the future . In the local , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the full right of membership . It is , however , only to the International House that they can not be elected. 56 <p> And in another letter : As regards the membership of the International House of Justice , ' Abdu'l-Baha states in a Tablet that it is confined to men , and that the wisdom of it will be revealed as manifest as the sun in the future. 57 <p> Again : Regarding your question , the Master said the wisdom of having no women on the International House of Justice , would become manifest in the future . We have no indication other than this ... 58 <p> Again : People must just accept the fact that women are not eligible to the International House of Justice . As the Master says the wisdom of this will be known in the future , we can only accept , believing it is right ... 59 <p> The remarkable similarity of these letters to individual believers should be noted . In each case , the Guardian directed his secretary to refer to the Tablet of ' Abdu'l-Baha to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women be elected to the Chicago House of Justice . This Tablet explains that the reason for the exclusion of women will become manifest in the future . <p> Subsequent events demonstrated that ' Abdu'l-Baha had intended that this exclusion be only temporary - an exclusion that would be followed by the full participation of women on this body . <p> The exclusion of women from the Universal House of Justice today is observed by the Baha'i community primarily in obedience to these letters of the Guardian . Most Baha'is assume that this exclusion was intended to be a permanent one . However , since this instruction of the Guardian is tied so closely to the meaning of the one Tablet of ' Abdu'l-Baha which promises that the wisdom of the exclusion of women will become manifest in the future , and since it is known that the meaning of the Tablet was that women should be excluded only temporarily from the Chicago House , the assumption that women will be permanently excluded from the current Universal House of Justice may be a faulty one . A temporary exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as with all other questions in the Baha'i community , will have to be worked out over time . The elements of dialogue , struggle , persistence and anguish which are so evident in the history of the gradual participation of women on local Baha'i administrative bodies will , no doubt , all attend the working out of that answer in the future . These elements are all present today . <h> A Tablet of Assurance <p> ' Abdu'l-Baha repeatedly assured Baha'i women in His writings that the women of the future would achieve full and complete equality with men . In one of these Tablets He refers to the composition of the House of Justice . The Tablet is dated August 28 , 1913 , and it appears to have been written to a Baha'i woman in the East . In it , ' Abdu'l-Baha repeats His promise : <p> In this Revelation of Baha'u'llah , the women go neck and neck with the men . In no movement will they be left behind . Their rights with men are equal in degree . They will enter all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such a degree as will be considered the very highest station of the world of humanity and will take part in all affairs . <p> Rest ye assured . Do ye not look upon the present conditions ; in the not far distant future the world of women will become all-refulgent and all-glorious , For his Holiness Baha'u'llah hath willed it so ! At the time of the elections the right to vote is the inalienable right of women , and the entrance of women into all human departments is an irrefutable and incontravertible question . No soul can retard or prevent it ... <p> As regards the constitution of the House of Justice , Baha'u'llah addresses the men . He says : " O ye men of the House of Justice ! " But when its members are to be elected , the right which belongs to women , so far as their voting and their voice is concerned , is indisputable . When the women attain to the ultimate degree of progress , then , according to the exigency of the time and place and their great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident on these accounts . His Holiness Baha'u'llah has greatly strengthened the cause of women , and the rights and privileges of women is one of the greatest principles of ' Abdu'l-Baha .

@@40786841 @786841/ <p> By 1880 one-third to one-half of all farmers in the upper Midwest were foreign-born . The Minds of the West is the story of the making of ethnic cultures by European immigrants in the Upper Midwest ( most prominently , Minnesota , Wisconsin , and Iowa , but also the Dakotas , Kansas , and Illinois ) from settlement to eve of World War I. The vast expanses of Midwestern lands paradoxically allowed immigrants to geographically seclude themselves in ethnic enclaves where they transplanted cultural patterns brought from Europe to the American milieu . Gjerde labels these cultural signatures the " minds " of the West ; by this he means not cultural baggage , but the culture as transformed in its American setting . <p> The core of the book is a history of the mingling of American and European minds as revealed through the discourse of each group and their critiques of each other . A blend of social , political , and cultural history , Gjerde not only synthesizes the secondary literature on the Midwest , but also draws upon a wide range of primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , and standard social history sources such letters , diaries , and vital records . In the book 's four parts , he argues that the " foreign minds " profoundly informed the development of American society in four contexts : region , community , family , and society . <p> The linchpin of his argument , set out in Part One , is that foreign immigrants possessed what he calls a " complementary identity that pledged allegiance to both American citizenship and ethnic adherence " ( p. 8 ) . In America , European immigrants could become republican citizens precisely because they were not required to discard their cultural heritage . However , this multilayered identity was fraught with tension because American liberal individualism imperiled European corporatism which prized the family and community at the expense of individual equality . For their part , Americans feared that the freedom to establish segmented communities meant that Europeans would fail to assimilate into American society , and indeed , would threaten the republic by clinging to their authoritarian traditions . The prospect of these alternative possibilities , which were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the argument is suspended . <p> Part Two establishes the importance of community formation to ethnocultural evolution . Gjerde explains how chain migration patterns for both Americans and Europeans created " a human matrix throughout the Middle West that linked people with common pasts and ultimately offered them social and economic benefits " ( p. 100 ) . For both groups , subsequent migrations led to social conflicts within communities , commonly played out in church-centered confrontations . In one of the book 's many ironies , the complementary identity which allowed the retention of religious culture also let people choose their church , and thus supplied immigrants with the democratic tool of majority rule which they wielded against clerical authority . <p> Part Three takes us within the community to the farm family , where a " family morality " justified the subordination of individuals in the household for the collective good . Building on the work of Sonya Salamon , Gjerde compares customs of household power , patriarchal ( lineal ) for the Europeans and conjugal ( lateral ) , for the " Yankees , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles and the life-chances of farm children. 1 While readers who know the literature on farm families will find much that is familiar here , Gjerde carries out innovative research which explains how market capitalism posed a threat to the family morality , and why Europeans found it so important to maintain the primacy of the family over individual needs . Gjerde squarely addresses the literature on gender inequality , including a detailed consideration of the custom of immigrant women working in the fields . <p> Part Four is a bracing discussion of the cultural debates between the two groups which culminated at century 's end in political battles over public schools , temperance , and women 's suffrage . In a complicated analysis which can not be done justice in a brief review , Gjerde argues that disagreements on these issues were rooted in fundamental ideological differences regarding the relative roles of family , community , and state in American society . The immigrants responded to a resurgent nativism by forming ethnic groups which gave them a collective voice in politics and enabled them to form coalitions with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their goals and muted their rhetoric , and by the end of World War I , they had largely succumbed to the dominant American paradigm of liberal individualism . <p> While rural social history has borne the fruit of many fine local studies of immigrant culture , no one has yet attempted to weave together the threads of both immigrant and native-born rural peoples on so large a scale . That Gjerde , the author of an earlier case study of Norwegian immigrants to the upper Midwest , is able to tell the story whole is a summary achievement. 2 To trace the process of ethnocultural evolution , he quotes extensively from the writings of the literati of the day in both the English-speaking and foreign-language press , interpreting each with agility and keen insight . However , the loudest is the immigrant voice . <p> This tendency to use native-born Americans as a foil accentuates homogeneity , and thus emphasizes the gulf between them and the foreign-born . Gjerde , who skillfully separates the strands of national origin , religion , and political loyalty for immigrants , rarely distinguishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the preponderance of New Englanders in the Upper Midwest , he uses the term Yankee to represent all native-born Americans , regardless of region of origin. 3 This moniker elides the substantial cultural gaps between native-born Midwestern settlers that may not have been apparent to the immigrant observer . This anachronistic inclination to characterize native-born Americans as Yankees signals a lacunae in the rural scholarship that suggests a research agenda for the future . I am also troubled by his heavy dependence upon the diary of Emily Hawley Gillespie in the comparative analysis of native-born and immigrant farm families . While her diary is unusually valuable for its exposition of her feelings , the profound alienation and mental illness in her family are hardly typical of native-born midwestern farm families . <p> This criticism aside , The Minds of the West is valuable on three levels : it brings a coherence to the study of rural America by crafting new theoretical models , it supplies evidence based on original research , and it freshens and synthesizes existing literature on the Midwest . Perhaps its most important contribution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ethnicity , and religion , thus deepening our understanding of an emerging American pluralism . Rural historians should consult it as a primer on the theory of ethnic group formation , and historians of ethnicity will find in it a model of comparative analysis which avoids the pitfalls of filiopietism . Necessarily , gender and race take a back seat to ethnicity , which leaves one curious about how the presence of Native Americans and African-Americans in the Midwest figured in the construction of ethnic identities . ( The 1862 Dakota uprising in Minnesota comes to mind . ) <p> Given our concern that rural history be taken more seriously , it is instructive to see how Gjerde 's work informs larger historical debates . He convinces us that much of what we label rural culture--the patriarchal family , the tightly-knit community , the village church--is a manifestation of ethnic culture in the countryside . And in a period of peak immigration from Europe to America , this book explains how rural immigrants were drawn into a pluralist politics through a set of ethnic loyalties anchored in their cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rural historians , but also to scholars interested in ethnicity and immigration , politics and the expanding state , and the role of religion in identity and community . <p> The book raises some questions that we might consider in an on-line discussion . How broadly can we use the model of a complementary identity ? Does it hold true for immigrants who lived in communities which were a mix of immigrants and the native-born ? Might the story be told differently in the lower Midwest , where the " Yankee " element took a back seat to Southerners ? We might also discuss the lessons of this history for nativist controversies in today 's public policy , such as campaigns to make English the official language . Can we see parallels between the formation of ethnoreligious identities and the identity politics of our own age ? Are today 's debates over abortion rights , prayer in schools , and working mothers anchored in similar dual conceptions of power and authority in the home ?

For example , does communication in the public sphere leave the framework of most democratic theories ? Do concepts like legitimacy or representation have to be transformed because of changes in public reasoning or participation modes ? Is lowering the normative expectations a good way to react to the new realities ? What amendments have to be considered for these theories ? Which democratic theory is particularly under pressure and which is able to preserve its norms ? We invite submissions on these and related topics .

Leon Higginbotham completed In the Matter of Color , the first book in his series " Race and the American Legal Process . " This influential text examined the ways in which the legal structure of the American Colonial Period , the institution of chattel slavery , and racism were inextricably intertwined . The publication of the second volume in the series , Shades of Freedom , has come eighteen years later . In Shades of Freedom Higginbotham endeavors to move beyond the period of American history so defined by the forced submission of African-American people codified in pre-Civil War constitutional law , to a time when racial equality appeared to be an attainable reality . He aims to trace how the law systematically dehumanized African-American people and " its impact on the journey from the midnight of total oppression to some early dawn , where there were occasional glitters of light and muted shades of freedom " ( p. xxiv ) . He boldly strides into a complex period of African-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obfuscate the actual nature of racial injustice . <p> Higginbotham 's analysis is driven by a concept he has coined the " precept of inferiority . " Higginbotham defines this theme as the effort to " presume , preserve , protect , and defend the ideal of the superiority of whites and the inferiority of blacks " ( p. 195 ) . He distinguishes four historical stages in the development of this " precept " within the American legal system : the ancestry of inferiority ( 1619 to 1662 ) --during which the legal process presumed black inferiority and white supremacy ; the ideology of inferiority ( 1662 to 1830 ) --when black inferiority and white supremacy become strategically encoded within legal rhetoric and practice ; the politics of inferiority ( 1830 to the Civil War ) --at which time the legal structure maintained the precept of inferiority even as its primary institutional support , slavery , was dissolving ; and the dream of freedom and its demise ( Reconstruction to Plessy and beyond ) --characterized by the unsuccessful efforts remove racially-based prejudice from the American legal process . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of Higginbotham 's writing , but he places the greatest emphasis on the period from Reconstruction until Plessy . It is in these sections where he turns up the energy on his judicial analysis . His narrative easily glides from Supreme Court judgments like Railroad Company v.

Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad Company , when the court decided that an African-American woman did not have the legal right to a seat in the " ladies " car . Higginbotham clearly maps out several of the critical legal cases and political actions that laid the all important foundations for the Supreme Court 's 1896 " separate but equal " decision handed down in Plessy v. Ferguson .

Shades of Freedom is to be the first of several volumes delineating his " Ten Precepts of American Slavery Jurisprudence . " In light of this intent , this book appears programmatic at times . Yet , the carefully interlaced historical documentation lifts this piece from being merely an exercise in explicating one of his precepts of American slavery jurisprudence to a purposefully crafted examination of race and the law . Higginbotham argues that the precept of inferiority 's legacy continues to linger within contemporary American culture .

Their pursuit of what one might perhaps call ? the meaning of meaning ? leads them away from the source of tragic inspiration and away from undifferentiated violence . <p> INViolence and the Sacred , RenT Girard writes that : ? The City of Athens prudently kept on hand a number of unfortunate souls , whom it maintained at public expense , for appointed times as well as in certain emergencies . Whenever some calamity threatened . . . there was always a pharmakos at the disposal of the community ? ( p. 94 ) . Although somewhat perplexed as to whether Calder=n : The Secular Plays constitutes an emergency or an appointed time , I , languishing at public expense in the dungeons of Arizona , find that the handling of my book and me in the previous pages , opaque and ill-composed as they are , amounts to an academic rite of sacrifice for the spiritual well-being of one exceedingly small interpretative community . Intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiar notion of the sacred . At first , like any victim , one feels bewildered at being ritually abused . But , as anyone who has ever been a captive knows , one of the great resources of a prisoner is inwardness and self-containment , that solipsism so rightly dreaded by Girard . In not a few such solipsistic moments , then , I have meditated on the aggressions of my assailant and have come to understand them . The notion of society as something both primordial and sacred has dominated French interpretative thought since MoliFre 's Misanthrope . Even that misfit Rousseau was enraged when Diderot characterized him as bad because Rousseau lived apart . But of course Rousseau 's preoccupation was with a society to which he would not have to feel hostile . Similarly , for RenT Girard society is the indispensable critical context . Athens comes first , we pharmakoi last . And , as my reference to the exalted status of the community as created and guaranteed by the debased condition of those victims who supposedly ensure its health makes clear , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which there are infinite gradations of degree . Even the most casual reader of the memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon will recognize this world with its rivalry for difference and distinction , its pursuit of tabourets de grGce and of a better position in the funeral procession of coaches . But many a reader will also recognize at least one of its alternatives in a withdrawal from the tyrannies of society <p> 5 ( 1985 ) <p> A Reply to Cesreo Bandera <p> 61 <p> into the interiorities of monasteries like that austere one founded by Saint-Simon 's friend M. de la Trappe . Even in Saint-Simon , then , religion is previous to and greater than society , which looks frivolous once it is abandoned for an observantine cloister . Girard posits , however , quite another ordonnance . Community bringing together humans and their hostilities is primeval . Community as the conflictive catchment for that aggressiveness which fundamentally characterizes the species is thus his commanding idea . Next in the sequence comes that violence which is the inevitable result of social grouping ? the plague , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes the tragic sacrificial cure ? the immolation of the pharmakoi , the rise about them of the sacred . Accounts of this genetic event must , according to Girard , always mask and misapprehend it . Art therefore conceals reality rather than revealing it : ? In order to retain its structuring influence , the generative violence must remain hidden ; misapprehension is indispensable to all religious or postreligious structuring. ? Generative violence is thus the core , and the corps , of one vast monomyth of origin : ? All religious rituals spring from the surrogate victim , and all the great institutions of mankind , both secular and religious , spring from ritual . Such is the case . . . with political power , legal institutions , medicine , the theater , philosophy and anthropology itself ? ( p. 306 ) . Moreover , this ? single mechanism . . . is continually functioning because perpetually misunderstood ? ( p. 299 ) . Girard unmistakably subordinates society , culture , and art to a violent tragic vision , by turning away from which those only fortify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aversion from the tragic is what Pascal would call , generally , ? divertissement , ? and specifically , ? la comTdie. ? Like him , Girard castigates both . In Calder=n : The Secular Plays I have quite consciously and methodically interpreted the narrative and the dramatic art of Cervantes and of Calder=n as moving apart from the tragic sense in which it nonetheless so richly abounds . For both , I think , the tragic is a datum in their distance from which , a distance ever so intimate , a comic or , better , comedic vision is generated . Since the comic parodies the tragic , it necessarily misapprehends it or at least misrepresents it . The purpose of the distortion is liberation and , ultimately , domination of the dominant . Guard would say that this misreading simply increases tragic potency , which is wise when one considers how often power has been reduced or destroyed by ridicule . Now the usual view of Calder=n and Cervantes is that their art , though ludic , is ultimately <p> 62 <p> ROBERT TER HORST <p> Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemplary death would , for example , be adduced to support such an understanding . I would argue to the contrary in terms of art , which not only in Cervantes but well before , in Manrique 's Coplas , appropriates the ultimate moral reality ? death ? in the form of the ars moriendi . Gris=stomo stages death , as does Basilio , as does Don Quijote himself . Similarly , in El gran teatro del mundo Calder=n theatricalizes human destiny and God 's part in it . Life becomes fiesta , holy day and holiday , the sacred and an evasion of the sacred . His characters do not stay at home in Pascal 's room to meditate on death . They embark on that sanctified escape , a pilgrimage , and find death along the pathways of divertissement , with varying fortune in the afterlife yet having experienced the enormous consolation of a non-violent society along the road . This pilgrimage , this perpetual motion so detested by Pascal , is the basic structure also of Cervantine narration , the multiple salidas of the novelas and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which art masters a congruent morality . In this dual approach to a non-tragic dispensation , Cervantes and Calder=n also begin to overhaul the previous subordination of the female to the male . Women in their works come to the fore , perhaps because they realize that women are less addicted to ritual sacrifice than are men . Modern tragedy for both writers centers on honor , and honor on the female victim . Comedy is a surrogation of tragic immolation . In El galn fantasma , the duke of Saxony does not quite murder his rival , and the competitor and the woman the duke and his rival both desire are banished , the Platonic , rather than executed , the Athenian solution . Comedy in Cervantes and Calder=n by and large turns the tables on the tragic and so comes to dominate that by which it had once been dominated . Though very close indeed to a much darker ancient perspective , this is a modern outlook , what my antagonist would call ? liberal optimist ? or ? secular humanist. ? Girard 's strategy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to return it to a tragic anthropological monomyth over which he himself is dominant . Speaking of the quarrel between Tiresias and Oedipus , he writes that ? Truth is on the side of Tiresias and of that interpretation in depth which turns the tables on a former interpreter , ? but prudently adds ? Are we so sure that this is the end of the road ? ? So far as I am concerned it is not . Yet I strongly suspect that Girard feels that he has completed his journey , or should I say pilgrimage ? His will have been an Odyssey rather than an Iliad , a return rather than an advance : <p> 5 ( 1985 ) <p> A Reply to Cesreo Bandera <p> 63 <p> ? Far from subordinating religion to sport or play ( as does Huizinga in Homo Ludens ) , we must subordinate play to religion , and in particular to the sacrificial crisis ? ( p. 154 ) . ? Huizinga 's famous theory of play should be inverted . It is not play that envelops the sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( p. 312 ) . But even though Calder=n declares that ? no hay ms fortuna que Dios , ? fiesta dominates his theatrical cosmos , as it does Cervantes fictive world in which ? no siempre se est en los templos. ? My own critical posture is one of subordination to the text , an attitude which my antagonist characterizes as ? frivolous ? and ? meaningless. ? Yet in treating the text with no small degree of reverence I believe I avoid that tyrannical struggle for interpretative dominance which would not only subordinate me to a monomyth but would also take my hermeneutical license away on grounds of levity . To try to suppress and silence others in the name of an unproven theory of the sacred is no mere academic dispute . It is a deadly game .

The timing was crucial : by that year , over seven million German " expellees " from the East had entered the territory of the new Federal Republic of Germany . All across West ( as in East ) Germany , cities were still in ruins , and refugees without property or hope had spent years in overcrowded camps . Fearing unrest and radicalization , postwar West German leaders worked under the supervision of the Allied authorities to produce a monumental social and economic " equalization of burdens " ; those who had lost less during the war were compelled to contribute resources which the government redistributed for the benefit of refugees , as well as thousands who had suffered material destruction or persecution under Nazism .

R++diger Wenzel 's newly published monograph on the political controversies over the Lastenausgleich offers the reader heavy citation on every page from an exhaustive collection of archival materials as well as interviews held in the early 1980s with personalities concerned . Time and again , Wenzel demonstrates his authority on every aspect of the debates over the law 's conception and passage . For all this , his work also disappoints on many levels . <p> To frame further discussion of the work , it is most useful to ask whether or not the author has met his stated goals . At the opening of his study , Wenzel states that his goal is " to show the whole legislation proceeding , and so the skirmishes and struggles of all the powers involved , " as well as " to document which political powers collaborated materially on the formation of the law " ( p. 13 ) . Here Wenzel perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader is amazed and overwhelmed by the intimate detail the author presents on each successive controversy from the law 's inception to its passage and immediate aftermath . A look at the ten-page timeline in the appendix is instructive . It proceeds week by week and even day by day . The reader learns such minute information as the fact that a December 5 , 1950 cabinet meeting about the Lastenausgleich was followed on December 6 by a special meeting of the federal government concerning the administration of the proceeds from the Lastenausgleich . Each chronologically arranged chapter carries the reader through another phase : the beginnings of the discussion about compensation , the Lastenausgleich in the economic council , the draft in the executive branch , the draft in the legislative branch , and onward through the law 's passage . Along the way , one becomes acquainted with the smallest details about the early framing of the law , such as the precise layout and content of each subsection in both the first and second preliminary drafts . <p> This is not to say that , while sifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find some details of interest . At the first reading of the draft law before the Bundestag on January 31 , 1951 , for example , expellee leader Linus Kather rejected the idea that expellees should receive quotas of relief and insisted on " proportional reimbursement for what had been lost , " as though the replacement of whole villages and livelihoods should be given a material value ( p. 106 ) . At the same time attacking the " snail 's pace " of Lastenausgleich legislation , Kather contributed to the law 's slowing momentum through his fiery speeches and threats of political consequences . <p> Unfortunately , Wenzel never proves able to move outside of minutiae to appreciate the larger , indeed pivotal stakes involved in the law , and in this manner he can not deliver on his other major goal : to demonstrate " the meaning that the Equalization of Burdens Law presented for the history of the reconstruction of the Federal Republic of Germany " ( p. 13 ) . In part , this lack may be due to the fact that he devotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical , legal , and social background in which the law was framed ; it may also be because , after an exhaustive trek through archival data , he never analyzes the law 's consequences . Above all , though , the work fails due to the general absence of secondary literature . Though he claims that his work fills a hole in contemporary research , Wenzel 's bibliography conspicuously lacks reference to serious literature published in the past two decades , in essence since the monumental changes of 1989 . He never examines Michael Hughes 's useful book on the same subject , which already offered a detailed history of the Lastenausgleich using public opinion surveys of the time , archival resources , and an insightful analysis that frames the Lastenausgleich in light of previous social and economic legislation in central Europe. 1 To name just a sampling , the author also fails to discuss the research on the Lastenausgleich by Paul Erker , Carl-Jochen M++ller , and Reinhold Schillinger ; Arne Weick 's study on the currency reform ; the materials recently released with analysis by the Bundesarchiv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 <p> As a result , though this book offers an outstanding exegesis of archival texts , illustrating what contemporaries termed the " snail 's pace " of the measure 's implementation , it never leaves the halls of power to examine how the law affected everyday expellees , much less German society as a whole .

@@40786855 @786855/ <p> In this multifaceted book , Joshua C.- Wilson sets out to accomplish a number of ambitious goals . Based on fifty interviews and secondary and primary source materials , including newspapers , Wilson tells the stories behind three distinct court cases . What these court cases share is that they stem from an actual or perceived conflict of interest regarding people 's rights in relation to the physical space around health clinics where abortions occur . Firstly , he attempts to develop these stories through the lens of " movement-countermovement " analysis whereby he analyzes " how directly competing movements interact with one another " and possibly with a more traditional entity like the state " in a dynamic process where each movement in part creates the conditions within which the other acts " ( p. 10 ) . At the same time , he sets out to understand what we can learn about these stories regarding questions raised by traditional " legal consciousness " research , including " determining if and how law mattered for those involved in these disputes ; how their stories may or may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state authority ; ... and how their conceptions of law affect the ongoing politics of abortion " ( p. 111 ) . Lastly , Wilson includes the perspective of a group of participants in these legal conflicts that is- often explicitly excluded in traditional legal consciousness research : state legal insiders or legal " elites , " specifically lawyers , legislators , and amicus brief authors . Overall , this book achieves the ambitious goals it sets for itself in that it engages with and furthers two types of socio-legal-historical research : movement-countermovement literature and legal consciousness literature . Nonetheless , certain aspects of the conclusions reached by Wilson raise questions and leave room for further analysis . <p> In the first half of the book , Wilson tells the stories behind Planned Parenthood Shasta-Diablo v. Williams- ( 1995 ) , Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York ( 1997 ) , and Hill v. Colorado ( 2000 ) . These three cases frame Wilson 's investigation and arise from a particular historical moment in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the primary battleground over abortion was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , as Wilson explicitly notes , that all abortion wrangling was occurring on the streets at this time or that all street-level protests and actions have ceased since then but rather that clinic-front direct action was one of the anti-abortion movement 's " identifying hallmarks " during this time ( p. 1 ) . As Wilson notes briefly , this move to the street partly occurred as a result of failures and setbacks for the anti-abortion movement within the courts and on judicial benches . This led to a new set of tactics being developed on both sides of this controversy . <p> Two specific types of anti-abortion protestors , as identified by Wilson , were created during this time : the picketers and the rescuers . Both targeted their direct-action tactics at health clinics where abortions occur . However , the picketers tended to be more peaceful , less aggressive , and generally more interested in educating and counseling women who were considering abortion . The rescuers , so called due to their connection with organizations like Operation Rescue , were involved with large-scale demonstrations that often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parking lots and/or using their bodies to prevent entrance and exit from health clinics in other ways . <p> Both types of direct-action anti-abortion protestors sparked various reactions from abortion rights advocates , particularly those affiliated with the specific clinics that were heavily targeted . One direct-action tactic abortion rights advocates used included the regular use of " escorts , " people who were willing to walk patients from their car to the entrance of the clinic in order to physically separate the protestors from the patients and to help shield patients from some of the more explicit photos employed . Increasingly , however , abortion rights advocates found themselves turning to the law to find a solution . The three cases Wilson- details are examples of the move to engage the law to help solve the problems created by these street-level anti-abortion tactics . <p> To tell the stories in a way that engages with movement-countermovement and legal consciousness research , Wilson utilizes the accounts of participants on both sides of the cases and includes perspectives of street-level activists and legal " elites " in their own words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Both Planned Parenthood Shasta-Diablo v. Williams- and Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York- dealt with the use of court-ordered injunctions . In Williams , the permanent injunction pushed anti-abortion protestors so far away from the clinic that they were separated from it by a busy four-lane street . In Schenck , the permanent injunction included , among other things , a fixed no-protest buffer of fifteen feet around all clinic entrances and driveways and a cease and desist provision . The cease and desist provision required that , although two picketers at a time were allowed within the fifteen-foot buffer to counsel patients , those picketers must stop counseling or engaging with patients within that fifteen-foot buffer if they were asked to stop by the patients . Hill v. Colorado- dealt with a law passed by a Republican-dominated legislature in the state of Colorado in 1993 to limit the means by which protestors may target patients entering clinics . The law created a " floating bubble " that required anyone within one hundred feet of a clinic entrance to first get permission before approaching closer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counsel , display a sign , protest , or educate . However , if a person approached within eight feet of the protestor , the protestor need not move away but could remain standing in place without violation of the law . All of these legal solutions were ultimately upheld by the reviewing courts as content-neutral and as- valid " time , place , and manner " restrictions on speech and therefore not in violation of the protestors ' First Amendment rights . <p> The unique and most- important contribution of this book is made through Wilson 's choice to pick this set of cases and , in fact , this entire controversy . He explicitly chooses these cases in a calculated and effective move to broaden the scope of traditional movement-countermovement and legal consciousness research . His choice to examine these cases is driven by their classification as , in his terms , " secondary movement litigation " ( p. 12 ) . By this classification , he explicitly draws two important parallels between these cases . First , they all arose from back-and-forth reactions to the tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought as part of an intentional legal strategy . Second , he claims , these cases " are not meant to , nor do they even have the ability to , incrementally or immediately achieve either movement 's ultimate policy goals " ( p. 14 ) . Further , he suggests , a third way to understand the status of these cases as secondary litigation is by noting , jurisprudentially , that these cases were about competing interpretations of the First Amendment right to free speech rather than the Fourteenth Amendment due process right to privacy and liberty around which reproductive rights have been legally framed . This type of litigation , he points out , has rarely been examined explicitly in either movement-countermovement or legal consciousness literature . His insights regarding what this less deliberative type of litigation can tell us about how movements respond to each other and how individual participants understand and shape law is unique and useful in many ways . Nonetheless , I believe there is a conceptual flaw in part of his definition of these cases as secondary litigation . <p> I believe Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrelated to either movement 's ultimate policy goals . Both anti-abortion picketers and rescuers were at the clinics to stop women from having abortions through education and/or counseling they thought would be effective in reducing abortion and through blocking access to the clinics more directly . This action relates directly to anti-abortion policy goals of , at the very least , reducing the absolute number of abortions that take place . Similarly , abortion rights advocates were compelled to defend against these actions . If intimidation of patients and the effective shutting down of clinics for short periods of time were allowed to continue , the most important policy goal for abortion rights activists , safe and reliable access to abortion , would be compromised as well . Although Wilson is correct in the idea that this litigation is " secondary " in that it was reactionary and legally distanced from the normal abortion jurisprudence issues , it is not accurate to suggest that the aims being sought by this litigation for both sides were not central to the overall aims of both movements . This mischaracterization , although leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect some of the conclusions Wilson reaches . <p> For example , one conclusion Wilson examines in relation to secondary movement litigation is that " one would expect the movements not to be fully invested in them .... The movements may be better able to end these cases if they seem too great of a drain on financial or emotional resources " ( p. 167 ) . Yet he also notes , " these cases persisted through the appeals process even when they were quite costly for both sides . This shows that the movements were deeply invested in these cases " ( p. 170 ) . He looks for reasons why this might be the case here when , given his earlier assumptions about secondary litigation , it seems as though there should be more of a divestment in cases such as this . Finally he adds , " the risk of a movement harming itself through overinvesting in secondary movement litigation should be recognized " ( p. 171 ) . The fact missed by Wilson throughout this analysis is that defeat in these cases would reduce the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the goal of reducing abortion or the goal of ensuring safe and reliable access to abortion . This is an additional factor that could help explain why these cases were not easily abandoned and why the cases were seen by the participants as " personally important " and " highly significant " for both sides ( p. 170 ) . <p> The second half of Wilson 's book engages in analysis of the effect of these cases on the legal consciousness of the various participants . As he says , " We know how the actors in these disputes have behaved , but in order to fully understand the nature of legal power , we need to explore how they understand their behavior and construct law in their stories " ( p. 113 ) . His analysis of this question leads to several interesting insights . Briefly , he forwards two conclusions regarding the street-level participants ' beliefs in the legitimacy of state power and access to law 's narrative power after the conclusion of these cases . <p> First , even though abortion rights advocates won in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coercive nature of state power , this victory did not enable the victors to have unlimited access to the normative power of law . This is best understood as a result of the fact that these cases arose as secondary litigation where , specifically , abortion rights advocates found themselves arguing for a more conservative view of First Amendment rights to free speech in this area . Since many of the activists in the movement tended to believe in an expansive reading of the right to free speech in other contexts , this position required the activists to carefully articulate the interests being balanced in these cases rather than have access to a clear-cut and powerful rhetoric regarding absolute " rights " in these cases . <p> Second , even though anti-abortion forces lost in the courts and were made subject to coercive state power , this loss did not require them to either delegitimize state law or to give up their beliefs or sense of themselves as law abiding citizens . Rescuers ' narratives generally underscore their belief that the courts were simply enforcing law that probably should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were doing so because the state misunderstood the nature of what was at stake . For rescuers , the appeal to a higher extra-state law , found in their belief in God 's law , fueled their anti-abortion actions but also allowed the participants to recognize that , in these cases specifically , they were actually breaking state law and the state responded appropriately . The picketers , on the other hand , saw their actions as legal and justifiable and the courts as wrong in imposing punishment on them . However , in their overall narratives , rather than regard state law as illegitimate , the picketers tended to minimize their critique of state law by claiming that the cases were a result of individual corrupt judges or lying clinic owners . Further , the anti-abortion movement , partly through the interplay of participants in these three cases , has been advantaged by these cases in the long run by making key connections and marshaling resources that have continued to serve them in the state legislative battlefield . <p> Another innovative aspect of this book , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revolves around his choice to extend this legal consciousness analysis to the legal " elites " he interviewed regarding these three cases : the cause lawyers , state attorneys , " hired gun " lawyers , legislative members , and amicus authors . Most research on elites tends to focus on the way that elites may have a detrimental effect on movements and alienate activists by taking over the rhetorical framing through focusing on law and litigation strategies . In his research , Wilson thought it useful to " reverse the causal arrow and note the degree to which the lawyers and other elites that work with movements adopt the street-level frames and rhetoric " ( p. 133 ) . He made three crucial claims regarding the legal consciousness of " elites " based on these cases . <p> First , lawyers , especially those in closest coordination with the movement 's street-level participants , did demonstrate similar rhetorical constructions of the issues at stake and the view of law that the street-level activists accepted to some extent . Second , the " elites " placed further away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric and , more important , " the overwhelming majority of elites constructed images of law that were unprincipled and infused with politics and showmanship " ( p. 178 ) . Yet , third , he claims the elites ' " anemic " version of state law , which tended to undermine state law 's legitimacy , did not seem to pass to the street-level activists ( p. 180 ) . Although he mentions a number of reasons why this may be so , one reason Wilson proffers is the distance between the activists and the legal battles of the elites . Wilson suggests that rather than alienating the street-level activists in these cases , the distance between the activists and the " legal fights in a foreign world being waged by distant surrogates " actually insulated the activists from the problematic versions of state law created by these distant legal " elites " ( p. 183 ) . Thus , while many studies warn of the problems created by this separation between legal elites and activists in movements , he recognizes one possible benefit that this distance may afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three cases reveals some really interesting dimensions related to movement-countermovement and legal consciousness research , it also shields from view some important and useful insights , particularly interesting movement-countermovement dynamics . Although Wilson does briefly mention that the anti-abortion movement has had some considerable success in the state legislative arena since these cases were fought , he misses some specific connections between the goals of the anti-abortion activists in the street and the form of some recent state laws . For example , some recent state laws require women who present themselves for an abortion to be told that personhood begins at conception- and that there might be serious negative psychological effects on the women due to abortion , and/or to receive information on the ability of the fetus to feel pain. 1 In Texas , the state has gone so far as to require women who present themselves for an abortion be given a sonogram , often a vaginal sonogram , even when not medically necessary and even against the- woman's- will . The doctor is required to turn the screen toward her face and describe various body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and cover her ears. 2 In effect , these state laws have taken the messages and images conveyed by the protestors outside the clinics and put them into the mouths of the doctors and/or other health professionals inside the clinics . Wilson symbolically demarcates the end of the street politics of abortion with an image of a picketer who claimed that after the bubble bill was passed she felt unsure how to proceed and would sometimes not move or speak when a woman walked by in case she was accidentally violating the law . He says , " The resulting street-level demobilization is captured in the image of the anti-abortion activist standing stock-still and silent " ( p. 106 ) . The insight he misses by cordoning off the street aspect of the anti-abortion movement from the wider movement itself , however , is another symbolic picture : this one of the health-care practitioner speaking the messages and reproducing the images of the anti-abortion movement at the coercive behest of the state . The street activist is now , effectively , inside the clinic and wearing the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book Wilson set out to write , he has done an admirable job of furthering the existing socio-legal-historical research .

Calling specific beaver by name , Hearne marveled at their fondness for humans and their behavior , which he found to be not unlike that of a dog . The famed eighteenth-century Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ) explorer and fur trader is best known for his northwestern travels and expeditions chronicled in his heroic narrative A Journey from Prince of Wales 's Fort , in Hudson 's Bay , to the Northern Ocean ( written between 1769 and 1772 , published in 1795 ) . In addition to mapping the trade territory of the HBC and establishing a number of key posts for the fur trade corporation , Hearne also recorded detailed descriptions of the New World animals he encountered on his travels . While Hearne 's work for the HBC facilitated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Northwest , he ironically developed companionships with many of these animals , which he tamed and kept as pets . This revelation marks the opening of Sharon Kirsch 's fascinating exploration of early European encounters with New World animals . <p> Writing about historical nonhuman animals is no easy task . Scholars in historical animal studies and environmental history must look to documents or oral histories produced by humans in order to capture a glimpse of the lives of other animals and their relations with humankind . Kirsch does just this in What Species of Creatures , a work of creative nonfiction that examines the relationship between New World animals and European peoples in northern North America ( what is now Canada ) in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . While these sources can only offer a human perspective on human-animal relations , they do provide insights into the place of other animals in the history of European resettlement of North America . <p> Kirsch opens her narrative by examining the recollections and observations of fur traders , explorers , settlers , and missionaries , like Hearne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comte de Buffon . As mentioned above , Kirsch teases out lesser-known evidence of the companionate relations between fur traders like Hearne and the animals that provided the furs which so greatly enriched the HBC . Many early European colonists attempted to tame and domesticate New World animals ( a practice that continued in Canada even into the twentieth century with state-sponsored efforts to domesticate muskox in the Northwest Territories ) . These efforts , it would seem , were born out of both economic interest and scientific curiosity . <p> The second chapter focuses on a specific species of animal that was the object of fascination for many Old World settlers in North America : the hummingbird . Known also as the " fly bird , " Europeans were captivated by this unique and mysterious species of bird that exhibited many of the characteristics of an insect . Kirsch 's sources , drawn from the pages of a great variety of travel and settlement narratives , including the writing of Joseph Lambert , Pierre-Francois-Xavier de Charlevoix , Nicolas Denys , and Sieur de Diereville , provide evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She adopts a similar approach in the following chapter on foxes , which explores the ways in which humans imposed different values on the foxes of the New World compared to their Old World cousins . <p> Chapter 4 highlights the ways that Europeans learned about New World animals through culinary experiences . Many observations recorded in these sources describe the experience of eating strange and exotic animals from beavers to rattlesnakes . In the fifth chapter , Kirsch delves into the diaries of Elizabeth Simcoe , a prominent figure in early Upper Canadian history . While not deeply concerned with her encounters with nonhuman animals , Kirsch provides a more general analysis of Simcoe 's experiences traveling and living in Upper and Lower Canada in the late eighteenth century . Finally , the book concludes with a chapter dedicated to an examination of James Isham , naturalist and HBC chief factor , and his book A Vocabulary of English &amp; Indian ( 1743 ) . Isham 's descriptions of the difficulties of growing vegetables in the harsh climate at York Fort in Rupert 's Land and his impressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Species of Creatures of specific encounters with Alfred Crosby 's concept of ecological imperialism . <p> Kirsch skillfully stitches together this scattered survey of European testimony and observations about encounters with New World animals with very challenging but rich prose . The text is accompanied by a very fine collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century hand drawings of New World animals . Since this is a work of creative nonfiction , readers should be prepared for a nonlinear narrative , punctuated by occasional asides and fictional dialogue . While this style sometimes distracts from the historical subject matter of the book , it offers a unique approach to the writing of history not found in traditional academic publications . <p> As a trade publication , however , Kirsch 's impressive body of primary source research is obscured by an absence of extensive notations . She does include a lengthy description of her sources at the back of the book , but academic readers may find this to be unsatisfactory . This is unfortunate since Kirsch 's research includes a deep collection of primary sources and a reinterpretation of some traditional documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations during this period . <p> With its unique prose and episodic structure , What Species of Creatures provides an engaging , but limited , historical narrative with only tentative conclusions .

With so few books in early Canadian history on the subject of human-animal relations , however , Kirsch 's work is a very welcome contribution that should open the door for other scholars and writers to pursue this kind of research . Her revelations and deep reading of primary source documents , like Hearne 's Journey , should invite other historians to reexamine the relationship between Old World peoples and New World animals .

@@40786868 @786868/ <p> For many , industrial unionism will evoke urban images of auto plants , steel mills , and textile factories . But industrial organizing has embraced the rural world as well , reaching out to disaffected workers in such industries as timber , mining , oil , and agriculture . Seasonal and frequently migratory , these workers often live in isolated company towns or camps , often with little attachment to nearby rural communities . In the early years of the twentieth century , the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) recognized the need and likely radicalism of such workers and pioneered in organizing these often-overlooked members of the working class . <p> In Oil , Wheat , and Wobblies , Nigel Anthony Sellars focuses readers on this effort with a history of IWW organizing in early twentieth-century Oklahoma . According to Sellars , Oklahoma is a natural site for examining IWW organizing at the local level . He characterizes Oklahoma as a " wage-workers frontier " where low-skilled labor in migratory and seasonal jobs was exploited in intensely competitive industries , including agriculture , that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations . Sellars also identifies a parallel between the resistance of Oklahoma 's traditional labor unions , agrarian Populists , and Socialists to " the new economic order , " and the IWW 's ideology of industrial unionism and direct action to achieve workers ' control . <p> Although a fairly traditional labor history , the story is made more broadly meaningful than the typical state-bounded study by its attention to workers in two particular industries , wheat and oil . The narrative is roughly chronological and covers the whole range of IWW activities in Oklahoma from 1905 to 1930 , but it focuses particularly on the IWW 's organizing efforts among wheat harvest laborers and oil field crews from 1915 to 1923 . <p> Sellars examines the growth of the IWW 's agricultural union in Oklahoma 's wheat belt from 1915 to 1917 , then looks at IWW organizing among Oklahoma oil workers during the same period . The fairly successful wheat organizing campaigns tested such eventually standard IWW recruiting strategies as hiring roving job delegates , who were paid a fee for each new member , and aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IWW oil field organizing encountered unexpected difficulties . Recruitment should have been easy--the work was dangerous , employment was insecure , and workers suffered from exploitation resulting from intense competition within a new , rapidly concentrating industry . But labor " agitators " faced powerful , organized corporate opposition , and the workers were transient , relatively highly paid , and concentrated in company boom towns where organizing was difficult . <p> From 1918 to 1923 , the narrative recounts a familiar story of vigorous wartime and post-war repression of labor organizing and radical parties : for the IWW in Oklahoma , the scenario included apparent successes in organizing harvest and oil workers , followed by vicious attacks on IWW leaders , legal and illegal , from solidified corporate and state opposition . But organizers carried out a series of encouraging post-war campaigns among wheat harvesters and oil workers , led by the surviving leadership and focused on more immediate economic issues than previous campaigns . <p> The study includes an account of a 1917 tenant farmers ' protest--the Green Corn Rebellion--which resulted from the IWW refusal to allow membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including tenant , were exploiters of labor just like any other business owner and their aspirations to private property ownership contradicted IWW ideals of worker-ownership . Sympathetic members of the IWW and the Brotherhood of Timber Workers , however , organized tenant farmers , already radicalized by IWW rhetoric , into a union of their own . Tellingly named the Working Class Union ( WCU ) , the tenants ' organization adopted direct action tactics in its struggle against state and corporate powers , and despite their refusal to embrace the tenant farmers , IWW leaders were prosecuted and publicly blamed for the WCU 's activities . <p> According to Sellars , three trends or events caused the IWW 's eventual demise in Oklahoma : increased vigilantism by corporate interests , the 1924 schism of the national IWW , and technological change in the wheat and oil industries . Among these , the last offers the newest insights into the reasons behind the IWW 's failure to survive beyond the 1920s . Compelling evidence suggests that technological change simply reduced the demand for the low-skilled workers the IWW had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adequate membership base to continue active organizing . The introduction of the combine harvester in the wheat industry , for example , reduced harvesting crews from 320 to 5 , while excavating machinery and pipeline welding in the oil industry eliminated the need for ditch diggers and pipeline threading crews ( who had been required to screw the huge pipeline joints together ) . Change in the wheat industry , in particular , had repercussions for the entire IWW organizing effort , since the agricultural workers union had supplied a large proportion of the IWW 's financial strength . <p> Sellars admirably accomplishes his purpose of reexamining the successes and failures of the IWW nationally through detailed attention to its field organizing in the " industrial frontier " state of Oklahoma . He has produced a solid study offering carefully developed evidence of the effects of national directives on the local level , with which he draws conclusions about the eclipse of IWW organizing by other industrial unions , particularly the Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) . His work will be valued both by readers interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those looking for a more fully developed understanding of the IWW . <p> Readers with an interest in the story of Oklahoma 's early twentieth-century radicalism will also find the study of value , since it adds a labor dimension to earlier work on the agrarian roots of populism and socialism in the state . For readers of H-Rural , in fact , this aspect of Sellars ' work may be the most valuable , as a reminder of the full scope of rural experience . <p> Along those lines , the study particularly provides food for thought about the appropriate definition of a rural working class and the implications of that definition . The IWW focused on seasonal , migratory wheat harvest and oil field workers as the vanguard of a workers ' revolution in Oklahoma . Most were not Oklahomans , but transients without roots in local communities . In fact , Sellars attributes the success of the IWW in Oklahoma to the labor circumstances of the industrial " frontier " --the prevalence of company towns and transient housing and the concomitant lack of long-time community relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between small businesses and industrial labor . Thus the IWW definition of rural workers affirmed a traditional outsider/insider class distinction in rural communities , securing local community support for employers against the claims of rural labor . <p> At the same time , the IWW refused to organize the equally vulnerable , and radicalized , tenant farmers , whom they defined as members of the employing class . As Sellars points out in his analysis of the Green Corn Rebellion , the IWW failed to grasp both the powerlessness and the multiple identities of many tenant farmers--aspiring farmer , struggling tenant , seasonal wage worker--that frustrate definitions of a rural working class . Thus , the IWW could not harness , or control , the activities of these radicalized " farmer/workers , " nor did they lend support to the efforts of a group who proved themselves among the most committed supporters of resistance to state and corporate powers . <p> Sellars suggests the IWW might have survived longer had its leadership been less ideologically rigid on this issue . But expecting the IWW to have been able to characterize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high standard . Appropriately defining tenants within a rural class structure was not an issue only for the IWW ; Marxist-based class definitions that rely on a distinction between workers and individuals with ownership of the means of production ( or in the case of tenants , aspirations to ownership ) has been both fundamental to revolutionary ideology and problematic for that ideology in the rural setting since its inception . Although the IWW was at times a practical , flexible organization , it was also a highly ideological one ; accepting tenant farmers as workers would have required re-forming the union 's ideological foundations . <p> On other issues as well , Sellars concludes that the IWW might have survived longer had it been willing to bend or change its ideology . Such a suggestion raises a final question that should capture the imagination not only of rural historians , but also of all historians who look to the past as a source of insights about alternatives that might have been . Had the IWW adopted strategies that might have helped it survive over the long term--organizing tenant farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example--would its survival have contributed to a different labor and rural history in Oklahoma ? Or would a changed IWW simply have substituted for successor unions like the CIO , with a relatively similar outcome for workers , including tenant farmers ? 69403 @qwx479403

Tithecott sees the construction of the serial killer in narrative representation as part of a growing cultural tendency to reject intellectual critique of one 's own cultural values as contributing factors to violence . As evidence , he points to the culture 's frequent use of words such as " motiveless " in constructing serial murder tales . The refusal to entertain a serious discussion of motive , to posit crime as essentially unknowable and thus , at least by some definitions , metaphysically evil , serves to distance the serial killer from the comfortable everyday world and place him in some mythic realm where he is at once profane and sacred . The popularity of the serial killer in fictional narrative , then , is a symptom of a larger cultural denial of responsibility in the production of violence . If nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serial killer , and this nature is perceived as unknowable and uncontrollable , as so many of these narratives imply , what is the point of trying to do better as a society ? Tithecott wishes to remove the word " nature , " with its associations of biological determinism and historical inevitability , from discussions of serial murder ( p. 8 ) so that we may acknowledge our ability to change the parameters of a world we have created ( or at least transformed ) through narrative representation . <p> Part One of Tithecott 's study , entitled " Policing the Serial Killer , " is centered around the idea that mainstream American discourse is more and more dominated by the voices of those who " describe a world threatened ... by inexplicable horror " and advocate " imprisonment or execution ... as the state 's only suitable response " to crime ( p. 15 ) . The entertainment industry is also dominated by these authoritarian voices , so that we are witnessing a widespread " intensification of what might be called a cultural ' policing mentality ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentality insists that violent criminals such as serial killers are both sane and evil , so that " Sane beings motivated by evil can be imprisoned or capitally punished and estranged from the rest of us " ( p. 21 ) . The policing mentality also " elevates the FBI to a community service , above politics " ( p. 22 ) and dismisses the language of modern psychiatry as somehow complicit with the transcendental " evil " of serial murder itself . The policing mentality , in its attempt to configure serial killing as an " asocial " evil so that the social order itself is preserved , finds intellectual justification for its agenda in the Freudian psychological emphasis on the childhood origin of adult personality--a zone outside of society and located within an uncontrollable " nature . " Thus , from the policing perspective , words and language , products of society , seem unsuited to deal with the reality of serial murder . Only the Gothic , with its " acknowledgment of language 's lack of certainty , of the voids which destabilize its meanings " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder phenomenon , whether in fact or fiction . <p> However , Tithecott finds a contradiction between the mainstream desire to hold the serial killer individually culpable for his " evilness " and yet to exonerate silently middle-class , domestic , misogynist society for its own culpability in perpetuating violent ideologies of radical selfhood . He then argues that " Having constructed a barrier between nature and our culture , ... we expel the unspeakable serial killer to the natural world " ( p. 63 ) . Relegating the killer to the realm of nature also allows demonization of behaviors objectionable to mainstream , heterosexual America . Specifically , the representations of Jeffrey Dahmer thus allow the middle-class audience " to explain acts of savagery by referring to Dahmer 's putative homosexuality , to confuse homicidal with homosexual tendencies , confuse ' sexual homicide ' ... with homo sex " ( p. 73 ) . Dahmer 's alleged cannibalism , so often emphasized in his media portrayals , offers " a continuation of the colonizing of homosexuality by heterosexual culture , the conflation of heterosexuality with civilization and homosexuality with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspeakable way , the cultural fascination with Dahmer 's savagery also " indicates a white desire to appropriate those powers previously ascribed to the black savage " ( p. 83 ) . It is through these specific links between Dahmer and popular culture that Tithecott 's work displays its true strength . <p> Part Two of Tithecott 's study expands on the idea that readers of the serial killer spectacle find something personally recognizable in this form of so-called " unspeakable evil " and , indeed , honor the serial killer and his power even as they deny their own complicity in his creation . This uneasy **26;989;TOOLONG can be found in the various representations of Dahmer as " super " serial killer--the relentless automaton or killing machine , for example , which Tithecott identifies as a specific " expression of anxiety on our part about modern humanity or ... modern man in ' machine culture ' " ( p. 96 ) . Even Dahmer 's lengthy confessions , hailed by investigators as honest attempts at self-explication , take on an air of the uncanny and the unspeakable , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , and yet we know it says nothing .... There 's a power to his storytelling , and yet his power is also demonstrated by his ability to ' escape ' his story . He remains unrepresented , hidden from view " ( p. 103 ) . Dahmer is at once human and preternaturally silent , which makes him a seemingly omnipotent figure . The oft-repeated fact of Dahmer 's cooperation with police authority after his capture illustrates another facet of society 's high regard for powerful figures : " Together , the serial killer and his pursuer seem to be united by a special bond of knowledge and mutual respect .... the killer , physically imprisoned , is figured by society as a seer , able to transcend physical barriers and look deep into the soul of fellow monsters and police alike " ( pp. 110-11 ) . Thus , " detective , monster , and audience ... conflate into a single figure " ( p. 117 ) . All are interdependent , to the extent that the serial-killer subject not only " fades , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which represents it " ( p. 134 ) . The serial killer 's invisibility is part of his representation as a postmodern Satanic figure , for " the Dahmers of our culture are ... inscribed with secret powers , with superintelligence , and special knowledge and vision " ( p. 141 ) . Furthermore , these murderous fantasies of omnipotence are gendered as masculine--part of our tendency " to regard male-female politics in terms of a violent hierarchy " ( p. 156 ) . Tithecott concludes by linking misogynistic fantasies of selfhood--those that destroy all notions of difference--to the self-destructive philosophies of fascism that have so plagued the politics of the twentieth century . <p> Other notable recent studies of the cultural representations of serial murder , such as Philip Jenkins 's Using Murder or Mark Seltzer 's Wound Culture , have similarly employed Tithecott 's multi-disciplinary critical strategy . Whereas Jenkins and Seltzer cast a very wide net indeed in their respective analyses , Tithecott benefits from narrowing his focus onto one specific serial killer and then inspecting the media treatments of that individual . Tithecott finds that Dahmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , victim , etc. , depends in large part upon the ideological agenda and biases of those who represent him . Thus , Tithecott 's work at once complements and expands upon Jenkins 's assertion that serial murder in all of its representational guises serves a variety of political purposes in contemporary culture . Within the growing field of what we might call " serial killer cultural studies , " Tithecott 's approach is fairly conventional . However , his application of generally accepted theory to the specific Dahmer case is deftly handled . <p> This review is copyrighted ( c ) 1999 by H-Net and the Popular Culture and the American Culture Associations .

@@40786893 @786893/ <p> Conference Report : 1989 and the West . New Perspectives on the Consequences of the End of the Cold War <p> Utrecht University , 20-21 April 2017 <p> How did the End of the Cold War affect Western Europe ? For decades , scholars have mostly focused on tracing causes and consequences of the Eastern halve of the continent . The West , it seemed , was unaffected by the Fall of the Berlin Wall . If anything , this only seemed to confirm the victory narrative of the Western political and economic model which the East adopted in the 1990s . The recent crises which sweep across the West " whether in relation to Russia , the rise of populism , or the resistance against neoliberalism " cast a shadow over this scholarly reading of the consequences of the end of the Cold War . The question how the End of the Cold War has affected the West is therefore of major importance . <p> Throughout the 1980s , when les trente glorieuses had come to an end , three processes emerged that seemed to confirm Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western view on international security , which focussed on European integration and NATO , seemed confirmed by the arms race , the Single European Act , and European expansion . Secondly , the economy recovered from the slowdown of the 1970s and this instilled faith in the ideology , neoliberalism , which underpinned the economic growth . Lastly , democracy " more specifically a democracy centred on parliaments , parties and professional politicians " seemed solidly in place in the 1980s . Although the end of the Cold War is a widely studied subject , new perspectives on the triumphalism of these three processes are much needed , as they are currently all being questioned . <p> Therefore , the History Department at Utrecht University hosted a workshop entitled 1989 and the West : New Perspectives on the Consequences of the End of the Cold War ' , on the 20th and 21st of April 2017 . Scholars from Italy , Germany , the United States , Belgium , Great Britain , Denmark , the Netherlands , and Portugal gathered to discuss ways in which the end of Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue . <p> During two days , four panels and a keynote lecture discussed the consequences of the end of the Cold War in the West . The panels focussed on the following subjects : a new Germany in a new Europe ; neoliberalism in and beyond the nation state ; remaking Europe after 1989 ; and populism and identity politics after the Cold War . The workshop was opened with remarks by Pepijn Corduwener , who posed three central questions to be answered during the two-day workshop : Which narratives , political practices and institutions were strengthened by 1989 and which fell by the wayside ? How should we conceptualise the legacy of 1989 ? And if we tend to speak of the former Soviet bloc and the former East , would it make sense to speak of the Former West ' ? <p> The first panel , focussing on a new Germany in a new Europe , was opened by Ubaldo Villani-Lubelli ( University of Salento/Ruhr University ) . He presented a paper on the role the new German power will play in the future European Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to assume a leading role . Christian Wicke ( Utrecht University ) focussed on the normalisation of German identity and argued that , even though the German normality is ontologically , territorially and ideologically achieved , the historiographical normalisation remains unachieved . Therefore , the negative aspects of German history continue to influence German identity . Adam Seipp ( Texas A&amp;M University ) discussed the process of conversion of American military properties in Western Germany to the new German state after 1989 and the socioeconomic and cultural gap it left . Discussant Jacco Pekelder ( Utrecht University ) summarised the three presentations as the consolidation of a German self-image as Germany as a civilian power ' in the world . <p> In the second panel , Neoliberalism in and beyond the nation state ' , Ana+s van Ertvelde ( Leiden University ) discussed how the end of the Cold War influenced Belgian policymaking and civil society , through the lens of disability policy . She concluded that , after 1989 , the influence of new social movements and neoliberalism became intertwined , which caused the deconstruction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.W . Zuidhof ( both University of Amsterdam ) continued along comparable lines , by arguing that after 1989 the market was no longer an external critique of the state . Rather , it transformed into an internal principle of the state , or roll in ' as Mellink and Zuidhof named it . They argued that the end of the Cold War worked as a catalyst for this process . Discussant Annelien de Dijn ( University of Amsterdam ) noted that the liberal consensus that followed 1989 is currently being threatened , for instance by nationalism and religion , and she thereby problematised Fukuyama 's end of history thesis . <p> In the third panel , centred on remaking Europe after 1989 , Frank Gerits ( University of Amsterdam ) discussed how European relations with Africa reflected the European integration process . Gerits argued that the EU acted as a reluctant soft power during the 1990s , by performing a narrative of efficiency and good governance . Cristina Blanco Sio-Lopez ( New University of Lisbon ) added to this , by arguing that the EU is becoming increasingly pragmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between the European electorate and its political representatives in the EU . This gap was caused by failing to take the window of opportunity in the early 1990s and the enlargement fatigue in 2004 . Laurien Crump ( Utrecht University ) discussed her paper on the consequences of the end of the Cold War for Western European relations with Russia . She maintained that the Fall of the Berlin Wall closed the possibility of Russia 's return to Europe : after 1989 , Russia was not included in the European integration process and attempts to strengthen the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe failed . Discussant Carlos Reijnen ( University of Amsterdam ) linked the three papers together by concluding how they all focussed on the role of the EU after 1989 , but from different dynamics and perspectives . <p> - <p> The fourth and final panel was dedicated to populism and identity politics after the Cold War . Nicolaas Kraft van Ermel ( University of Groningen ) explained that until 1989 , European history writing was frozen . The end of the Cold War and European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snyder 's Bloodlands was named an influential example of the unfreezing of history . Still , Kraft van Ermel argues , Western historical narratives have been unable to integrate Eastern European perspectives on history , even though this is much needed . Jesper Vespermark K++ber ( University of Copenhagen ) stated that the image of Western triumphalism overlooks the doubt about democracy in the West itself . Vespermark K++ber argues there is a widening gap between citizens and electorates . This causes disbelief in the democratic system , of which the far right now takes advantage . Hanco J++rgens ( Germany Institute Amsterdam ) elaborated on the fundamental change of the Dutch imagined community . In the 1980s , the Netherlands were a guiding nation and the Dutch identity was an export product . By 2002 this had changed , because of the multicultural society and the rise of populism , which caused the Dutch identity to come under pressure . Discussant Sarah de Lange ( University of Amsterdam ) provided comments on the three papers separately and tied them together thematically . <p> - <p> The workshop was highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , University of London ) on the return of fascism in Europe . Although the current circumstances and main drivers are different from the 1930s , Stone argued that fascism is returning to Europe " mainly as a response to neoliberalism . He explained that fascism is being adapted , so that it both draws on ideas from the past and takes new energy from current-day issues , such as xenophobia , extreme nationalism and economic protectionism . The end of the Cold War accelerated the deconstruction of the post-WWII consensus , and the forces that kept fascism away after 1989 have vanished , which caused fascism to rise again . However , discussant Beatrice de Graaf responded that end of the Cold War was not as influential as 1945 or 9/11 to the rise of fascism , regarding the emotional , psychological and moral discourse . This contributed , according to De Graaf , to a sense of insecurity and fear , which causes people to make irrational choices : Dan Stone characterises this as the rise of fascism . <p> - <p> Eleni Braat concluded the workshop by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by answering the three main questions posed in the opening of the workshop . Braat stated the workshop emphasized the importance of 1989 as a catalyst , because many contributors stressed that several developments were already under way in the 1980s and only strengthened by 1989 . Another joint conclusion held that 1989 was followed by several missed opportunities . Most importantly , connecting Eastern and Western Europe through European integration and an inclusive historiography failed . In conclusion , the two-day workshop facilitated original debates on the consequences of the end of the Cold War and the end of history thesis , thereby providing new topics for further research .

Examples of political intervention in sports are numerous : African countries boycotted the 1976 Olympics in Montreal in protest of apartheid in South Africa ; the United States did not participate in the 1980 Games in Moscow after the Soviet Union 's invasion of Afghanistan ; some Arab countries still refuse to compete with athletes from Israel in support of Palestine .

Striking in its simplicity , the cartoon depicted a white man and woman struggling in a field and joined together by a yoke labeled " economic inequality . " The caption simply read " Dixie. " 1 In many ways this cartoon encapsulates the liberal attitudes following the Report 's release . Although the southern authors of the Report went to great lengths to explain the external and internal sources of southern poverty , many Americans simply continued to view the South not as a distinct and potentially wealthy agricultural region and system , but as an area of the nation that was woefully behind the economic and industrial times . The source of economic inequality in the South , this popular opinion went , was a lack of technological and economic modernization coupled with an incomprehensible refusal to she 'd old anti-progressive traditions and attitudes . And , for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much like our Cleveland News cartoon , the nation , even the Report itself , presented the southern economic and social problems devoid of any racial dimensions . The distinct economic , social , and political disadvantages of African Americans were never acknowledged . <p> Yet when one discusses the economic conditions of the South , and Franklin Roosevelt 's subsequent New Deal programs meant to address those conditions , race can hardly be ignored . For not only were race and poverty inextricably linked in the southern United States , but , according to Patricia Sullivan 's Days of Hope : Race and Democracy in the New Deal Era , the politics designed to remedy these economic problems created a unique period of opportunity for those involved in reversing the second class status of southern African Americans . Sullivan 's thesis that the national crisis of southern poverty created opportunities for southern liberals to attempt to change the deep-rooted economic , political , and racial traditions of the South is promising , well-researched , and in-line with recent evaluations of the New Deal as a crucial moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days of Hope , Sullivan boldly proclaims that her work is " the study of a generation , " one that she pursues through the examination of three central themes : the changing relationship between the federal government , the South , and the Democratic Party ; the dynamic role that post-World War II black southerners played in voting rights challenges ; and the development of mostly-young southern liberals and the organizations they formed to further their crusades for economic and racial justice in the South ( pp. 8-9 ) . The heroes and heroines of Sullivan 's study are , for the most part , young idealists of both races who created and used a variety of political and labor organizations to further their struggles and who capitalized on the political urgency and opportunity created by the Great Depression and Roosevelt 's New Deal . In this narrative of the New Deal South , men and women such as Palmer Weber , Virginia and Clifford Durr , Clark Foreman , John McCray , Charles Houston , and Lucy Randolph Mason rise to the surface and represent a new breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Depression young , well-educated , politically and socially liberal , and , for the most part , from financially stable backgrounds . They questioned the morality of racial discrimination , and were willing to create interracial organizations . They were also a part of a much larger national and international movement aimed at addressing economic and social inequality , the Popular Front movement . <p> The story of the challenge to the " southern way of life " that these young reformers mount is rooted in the connection between economics , race , and position in southern society , a society where economic destitution was used to buttress racial discrimination . Nowhere was this more evident than in the distribution of factory jobs after Roosevelt 's National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) established minimum wages . When forced to begin paying a national minimum wage , southern factory owners either closed down their factories or replaced their black workers with white workers . Economic opportunity , or in this case the lack thereof , became yet another way to reinforce the second class status of African Americans while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity . Despite the problems that New Deal reforms might have created in their application , Sullivan argues that the urgency of the Depression created a window of opportunity for political , economic , and social change in the South ( p. 66 ) . <p> One of the first activists to embody that potential for change in Sullivan 's narrative is Clark Foreman , the white Atlanta native who became Roosevelt 's first Special Advisor on the Economic Status of Negroes . In many ways , Foreman is the logical choice for Sullivan to begin with since he embodies many of the characteristics that the other young Turks of southern reform share . Foreman grew up in the heart of the New South , Atlanta , Georgia , and benefited from the economic and social status of his family . After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Georgia he attended Harvard for one year and eventually completed his education with a grand tour of Europe . While in Europe , Foreman attended the London School of Economics , became friends with many of England 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty on developing European nations . Upon his return to Atlanta , Foreman was a changed man . He no longer held many of the views considered proper in Atlanta society , and instead of entering into the business world of his father , Foreman became secretary of the Georgia Committee of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation ( CIC ) . From this position Foreman had the opportunity to explore interracial politics and worked to improve the availability of public services to Atlanta African-Americans . But even his CIC involvement was not enough for Foreman , who grew increasingly frustrated at only being able to respond to what he believed were merely symptoms of much deeper racial and economic problems . In an effort to address the root causes of racial discrimination and economic poverty , Foreman jumped at the chance to become Roosevelt 's first Special Advisor on the Economic Status of Negroes . In so doing , Foreman became a part of a growing contingent of the young , educated , and idealistic soldiers running Franklin Roosevelt 's battle against poverty . <p> Just as Foreman 's intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of other southern white radicals , the political career of Palmer Weber is also instructive . Unlike Foreman , Weber did not share the economic advantages of a powerful southern family . Raised in relative poverty , Weber spent his formative years in the Blue Ridge Sanitarium recovering from glandular tuberculosis . It was here and not in the dining clubs of Harvard or around the tables of London radicals that Weber received his early education in radicalism , particularly Marxism . After securing a scholarship to attend the University of Virginia , Weber continued his political self-education by becoming involved in the university 's Liberal Discussion Group and the local chapter of the National Student League . These interests and his reading of Marx and Plato eventually led Palmer to pursue a Ph.D . in philosophy . However , his anti-lynching crusades and other activities alienated the university community , and a lack of faculty recommendations for a teaching position led Weber into public service with a Washington , D.C. staff position with the Tolan Committee on Interstate Migration . <p> Weber is particularly central to Sullivan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also as a way to discuss and explore the intricate interactions between various political , labor , and civil rights organizations . Coming shortly after America 's first red scare , the American version of the international Popular Front movement challenged American , particularly southern , understandings of democracy and political involvement . Throughout the South organizations like the Southern Conference for Human Welfare ( SCHW ) were created as a means of addressing the racial and economic concerns of this region that Roosevelt labeled " the nation 's number one economic problem . " In addition to its radical membership , organizations such as the SCHW , the Congress of Industrial Organizations-Political Action Committee ( CIO-PAC ) , the Highlander Folk School , the National Citizens Political Action Committee , and the Progressive Party struggled to join together a broad coalition of members and supporting organizations that ran the gamut from union leaders to Roosevelt administration appointees to weathered civil rights activists . At the heart of these efforts was the understanding that activists like Palmer Weber championed--racial and economic matters were intimately linked together and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political action . Unfortunately for many of these organizations , they ran into difficulties as they attempted to negotiate the increasingly hostile and complex world of national and southern politics . Despite their efforts at national legislation outlawing lynching and the poll tax , these organizations were often frustrated by Roosevelt 's and the Democratic Party 's unwillingness to completely alienate the increasingly powerful and conservative cadre of southern democrats . This reticence of the national Democratic Party toward offending southern conservatives is nowhere more apparent than at the 1944 Democratic national convention and the removal of liberal Henry Wallace as Roosevelt 's running mate . <p> In an effort to understand the development and impact of these southern liberals , Sullivan traces these organizations and their leaders through the contentious internal politics of the Democratic Party of the 1930s and 1940s . Beginning with the involvement of many of these young radicals in New Deal programs such as the NRA , Agricultural Adjustment Act ( AAA ) , and the Works Progress Administration , Sullivan follows them into the creation of private political organizations such as the Southern Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Committee to Abolish the Poll Tax , and the Southern Regional Council . But probably the two most useful areas of Sullivan 's organizational study are her examination of the role of labor in these political organizations and the mounting pressures brought by these activists against both state and national Democratic parties . By detailing the development and subsequent work of the Congress of Industrial Organization-Political Action Committee , Sullivan demonstrates how the leadership of organized labor became involved in the southern campaign for economic and racial equality . Civil rights scholars have long taken for granted the involvement of organized labor in the post-World War II civil rights movement , but few have taken the time to examine the beginnings of that involvement . <p> But most important for scholars concerned with the development of twentieth century southern politics is Sullivan 's discussion of the relationship between southern liberals , the national Democratic Party , and several of the southern state Democratic parties , especially the South Carolina party . Monographs on both southern politics and the national Democratic Party seldom discuss the failed yet extraordinarily important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party ( PDP ) of South Carolina and Henry Wallace 's Progressive Party . The least well-known of these two challenges , the South Carolina PDP , is one of Sullivan 's most intriguing and promising narratives . Begun as a challenge to the lily-white and discriminatory South Carolina Democratic Party , the PDP not only ran significant voter registration campaigns throughout South Carolina , but it also challenged the seating of the regular state delegation at the 1944 Democratic national convention . Although the PDP failed to unseat the regular delegation , it marked the first time that an all-black delegation mounted such a challenge and formed the basis for not only further organizational work in South Carolina , but also a precedent for the unsuccessful 1964 Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party challenge and the successful 1968 Loyal Democrats of Mississippi challenge . The 1944 convention challenge and the subsequent removal of progressive Vice President Henry Wallace from the Democratic ticket highlight the ways in which the battle between liberal and conservative democrats were shaping both southern and national Democratic politics . In fact , the impact of these battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign of Henry Wallace and the mixed reception he received on the southern campaign trail . <p> Although Sullivan does an outstanding job exploring the nuances and interactions of these mostly southern-grown progressive organizations and their efforts at racial and economic equality , her analysis sometimes leaves important questions unanswered . Several times she claims , sometimes even through the words of participants such as Virginia Foster Durr , that southern blacks were " the generating force " in the struggle for southern civil rights and voting campaigns ( p. 195 ) . Unfortunately , despite these claims of their central importance , Sullivan spends relatively little time discussing black efforts . Perhaps even more unfortunate , the analysis that Sullivan does provide focuses primarily on organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . Undoubtedly , the NAACP took the lead in the formal political organization of groups of southern blacks , but its dedication to these local branches was scatter-shot at best . Although NAACP membership in the South increased because of the efforts of Ella Jo Baker , the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less concerned with developing local leadership and campaigns than it was with using local membership dues to finance its national legal and political battles . In fact , this lack of national concern for local problems and development eventually led to the angry resignation of Baker . And the NAACP was not above removing or limiting financial and staff support for southern state branches if it felt that no significant national gains could be made . Thus , although local NAACP branches had existed throughout Mississippi since 1918 , the national organization resisted appointing a full-time field secretary until 1954. 2 In effect , by focusing most of her attention on the NAACP and other national organizations , Sullivan sometimes neglects an analysis of local black efforts at improving the lot of southern African Americans . ( Although in all fairness , one should note that Sullivan does provide a compelling analysis of the efforts by blacks to challenge voter discrimination in Georgia and South Carolina . However , even here Sullivan 's analysis tends towards focusing on the leadership of these movements and their relationship with her radical southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local African Americans . ) <p> This focus on national organizations and leaders exemplifies another problem with Days of Hope--the disturbing lack of local southern voices . Although she agrees with the prevailing thesis that most southerners applauded New Deal relief efforts despite the opposition of southern political leaders , Sullivan 's neglect to analyze these southerners renders them voiceless . Considering that the final portion of Days of Hope is most concerned with exploring the efforts of southern liberals to create coalitions that would increase their national and local political power , Sullivan 's limited exploration of local political and social attitudes impedes any understanding of the tactics and frustrations involved in these coalition efforts . In fact , the world of the local southerner , black or white , is missing from Sullivan 's narrative . Although there is ample discussion of the motivations and workings of the leaders of groups such as the SCHW and the CIO-PAC , readers are left wondering what the attitudes and actions were of the rank and file of these organizations . This is an especially puzzling omission given Sullivan 's argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national political support for their changes but also attempted to discover ways to lessen the political power and prestige of the conservative southern political leaders that they believed were limiting southern racial and economic gains . <p> The lack of a local focus also corresponds to a surprisingly small amount of class analysis . Again , by focusing on the leaders of these organizations , most of whom experienced some form of economic or educational privilege , Sullivan skirts significant class analysis . Make no mistake , economic and class issues are primary themes in both these liberal activists and Sullivan 's analysis of them , but they remain rather large , abstract issues to be grappled with on a national level . Thus , during her discussion of New Deal legislation in the South , particularly NRA minimum wage requirements and AAA crop reductions , Sullivan spends little time exploring the relatively minimum impact that these programs had on improving the economic situation of southern blacks . Instead of affirming Harvard Sitkoff 's assertion that the glorification of the New Deal and Franklin Roosevelt by black southerners was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been rather than damning him on a standard of what might be , " Sullivan falls prey to an all-too-optimistic evaluation of the New Deal 's effect on southern African Americans and southern society. 3 Furthermore , given the economic and educational advantage of most of Sullivan 's radical subjects , one is also left wondering how their own economic experiences of privilege affected their liberal political beliefs , and , more importantly , their interactions with most southerners . One gets a sense from Sullivan 's narrative that these activists and their organizations were , in the words of the New Testament , " in the world but not of the world . " Questions such as " How well were these radicals able to communicate with southern workers ? " and , " How did they attempt to translate their economic and political theories of class and race into the vernacular of the voting South ? " are left unanswered . We are given some hint of the difficulties that such an interaction posed with Sullivan 's discussion of Congress of Industrial Organization ( CIO ) unionizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , Sullivan records that the CIO 's radical message of racial equality became watered down by local white southern union members . This occurrence would suggest that the progressive organizations that Sullivan writes about not only met opposition among many southerners , but could also be co-opted for conservative purposes . However , without further analysis , the question of the ultimate effectiveness of these organizations is left unanswered . <p> Despite these analytical lapses , Sullivan offers the most compelling argument to date about the importance of the New Deal period as a fundamental turning point in southern history . Echoing the arguments made by the likes of Alan Brinkley , Numan Bartley , and Harvard Sitkoff , Days of Hope furthers the trend in southern history to view the New Deal period as a fundamental point for change in the South , although most of these scholars do qualify their discussions by emphasizing the long-term affects of the New Deal . Undoubtedly , the Depression and Second World War did create ample opportunities for long-term economic , political , and social change . By discussing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democrats and a somewhat unwilling national Democratic Party , Sullivan highlights the beginning of a redefinition of party politics that would ultimately culminate in the political aspects of the civil rights movement and the demise of a solid Democratic South . <p> Furthermore , Sullivan 's discussion of the long term effects of black voter registration efforts in South Carolina and Georgia support Harvard Sitkoff 's assertion that " The seeds that would later bear fruit had been planted . They would continue to be nurtured by the legal and political developments , the ideas articulated , the alliances formed , and the expectations raised during the New Deal years .

Armitage ( Department of History , University of Kansas ) Published on H-Ideas ( September , 2000 ) <p> A Dialectic of Domination : Carolyn Merchant 's The Death of Nature : Women , Ecology and the Scientific Revolution <p> Note : This review is part of the H-Ideas Retrospective Reviews series . This series reviews books published during the twentieth century which have been deemed to be among the most important contributions to the field of intellectual history . <p> In their classic work Dialectic of Enlightenment , German Critical Theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno argued that the Western project of enlightened thought -- which they distinguished from " the Enlightenment " as a historic period -- conflated the technical domination of nature with the social domination of people . The values of calculation , quantification , and exchange that form the heart of bourgeois thinking are essential to social processes that seek to master nature . Moreover , the drive for domination that Horkheimer and Adorno found at the core of western reason contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primitive forces of nature demanded that he deploy entrepreneurial power over men and patriarchal power over women and children . Horkheimer and Adorno thus argued that critical investigations into the western project of mastery of nonhuman nature must recognize the dimensions of human domination intertwined into the drive to subjugate the green world . <p> Carolyn Merchant 's distinguished text The Death of Nature : Women , Ecology and the Scientific Revolution engaged in just such a critical investigation as it endeavored to reveal the historic connection between the domination of nature and women . Merchant explained that her volume sought " to examine the values associated with the images of women and nature as they relate to the formation of our modern world and their implications for our lives today " ( p. xxi ) . The " implications for our lives today " provided the moral grounding for this work in which Merchant advocated the need to " reexamine the formation of a world view and a science that , by reconceptualizing reality as a machine rather than a living organism , sanctioned the domination of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of the book , then , is a " broad synthesis " that examined the social and ecological changes wrought by the new images of nature associated with the Scientific Revolution . The premodern , organic view of a feminine natural world gave way to a mechanistic cosmology that perceived the green world of nature as inert matter , a machine available to human manipulation . <p> Some readers will remain skeptical at Merchant 's compressed depiction of a premodern European philosophical outlook that unified nature and culture ; however , Merchant acknowledged the diversity of premodern thought and that early Europeans " quarried the mountainsides , altered the landscape , and overgrazed the hills " ( p. 3 ) . Yet Merchant persuasively argued that the dominant feminine , organic theory of nature prominent in many ancient systems of knowledge shaped the governing metaphors that helped regulate human behavior toward the earth . Thus writers such as the Roman compiler Pliny cautioned against deep mining , citing earthquakes as Mother Nature 's indignation at such intrusive violations . Moreover , Pliny warned that the mining of gold corrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders and wars . Europeans still followed Pliny 's admonitions as late as the sixteenth century , enough so that a proponent of mining such as Georg Agricola felt it necessary to refute them in his 1556 work De Re Metallica ( " On Metals " ) . <p> Organic conceptions of nature that emphasized interrelationships and organic unity rather than hierarchy and mastery lent themselves to social ideologies based upon democratic values . ( Merchant noted that organicism and mechanism later fused in the form of twentieth-century totalitarianism . ) Thus the premodern connection between women and nature infused utopian thought such as Tommaso Campanella 's 1602 work City of the Sun , which envisioned an organic society characterized by communal sharing of goods , property and knowledge . Conversely , when popular images of the green world stressed the disorderly nature of illnesses , storms and ruined crops , ideologies that emphasized the need to control both nature and women rose to prominence . Niccolo Machiavelli 's injunction to conquer a wild and feminine Fortune exemplified a philosophy of domination that encompassed nature and women . The ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witchcraft . Merchant argued that , " the disorder symbolized in the macrocosm by the dissolution of the frame of nature and the uncivilized wilderness of the new world , in society by the witch who controlled the forces of nature and the women who overturned its order ... heralded the death of the old order of nature " ( p. 148 ) . <p> The death of the old order of nature came at the hands of the newly developing capitalist economic system of the sixteenth century and the mechanistic ideology that sanctioned its worldly activity . The chief ideologists of the new program were Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes . Bacon 's view that religion and science were engaged in a mutual effort to compensate for the damage done to humanity by the expulsion from Paradise valorized the tendencies toward growth and technological innovation inherent in early capitalism . Descartes ' mechanism furthered the Baconian program by effectively removing spirit from nature and the human body , positing that external objects consisted solely of quantities . <p> Moreover , Merchant observed that " In France , the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency toward central governmental control and the concentration of power in the hands of the royal ministers " ( p. 205 ) . The relationship between mechanistic philosophy and hierarchical social orders continued with the abstract materialism of Thomas Hobbes , who relied upon mechanical models of society to solve philosophical difficulties associated with disorder in his Leviathan . <p> After assessing such ideas , Merchant contended that the mechanistic philosophies of nature which easily associated with hierarchy and social power " sanctioned the management of both nature and society " ( p. 235 ) . Contemporary examples of mechanism include the utilitarian conservation movement , which Merchant characterized as an " adaptation of the rationalizing tendencies inherent in mechanism applied to the natural environment " ( p. 238 ) . Like its contemporary counterpart , however , early modern mechanisms spurred countervailing philosophies such as the vitalism of Anne Conway ( 1631-1679 ) that remained rooted in an organic worldview and articulated no essential differences between spirit and body . Indeed , Conway , whose writings exerted a great influence on what Merchant termed the " dynamic vitalism " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under God , unified in a central spirit that governed all things . Merchant noted the many philosophical deficiencies of vitalism , yet given contemporary ecological dilemmas that arise in part from the lack of organic value systems , concluded that " we might regret that the mechanists did not take their vitalistic critics more seriously " ( p. 268 ) . <p> Despite the originality and many successes of Merchant 's book , informed first-time and repeat readers will surely wish to differ with some of its assertions . Merchant 's reconstruction of a premodern culture that posited an organic and harmonious nature and culture remains problematic . Her depiction of historical causality also feels simplified , even if one acknowledges the need for concise representations of the complex philosophical traditions that comprise the largest part of her evidence . Too , other readers will surely quibble with the interpretations of various figures and her perhaps excessively ambitious thesis ; for example , Merchant 's assertion of connections between mechanism and the social subordination of women remains somewhat speculative , even to the sympathetic reader . <p> Yet twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impress most readers with the vitality of its argument and its sophisticated embodiment of the type of historically and theoretically informed scholarship advocated by thinkers such as Horkheimer and Adorno . Indeed , the strongest parts of Merchant 's message resonate now more than ever : surely our current era of capitalist triumphalism and globalization calls for both ecological analysis and thoughtful criticisms of positivist models of knowledge . The ethical components of Merchant 's work also continue to demand our attention . Her implication that holistic ecology can extend democratic principles toward nonhuman life carries the reader directly into the wide-ranging moral issues informing the human relationship with nonhuman nature . <p> Finally , Merchant 's book helped shape many of the core issues of the two disciplines in which it is firmly canonized . Environmental historians continue to investigate and debate the role of ideas in shaping the human relationship with nature , and , perhaps most importantly , continue to criticize economies from an ecological perspective . Similarly , ecofeminists have furthered Merchant 's vital investigations into the gendered interactions of people and nature and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these and other disciplines , and thereby ensure the continued relevance of The Death of Nature . Merchants ambitious text , then , despite its shortcomings , continues to reward both new and repeat readers because it speaks in a critical and engaging manner to some of the most pressing intellectual , moral , and political issues of our time . 69404 @qwx479404

@@40786909 @786909/ <p> This translation was prepared under the supervision of Professor J. ter Haar , and with the assistance of Asghar Seyed-Gohrab , both of the Department of Persian at the University of Leiden , the Netherlands . I have drawn heavily on an English translation by Juan Cole that has been published electronically in Translations of Shaykhi , Babi and Baha'i Texts , vol. 2 , no. 2 ( May , 1998 ) and on an unpublished translation into French by H. Dreyfus . The present provisional translation is intended for general use in the Bahai community . The Persian source used is the typeset Persian text printed in Tehran by Muhammad Labib in 1935 . This has been checked against the 1893 Bombay lithograph edition in the hand of Mushkin-Qalam . Both published versions are divided into sections , which have been indicated in the translation . <p> Coles English title for the work is Abdu'l-Baha 's " Treatise on Leadership , " while Dreyfus has chosen La Politique . I have chosen the title A Sermon on the Art of Governance , where governance is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Divine governance , which operates through two powers , the religious and the political . But it is also governance in the conventional sense , since much of the book is devoted to the relations between the government and the people . <p> The Persian original is certainly best appreciated when read out loud . Many sections of the Resale-ye Siyasiyyah are written in exhortatory style , in rhyming Persian prose with a declamatory rhythm . Sections with a strong cadence and rhyme alternate with prose , while analysis and scriptural quotations alternate with historical illustrations . The overall effect of the original is of a persuasive Persian sermon in high rhetorical style . <p> Two sentence structures dominate the more rhetorical sections . The first is a simple pair of rhymed phrases , the rhyme usually falling on the verbs which typically come at the end of each phrase : <p> chun be-maqsud-e khish muvafaq shodand <p> rasm-e degar pish gereftand <p> And when their strategy was succeeding <p> they presented another plan . <p> The second consists of two phrases which share a single simple verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the sentence . The verb has to be read implicitly in the second phrase , and so links the two elements : <p> maamura-ye iran viranshodwa dihim-e jahanbani maqar o sirir-e divan <p> The cultivated lands of Persia were laid to waste : <p> demons reclined on the throne of the kings . <p> The structure of the language , with the sustained use of two-part sentences and the frequent use of paired synonyms , reflects Abdul-Bahas theme : that Gods guidance for the world acts through a two-fold order , religious and political . In his words , " This prohibition and prevention , rules and restraints , leading and impelling , is divided into two types . " <p> In the hope of giving the reader at least an impression of the literary quality of the original , parts of the translation have been presented as free verse , usually in pairs of short lines . This is not to say that the verse sections of the translation correspond exactly to those in the original : at some points where Abdul-Baha continues in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose . I have not found any way of reflecting the alternation of Arabic and Persian terms , with some sections drawing on the Persian ideal of kingship , and others drawing their terminology from Islamic thought on governance . <p> Abdul-Baha employs many quotations and allusions from the Quran and Islamic traditions , and from Persian and Arabic poetry . Some of these have been identified , with the aid of many friends , and further assistance with this would be greatly appreciated . <p> The background and audience of the Sermon on the Art of Governance <p> Abdu=l-Baha wrote his Sermon on the Art of Governance in 1892 , had it copied in a fine hand by Mushkin-Qalam , and sent it to Bombay where it was published in 1893. 1 This is just after the period of the &gt;Tobacco Protest= , which had demonstrated the political power of the ulama . From a tablet which is included below as a preface to the main text , it is evident that Abdu=l-Baha sought to have it published again in 1907 , when Iran was again in political chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However the Sermon on the Art of Governance does not contain specific references to the events or personalities of the time . Abdu=l-Baha seeks rather " to briefly clarify the most basic fundamentals of the divine teachings , " setting out the principles underlying the relationship between religion and politics ( in the broad sense ) and between the government and the people . These teachings are as relevant today as they were when the text was written , certainly in Iran , but also elsewhere . <p> It is not necessary to consider the history of the Tobacco Protest extensively here : the details are available for example in Nikki Keddies Religion and Rebellion in Iran : The tobacco Protest of 1891 1892. 2They will be outlined only so far as they help to explain the audience for whom Abdul-Bahawrote . The reader will note that Abdul-Bahaaddresses his treatise to the Friends of God , and cites texts from Bahaullah as evidence that religious leaders should not be directly involved in politics , but also that his argument draws on texts from the Quran and from Islamic traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ulama of Iran and the court . So the question of audience needs to be addressed . <p> The background to the Tobacco Protest was an Iranian state which suffered from chronic disorganisation , a shortage of funds , and inflation due to financial mismanagement . In 1890 the Mullahs in Tehran had begun to preach publicly against the Shah . At the same time , reformers in Iran and in exile were publishing newspapers and distributing pamphlets calling for the end of the absolute monarchy . The immediate cause of unrest was a concession , which Nasirud-Din Shah granted to a British entrepreneur , Major Talbot in March 1890 , in return for royalties to be paid to the Shah . This was only one of many such concessions granted mainly to Russian and British interests , including one to run the state bank . The tobacco concession gave Major Talbot a complete monopoly over the production , sale and export of tobacco . As the details of the agreement became public , and particularly as the companys agents began their work in Iran the Spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposition was Shiraz , where a leading Mullah , Sayyid Ali Akbar , preached against the sale of the tobacco monopoly to foreigners . He was expelled from Iran and went to Iraq to see a prominent reformer , Jamal al-Din Afghani . Sayyid Ali Akbar was a close relative of the most prominent Shiah cleric of the time , Mirza Muhammad Hasan Shirazi , the sole marja at-taqlid , or exemplary guide in matters of practice , for all of twelver Shiism. 3 At Sayyid Ali Akbars urging , Afghani wrote a long letter to Shirazi4 condemning the Shah in the most biting terms , and saying that the Persians were being made desperate by oppression but lacked a leader . He tells Shirazi that the people and ulama of Iran were waiting only for a word from him to act : <p> God hath set thee apart for this supreme vice-gerency , to represent the Most Great Proof , and hath chosen thee out of the true communion , and hath committed to thy hands the reins to control the people conformable to the most luminous Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty interests whereby the people shall prosper in this world and attain happiness hereafter . ... He hath assigned to thee the throne of authority ... " " How then can it beseem one on whom God hath bestowed such power as this to be so chary of using it ... <p> In this letter , Shirazi is addressed in the most laudatory terms , as the " most mighty Pontiff . " Afghani also wrote a similar letter addressed to the ulama of Iran , and both letters were printed and distributed from London. 5 Another letter in Arabic , in which he asks Shirazi to order the Iranian people to depose the Shah , was published in Istanbul. 6 <p> There appears to have been a decided policy among the reformers to seek the involvement of the ulama in order to mobilise popular support for their programme . Another of the reformers , Mirza Malkum Khan , wrote in the newspaper Qanun " Why should the spiritual leader of sixty million Shiis i.e. , Shirazi sit trembling and hidden in the corner of some outlandish village ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be superior to all worldly princes ? " 7In Tabriz , wall-posters made threats against any of the ulama who might refuse to cooperate with the protest against the tobacco concession , and also threatened Europeans and Irans Armenian Christian minority with death . The Mujtahid of Tabriz is said to have threatened to launch a jihad. 8 At the same time , the Tobacco Corporation was giving large bribes to some of the leading ulama to persuade them not to join the protest. 9 <p> At this point , a telegram was received in Iran , purportedly from Shirazi , which condemned the interference of foreigners , concessions such as the bank , tobacco and railroad concessions , and the expulsion of Sayyid Ali Akbar. 10 In Isfahan , two of the leading Mullahs organised demonstrations , and preached that all tobacco was religiously unclean . One of these Mullahs was Aqa Muhammad Taqi Najafi Isfahani , whom Bahaullah had addressed in a book called " The Epistle to the Son of the Wolf . " With a fine irony , Abdul-Baha quotes from this book in section 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying to whom it was addressed . At one of the demonstrations in Isfahan , those present swore that they would stop smoking . The Isfahan ulama apparently wrote to Shirazi for support , and rumours spread that he had ordered a consumer boycott . In December 1891 a fatwa or legal opinion , purportedly from Shirazi , was circulated . It directed all believers to abstain from smoking . As a result , the tobacco boycott quickly spread from Isfahan to the rest of the country . Doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of this fatwa : the evidence appears to be conflicting . Keddie suggests that it may have been written by Mirza Hasan Ashtiyani , the leader of the ulama in Tehran. 11 A later fatwa in Shirazis name , calling for a jihad , was certainly fraudulent , but some people responded by arming themselves. 12 At the end of December , the Shah gave in , and cancelled the tobacco concession . <p> Afghanis machination did not stop , however . In 1892 he addressed appeals to the ulama , calling on them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agreements that the Shah had made with foreign companies . " If you protectors of the faith oppose him with righteousness , and men know that to obey this ( wicked man ) is unlawful according to the religion of God ... they will all hasten and upset the throne of his deceit .... You are the protectors of the Nation and the supporters of the Faith ... to War ! ... to War ! " 13 It is hard not to see a reference to this appeal to the ulama in section 19 of the Sermon on the Art of Governance . Afghani was assisted in his attempts to mobilise the ulama to depose the Shah by Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani , a politically active Azali Babi , and by Mirza Malkum Khan , a complex figure known both as a moderniser and as one of the leading advocates and beneficiaries of granting concessions to foreign investors. 14 <p> The Sermon on the Art of Governance may in part be read as an address by Abdul-Bahato the Bahais and Babis , warning them not to become involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution against the Shah . But it is also in part addressed to the ulama , and particularly to Shirazi , arguing that they should not accept the authority to direct the worldly affairs of the nation , which the reformers were endeavouring to thrust upon them . Where Afghani had asked Shirazi to adopt a position analogous to the Pope , to become a prince of this world , Abdul-Bahapresents an ideal model of the ulama as humble , disdainful of worldly pomp , and devoted to the spiritual welfare of the people . But this requires some further explanation , since Abdul-Baharests his argument not only on the Quran and Islamic traditions , but also on Bahaullahs Kitab-i Ahd and Treatise to the Son of the Wolf . One might well think that the use of texts by Bahaullah would rule out an audience among the Shiah ulama . <p> We have seen above that the efforts by reformers to enlist the ulama in a struggle against the concessions , and later against the Shah , focussed particularly on Muhammad Hasan Shirazi ( 1815-1895 ) , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , and bearing also the titles of Ayatullah and Hujjatul-Islam , was the leading Shiah cleric of his day . Shirazi , however , was a secret Babi and later Bahai . He was a second cousin of the Bab , and was converted to the new Faith in his youth , when he met the Bab in the house of Manuchihr Khan in Isfahan. 15 Thus the man whom the reformers were prompting to assume the position and political powers of the pope and leader ofthe Shiah community , was a secret Babi , and by this time apparently also a Bahai. 16 <p> The situation facing Shirazi was even more complicated than this , for it will be recalled that the Bab had made tobacco and all instruments connected with it haram , forbidden. 17 Implicitly , this means that the trade in tobacco was already " forbidden to believers " to Babis that is . On the other hand , Babi and Bahai teachings endorsed free trade , and the tobacco monopoly and other monopolies granted to European investors were restraints on free trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposing the monopolies , and in a climate in which violence against Europeans and jihad were being threatened , it may have appeared the lesser evil . <p> On the side of the reformers , while Afghani was certainly not a Babi , some of his followers were . In Nikkie Keddies words : <p> An interesting , if obscure , footnote to the story of the tobacco protest is the role played by the Azali branch of the Babi sect , many of whose members engaged in oppositional political activity in this period and through the time of the Constitutional Revolution . Azali Babis were among the editors of Akhtar and among Sayyed Jamal ad-Din al-Afghanis followers , and there were also Babis among the group arrested for sedition in Tehran in the spring of 1891 , though some at least of these were of the Bahai branch . Already at this time there was a decisive political split between the oppositional Azalis and the quietist Bahai branch of the Babis , which continued through the Constitutional Revolution .

Among these enemies of the Government the sect of the Babis is not the least influential element . <p> The Amin-es-Sultan has been careful to explain to me that the Babis are divided into two branches , one of which , the Bahais , are inoffensive , and abstain from any interference in the affairs of State ; whereas the other branch , known as the Azelis , seek for the destruction of all existing institutions , and are similar to the Nihilists in Russia . <p> His Highness has communicated to me a letter addressed to him by the exiled Babis belonging to the Baha branch , who are living at Bombay , expressing their loyalty to the Shah , and pointing to the Sayyid Jmal-ud-Din ( sic ) and his followers as the fomenters of trouble and disaffection. 18 <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading ulama , reformers and journalists who were Babis , Azalis or Bahais , found themselves in a complex web , in which various actors would be pulled in different directions by their attitudes to the Shah and political reform , to tobacco itself , free trade , and European dominance , to Azal and Bahaullah , and by their shared desire for progress and modernisation ( however differently they may have conceived that ) . <p> Finally , the Sermon on the Art of Governance is in part addressed to the Shah and his ministers , and was in fact presented to the Shah and leading notables. 19 An anonymous researcher has pointed out that Mirza badi Bashrni , who visited Haifa in November 1915 , records in his notes that HSji Mirza Haydar Ali told him that the book was revealed in response to a question addressed to Abdul-Baha by Mirza Ali Asghar Khan , who was serving as the chancellor in 1893 .

But from the contents of his reply , it is clear that this was not the primary audience Abdul-Baha had in mind . <p> In addressing the audience at court , Abdul-Bahas purpose was on the one hand to make it clear that the Bahais had nothing to do with those Azalis who were involved in attempts to mount a revolution , and on the other hand to point out that , although the ulama had for a generation been telling the Shah that the new religion was a threat and should be suppressed , it was actually other parties that threatened the throne implicitly referring not only to the reformers , but to some leading anti-Bahai ulama such as -qa Muhammad Najafi . <p> The complexity of the audience explains why Abdul-Baha sometimes addresses himself to the Friends of God with references to Bahaullahs writings , and sometimes uses Quran and hadith references , and employs a style that would be not be out of place if read from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also see why he is careful to distinguish the principle of the institutional separation of the religious and political spheres from anti-clericalism . <p> Leiden , March 2003 <p> ************ <p> On a page preceding the main text in the 1935 ( Tehran ) edition , we find the following : <p> In one of Abdu'l-Bahas tablets he states : <p> The Sermon on the Art of Governance was completed fourteen years ago , copied in the hand of Mushkin-Qalam , and printed and distributed in India . This treatise is sure to be available in Tehran , but I am sending one copy . You may show it to the people at large , because the treatise describes the present widespread damage , corruption and discord in the clearest terms . The treatise outlines the sacred rights of government , and the rights of the people that are to be respected , as well as the relationship between the shepherd and the flock , the ties between the governor and the governed , and the necessary relations between the leader and the led . This is the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent victims . Peace be on those who have followed the right path. 21 <p> Abdu'l-Baha Abbas , 11 Jumadi ul-awwal , 1325 22 June 1907 <p> The following publication details are given by Muhammad Labib , in part below this tablet , in part at the bottom of the last page : <p> In accordance with the permission of the Central Spiritual Assembly , on the basis of an authentic copy printed in India . <p> BE 91 1935 . <p> Published ( by Muhammad Labib ) in Tehran . <p> *** 1 *** <p> He is God . <p> All praise and thanksgiving be to God , who has made the appearance of the sacred perfections of the human realm the foundation of his creation , so that the hidden Godhead may be manifested on the plane of perception , in the form of distinctions and signs , Decrees and Acts , essences and secrets . Thus the rays of the reality of the saying , I was a hidden treasure and desired to be known22 may dawn on the horizon of the visible world . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grandeur who is the sun of truth in the divine world , the most great luminary of the human realm , the seat of the manifestation of the Merciful , and the dawning-place for the signs shining from the presence of the One Being . Through his appearance , the secret of I created the creation , so that I might be known has been confirmed on the plain of Witness . <p> You see the earth lifeless : when we let rain descend upon it , it stirs and swells , and produces plants from all the pairs , causing rejoicing. 23 <p> *** 2 *** <p> In these days and times , certain events that are contrary to all religious laws , things that destroy human institutions and undermine the divine edifice , 24 have been brought about by some ignorant , foolish people and by rebels and those who love discord . They have taken God 's clear Faith as a pretext and have stirred up a seditious commotion . They have dishonoured the people of Iran in the eyes of all the nations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherds , but have the characters of wolves ; they recite the Qur'pn , and wish to behave like wild animals . They have a human form , but they prefer the manners of beasts . And when it is said to them , " Do no mischief on the earth " they say , " We only want to make peace " Truly , they are the ones who make mischief , but they do not realise it. 25Therefore it has become necessary to briefly clarify the most basic fundamentals of the divine teachings to remind the friends to be alert and watchful . <p> *** 3 *** <p> It is evident , and indisputable , that all beings , in their inherent disposition and natural created form , possess the power and capacity to manifest two kinds of perfections . One is inborn perfections : these are solely the divine creation , without any intermediary . The other kind is acquired perfections , which are dependant on the education of a true Master . Consider the things that exist in this world : the trees , flowers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift of God . In addition to this , there is a vigour in growth and an indescribable sweetness of flavour that become evident through the attentions of a careful gardener . For , if left to itself , the garden would turn into jungle and undergrowth . The flowers and blossoms would not open , the tree would give no fruit and would be fit for burning . But when it comes under the training and care of a master , it becomes a garden , a rose-bower , or an orchard . Blossoms and fruit appear , and the face of the earth is adorned with flowers and fragrant herbs . It is the same with human societies and social structures : if left in their natural condition , people would swarm like vermin , and would be considered as beasts and predators . They would learn ferocity , cruelty and bloodthirstiness , and be consumed in the flames of disobedience and forbidden things . <p> *** 4 *** <p> Human beings are children , studying in the school of the world , but they fall i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holy figures , the prophets and holy ones , are the professors in the academy of God and the doctors in the hospital of the Lord . They are messengers of grace , and suns in the highest sphere of guidance . Through them , the radiant flame of spiritual and outward perfection , that has cooled and died within the lamp of human reality , may be reignited from the blazing fire of God. 26 Chronic diseases become as nothing through the over-flowing grace of the All-Merciful and the spirit of the Messiah . <p> Thus it has been demonstrated with the clearest of proofs that human society requires the training and cultivation of a true master , and that human souls need a governor , one who binds and restrains , prohibits and encourages , one who impels and leads . For the garden of his creation can not attain beauty , delicacy and plenty except through the training of the kindly gardener , the overflowing bounty from the realm of unicity , and the just governance provided by the government . <p> *** 5 *** <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading and impelling , is divided into two types . The first protector and restrainer is the power of governance that is related to the physical world , a power that guarantees happiness in the external aspects of human existence . It safeguards human life , property and honour , and the exalted quality and refined virtues of the social life of this illustrious race . Just monarchs , accomplished representatives , wise ministers , and intrepid military leaders constitute the executive centre in this power of governance , the axis of the wheel of these divine favours . <p> *** 6 *** <p> The second type of educator and governor of the human world is sacred and spiritual power : the heavenly Books that have been sent down , the prophets of God , and spiritual souls and devout religious leaders . For those in whom revelation descends and divine inspiration arises are the educators of hearts and minds , the correctors of morals . they beautify conduct and encourage the faithful . That is , these holy souls are like spiritual powers . They have freed human souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wicked qualities , and the coarseness of the worlds of being . They illuminate the realities of human nature with the lights of the virtues of the human world , with divine distinctions and the virtues and excellencies of the Kingdom , so that the radiant reality of Blessed be God , the best of creators , 28 and the virtue of We have created man according to the best pattern29 might be realised in the hallowed human person . thus , through the glorious effulgences of these dawning-places of the divine verses , the pure and subtle reality of humanity becomes a focus for manifestations of the holiness of the world of God . <p> These sacred duties are rooted in spiritual , divine matters , and in ethical considerations . They have not been linked with material honours , political affairs or worldly matters . On the contrary , the sacred power of these pure and excellent persons is at work within the reality of the soul and conscience , in the inner heart and spirit , and not in water and clay . The banners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open spaces of the soul , where the spirit takes wing , not in this world of dust . they have never had any role to play in questions of the government and the governed , of ruling and being ruled . They are ones chosen by the sweet-scented breezes of God , the ones closest to the overflowing waters of the spirit of eternity . They do not seek any role in other matters , and they do not urge the steed of ambition in the arena of greed and power . For matters of politics and government , of the kingdom and of subjects have a specified source and a respected place to which they refer , while guidance , religion , insight , education , and the promotion of the morals and virtues of humanity have a sacred centre and designated spring . These souls have nothing to do with political affairs , nor do they seek any involvement . <p> Now , in this most great cycle , when the world has reached the age of discretion and maturity , this matter has been made indisputable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm foundation . According to this incontrovertible text and this brilliant proof , all must be humble and submit to the commands of the government , all should be compliant and obedient before the throne of sovereignty . That is , in their obedience and servitude to rulers , they should be sincere subjects and willing servants . This is what the Beauty of God , whose decree is decisive , whose dawn is clear , and whose morn is true and shining , has commanded in the book of the covenant and the pledge , the eternal pact . The indisputable command is this : <p> *** 7 *** <p> O ye the loved ones and the trustees of God ! Kings are the manifestations of the power , and the daysprings of the might and riches , of God . Pray ye on their behalf . He hath invested them with the rulership of the earth and hath singled out the hearts of men as His Own domain . Conflict and contention are categorically forbidden in His Book . This is a decree of God in this Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is invested by Him with the splendour of His confirmation . Verily He is the All-Knowing , the All-Wise . It is incumbent upon everyone to aid those daysprings of authority and sources of command who are adorned with the ornament of equity and justice. 30 <p> *** 8 *** <p> The same is found in an unambiguous treatise that he addressed to one of the religious leaders . One choice citation from that blessed treatise is this : <p> *** 9 *** <p> It is now incumbent upon His Majesty the Shah -- may God , exalted be He , protect him -- to deal with this people with loving-kindness and mercy . This Wronged One pledgeth Himself , before the Divine Kaaba , that , apart from truthfulness and trustworthiness , this people will show forth nothing that can in any way conflict with the world-adorning views of His Majesty . Every nation must have a high regard for the position of its sovereign , must be submissive unto him , must carry out his behests , and hold fast his authority . The sovereigns of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandeur and the majesty of God . This Wronged One hath at no time dealt deceitfully with anyone . Every one is well aware of this , and beareth witness unto it . Regard for the rank of sovereigns is divinely ordained , as is clearly attested by the words of the Prophets of God and His chosen ones . He Who is the Spirit ( Jesus ) -- may peace be upon Him -- was asked : " O Spirit of God ! Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not ? " And He made reply : " Yea , render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's and to God the things that are God's. " 31 He forbade it not . These two sayings are , in the estimation of men of insight , one and the same , for if that which belonged to Caesar had not come from God , He would have forbidden it . And likewise in the sacred verse : " Obey God and obey the Apostle , and those among you invested with authority . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more especially the Imams --the blessings of God rest upon them ! They , verily , are the manifestations of the power of God , and the sources of His authority , and the repositories of His knowledge , and the daysprings of His commandments . Secondarily these words refer unto the kings and rulers -- those through the brightness of whose justice the horizons of the world are resplendent and luminous . We fain would hope that His Majesty the Shah will shine forth with a light of justice whose radiance will envelop all the kindreds of the earth . It is incumbent upon every one to beseech the one true God on his behalf for that which is meet and seemly in this day . <p> O God , my God , and my Master , and my Mainstay , and my Desire , and my Beloved ! I ask Thee by the mysteries which were hid in Thy knowledge , and by the signs which have diffused the fragrance of Thy loving-kindness , and by the billows of the ocean of Thy bounty , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood spilt in Thy path , and by the hearts consumed in their love for Thee , to assist His Majesty the Shah with Thy power and Thy sovereignty , that from him may be manifested that which will everlastingly endure in Thy Books , and Thy Scriptures , and Thy Tablets . Hold Thou his hand , O my Lord , with the hand of Thine omnipotence , and illuminate him with the light of Thy knowledge , and adorn him with the adornment of Thy virtues . Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee , and in Thy grasp are the reins of all created things . No God is there but Thee , the Ever-Forgiving , the All-Bounteous . <p> In the Epistle to the Romans Saint Paul hath written : " Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . For there is no power but of God ; the powers that beare ordained of God . Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God . " And further : " For he is the minister of God , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 33 He saith that the appearance of the kings , and their majesty and power are of God . <p> Moreover , in the traditions of old , references have been made which the divines have seen and heard . We beseech God blessed and glorified be He to aid thee , O Shaykh , to lay fast hold on that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of God , the Lord of the worlds. 34 <p> *** 10 *** <p> Therefore , O friends of God , strive with heart and soul . Show to the world the miraculous power of your pure and genuine intentions , in good will to the government and obedience to the state . This command is the most important of the duties of the manifest religion and the decisive texts of the Heavenly Book . <p> It is evident that the government , by nature , desires the security and ease of the subjects , and seeks the prosperity and happiness of the people . It is ready and willing to safeguard the just rights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repel the wicked intruder . For the honour and prosperity of the subjects is the dignity , grandeur and power of the glorious monarchy and the triumphant state , the success and happiness of the people is the object of the attention of their royal highnesses . This is so , according to the nature of things . <p> When , on the contrary , the outcome is a decline in the security of the people or a deficiency in the prosperity and happiness of high and low , the cause is a lack of ability on the part of functionaries , or the extreme despotism and barbarity of ill-willed people , who appear in the robes of learning and are experts in the arts of ignorance , and from first to last are instigators of disorder . Disorder was sleeping , may God curse the one who woke it . <p> *** 11 *** <p> For fifty years , in the streets and from pulpits , and in councils and gatherings in the presence of government officials , this gaggle of imbeciles -- that is , the clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They go so far as to falsely accuse them of revolt . They say , <p> " This community are destroyers of the world , <p> they are debasing the morals of the children of Adam . <p> they entice the regions to be disloyal <p> and are pernicious in every respect . <p> They are the flag of rebellion , <p> and the standard of insurgency , <p> Adversaries to religion and government , <p> and enemies of the souls of the subjects . " <p> God 's justice demands that the truth about every community and group should become manifest and clear , so that it may be evident in the councils of the world who acts in the best interests of the people , and who is the corrupter. who is stirring up sedition , and which group are the mischief makers ? And God distinguishes the corruptor from the one who acts in the best interests of the people. 35 <p> Now , O friends of God , give thanks for His providence , because the true Just One has lifted the veil from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of souls have become as manifest as the gleaming star . Praise be to God ! and again , thanks be to God ! <p> *** 12 *** <p> The fact is , that the functions of the religious leaders and the duties of experts in religious law are to keep watch over spiritual matters and to spread abroad the virtues of the Merciful . Whenever the leaders of the manifest religion , the pillars of religious law , have sought a role in the political sphere , have issued opinions and taken control , the unity of the believers in the one true God has been dissolved , and schisms have encompassed the community of the faithful . <p> The flames of sedition flare up , <p> the fires of revolt burn the world . <p> The kingdom is plundered and pillaged , <p> the people are as vassals , in bondage to the oppressors . <p> At the time of the last Safavid kings37 ( may the Lord of Creation have mercy on them ) , the religious leaders sought to participate in Iranian politics . They raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and opened the door . The unfortunate outcome of that movement became the occasion of harm and the cause of ruin . The land of Iran became a jousting field for the Turkoman tribes and the arena for Afghan raiding and conquest . <p> The blessed earth of Iran was exploited by neighbouring peoples , <p> the lands of glory were fallen into the hands of strangers . <p> The triumphant state was erased , <p> a brilliant dynasty passed into oblivion . <p> Oppressors extended their tyrannous hands , <p> malevolent people plotted , against property , honour and life itself . <p> People were killed , <p> properties plundered . <p> Great men were seized by force , <p> and great estates were stolen . <p> The cultivated lands of Persia were laid to waste : <p> demons reclined on the throne of the kings . <p> The reins of government held in the talons of beasts , <p> and the royal family enchained , <p> or under the sword of bloodthirsty nomads , <p> and the little children as captives . <p> These were the fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in political matters . <p> *** 13 *** <p> On another occasion , at the beginning of the reign of Aqa Muhammad Khan , 38 the religious leaders of the people again made a move in political matters , and scattered the ashes of humiliation over the heads of Iranians . <p> They issued opinions regarding the succession to the throne , <p> they sang a siren song that confused the minds of the people . <p> They incited turmoil and commotion , <p> they raised the flag of revolt . <p> A hurricane wind of rebellion sprang up , <p> the customs of sedition and discord gained the upper hand . <p> Anarchy and chaos ensued , <p> a wave of unrest reached to the highest heavens . <p> The chiefs of the tribes pretended to be kings , <p> sowing the seeds of enmity in the rich soil of the kingdom , <p> and one sought to kill another . <p> Peace and security were forgotten , <p> covenant and treaty had no effect . <p> Neither lifelife nor property remained , <p> there was no security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive events at Kirman took place. 39 The dust of disorder and rebellion settled , and for the people of sin there was cutting off at the root , 40 that is , the root of the corruptors was pulled out . <p> *** 14 *** <p> A third such incident occurred during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah : 41 <p> The best example of all is the sad case of the last days of the late Sultan Abdulaziz48 ( may his soul rest in peace ) , as follows : <p> The spiritual leaders of the Ottoman people began a rebellion , <p> they raised the banner of enmity . <p> In their madness , they started a movement <p> they wanted a role and a share in running affairs . <p> They stirred up unrest , and provoked a dispute with government officials . <p> They took for their pretext the manifest Faith and the God-given Law , <p> they spoke of " the good of the nation , " <p> and demanded the dismissal of Ministers . <p> They destroyed the foundations of fairness and chivalry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they made the malicious ones happy . <p> They made trustworthy people the object of public anger , <p> and turned traitors into popular favourites . <p> And when their strategy was succeeding <p> they presented another plan . <p> They challenged the throne of the sultanate , <p> belittled the ruler and government . <p> They issued a fatwa that spoke of depose , <p> and sought to extirpate and suppress . <p> They disgraced the name of chivalry , <p> and raised up the dust of tyranny . <p> They approved of a violent deed that disgraced the perspicuous faith and the law of the Lord of the Messengers . Because of this movement , regret and sorrow burned in the breasts of the world 's inhabitants , and the hearts of the world and its peoples were seared , for the wrong done to that great ruler . <p> retribution personified , and the humiliation of the government and the people . <p> The earth was stained with the blood of the innocent , <p> the bodies of the dead made the field of battle a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted the cup of affliction , <p> three hundred thousand young men of the nation , <p> three hundred thousand youth of the empire , <p> tasted the poison of death . <p> How many great monuments were razed to the ground , <p> how many old families faced extinction or poverty ! <p> Of thousands of well-ordered villages , nothing remained but the cellars , <p> the crop-growing regions were turned into wastelands . <p> The contents of treasuries thrown to the winds , <p> the wealth of the state and the people , plundered and gone . <p> A million subjects were forced into exile , leaving the lands that they knew . <p> A multitude of the chief men of the kingdom , the notables of these provinces , having been deprived of everything , fled the nest . Children of tender years and old men bearing the weight of the years wandered in the wilderness and the desert , completely destitute . At the first setback , the quarrelsome religious leaders who had raised the cry of " War , to war ! " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where can we hide , where can we flee ? " At the smallest encounter they forgot about great rewards and glorious recompense : they turned and fled , and they harvested this colossal catastrophe. 51 <p> Gracious God ! Shall a people who are not able to manage their own little nests , or to instruct their own households , who are unaware of domestic and foreign affairs , shall these interfere in the weighty affairs of the kingdom and its subjects , and raise opposition in the complexities of political matters ? If you refer to history , you would find countless examples of this sort , all based on the involvement of religious leaders in political matters . These souls are the fountainhead of the interpretation of Gods commandments , not of implementation . That is , when the government requests an explanation concerning the requirements of the Law of God and the realities of the divine ordinances , in principle or in a specific case , they must explain what they have deduced from the commands of God and what is in accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they have of questions of leadership and social development , the administration and control of weighty matters , the welfare and prosperity of the kingdom , the improvement of procedures and codes of law , or foreign affairs and domestic policy ? <p> Likewise , in all previous ages and eras , the sources of opposition to the friends of God , and of disputation with those who believed in the divine verses , have been certain individuals who have been outwardly graced with the jewel of knowledge , but piety and the fear52 of God have faded from their hearts . They are learned in form , and ignorant in truth , devout of speech but deniers at heart , devotees in the flesh , but lifeless in spirit . <p> For example , in the days when the One who bestowed the spirit , the Messiah , was giving life to the body of the world , when the holy and fragrant Christ-spirit was granting the contingent world a soul , the religious leaders of the children of Israel such as Anas and Caiaphas voiced their opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praiseworthy spirit . They turned their backs on him , declaring him to be no true believer , seeking to destroy him , and they persecuted him and issued a licence to harm him . They punished the apostles and inflicted the most severe punishment and vengeance . They issued fatwas of death , and imprisoned and exiled them . They used torture and pain , they martyred them with the worst afflictions and caused their pure blood to flow in the path of God . This opposition , harshness , punishment and torment were all due to the religious leaders of the community . <p> *** 16 *** <p> Similarly , consider the days of that mystery of existence , the promised beauty who has been confirmed in the dignity of the praised one , Muhammad , the Messenger of God , peace be upon him . Those argumentative and proud people who opposed and rejected him were the learned among the Jews , intransigent Christian divines , and ignorant and envious soothsayers such as Abu -mir Rahib , Kab ibn Ashraf , Nadr ibn Harith , -s ibn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 These leaders of the community engaged in anathematising and reviling , striking and killing , that rising54 sun of prophethood . They were so fanatical in injuring the one who was the lamp in the assembly of humanity that he voiced a complaint , saying , " No prophet has been persecuted as I have been persecuted . " <p> Consider , then , that in every dispensation and age , the injustice , persecution and restrictions , the most severe cruelty and unprecedented oppression , have come from some faithless divines . Moreover , whenever the government has offered opposition or55 has been biased , it has all been as a result of the defamatory innuendos , signs and winks of these rebellious individuals . Likewise , in these days , if you look carefully , the things that have occurred have been due to the opposition of unjust religious leaders , who are shut out from the fear of God , and are far from the Law of God , and who seethe with the fire of envy and jealousy . <p> *** 17 *** <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , <p> each one is a mercy from the Lord and a gift of God . <p> They are a candle for guidance and a lantern of Gods grace , <p> the lightning bolt of truth and the guardians of the law . <p> They are the scales of justice and the sovereigns of trustworthiness . <p> They are the true dawn and the towering palm , <p> the bright star , and a planet clearly seen . <p> They are the fountainhead of mystical insight , <p> the spreading of the sweet waters of life . <p> They are the educators of souls <p> they bring glad tidings to the hearts . <p> They are a guide to the nations , <p> the heralds of God among the children of Adam . <p> They are the greatest sign and the loftiest banner , <p> the jewels of being and the Graces of existence . <p> They are the manifestations of detachment , <p> the dawning place of the sun of sanctity . <p> This ephemeral mortal existence has no attractions for them , <p> they hold themselves apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the initiates of mysteries , and the commanders of the company of the pious . <p> They turn the private chapel , where dhikr is chanted , <p> into a cloister in the Kingdom of heaven ( malakut ) . <p> They consider the surrender of all that is other , <p> as attainment to the threshold of divinity ( lahut ) . <p> If they are not like this , they are as lifeless bodies and images on walls . As it is written in the authoritative text of the Qur'an , " And God has led him astray by means of some knowledge . " 59 <p> *** 18 *** <p> Human collective life naturally entails a need for binding rules and relationships , for without these ties , no protection or security can be attained , 60 there can be no sociability61 or happiness . The sacred dignity of human beings would not be unveiled , the face of the desire of all hearts would remain concealed . The country and regions would not be cultivated , there could be no structure62 and system in cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , and the human race would not be able to wax and mature . Repose for the soul and tranquillity of conscience would not be possible . The distinctive human attributes would not shine , and the candle of God 's bestowals would give no light . The human essence would not discover the reality of the contingent world , or become aware of Gods universal wisdom . The glorious arts would not be spread abroad , and great discoveries would not yield their benefits . This house of clay would not be the observatory of the heavens , and industry and inventions would not amaze the mind . The east and west of the world could not be drawn together , and the power of steam could not connect the continents . <p> These rules and relationships that comprise the foundation for the edifice of happiness , and are the medium of grace , are the religious law and a social system . These are the guardian of prosperity , the guarantor of good repute , the preserver of the humane quality of life . If you study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , it will be evident that the religious law and social system are necessary relationships that derive from the realities of things . If it was not so , there could be no order in collective life , no reason for tranquillity , and no happiness for human society . For the collective condition is analogous to a human person . Because it has been composed from individual substances and diverse opposing and contradictory elements , it is inevitably subject to accidents and illnesses . Whenever it is thrown into disorder because of deficiencies , a skilful doctor and superior physician must diagnose the disease , and then explain its cause . The doctor must consider the essentials and the details of the illness and the requirements of Nature , giving attention to causes and consequences , and to the means and necessities , and distinguishing between particulars and universals . Then the doctor considers what the exigencies and requirements of this disease are , and he begins treatment and effects a cure . <p> From this it is clear that the effective treatment and medication comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the illness . In the same way , social life and the body of the world are subject to systemic disorders , and are under the sway of various illnesses . The religious law , the social order , and commandments are like a powerful remedy and a cure for the creatures . <p> Could any knowledgeable person imagine that he , by himself , has discovered the chronic diseases of the world and is aware of the various disorders and accidents of contingent existence , that he can diagnose the infirmities of the people of the earth and can explain the painful condition of human society , or that he can uncover the hidden secrets of the ages , to such an extent that he penetrates to the necessary connections originating in the realities of things , 63 and so establish that system and those regulations that constitute a swift remedy and a complete cure ? There is no doubt that this is absurd and impossible . Now , it is evident and proven that the founder of the commandments , system , religious law and regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For none but the exalted Lord is aware and informed of the realities of existence , the particularities of every being , and the hidden mysteries and guarded enigmas of ages and centuries . This is why the laws of European countries , which are in fact the product of several thousand years of thought on the part of experts in administration and law , nevertheless remain incomplete and imperfect , and subject to change , repeal and correction , because the learned men of the past had not discovered the unsuitability of some regulations , whereas later scholars became aware of it . Therefore , they have corrected some laws , reaffirmed some , and replaced a few , and this continues . <p> Let us return to the main topic : <p> the religious law is like the spirit of life , <p> the government is the locus of the force of deliverance . <p> The religious law is the shining sun , <p> and government is the clouds of April . <p> These two bright stars are like twin lights in the heavens of the contingent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the world . <p> One has illuminated the world of the soul , <p> the other caused the earth to flower . <p> One sowed pearls in the oceans of conscience , <p> while the other made the surface of the earth a garden of paradise . <p> It has turned this mound of dust into the envy of the heavens , <p> and made this dark house of shadows the cynosure of the world of lights . <p> The cloud of mercy rose , the gentle rain of benevolence came down , <p> the fragrant breeze of grace diffused musk and ambergris . <p> The dawn breeze blows , wafting the perfume that quickens the soul . <p> The face of the earth has become like heaven on high , <p> the agreeable season of spring has arrived . <p> The showers of the heavenly spring have conferred <p> a wondrous freshness on the garden of the world . <p> the sun of ancient grandeur has lavished new radiance <p> on the horizon of the contingent world . <p> The tawny dust has been turned into sandalwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rose arbour of the Merciful , <p> the flowering garden of illumination . <p> The point is this , that each of these two signs of grandeur is the aid and assistant of the other , like milk and honey , or the twins of Gemini in the sky . Thus , contempt for one is betrayal of the other , and any negligence in obedience to one is sinful rebellion against the other . <p> *** 19 *** <p> The divine Law ( which is the life of existence , the light of the visible world , and is consistent with the purpose of creation ) needs an effective power and decisive means . A clearly identifiable champion is required , a resolute propagator is needed . There is no doubt that the institutions of government and the sword of sovereignty are the source of this mighty power . When the one has been strong and victorious , the other was manifest and refulgent . Whenever the first is elevated and radiant , the second has been resplendent and widely diffused . Thus , a just government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-ordered realm is a universal blessing . The royal throne is encompassed with divine confirmations , and the royal crown is adorned with the gems of heavenly bounty . In the Quran it is clearly written , " Say : O God , Lord of sovereignty , you grant sovereignty to whoever you will , and you take it from whoever you please . " 64 Therefore , it is clear and evident that this bestowal is a divine gift and a favour from the Lord . Likewise , it is clearly said in an authentic tradition that " The king is the shadow of God on earth . " 65 Given the existence of these texts , which are like a solid foundation , any other talk , of the king being " an usurper who imposes " is evidently futile speculation and sheer imagination without argument or proof . <p> Note that in the scriptural verse and the clear tradition , the statements are absolute and not bounded : it is a general reference and not a specific matter . <p> However , the dignity of the Imams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of grandeur , is the honour and respect due to holiness . <p> Their prerogative is the patronage of the All-Merciful , <p> their garland of glory is the dust in the path of the Merciful , <p> their gleaming crown is the lights of the bounty of God . <p> Their seat of justice is the throne-room of the hearts , <p> their sublime and glorious throne is this , <p> that they are faithful to the world of the Kingdom . <p> They are lords of the worlds of life and soul , <p> and not of water and clay . <p> They are kings of the realms of immeasurable space , <p> not of the straight places of this contingent world . <p> No-one can usurp or plunder <p> this glorious station , this ancient honour . <p> Yet in the human world their throne is the mat , their seat of high honour is the row of shoes. 66 The pinnacle of prestige for them is the lowest rank of servitude , and the court of their sovereignty is some secluded corner . They see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intolerable nuisance . They know that wealth and riches are toil and sorrow , and a great entourage is a burden to the soul . Like grateful birds in this house of vanity , they are satisfied with a few grains . In the arbour of " God is One " , at the tip of the branch of detachment , they busy themselves with singing the virtues and praises of the Ancient and the Living in an eloquent tongue . <p> In short , the point of that which has been expressed in the clear verse and sound tradition is that kingship is the gift of the Lord of grandeur , and government is a mercy from the Lord of divinity. 67 The object of such gradations is that68 perfect rulers and just kings , out of gratitude for this gift of God and these glorious marks of favour , should be justice incarnate and wisdom personified . They should be bounty unalloyed and the very picture of generosity , the sun of loving kindness and the clouds of compassion , the banner of the Lord , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 69 The government , the defender of the people , is worthy of obedience , and obedience to it leads to nearness to God. 70 The justice of God requires the observation of mutual rights , and the divine law is the preservation of distinct ranks . The governed have the right to protection and consideration from the governor , the ruled have a right to security and kind treatment from the ruler . Subjects are under the protective guardianship of kings , and the common folk are under the protective shadow of the monarch , who dispenses justice . Every shepherd is responsible for his flock. 71 This , so that government might be a sure fortress for the people , and a cave of assurance , an inviolable sanctuary and a refuge in a high place , preserving and protecting the rights of subjects and of all creatures with all its powers , observing and promoting the dignity and happiness of subjects and subordinates , for the people are a trust from God , and the poor are a charge from the Lord of unicity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loyalty have been decreed for subjects . They must be upright in their duties as subordinates , and sincere in their service . Good intentions and gratitude are obligatory , to the extent that they pay their property taxes with unmixed gratitude , and bear the annual levies willingly . They must exert themselves to increase the loftiness of the dignity of kings , and give generously of their wealth and lives in support of the power of government and to increase the glory of the royal throne . <p> The state and the government are like the head and the brain . The people and subjects are like limbs , hands and feet , the pillars and parts of the body . When the head and the brain ( which are the centre of the senses and faculties , the managers of the whole body and all of its limbs ) , when these have effective power and complete authority , they make guardianship their motto and provide for the means of security . They organise the necessary pre-requisites and ensure the desired results and consequences . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed of ease and in the greatest peace . <p> But if there is any slackening in their effective control , <p> any deficiency in their power , <p> the kingdom of the body becomes a wasteland <p> the corporeal realm knows neither safety nor security . <p> A thousand ills of various sorts gain the ascendant , <p> the well-being and repose of all its parts are broken . <p> Likewise , when the governments power is effective and its orders prevail , <p> the kingdom will be embellished , the people will be at peace . <p> But if its power slackens , an earthquake shakes <p> the structures of the peoples well-being and comfort , <p> and down they come . <p> For the required constraint and restraint , the harness and reins , <p> the night watchman and sentinel , is government . <p> When the government is a shepherd to the people , <p> and the people take on the duties of citizens , <p> the ties that bind them are put in order , <p> the links of solidarity are strengthened . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people are brought together and anchored in one point , one eminent individual , and there is no doubt that it attains the greatest possible potency . When the rays of the sun fall on the surface of a curved magnifying73 glass , all the heat is concentrated at the focal point of that glass , and such efficacy , penetration and combustive power result that any obdurately solid body placed before this point must melt , even if it can endure fire . <p> Consider : the subjects of every resplendent government and victorious empire enjoy the utmost honour and well-being . The dependents and ordinary folk in every great and respected country are extremely well treated . They advance rapidly in every respect , they progress steadily in learning and wealth , in commerce and in industry . This is evident and accepted , beyond any doubt or ambiguity , among all the wise and learned . <p> O friends of God ! Open the ears of wisdom , shun those who love discord . If you detect the odour of villainy from any person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , know that he sets out to deceive powerful men , and opposes the order of the possessor of Majesty . He is an enemy of God , a destroyer of foundations , a breaker of the covenant and treaty , an outcast from the court of the Merciful . <p> A person who is knowledgeable and intelligent is like a radiant lamp , a cause of happiness and virtue in the greater and lesser world . Such a person works for the well-being and peace of the people of the world , in accordance with the doctrine and covenant . <p> O Friends of God , the divine order is in the epoch of youth , <p> the wondrous Cause in the season of spring . <p> The modern age is the first sign of growth . <p> This age is the chosen age of the one true God . <p> The horizons of the contingent world are radiant , resplendent , <p> lit by the sun of mystical knowledge . <p> The east and the west of the world , <p> in the fragrant breezes of holiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new creation is most comely and fair , <p> the body of the wonderful Cause is flexible and strong . <p> Listen with understanding to the counsels and precepts of God , and then , in all sincerity , demonstrate your high calling through a natural74 genuineness , an upright disposition , and good will to the authorities. 75 In this way it will become clear and established in world society and in the council of nations that you are76 the shining candle of the world of humanity and the rose in the garden of the divine realm . Mere speech yields no harvest , and the sapling of hope has no fruit . It is necessary to arise and set to work . Potentially , all things are laid ready , all things are completed . Some are easy to accomplish and others are difficult . But what is this worth ? The human person must , in actuality , become the sign of the All-Merciful and the banner of generosity77 of the Lord . <p> 1 See Abdu'l-Hamid Ishraq-Khavari , Bahai Encyclopaedia ( available on-line at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Risalih .

( Balyuzi , Eminent Bahais , page 259 . In his Refutation of the Materialists , Afghani adopts a similar tactic : he presents himself as the orthodox Muslim and progressive Muslim thinkers as apostates . ) In the circumstances , there was not the slightest possibility that Shirazi would cooperate with the revolutionary plans of Afghani and Mirza Malkum Khan . <p> 20Piyam-i Bahai , No. 275 , October 2002 , page 22 and page 27 note 2 . The article supposes that Abdul-Bahas tablet of1912 which is printed as a preface in the Tehran edition is also addressed to Mirza Ali Asghar Khan , but this can not be correct : it is addressed to Muhammad Labib himself or at any rate to a Bahai in or near Tehran who has asked permission to publish the Sermon on Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated from the Arabic . Here Abdu'l-Baha cites a well-known hadith qudsi , an Islamic tradition in which the words are supposed to be spoken by God . In B.

The former is used by Abdul-Baha , in the sense of ill-fortunes ( Tehran edition page 21 ) , but in this case I believe the Bombay edition is closer to the truth . <p> 34 Abdu'l-Baha cites Baha'u'llah 's Epistle to the Son of the Wolf . The authorised translation used here is by Shoghi Effendi Rabbani ( Wilmette , Ill. : Baha'i Publishing Trust , 1971 ) , in which this passage appears at pp. 8991 . <p> 36 From a ghazal by Hafez concerning a hypocritical sufi .

Arjomand. , The Shadow of God and the Hidden Imam , 191 ) <p> 49 The reference may well be to the brutal suppression of a rising in Bulgaria . <p> 50Cole reads surur , the delight of nations , Dreyfus reads sarvar , leadership . Both are possible , but the latter is in accordance with the preceding lines which refer to the belief that God has destined the Muslims to rule over other peoples . The position of ila itlaq at the end of the sentence could mean that it modifies the whole preceding phrase : over the peoples and nations , without exception , but its position is determined by the demands of the rhyme . I have read it as applying particularly to sarvar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required no further explanation . The Eastern Crisis of 1875-8 began with the revolt of Christian peasants in Bosnia-Hercegovina , followed by a rising in Bulgaria which was suppressed with great cruelty . Serbia entered the war with Russian backing . Initial Ottoman victories and a settlement under the auspices of the European powers was unsatisfactory to Russia , and in 1877 Russia launched a war on her own account . The war in fact lasted some ten months , ending with the Ottomans forced to accept terms dictated by the Russians , which involved the loss of four provinces to the Russians and the independence of Romania , Serbia and Montenegro . This is the catastrophe to which Abdul-Baha refers . <p> 52 The Bombay edition has hashiya , which must be a copyists error for khashiya , as found in the Tehran edition . <p> 53Abu -mir Rahib fought against the prophet , and became a hypocrite , a believer of dubious sincerity .

He accused Muhammad of merely repeating stories he had heard from others .

Khoi and San communities have formed their own advocacy organizations to ensure land and resource rights and have partnered with international " First Peoples " groups to further their aims . The extent to which Khoisan issues have been acknowledged in the new South African political and cultural agenda can be seen in the incorporation of San rock art and the /Xam language in the new national coat of arms , the 1996 Miscast exhibit at the National Gallery in Cape Town , and the 1999 land claim finding that returned sixty-five thousand hectares of land in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park to the dispersed Khomani San who had been evicted in 1931. 1 On December 16 , 2007 , a memorial commemorating the major conflicts that shaped South Africa 's history called S'khumbuto ( or place of remembrance in siSwati ) opened to the South African public as part of the national Freedom Park . S'khumbuto was designed to " bear testimony to the various conflicts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives for humanity and freedom . " 2 S'khumbuto includes a " Wall of Names , " 697 meters in length and inscribed with the names of people who died during eight conflicts : the precolonial wars , slavery , wars of resistance , the South African War , two world wars , the struggle for liberation , and , most relevant to this discussion , genocide . <p> Despite these public gestures , the destruction of some of southern Africa 's original inhabitants--the Cape San--has generated little public or scholarly debate in South Africa , especially in comparison to the colonial settler extermination of indigenous peoples in the United States and Australia . Mohamed Adhikari 's The Anatomy of a South African Genocide is not just a much-needed synthesis of scholarly knowledge on the colonial encounter between the European settlers and the San hunter-gatherers of the Cape interior . Adhikari , a historian at the University of Cape Town who has written extensively on Coloured South Africans , 3 compellingly argues that the annihilation of the Cape San societies during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries constitutes genocide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of the Cape San as genocide , but none explicitly analyze it as such . Adhikari thus makes a welcome contribution to the literature . <p> To make this case , Adhikari opens the book with a definition of genocide that is more stringent than that of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( 1948 ) , as outlined by Article II , the " intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such " ( p. 14 ) . Adhikari instead weighs his evidence against the following definition : " Genocide is the intentional physical destruction of a social group in its entirety , or the intentional annihilation of such a significant part of the group that it is no longer able to reproduce itself biologically or culturally , nor sustain an independent economic existence " ( p. 12 ) . For nonspecialists in genocide studies , Adhikari includes several alternative definitions of genocide . Disappointingly , he does not elaborate on his own choice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of near-total physical annihilation . But this strict definition makes Adhikari 's argument all the more compelling as he provides evidence for even this demanding interpretation . <p> In chapters 1 through 3 , Adhikari draws on colonial sources and secondary scholarship to concisely synthesize the violent nature of the colonial encounter between the Cape San societies , on the one hand , and both the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and British administrations , on the other . He describes two cycles of violence as characteristic of this encounter . The first and immediate cycle was characterized by the encroachment of the original Dutch settlers ( the migrant farmers known as trekboers ) , San retaliation , and trekboer retribution . The longer-term cycle across the eighteenth century was one of trekboers encroaching in phases further into the interior . By the start of European colonization in southern Africa , the San had been forced into the interior by Khoi pastoralists and Bantu-speaking farmers . After the VOC set up a refreshment station at the tip of southern Africa in 1652 , the colony began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural needs of the settlement . <p> As the Dutch-speaking settlers pushed back the frontier , they increasingly came into contact and conflict with groups of the displaced San . The trekboers established farms around springs and water holes and controlled expanses of land disproportionate to their numbers . This encroachment caused the San to both withdraw further into the interior and ferociously resist . Withdrawal meant moving to less hospitable terrain and abandoning land with sacred and ritual significance . Thus , resistance became increasingly common as the San raided and killed settler stock , slayed herders , and destroyed crops and homesteads . Adhikari draws out the tenacity and ferocity of San opposition despite limited source material and without romanticizing their response . He tells the story of one San leader , Koerikei , who evaded the commando of David Schalk van der Merwe and stood taunting the militia from a cliff . San bands raided alone , in larger groups , in cooperation with dispossessed Khoi , and occasionally in collaboration with Khoisan farm servants . While initial San attacks were sporadic and small in scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the San were no match for the firepower of the settlers , that the San consisted of large numbers of small social units spread out over a vast territory enabled them to resist and survive throughout the eighteenth century . <p> Adhikari shows how this continuous San aggression shaped the responses of the settlers and colonial administration . The commando became the " main institution of military force at the Cape under Dutch rule and the main instrument of war against indigenous peoples " ( p. 39 ) . These retaliatory raids by armed , mounted militia units evolved through the eighteenth century to meet the military needs of trekboer society and became an accepted part of life for most settlers . From about 1770 through the 1790s , state-sanctioned commandos led by local representatives of the VOC and stocked with VOC-provided shot and powder were organized annually against the San . These gave way to unofficial commandos that could be mobilized rapidly in response to San attacks and raids and that reported back to the local VOC representatives after the fact . <p> The commandos became increasingly exterminatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , VOC Council of Policy that explicitly sanctioned the eradication of the San . For Adhikari , this policy change represents the genocidal moment in Cape Dutch settler relations with the San . Commandos hunted the San with impunity and destroyed entire bands . They put San men to death on the spot and took San women and children captive as farm laborers . Adhikari argues that the assimilation of these captives also contributed to the genocidal process as those taken captive were effaced of their San identities . <p> While the San 's ability to reproduce themselves biologically and culturally and subsist as foragers was compromised under the rule of the VOC , it was extinguished after the British took control of the colony in 1795 . While the British brought with them significant military power , the high cost of conflict as well as humanitarian and social concerns ensured a more humane policy toward the San . However , the British turned to deracination and acculturation to obliterate the San . " Whereas Dutch colonialism became exterminationist , and therefore genocidal , in its relations with the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnocidal in outlook " ( p. 61 ) . The British implemented a four-pronged approach in their efforts to acculturate the San to colonial society and provide them with some protection against settler abuse . They encouraged settlers to make gifts of livestock to the San to prevent raiding and encourage pastoralism . They sought to identify and appoint suitable chiefs among the San with whom they could negotiate , a popular tenet of indirect rule applied across the British colonies that particularly faltered among the San who did not have hereditary leaders . The British also promoted missionary activity to " civilize " the San and prepare them for a sedentary life and declared the area known as Bushmanland to be a reserve for the San . <p> Racism played no small part in the extreme violence of the frontier commandos under both the VOC and the British . To settlers , the San occupied the lowest rung on this racial hierarchy and in their minds lacked the basic human characteristics of language , settled life , and social organization beyond the family . While the VOC sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive hunter-gatherers into pastoralists and laborers . Adhikari insightfully points out the irony here : the immigrants who had traveled across the ocean and pressed inland accused the San of racial inferiority because of their migratory lifestyle . Those who labeled the San as savage undertook brutal exterminatory acts themselves . <p> But the San resisted the sedentary and pastoral life and showed little interest in Christianity . While the British administration had issued an injunction against commandos , a clause making exceptions where San aggression justified retaliation enabled continued state-sanctioned violence . Despite the more humane British policy toward indigenes , San society within the colony was extinguished in an incremental process of encroachment , enforced labor , and periodic massacre . The few bands that survived the colonial encounter did so in parts of the Kalahari Desert . Adhikari cites recent estimates that today 7,500 people in South Africa identify as San--6,000 of whom are recent immigrants from Namibia and southern Angola . The presence of this small community suggests a missed opportunity to seek out indigenous traditions about the colonial encounter . <p> While Adhikari provides ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early chapters , it is in chapter 4 that he most explicitly makes the case for genocide . Adhikari converses with the larger literature on genocide and confronts the general reluctance among the public and scholars to label this historical episode as genocidal . Adhikari counters the anthropologist Miklos Sazlay ( who devoted significant attention to explaining why the San 's destruction did not constitute genocide ) , addressing doubts about the concept of genocide as a modern crime not applicable to preindustrial and colonial mass killings . In response to objections concerning the long time period over which the San were annihilated , nearly two centuries , Adhikari works with the literature on settler imperialism and genocide that argues that the eliminationism of settler colonialism is a structure- rather than a time-bounded event . He highlights the shared characteristics of modern genocide and the annihilation of the Cape San : intention to eradicate a national group coupled with large-scale killing of that group . <p> The Anatomy of a South African Genocide is provocative and consequential .

Adhikari 's clear prose and conveyance of complicated issues , accompanied by a chronology of important dates in the Cape colony 's history and a guide to further reading on the Cape San , makes this short book suitable for a wider public audience and the college classroom . But this same succinctness sometimes leaves the academic reader wanting more analysis and engagement with the wider literature on genocide .

Approaching the fall of the wall from the perspective of four leading powers ( the United States , Soviet Union , Europe , and China ) , this volume underscores the long-term reforms that facilitated these momentous changes as well as their continuing impact . <p> In his introduction , Jeffrey Engel reminds us that the story of 1989 has typically been presented as one dominated by ordinary citizens . Popular unrest spread from Poland and Hungary to East Germany , Bulgaria , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few short months . Yet , the opinions and actions of the world 's statesmen , Engel argues , are not as well understood . Although these elites may not have had absolute control over the many popular movements that emerged , they did continue to wield surprisingly tremendous influence . Related to this focus on policymakers and elites is Engel 's emphasis on the power of personality in history . Nowhere is this point made more clearly than in the discussion of Mikhail Gorbachev and his efforts to save socialism in the Soviet Union . More than anything or anyone else , argues Engel , Gorbachev was the key ingredient in the making of 1989 . His policies ( most notably glasnost and perestroika ) , his language ( stressing " equal security " and a " common European home " ) , and his personal beliefs ( especially his great reluctance to use force ) signaled a sea change in Cold War relations . <p> Following the introduction , the volume contains four chapters , each of which examines the policymakers of a major Cold War power center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in a world dominated by the two superpowers . Instead of limiting his analysis to European politicians , Sheehan stresses the power of Europe " as an idea , an aspiration , and a historical example " ( p. 37 ) . It was the Europeans ' renunciation of war as a political instrument and their new supranational institutions that proved to be their greatest contribution to the demise of the Soviet empire . After providing an examination of the foreign policy of the two German states , Soviet relations with Western Europe , and the anxieties surrounding reunification in 1990 , Sheehan returns to the attraction of the idea of Europe . It is , Sheehan intimates , no coincidence that the European Union embarked on a path of deepened integration in the 1990s and expanded to include a host of new members ( including several former Soviet satellites and three Baltic republics in 2004 ) . Not even a reunified Germany and the end of the Cold War could uproot the forces that had transformed European domestic and international politics since 1945 ( p. 63 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the internal calculations of Mikhail Gorbachev in their essay on the Soviet Union . Why did Gorbachev not respond more decisively after the wall fell ? How could he not have foreseen German reunification on western terms and its future NATO membership ? Taubman and Savranskaya offer a two-part explanation for the enigmatic responses of Gorbachev in the days and weeks following November 9 . First , they argue that he was greatly distracted by the challenges of keeping his own house in order . In addition to serious economic problems , Gorbachev was also addressing discontent in the Baltic republics , Georgia , and Ukraine . Second , in light of the relationships he had forged with western leaders prior to the autumn of 1989 , Gorbachev misunderstood the ramifications of the wall 's fall for Germany , Eastern Europe , and the Soviet Union . Gorbachev thrived on the support and respect he received from western political elites , and he believed their many promises regarding Soviet security concerns on the continent . Seeing the fall of the wall as one of several border changes of 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Austria ) , Gorbachev trusted the reassurances of Helmut Kohl regarding their shared European interests and saw no reason for alarm . Thus , Gorbachev felt he had been betrayed when Kohl introduced his ten-point plan for reunification at the end of November 1989 , without a single European power publicly objecting to the proposal . <p> In his essay on China 's experiences in 1989 , Chen Jian explores the origins and consequences of the Tiananmen tragedy as well as its impact on Europe . This chapter traces the development of China under Mao Zedong and the reforms of Deng Xiaoping in the decade prior to 1989 . Most intriguing here is how Chen illuminates the many links between the events in Eastern Europe and China . Prior to Tiananmen , Deng and other Communist Party leaders drew important lessons from the concessions of the Polish government and the growth of Solidarity in Poland . Most notably , they resolved not to permit any opposition groups to gain a foothold in China . Chen also reminds us that journalists reporting on Gorbachev 's visit to Beijing in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese students ' demonstrations . Furthermore , the condemnation of the international community following the Chinese crackdown made Gorbachev even less willing to use force in his own affairs . In comparing events in China and Eastern Europe , Chen discusses the differing role of nationalism in the two revolutionary situations . Whereas nationalism prompted the disintegration of the Soviet bloc , the Chinese Communist Party was able to maintain control over " the banner of nationalism and ... define the discourse of patriotism " ( p. 125 ) . Chen identifies this point as a key difference in the evolution of the events of 1989 in Asia and Europe . Chen concludes that , although the Communist Party survived the turmoil of that spring now more than twenty years past , it continues to face the problem of legitimizing its monopoly on political power . <p> The final chapter in this collection investigates how the end of the Cold War has influenced American foreign policy in the last two decades . Melvyn Leffler opens his essay with American images of the Cold War : the Berlin Airlift , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear down the Berlin Wall . For many Americans , these images underscore American determination , courage , and resilience , and ultimately , American victory over evil . For some Americans , Leffler argues , the Cold War vindicated U.S. policies and sparked greater interest in shaping the international system and spreading freedom and prosperity . George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton , however , did not belong to this camp . Leffler asserts that both men saw the prudent and careful use of American military capabilities as the central lesson of America 's Cold War experience . George W. Bush drew different conclusions from the fall of the wall , and he began to speak about the need for America to move beyond the old Cold War policies of deterrence in promoting freedom and individual liberty . The events of 9/11 then transpired , just nine months into Bush 's first term . Eighteen months later , the United States found itself fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . Yet , the imagery and symbolism of the Cold War continued to feature prominently in the speeches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news from Baghdad , a Cold War episode could be conjured to bolster the resolve of the American public . This symbolism might re-energize support at home , but Leffler concludes that the use of force had weakened America 's ability to promote democratic change ( p. 160 ) . As is perhaps fitting for the final essay in the collection , Leffler 's contribution underscores the continuing relevance of the Cold War--particularly its symbolism--in the twenty-first century world . <p> Overall , this volume comprises an excellent collection of essays . The book also holds true to its goal of concentrating on policymakers and other elites as it surveys the political and diplomatic developments of 1989 and their legacies . Despite the fact that each essay concentrates on a single world power , many connections emerge among the different chapters . Still , the volume might have even expanded its coverage and included essays on how other countries experienced the fall of the wall and its legacies . Separate chapters on the Eastern European nations , France , Britain , or other former Soviet client states ( for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including additional perspectives on 1989 . Nevertheless , this book would be an excellent addition to a course on the Cold War , particularly one that sought to illuminate the repercussions of 1989 and the reordering of a previously bipolar world . Perhaps the greatest strength of this volume is that it forces the reader to view 1989 not merely as the end of an historical era , but also as a period of transition that has significantly shaped the new millennium . The emergence of China as a world power , the further expansion and integration of the European Union , the newfound zeal for American democratization efforts abroad , and a return to frosty relations with Russia all constitute legacies of the wall 's demise . These authors thus make clear that although the wall itself may be gone , it still casts a long shadow over the post- Cold War world of the twenty-first century .

The translator , Maria Proser , was born in Argentina and now resides in Storrs , Connecticut with her husband Matthew Proser , who retired from the University of Connecticut where he taught modern drama , creative writing , and Shakespeare . Although it was written earlier , other books on the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo preceded it in English : Marguerite Guzman Bouvard , Revolutionizing Motherhood : The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo ( 1989 and 1994 ) , and Jo Fisher , Mothers of the Disappeared ( 1995 ) . John Simpson and Jana Bennett published The Disappeared and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo : the Story of the 11,000 Argentinians Who Vanished ( 1985 ) . <p> Circle of Love is a compilation of the Mothers ' memories of their children . Over twenty-one contributed personal accounts of their children , sometimes accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The years covered are those of " the Dirty War , " 1975-1983 , which began in the last year of Isabel Peron 's administration . The military replaced her in a coup and ruled from 1976-83 . Democratic government was restored with the election of the Radical Party 's Raul Alfonsin , followed by two terms of the Peronist Party 's Carlos Menem , 1983 to present. 1 <p> Mellibovsky , whose 29-year old daughter Graciela was kidnapped and " disappeared " in 1976 , conceived of writing this book when an American author approached her in Buenos Aires for materials on the missing children . Mellibovsky realized that there was a need to write a book so that the lives of the victims would be remembered . She proposed to mothers she met that they record on tape or write the stories of their children . The experience , while painful , proved to be cathartic . The mothers felt they were paying tribute to a generation of children that had been " disappeared , " thereby retaining their memory and the links to the past and future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are organized chronologically to reflect the development of the mothers from individual anguish and shock to concerted action to protest the disappearance of their children . The mothers faced hostile police and military who refused to admit they had possession of their children ; their writs of habeas corpus were ignored . Each mother recounts how she became involved with the " Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , " who took their name from the central plaza of downtown Buenos Aires , where they walked in a circle every Thursday afternoon--a " circle of love . " Later , they began to carry pictures and photos of their missing children and grandchildren and to wear white kerchiefs so that they could recognize each other ( pp. 17-18 ) . ( Bouvard has offered different reason for their origin--they were symbols of diapers and maternal purity. ) 2 Slowly the mothers reached out to foreign governments for help , even traveling abroad to tell their stories and request aid for their movement . A group of women in Holland gave them money for a meeting house in 1982 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provinces , to have a place to visit . <p> Most poignantly , the mothers write of children who cared for others . Their kids were young and idealistic , many were involved with helping children in the " villas miserias " ( slums ) . Others were medical students , social workers , and psychology majors who worked with workers of the poor . One young person wrote articles opposing the military dictatorship , another reported on human rights abuses , and a third was a young lawyer who helped political prisoners . Some probably were taken because of activities of their friends . What they seemed to have in common is that they cared for those less fortunate than they , they loved to study and usually excelled at school . Some were still in high school or even younger when they were picked up by the security forces . Children were born in prison or kidnaped along with their parents . <p> The mothers acknowledge the many others who " disappeared , " such as lawyers who sought to defend political prisoners . Mellibovsky tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murdered--the Mothers claim 30,000--by including the testimony of a wife whose husband disappeared and that of a grandmother who lost a granddaughter and who went on to help organize the " Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo . " <p> Where did these children learn to care for others ? From their homes , and from schools that , in many cases , were Roman Catholic . This produced two ironies , if not sources of anguish , for the mothers . Their children reflected values they learned from their fathers and mothers , who are predominantly middle class working in the service sector or in factories . Are these mothers and fathers guilty of what consequences befell them ? No , they answer in separate stories , because their children were reared as caring human beings , and represented what Argentina and the world needed . That is why they admired and loved their children . It was the misery of military dictatorship that could consider helping the poor to be a crime . That some Roman Catholic schools and groups had been so influential in encouraging activism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Roman Catholic hierarchy turned its backs on the prisoners and the mothers ' pleas for help . Disgusted and infuriated , many of the mothers abandoned the church . <p> Were all of these disappeared children so innocent rather than armed subversives as the military depicted them ? All were non-violent in these examples ; none took up arms in these approximately twenty-five biographies . Were all of the homes as politically naive as the mothers make themselves out to be ? Again , hard to say since the representativeness of Mellibovsky 's sample is not made clear . Elena Dubrovsky de Pasik writes that her adolescent " politically activist socialist " son 's crimes " were those of being young , of thinking and of dissenting " ( p. 218 ) . An inkling of the politics guiding some is given when Mellibovsky writes of her struggle to arrive at some understanding of why her daughter disappeared : <p> I also learned something about economics , and I understood that the disappearances had a lot to do with the dictatorship 's project to subject the country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repression were learnt at a school in Panama ( p. 53 ) . <p> In their quest for information and release of their children , the mothers endured a lot . They themselves were followed , beaten , and threatened with disappearance . In fact , their first leader , Azucena Villaflor de Vicente , was detained and disappeared . Their husbands and members of their families lost their jobs . A few underwent the horror of having another child taken in retaliation for their activities . In a few cases , phone calls were received from their missing children while they were in captivity . Mellibovsky is not sure why the authorities did this , but it amounted to sadism and a form of torture for her and other mothers . <p> This book lacks the historical and political analysis of Jo Fisher , in Mothers of the Disappeared . It also falters on dates , and the reader is not always sure of the chronology of events . The extralegal and violent activities of prior Argentine governments , the military action of the Left , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glossary of " Names and Terms " defines the AAA ( Argentine Anticommunist Alliance ) and gives the significance of the return of Juan Peron at " Ezeiza , " but references to them in the personal accounts do not advise the reader of this . The lack of an index makes it hard to look up a specific event or name . There are some typographical errors ( the return to Ezeiza was in 1972 , not 1982 ; archbishop is misspelled on p. 113 ) but not caught by the editors or translators . <p> Nor does Circle of Love does not contain an analysis of the Mothers organization such as that written by Marguerite Guzman Bouvard . Bouvard interprets the mothers in terms of maternal anarchism because of their revolutionary methods , egalitarianism , and self-determination through direct participation. 3 The reader would need to supplement this book with a good history and analysis of Argentina and the Mothers to understand the context of the disappearances and the mothers acts of bravery in face of a hostile community and security forces . The political rhetoric of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfamiliar with dependency theory . <p> What this book does is allow the mothers to describe the personal agony suffered by families touched by kidnaping and violence . In their own words , the mothers narrate how they and their families handled the brutality of the dictatorship , how they went about finding information about their children , how they often suffered more loss as fiances , spouses and other loved ones of their children were also kidnaped . In some cases , their disappeared children were their only ones , or they took steps to send their other children out of the country where they would be safer . The shock of loss was made more tragic by the lack of support from their priests , lawyers , relatives , friends , and countrymen . It was only in the bosom of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo that they received comfort and emotional support from others who were going through the same agony . And even among the Mothers , they could not totally let down their guard--last names and telephone numbers were rarely exchanged and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take public buses to avoid being followed by security forces . The pain is still with them today , especially on the birthdays of their missing children or the Christmas holidays . <p> This pain has been aggravated by the return of democracy . In December 1986 , Raul Alfonsin signed a statute of limitations on the prosecutions of military officers , and rebellions led by mid- level military officers under which the administration ended all prosecutions of officers on active service . In October 1989 , Carlos Menem granted amnesty to military men accused of homicide and torture , including that of the Malvinas-Falklands War . The Mothers give little credence to the threat of military coups that faced both Alfonsin and Menem . Emilio Mignone , a well- respected lawyer whose daughter was abducted , explained the Alfonsin philosophy as " the theory of the two devils . " The violence in Argentina was due to both subversive activity and terrorism on the part of the government 's armed forces . Accordingly , since the violence of the subversives preceded that of the state , it excused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject that theory , arguing that the penal code should have been applied to subversives , not cruel and unusual punishments , such as kidnaping , torture , and killing . The state with its overwhelming power is supposed to protect its citizens ( pp. 120-21 ) . <p> The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo demonstrated and politicked against the pardons of those who kidnaped , tortured , killed , and disappeared their children . Their protests and publicity remained innovative and creative . In December 1981 , they organized a circle that would last twenty-four hours as a March of Resistance . They still assumed that their children were alive , and one- thousand Argentines joined them including the Organization for Peace and Justice , headed by Nobel prize winner Adolfo Perez Esquivel . With no news of their children , they marched again the next year , but the federal police did not allow them in the Plaza de Mayo so they marched in the streets . The Third March of Resistance was held on Students ' Day in September 1983 , and 30,000 faceless silhouettes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mothers , and volunteers . For the Fifth March of Resistance , drawings of hands made in solidarity in eighty-six countries were all along the way from the Congress to the Plaza de Mayo . For the Eighth March of Resistance in December 1987 , kerchiefs showing the slogan " Jail for the perpetrators of genocide " were tied all around the Plaza de Mayo . In the 1980s , international pop artist Joan Baez met with the Mothers , while writers and artists such as Maria Elena Walsh , Mercedes Sosa , and Antonio Tarrago Ross sent poems , songs , and paintings . In 1988 , the Mothers and Grandmothers were invited up on to the stage during a rock concert organized by Amnesty International , the only time they were shown on Argentine television ! In addition , a film " The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo " was made by Argentines , which was shown in various centers around Argentina . The Mothers also sponsored art festivals , round tables , photograph exhibits , and talks ( p. 176 ) . <p> The Mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers about what happened to their children . Around 1980 , the group Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo was organized to search for missing grandchildren . However , unremitting hostility and factionalism plagued them , even after the restoration of constitutional government . Leader Hebe de Bonafini endured threats from the security forces and a murder attempt ! Their headquarters was sacked by security forces . In 1986 , the Mothers split into two groups : the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo--Founding Group and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo . Mellibovsky is a member of the former , which viewed the elected governments as betrayers of the cause of the disappeared and backed the scientific exhumation of the remains of the disappeared . The latter group , led by Hebe de Bonafini , rejected the exhumations ( p. 179 ) . In her book , Marguerite Bouvard averred that the Mothers had lost members who returned to the traditional political parties--Radicals and Peronists--and that the Founding Group 's faction had higher socioeconomic status and more education than the other mothers. 4 <p> Age , infirmity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll on the mothers . Outside support , whether from the United Nations , the U.S. government under Jimmy Carter , the Organization of American States , Amnesty International , European women and men , and U.S. citizens have made it possible for the Mothers to expand their activities and publish . Their support inside of Argentina is more uncertain . Yes , thousands of Argentines have marched with them to protest amnesty for the military and security forces . Yes , many Argentines apologized for insulting the mothers who demonstrated during the World Cup soccer match in Argentina in 1978 . Mothers in other countries have organized to protest the disappearance of their children in emulation of the Argentine mothers . And the Mothers remain more popular in Europe than they do in Argentina . They now know their children are dead , but how they died and where they are buried are questions that still haunt them . That is why the Mothers continue their circle of love carrying pictures of their missing children and grandchildren . <p> Notes : <p> 1 .

Mudimbe has produced a work that is as ambitious in concept as it is impenetrable in style . From the outset it is obvious that this exceedingly dense book is not for the general reader . With chapters ranging from " Symbols and the Interpretation of the African Past " and " Which Idea of Africa ? " to " The Power of the Greek Paradigm , " " Domestication and the Conflict of Memories , " and " Reprendre , " the scope is sweeping indeed . One can not but hope that Mudimbe will make good on his own statement of purpose : <p> In this book I explore the concept of Africa by bringing together all the levels of interpretation , and I examine their roots in and reference to the Western tradition , focusing on some of their past and present constellations and involving myself as reader ( p. xv ) . <p> Certainly there is no false humility here . For anyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Invention of Africa ( Bloomington : Indiana University Press , 1988 ) , the implied promise that this book 's five essays and postscript " are stories written for my ' Americanized ' children , born in Africa " ( p. xii ) , would seem to come as welcome news . One is pleased to read , for example , that The Idea of Africa is : <p> both the product and the continuation of The Invention of Africa insofar as it asserts that there are natural features , cultural characteristics , and , probably , values that contribute to the reality of Africa as a continent and its civilizations as constituting a totality different from those of , say , Asia and Europe " ( p. xv ) . <p> With its explicit ( if time-honored ) thesis that Africa is represented in Western scholarship by false constructs and fantasies made up deliberately by scholars and writers since Greek times , all of this adds up to one big order . A scholar steeped in philosophy and the history of ideas , Mudimbe would seem ideally suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment gave way to bewilderment . A work that promises significant enlightenment soon became bogged down in confusion . A writer capable of the following passage , in the Preface , <p> It might be useful to note that The Idea of Africa , like The Invention of Africa , is not about the history of Africa 's landscapes or her civilizations . Since the 1920s , African scholars , and most notably anthropologists and historians , have been interrogating these landscapes and civilizations and reconstructing , in a new fashion , piece by piece , fragile genealogies that bear witness to historial vitalities , that until then , seemed invisible to students of African affairs ( p. xii ) . <p> can pen the following one page later : <p> If one accepts Pierre Bourdieu 's grids of classification : on the one hand , phenomenology as a critical and autocritical reading beginning within a determined subject and rigorously apprehending the perceived and rendering it as both discourse and knowledge ; and on the other hand , the dangerous ethnophilosophical enterprise , so well illustrated in African Studies by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ethnophilosophy claimed to be a perfect " scientific " translation of a ' philosophical ' implicit system which is out there in the quotidian experience , and it qualified itself as an objectivist discourse . . . ( p. xiii ) . <p> The author 's promise that this is a work designed not to analyze African achievements ( something done rather thoroughly by many scholars ) , but rather to bolster " a very simple hypothesis " --namely that in all cultures one finds " a sort of zero degree discourse " made up essentially of " popular , primary founding events of the culture and its historical becoming " ( p. xiii ) , almost immediately gives way to obscurantist gobbledygook . Jargon , particularly the specialized language of philosophy ( see the segments subtitled " Questions of Method , Questions of Philosophy , " " Philosophy and the Practice of Ethnography , " and " The African Practice of Philosophy , " pp. 202-208 ) may have its place when scholars within a discipline speak exclusively to each other . <p> One may safely assume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propos for philosophers . On the other hand , obscure language is often the refuge of pedantry , covering up for a lack of clarity in both conception and execution . In this book the endless recourse to structuralist , post-structuralist , and deconstructionist terminology almost guarantees obscurity . Readers not versed in philosophical or epistemological discourse and Foucaultian dialogue may feel like a miner looking for veins of gold amidst jumbles of rock ; only the most strenuous and consistent effort will reveal some ore . There is no denying that Mudimbe can be illuminating in his investigation of the Western ( white ) world 's penchant for rationalizing every exploitation in self-righteous ideological conceits , but there are others who have done the job with both clarity and accessibility , including Edward Said , Abdul JanMohammed , and Jonah Raskin , not to mention George Padmore . <p> The recourse to jargon is not the only problem with this tantalizing book . While the overall scheme of The Idea of Africa , as explicated in the Preface , appears consistent , the five chapters , even taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The medley of essays--despite some penetrating insights--is daunting , and one can not but wonder who will read past the first twenty-five pages of mostly impenetrable language . For those who do there is a reward through glimpses and tidbits of Mudimbe 's comprehension of the **32;1203;TOOLONG tendency of a dominant culture to look down upon the " other " as an inferior . This , however , hardly constitutes a breakthrough , and the lack of clarity in the book 's organization becomes self-evident . This book , to put it simply , would certainly be a mistake to assign to undergraduates . <p> For example , in the second chapter the author leaps from an Africa envisioned by anthopologists , including Melville Herskovits , to an analysis in chapter 3 of such classical Greek writers as Herodotus , Strabo , and Pliny , with a tacked-on segment about Bernal 's Black Athena . Even among more specialized scholars , the book 's relentless pedantry might prove too much . Well before one has finished , one wonders , is the crushing diminuendo of this book , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> For this reviewer the answer is a qualified yes . If the reader is interested at all in a " polysemic " idea of Africa , if s/he is " convinced that its Africa 's interpretations do not coincide with the complexity of the rules for its formation " ( p. 211 ) , and if s/he is in agreement that the real Africa needs to be " filtered out " from the immense and complex literature about Africa produced in the West , the intellectual rewards are considerable . Even then it is a fair guess that this book will be both disturbing and mystifying for all but a few , regardless of their discipline or interest . <p> Historians , for example , will surely be puzzled to learn that their discipline is relegated in Mudimbe 's scheme to a " second level discourse " ( p. xiv ) along with most of the other academic disciplines ( sociology , economics , etc. ) and that a " construct claiming to hold in a regulated frame the essentials of a past and its characteristics " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Volkgeist . Does this mean the author considers what happened in the past ( as documented by a preponderance of evidence ) to be mere discourse ? Or is he simply re-stating the common truism that each generation revises the past according to its own lights ? Mudimbe 's grasp of historiography seems uncertain . Since he claims for himself a " meta-discourse " that will produce a history of histories , or at least " a history of histories of African anthropology and history " ( p. xiv ) , one might be forgiven high expectations in reference to those disciplines . One can not help but wonder whether Mudimbe , will , like Croce , or Vito , deliver something truly meaningful ? <p> I confess to having had some disquiet when asked to review this work . Because it touches on so many disciplines and is so ambitious in scope , few indeed would seem qualified to produce a review that adequately covers history , art history ( particularly that of classical Greece ) , ethnography , philosophy , and literary criticism , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the simple geography of mountains and oceans , seeking what is secret and hidden . One is dazzled by the range of his reading and the sweep of his deconstructive lens . <p> Philosophers interested in the epistemology of knowledge ( especially relating the Western mental constructs of Africa ) may find far more here than meets the eye . One inevitably wonders if the book might better have been targeted to that audience . One also wonders if it is directed , at least in part , to ethnographers , or to curators and other experts on African art . Or to students of African literature . Segments in the latter chapters ( reviewed below ) would seem to indicate that Mudimbe had these audiences in mind . <p> This is , however , explicitly not the case . Mudimbe himself repeatedly stakes out territory that is inclusive of history , as well as the other disciplines ( anthropology , sociology , literature , and the arts ) that have traditionally " covered " Africa . The entire book , therefore , is fair game for any scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this reviewer 's opinion much of this book is best summarized as a tendentious melange of highly personal investigations and asides . <p> For example , what is one to make of the statement--in chapter 1--that Africa 's discovery ( in the fifteenth century , so Mudimbe says ) " meant and still means the primary violence signified by the word . The slave trade narrated itself accordingly , and the same movement of reduction progressively guaranteed the gradual invasion of the continent " ( p. 17 ) ? Does he dismiss the long record of trade diasporas and cross-cultural commerce ( including an extensive trade in slaves ) from Africa to the Middle East or North Africa , or South Asia , that predated the Atlantic trade ? Apparently the author agrees with Ali Mazrui ( whom he praises in his references to The Africans : A Triple Heritage ) that the only slave trade of import was that of the Atlantic , and that the consequences in violence , in this sense , stemmed exclusively from Europe . Though he avoids blatant Afrocentric myths , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting passage Mudimbe refers to the Periplus of the Erythaean Sea as a " little known text " ( p. 18 ) , a statement that will surely surprise anyone who has taught the content of this work in African History courses during the past thirty years or so . Since the Periplus has been mentioned or quoted in scores of anthologies and histories ranging from Basil Davidson on the Left ( The African Past ) to Gann and Duignan on the Right ( Africa and the World ) , it would be a rare student indeed , even on the introductory level , who had never heard of this text . <p> Even more problematic is Mudimbe 's version of the first serious " revision of traditional history , " which he attributes to Alain Bourgeois , a French scholar who lived for a time in Senegal , and , who , according to Mudimbe , was the first to challenge the fashionable attitude that Negroes were looked down upon from Classical times to the present , and he states somewhat further on that " the African right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogating the objective of history ... can be dated . The reality of African history , particularly for the sub-Saharan part of the continent , does not seem to exist , at least academically , before the 1940s " ( p. 21 ) . <p> Some historians of Africa might agree with this assertion , but its implications are that the reader discovers almost nothing of the pioneering work of Carter Woodson , W.E.B . Du Bois , and other African American scholars whose efforts , albeit neglected by the mainstream culture of the time , antedated Mudimbe 's revelations ( a la Bourgeois ) by decades . Though Mudimbe later surprises us with a single notation on George Washington Williams , W.E.B . Du Bois , John Hope Franklin , and others " who argued only that Blacks had a share in building the Egyptian civilization along with other races , " this apparent afterthought seems a mere quibble when compared with his heavily Francophone projections , revealing how Leopold Senghor , influenced ( apparently ) by Bourgeois , provided an early " reevaluation " of African history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but surely this is an exaggeration . Furthermore , if it is true , as Mudimbe states , that Eugene Guernier was among the first ( 1952 ) to articulate " the African origin of humanity and human consciousness " ( p. 23 ) , surely it is disingenuous to dismiss the work of Woodson , Du Bois , and others--done many decades earlier--whose collective efforts provided a real challenge at a time when pseudo-scientific racism was in the ascendency . It is no accident that in the United States African American scholars turn to these early pioneers for inspiration . <p> What 's more , in a " third group " of scholars whom Mudimbe lists as going a step beyond , to give " an essential importance to the African inititiative , " we find Cheikh Anta Diop , Ben-Jochannan , Chancellor Williams , and Martin Bernal . Anyone who has read Ben-Jochannan and Williams must wonder at this phrase , since both make essentially diffusionist , indeed race-centered arguments for the origins of African civilizations , if not all civilizations . Are we expected to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " racial " nature of Ancient Egyptians ? <p> Having read the latter 's works with care , as obviously Mudimbe has done , I am clear that Bernal is arguing essentially in favor of the influence of Ancient Egypt on Classical Greek civilization . Whatever one makes of Bernal 's much-challenged argument , surely it is a stretch to assume that he makes the same diffusionist arguments as Diop and his followers . One wonders if Mudimbe has thoroughly studied these highly mythologized texts , which ( though widely quoted and often misrepresented in popular tracts ) have very little in common with Bernal . <p> The segment on cultural relativism , which amounts to a fairly sympathetic critique of Herskovitsian assumptions ( pp. 46-50 ) , is another case of unrequited possibility . Especially when juxtaposed against structuralism ( pp. 50-52 ) , this promises a potentially rewarding search for a larger truth within the grand ethnographic tradition . Yet , it ultimately disappoints , for this segment , like so many throughout the book , seems oddly incomplete . Amidst its constant asides and references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear line of development . It is almost as if Mudimbe 's disdain for historicity precludes any historical continuity . Where , for example , are the contributions of Boas ? And why is there no mention of the diachronic tradition within anthropology that challenges--from within--the natural tendency to seek neat formulas and frozen or immobile societies ? <p> The book improves greatly toward the end , and especially in chapters 5 ( Reprendre ) and 6 ( Coda ) , Mudimbe further illustrates and condemns the projection onto Africa of Western constructs that rose out of colonialism and imperialism--as in his previous work , The Invention of Africa , which was expressly written to expose the categories and conceptual systems that , in Mudimbe 's words " depend on a Western epistemological order " ( p. xv ) . His analysis of African art--so long categorized within the " vague domain of primitive art " ( p. 154 ) --within a new system that he calls " architectonic " ( p. 155 ) is provocative and worth study . In seeking commonalities in order to reconcile " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mudimbe suggests we consider African artworks " as we do literary texts " --that is , as linguistic phenomena , as well as " discursive " circuits ( p. 156 ) . <p> The ensuing segments , particularly those subtitled " Between Two Traditions " and " Regrouping " ( pp. 159-164 ) are certainly original . Some of the passages are eloquent : <p> New generations have learned from the successes and failures of those earlier **25;1237;TOOLONG , at the same time they have interrogated their own traditional arts . The artists of the present generation are the children of two traditions , two worlds , both of which they challenge , merging mechanics and masks , machines and the memories of gods ( p. 164 ) . <p> Those looking for a handle to better comprehend ( and teach ) the interconnectedness of African arts and literature would do well do read this chapter . Mudimbe 's theme is hardly new , of course . Other scholars , including the poet and curator Jean Laude , the art historian Rene Bravmann , the anthropologist Denise Paulme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postulated a high degree of interaction and shared influences , particularly within larger cultural regions , not to mention a historic pedigree . Though he seems unaware of much of this ( failing to cite Laude or Paulme ) , Mudimbe credits Vansina , Price , and others for their contributions , and his synthesis is forward-looking . At one point he takes on Ulli Beier , challenging his lament that " all over Africa the carvers down their tools . The rituals that inspired the artists are dying out . The kings who were patrons have lost their power , " with this repost : " So what ? This discontinuity , despite its violence , does not necessarily mean the end of African art ; it seems , rather , that the ancient models are being richly adapted . " Mudimbe cites Beier himself to show how rich the new adaptations are , indeed that many new works reflect " a drive to say ... something new , to transcend the crisis of tribal societies and art disorganized by the impact of European culture " ( pp. 163-164 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Popular Art " ( pp. 164-174 ) , Mudimbe finds a liberating intensity . <p> One might quibble at Mudimbe 's uncritical use of the term African for Roman writers who came from the Roman ( North African ) province of that name . One might question Mudimbe 's reliance on Foucaultian hypotheses with their characteristic assumptions of a conspiratorial rationality controlling and conditioning virtually all discourse , existing side-by-side with inchoate systems of exclusion . Despite long and additive passages of pretentious jargon so common to this highly abstract and presumptuous deconstructionism , chapter 5 is a confident manifesto integrating art and literature ( especially interesting is the critique , mostly favorable , of Christopher Miller 's Theories of Africans , Chicago : University of Chicago Press , 1990 ) into a more optimistic synthesis than one might expect from a scholar steeped in a dialectic that seems to require a decoding , if not a deconstruction , of a mostly terrible past . <p> At least for those willing to struggle for its gems , this tedious work brings together an eclectic range of sources viewed from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable contribution . 69401 @qwx479401

Crossgrove ( Departments of German Studies and Comparative Literatures , Brown University ) Published on H-German ( February , 2009 ) Commissioned by Susan R. Boettcher <p> The Rise and Fall of Spices <p> As Paul Freedman notes in the introductory chapter of this volume , an enormous historical literature treats the medieval spice trade and its pivotal role in stimulating western Europeans to undertake deep-water exploration and establish colonial enterprises . But this literature is concerned primarily with the supply side , with how to circumvent Muslim and Venetian middlemen . Freedman proposes instead to focus on the demand side , on " why spices were so popular in the first place , why they were sufficiently sought after for traders to bring them to Europe from what seemed the farthest corners of the world " ( p. 2 ) . And this is what he does , especially in the first three chapters . Chapters 4 through 6 provide details on how the spice trade worked in the Middle Ages , how lack of knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate the middlemen , and how voices raised against conspicuous consumption of spices had little effect on their use . Having established how and why Europeans were so eager to pay high prices for an enormous variety of spices , Freedman then can not resist retelling the tale , in chapters 7 and 8 , of how government-backed expeditions set out to find and gain control of sources through exploration and conquest . These two chapters are well documented and engagingly narrated , but they cover material likely to be familiar to historians as well as to many general readers . Finally , in a concluding chapter , he chronicles the decline of demand for spices in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and their disappearance from world trade as commodities that countries would go to war to control . The work is primarily narrative rather than analytical , but general readers will enjoy it no less for that . <p> While previewing his main arguments in the introductory chapter , Freedman quickly dispenses with the old chestnut that spices were so popular in the Middle Ages because they helped preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pickling , smoking , or air-curing were much more effective means of preservation . More importantly , the price of spices so exceeded that of fresh meat that it would have made no economic sense at all to use them for anything other than as enhancements of cuisine , as drugs , and as aromatics . Above all , they were " prized as consumer goods by the affluent " ( p. 2 ) . In addition to black pepper , cinnamon , ginger , and saffron , such spices as galangal , zedoary , long pepper , and " grains of paradise " ( malagueta pepper from West Africa ) were commonly used in medieval cookery , along with sugar , which only later became the commodity that we know today . These , along with many others , including even ground mummy , were used as medicinal drugs , while expensive aromatic resins and animal products such as ambergris , castoreum , musk , and civet were used as fragrances , both for aesthetic and for medical reasons . <p> Of these , only saffron could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily because of the difficulty of harvesting it and the large number of stamens required to make a commercially viable amount . Most of the others have all but vanished from the European table . Freedman also draws an important distinction between spices and herbs . Spices , because of the long transit time from their origins in unknown parts of the world , were sold in dried form , while herbs were raised locally and used fresh . Herbs , though also used in cuisine , were especially important in medicine , not least because their use was not limited to the affluent . <p> Chapter 1 , on the use of spices in medieval cuisine , draws its primary evidence from medieval cookbooks and from accounts of meals served on special occasions . For the modern reader ( or eater ) , the most notable feature of medieval cookbooks is the large amount and variety of spices used in individual dishes , especially in the form of elaborate sauces . Individuals working for the wealthiest and most powerful families produced most of the surviving cookbooks . The overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostentation and presentation , with less concern about how the dishes might have tasted . Even people of moderate wealth , however , appear to have spent amounts of money on spices that seem alien to modern consumers . Freedman can demonstrate this point with recipes from a late fourteenth-century Parisian book of housekeeping that contains more than four hundred recipes . Tips for simplifying recipes and saving on excessive use of spices notwithstanding , elaborate banquet recipes are included that seem hardly less grand than those of the highest nobles . He also cites examples of anecdotes illustrating how peasants were made fun of by showing how they were completely unused to spices other than pepper . <p> Above all , the use of large quantities of expensive spices underlined a family 's social status , and Freedman provides detailed descriptions of meals prepared for specific occasions that highlight this point . To give just one example , a series of banquets on the occasion of the 1476 marriage of Duke George " the Rich " of Bavaria to Princess Jadwiga of Poland required : " 386 pounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 205 of cinnamon , 105 of cloves , and a mere 85 pounds of nutmeg " ( p. 6 ) . As for the source of the fascination with highly spiced cuisine , Freedman argues that it was already well established in Roman times . What differed in medieval Europe was simply the availability of more spices through the Muslim trading networks . The chapter on cuisine is , appropriately , the longest in the book . <p> In his discussion of spices as medicinal drugs ( chapter 2 ) , Freedman shows how the humoral balance sought in medieval medical theory inevitably led cuisine and medicine to interact . While each spice , herb , and foodstuff was thought theoretically to have its own qualities ( hot , cold , wet , dry ) in one of four degrees , these considerations were seldom rigidly applied in the preparation of foods . Herbals ( handbooks for treating illnesses ) were more likely to follow humoral guidelines in recommending what herb or spice to use for a particular complaint . Here , perhaps to a greater degree than Freedman explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an older tradition of herbal medicine after the translation of key Arabic texts into Latin in the transition from the early to the High Middle Ages . More importantly , importation of spices for medicinal purposes played an important role in the rise of the drug seller . And the more affluent members of society could best afford to purchase spices , often in the form of complex potions . <p> The third chapter outlines the use of the odors given off by spices . Freedman notes that only a small amount of the spices imported to Europe were used for medicine or perfume , but " fragrance , even more than gastronomy , explains the allure of spices because perfume ... joined together so many appealing effects " ( p. 76 ) . Scents could heighten sexual attraction and bring down the wrath of moralists , yet they were also symbols of holiness and central elements of church services . The desire for fragrances to counteract the foul smells of medieval urban life readily explains one of their uses , but long traditions associating saintliness and good smells were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonplace that the bodies of saints gave off sweet odors when they decomposed . Fragrant spices thus provided analogs . Europeans did not know where spices came from , and it was widely believed that valuable substances , including gemstones as well as spices , were swept down the rivers of Asia and Africa from their origins in Paradise . Even as the first European travelers ventured into Asia in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , the legendary Christian kingdom of Prester John continued to captivate the imagination of Europeans because its discovery might open direct access to the sources of spices without reliance on infidel traders . As Freedman notes , Pope Alexander III sent an emissary to search for Prester John in 1177 ( he was never heard from again ) , and in 1497 Vasco da Gama carried letters to him from the King of Portugal . <p> Chapters 4 through 6 deal respectively with details and history of the existing spice trade ; with factors that determined scarcity , abundance , and profit for the traders ; and with voices that condemned spices as immoral luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a peripheral market . From the sources in South and southeastern Asia to the markets in China , India , and the Islamic world , only a small percentage of the overall global trade ultimately found its way to Europe . This meant that Europeans were dependent on the predominantly Arab middlemen from whom they obtained spices , but they had no direct knowledge of or control over the supply fluctuations that might influence these markets . Only rarely , as during the brief period of Mongol hegemony in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries , did Europeans have limited direct access to East Asian markets . Freedman uses numerous examples from extant documents to provide details of how the trade worked , who the most important traders were , and how spices were distributed at the retail level . He also discusses the important issue of fraud and adulteration . While prices fluctuated over time , it is obvious from the extant records that a great variety of spices were available but at very high prices . <p> In the fifth chapter , Freedman discusses the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not much of something ) , circumstantial ( the desired item needs to be transported to where it is desired ) , or artificial ( the supply is deliberately restricted by human action ) . He gives detailed examples of each kind of scarcity , but the main reason for approaching the topic in this way is to suggest that Europeans eventually became convinced that they could eliminate the traders and make enormous profits themselves by getting direct access to the sources of spices . <p> Chapter 6 is a bit of a lull in the coming storm , a retarding moment before Freedman plunges into the story of how Europeans came to take over the global trade in spices . With examples ranging from Ulrich von Hutten to Dante Alighieri and especially to Geoffrey Chaucer , Freedman shows how the unseemly use of spices , especially in ostentatious preparation of food , could outrage medieval moralists . Even monasteries came in for a fair share of bitter comment for their overindulgence in expensive ingredients when simpler fare was available . All of this of course did little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Freedman retells the story of the voyages of exploration and the military conquest that led to the establishment of colonial empires . As noted earlier , these chapters provide a lot of interesting details , but they cover more familiar ground than that narrated in the first six chapters . Nonetheless , the presentation of the stories of discovery and conquest are well integrated with the previous discussions . They provide a final arch to the narrative that helps explain why European nations were willing to expend so much life and treasure to get control of the spice trade . <p> In a concluding chapter , we learn just how quickly everything changed . In the course of the seventeenth century , French gastronomy came to reject the heavy use of spices in favor of rich , creamy sauces flavored only with a modicum of herbs . Within just a few generations , heavily spiced foods came to be associated with a lack of sophistication . Sugar was largely banished from main courses , but it soon became a commodity consumed by everyone in the British Isles as new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedman notes : " when we look at the Middle Ages the real mystery is not why spices were popular , but why later , after a millennium of continuous popularity , they dropped out of favor " ( p. 221 ) . As humoral medicine came to be discredited , the medicinal use of spices also declined , though these were never as important as the use of spices in cuisine . In the introductory chapter Freedman had already noted , " in the summer of 2004 , Hurricane Frances destroyed the nutmeg crop of Granada sic , the largest producer of this spice , yet the world financial system did not tremble " ( p. 3 ) . <p> Extensive footnotes , a bibliography of over three hundred items , and an excellent index round out the volume . In addition to three maps , there are eighteen illustrations , all but two of which are drawn from medieval manuscripts or maps . Thirteen original texts containing recipes and descriptions are interspersed throughout the book , set off in boxes and italicized to mark them as source material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These range from a full page to just a few lines , and they lend an aura of authenticity to the narrative by providing illustrative examples for the reader . <p> Freedman presents his arguments throughout with analysis of extant documents and with detailed examples . The reader is sometimes left with a welter of images but without an easy way to decide what is typical and what is unusual . Here we get to the fundamental problem of narrative history . We must rely on the integrity and rhetorical skills of the narrator to build a convincing case . Freedman is largely successful in doing so , though the examples drawn from medieval cookbooks might profitably have been compared to the moderation usually counseled in regimens of health , a genre of medieval text that was more common than cookbooks . <p> Finally , Freedman often refers to contemporary phenomena as analogs to the points he is making . These are sometimes humorous but they also serve to make serious points . Here are just a few examples : <p> " A freezer was an emblem of prosperity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now cheap whereas it was considered a treat in the 1920s . As this is being written , flat-screen televisions are making the transition from show-off to routine items " ( p. 7 ) ; <p> " In general , first class loses some of its allure if ordinary people can upgrade to it easily ; a ' gold ' credit card means nothing if everyone possesses several of them " ( p. 43 ) ; <p> " The perceived cleanliness of the body 's interior was perhaps more important in the Middle Ages than its exterior , rather than vice versa as today ; the laxative more important than the moisturizer " ( p. 52 ) . <p> Such examples effectively bring the dynamic at the basis of the relationship between the attractiveness of spices and their rarity in premodern Europe home to the reader . On balance , Freedman has written a masterful synthesis of research from many different branches of economic , social , political , and textual history . Occasionally , some of the detail from particular texts makes for slow going , but the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective that makes it worthwhile to keep on reading .

It seems to have been first published , in Russian , in 1903 . However , its exact origin and its authors remain clouded in mystery , despite numerous efforts over the past 80 years or so to track them down . The document was definitively shown to be a forgery in 1921 , for example by Philip Graves in a series of articles in the Times of London . Since then , there have been many works examining the sources for the forgery , and predecessors for the fantastic theory which it elaborates . <p> Those interested in the etiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject in Chapter Four of the present work . In Chapter Two , the author gives some excerpts from the Protocols , taken from an English translation published in 1922 . This translation , by Victor Marsden , is ( rather ominously ) easily available in full on the internet today . The central theme of the Protocols is the announcement of a world wide conspiracy by a group of Jews ( the " Elders of Zion " ) to " enslave Christian civilization under a new world order run by the leading elder of Zion " ( p. 5 ) . <p> In Chapter Three , the author gives a brief discussion of varieties of antisemitism in general , which provides a context for discussion of the influence of the Protocols . <p> In Chapter Five , the author considers the connection of the Protocols with the anticommunist political movements which followed World War I , and dissemination and support of the Protocols in a number of countries by reactionary forces , such as threatened monarchies and nobilities . <p> There is a consideration as well of perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , Adolf Hitler , various of his officials , and many other Germans . As to the influence of the Protocols on the Holocaust , the author cautiously suggests that this sui generis event transcends the antisemitism of the later nineteenth and first decade or so of the twentieth centuries . Of course , it is difficult to estimate the effect of a single document such as the Protocols on something like the course of antisemitism in Germany and elsewhere , but directly and indirectly it seems to have had as much influence as a single document can have . At the least , it can serve , as the author says , as a " basis for these reflections on antisemitism " ( p. 4 ) . <p> The author is interested in explaining and conjecturing about why the Protocols had such a powerful political and social effect in numerous societies and nations during the first half of the twentieth century . Bronner quotes Hannah Arendt ( p. 122 ) : " ... if a patent forgery like the " Protocols of the Elders of Zion " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text of a whole political movement , the task of the historian is no longer to discover a forgery . Certainly it is not to invent explanations which dismiss the chief political and historical fact of the matter : that the forgery is being believed . This fact is more important than the ( historically speaking , secondary ) circumstance that it is a forgery . " The author adds : " The point is not whether they are true , but rather whether the antisemite believes them to be true " ( p. 122 ) . In fact , those who try to prove to believers in the truth of the Protocols that they are false will customarily find themselves on the wrong track . A " true " antisemite can always find reasons to believe in the " essential " truth of the Protocols , even in the face of overpowering evidence to the contrary . <p> The document is so palpably a forgery in the minds of many people that it can become for them a problem of considerable interest and depth to try to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , no less a person than Winston Churchill wrote in 1920 ( before Graves 's exposure of the forgery ) " this worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstruction of society on the basis of arrested development , of envious malevolence , and impossible equality has been steadily growing ... there is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews . It is certainly a very great one ; it outweighs all others " ( p. 107 ) . The formulation of this passage suggests convincingly that Churchill based his remarks on the content and " spirit " of the Protocols , if not the exact text . In Chapter Six , the author speculates on the nature of antisemitism today , especially as contrasted with the period before the end of World War II . On the whole , the author is rather optimistic . For example , he says " The world is different than it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology dealing with the destiny of mankind or a pretext . ... The overwhelming attempt to destroy the Jews turned into its opposite : the holocaust left in its wake a Jewish people more existentially , if not necessarily politically , unified than ever before . The destruction of fascism initiated what has become a strengthened commitment to the values of the liberal state .... " ( p. 134 ) . Still , as the author notes , the Protocols , and content based on them , knowingly or not , can be found in considerable quantity on the Internet . The author suggests , however , that promotion of material based on the Protocols , and analogous material , is the work of people who are " on the fringe " , and that " its use by extremist groups actually helps antifascists and humanists track them and their activities " ( p. 138 ) . <p> Finally , the author reflects on such matters as the relationship of so-called postmodernist and anti-Enlightenment attitudes toward antisemitism , on the extent to which " Antisemitism is the stupid answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs ? " ( p. 140 ) , and " if antisemitism is no longer a threat in the terms of times past , what does this imply for Jews and for Judaism ? " ( p. 147 ) . 69404 @qwx479404

But as Nicholas Wall reminds us in his important new book , relations were difficult between the two nations precisely because of a mutual dependence . The United States counted on France as the critical cornerstone of NATO . This explains the repeated interventions in the post-war years to shore up the fledgling Fourth Republic . Although American interference in French domestic politics declined after 1954 , the fear of a French lapse into neutralism--whether under Pierre Mendes-France or Guy Mollet--remained acute . For her part , France was desperately dependent on American aid-be it economic , military or diplomatic-in her attempts to retain her colonial empire . The problem of course was that the United States was rarely sympathetic to France 's desire to retain its colonies . To be sure , the wartime American hostility to France 's Indo-Chinese colonies evaporated with the onset of the Cold War , the Communist victory in China in 1949 and the Korean War . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Indo-China than she spent on the Marshall Plan . <p> But Algeria was a different matter . French governments strove mightily to persuade the United Sates that the war in Algeria was part of the larger struggle against Communism , and that Algeria was merely the beleaguered southern flank of NATO . But American policy makers saw through such arguments . John Foster Dulles , his notorious anxieties about an omnipresent Communism notwithstanding , rejected the equation of the Algerian Front de la Liberation Nationale ( FLN ) with Communism . From his perspective , the French attempts to crush the FLN risked driving moderate Arab nations and much of the emerging Third World into the staunchly anti-colonial Soviet camp . And , while the French persisted in the polite fiction that Algeria was an integral part of France , American observers were not blind to the fact that French military pre-occupation with Algeria effectively ensured that few French troops would be available for the defense of Western Europe . Indeed , as Wall notes , one of the many ironies in this story is that when Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1962 , this had little practical effect on the military resources at its disposal . <p> As a consequence , from the outbreak of the Algerian conflict the United States urged on France a " liberal " policy . In terms of specifics this " liberal " policy was vague but it involved direct negotiations with the Algerian rebels , leading to some form of autonomy and not excluding independence . French governments , from Mendes-France on , gave lip service to such " liberal " policies but , Americans would observe , such policies took distinctly second place to efforts to crush the rebellion . Worse , such efforts took forms calculated to complicate and imperil American attempts to win over the newly emerging states . French involvement in the Suez affair was the classic case , but so too was the French hijacking of a Moroccan passenger plane in order to capture the Algerian rebel leader , Ahmed Ben Bella . Seen in France as something of a coup , in the eyes of America and the rest of the world it was a clear case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of February 1958 when the French air force , flying American fighters and bombers , attacked the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef , suspected of harboring FLN fighters . In the process they killed several scores of Tunisian civilians . Not only did this poison relations with Habib Bourguiba 's moderate and thoroughly anti-Communist regime , but it suggested to Americans-and to a later generation of historians-that the Fourth Republic had lost control over its military . On this point Wall suggests , as he often does in this remarkable book , that both the Americans and subsequent historians might have got it wrong . On his account , the French military were acting in accordance with standing orders that had been approved by the French government . <p> American irritation with the French was matched by French suspicions of the United States . The very restrained American contacts with the FLN were seen by French intelligence as a vast plot by " Les Anglo-Saxons " to move in on the Saharan oil reserves .

No one suffered any illusions about how difficult de Gaulle could be , but he did offer the possibility of effective government and he was believed to be a " liberal " on Algeria . So the events of May-June 1958 were greeted with a cautious optimism by the American government . <p> Were these hopes well founded ? The traditional view has been : only partially .

" The General , he bluntly observes , " was not and never would be close to becoming the plaster saint that a recent semi-official French historiography has made of him " ( p. 259 ) . In the first place , Wall stresses the continuities between de Gaulle 's Fifth Republic and the regime it replaced .

De Gaulle , he argues , did not come to power with the intention of rescuing France from the Algerian morass . To the contrary , he wanted to do what his supporters , in France and Algeria expected him to do : preserve Algerie Francais . Granted , knowing exactly what de Gaulle meant when he declared before the crowds in Algiers on 4 June 1958 : " Je vous ai compris " has long bedeviled historians . Those who believe that de Gaulle had long ago reconciled himself to Algerian independence can cite certain private conversations to that effect . Those who believe he was lying on 4 June can cite very different confidences . No one , Wall notes , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up on French Algeria . The problem is compounded by the fact that , as Wall admits , it is not clear that the General knew his own mind . Still , nothing in the policies de Gaulle adopted in his first eighteen month in power suggest any commitment to Algerian independence . The Constantine Plan , involving as it did the commitment of vast resources to Algerian economic development , was not an obvious complement to any scheme for letting Algeria go . Even more strikingly , the Challe plan , adopted in January of 1959 , was clearly a plan for the military reconquest of Algeria . It displaced over a million Muslim villagers into what were often glorified concentration camps , created " free fire zones " and dramatically increased the body count of Algerian rebels . Successful though the Challe plan was , in a narrow military sense , its implementation strikes Wall as seriously inconsistent with any vision of an independent Algeria . Only when the Challe plan failed to break the resolve of the FLN did de Gaulle consider other possibilities , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . <p> Wall therefore flatly rejects the proposition that for de Gaulle , liquidating the Algerian adventure was the necessary pre-condition for an independent French foreign policy , a multi-polar view of the world designed to replace the Anglo-American bipolar view . To the contrary , according to Wall , French retention of Algeria--in whatever form-was central to de Gaulle 's essential bipolar foreign policy . In essence , a France strengthened by her African connections-the famous " Eurafrican " vision inherited from his predecessors-could be an equal partner with the two Anglo-Saxon powers . The quid pro quo was obvious . If the United States wanted unequivocal support over Quemoy and Matsu or over the Congo , all they need do was acknowledge French preponderance in North Africa and be less obstreperous about French negotiations with the FLN . <p> Unfortunately for De Gaulle , the Americans did not take this bait , the Kennedy administration even less so that the Eisenhower one . As a result , de Gaulle 's Algerian gambit failed miserably and he was reduced to the petulant sniping at the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There emerges from this study a consistently negative portrait of de Gaulle . Far from being the farsighted diplomat that his admirers have so often depicted , he was in fact a hidebound and blinkered bungler . His obdurate refusal to recognize Algerian realities needlessly prolonged the war ( which lasted longer under him than under the miserable Fourth Republic ) , unnecessarily increased the human suffering , played into the hands of the more radical elements in the FLN and generally produced what Wall describes as the " worst of all possible outcomes " ( p. 252 ) . The rest of his period in power was characterized by shallow and ineffectual posturing . Willi Brandt did more than de Gaulle ever could to overcome the East-West divide . De Gaulle 's massive spending on nuclear arms achieved little and ensured only that France would not invest sufficiently in higher education-for which de Gaulle would pay the price in 1968 . <p> Given the subject matter this is bound to be a controversial interpretation and one that will not command universal assent . But it is argued with exceptional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of the archival sources both in France and the United States .

While the germinal seed of this interest can be traced to passages of Edmundo O'Gorman , La invencion de America ( 1958 ) , studies of discovery and conquest emphasizing humanistic analyses of discourse , text , icon , symbol , and performance have lately flourished among a new generation of literary scholars and cultural critics. 1 Ceremonies of Possession , however , is the work of a broad-minded historian , and thus stands as a potential ( and much-needed ) bridge between literary and historical approaches to this topic . Ceremonies of Possession also contributes to the field of " comparative colonial studies " --an increasingly interdisciplinary sub-field of the social sciences2--by tackling the question of how European colonialism(s) of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were outgrowths of distinctive national-cultural traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives , Seed writes : " Homogenizing colonialism by insisting that it is a single undifferentiated European project has thus prevented us from understanding how contemporary struggles ... have taken distinct political directions in different regions of the Americas " ( p. 15 ) . By countering this universalizing tendency , Seed has laid important groundwork for future scholars interested in examining the institutional and discursive relationships linking early colonial arrangements in the New World to the later systems of imperialism that flourished worldwide in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . <p> Utilizing a comparative framework to treat the explorational activities and colonial legacies of five nascent nation-states of early modern Europe , Seed 's slender but dense volume attempts to isolate essential differences in 1 ) each European society 's initial approach to the New World , 2 ) the nature of their first contacts with Amerindian " others , " and 3 ) the mechanics of consolidating and maintaining their respective overseas colonies . To do so , Seed tapped three " fundamental sources " : " ' everyday life , ' ... common colloquial language , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her credit , Seed has reversed the usual priorities of historians by placing an emphasis on the two former sources and by reading law codes in ways that emphasize their linkages with vernacular customs , speech , and practices . One revisionist premise of the book is that these expressions of proto-national culture played much stronger roles than did commonly inherited traditions like Greco-Roman legalism and Medieval Christianity in determining the types of arguments and symbolism of authority deployed by each nation in the New World ( cf. pp. 185-87 ) . Thus by carefully examining rituals , practices , and texts of possession against the inherited traditions that conditioned them , Seed endeavors to fashion a kind of " comparative grammar " of early European conquest and colonialism . At its starkest level , Seed 's book is reducible to the following formula : " Englishmen held that they acquired rights to the New World by physical objects , Frenchmen by gestures , Spaniards by speech , Portuguese by numbers , Dutch by description " ( p. 179 ) . After summarizing the basic arguments and methods of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strengths and weaknesses of the work . <p> SUMMARY <p> Chapter 1 ( " Houses , Gardens , and Fences : Signs of English Possession in the New World " ) attempts to map out a distinctively English cultural complex associated with the foundation and possession of territorial units . After noting how the first written accounts of English occupation in North America prominently featured descriptions of building houses , planting gardens , and erecting fences or hedges , Seed first traces the background of these practices , commenting on their meanings in medieval custom and common law . To recover the cultural logic of these meanings , Seed probes the etymological layers and historical usages of a half-dozen key words in the English language : " improvement " ( p. 24 ) , " garden " and " gardening " ( pp. 25-27 ) , the " wild/cultivated " dichotomy ( p. 28 ) , " planting " ( pp. 29-30 ) , " husbandry " ( p. 30 ) , " replenishing " and " subduing " ( pp. 31-35 ) . In particular , Seed shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the earth and subdue it " --Gen . I:28 ) , was uniquely linked to agriculture and land possession in numerous folk incantations , " field rituals , " and sermons in medieval England . Without using the terms " discursive formation " or " ideology , " Seed nonetheless implies that a pervasive , deep-seated cultural symbolism , centering on metaphors of gardening , accompanied and legitimated English acts of delineating territorial spaces . In the New World , Englishmen would come to regard this symbolism as self-evident and universal in the face of conflicting claims with other European nations. 3 In the end , Seed argues that English proprietorship in North America was mainly based on " clear acts " ( erecting fences , hedges , and houses ) and customary understandings of those acts , rather than on legalistic theories of " discovery " or " just occupation " as contained in written documents . <p> In contrast to the folk-derived " clear acts " of English possession , French explorers enacted multi-faceted , time-consuming ceremonies of possession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French court . Using a combination of historicist and semiotic analyses , Seed looks at the transformation of French ceremonies in the New World , and considers their function within French colonial strategies of " captivating " native populations by consent and alliance . Having consulted a handful of accounts of French encounters with indigenous peoples along the coasts of Brazil , Florida , and the Caribbean , Seed begins Chapter 2 ( " Ceremonies : The Theatrical Rituals of French Political Possession " ) by examining the most complete account on record : Sieur Razilly 's landing on the Brazilian coast in 1612 . Over the course of several months , Razilly and his companions staged elaborately orchestrated religious processions , interspersed by long periods of waiting , trading , and conversing with the local Tupi inhabitants to assay the " sincerity and good affections of the Indians . " Once the Razilly had received ample assurance of the Tupis ' intention to embrace Catholicism and join the French , a third , strictly political procession was staged : " the standard of our King of France " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vassalage to the king , and amid a din of trumpets , tambors , and musket-fire , an alliance was sealed . In the history of cultural encounters in the New World , this sequence of ceremonies is unique for its level of theatricality and its attention to the responses of the native people involved . <p> In a subsequent section of this chapter , Seed sketches out the inherited traditions that undergirded such ceremonies and gave them special prominence among the French as mechanisms of possession . First , Seed establishes how the semantic field of the word " ceremony " in French--simultaneously connoting qualities of " complexity , seriousness , and order " --differed remarkably from its perjorative primary meaning of " affectation " in other European languages ( pp. 48-49 ) . Second , she looks at the history of French coronation ceremonialism from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century , noting that the scale and significance of French succession rituals was unrivaled in the rest of Europe ( pp. 50-54 ) . Citing French canon and legal theorists Hotman and Bodin , who held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hereditary monarchy , " Seed argues that it was actually the coronation event , publicly performed in the presence of the masses , and not divine disposition , that confirmed and legitimated the political power of the French royal house ( pp. 51-52 ) . <p> Along with strategies of political alliance based on native consent , public ceremonialism served as a key mechanism for establishing and maintaining French political power in the New World . In keeping with her overall purpose , Seed argues that a historically constructed cultural logic permeated both French symbolic modes of establishing authority ( ceremonies integrating the participation and feedback of subject communities ) as well as French strategic modes of maintaining power ( e.g. , trading luxury goods or forming military alliances based on voluntary consent ) . <p> Chapter 3 ( " The Requirement : A Protocol for Conquest " ) examines a legacy of conquest unique to Spain . The requerimiento was a written statement that all Spanish adventurers and colonists were obligated to read aloud ( usually without benefit of translators ) before subjugating indigenous peoples . Composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the requirement has long been known to students of Spanish-American history not only for being a basic source on Spanish notions of conquest as " just war , " but also for its abundance of textual inconsistencies , which occasionally border on the absurd . To cite one example , the text of the requirement states : " We will not compel you to turn Christians . But if you do not ... I will enter forcefully against you , and I will make war everywhere and however I can , and I will subject you to the yoke ... of authority of .... " ( p. 69 ) . Thus , besides its status as a canonical historical source , the requirement is also one of history 's enduring conundrums . In this chapter , Seed seeks to provide a satisfactory solution . <p> Notable for its etymological plumbs into key legal , martial , and political concepts , and for its rigorously cited synthesis of extant scholarship on Christian and Islamic Spain , Seed 's " archaeological " inquiry into the the origins of the requirement concludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions to a far greater extent than previously realized . The perplexing features of the document--which was regarded in its day by some Spaniards as " ludicrously and tragically naive ( Gibson , Spain in America , 1966 ) , utilized later by Protestant commentators as evidence of the depravity of the Spanish soul , and today recognized by us as idiosyncratic , if not paradoxical--are , in fact , the product of a hybridization of cultural logics alien to the main trunk-line of Western intellectual thought. 4 Seed demonstrates how the concept of jihad , a term meaning " fighting according to the proper legal principles " ( p. 72 ) , approximates the requirement 's notion of " just war , " and how one of those " proper legal principles , " the da a or " double summons " preceding a battle , was an Islamic precursor for the later Spanish practice of reading a formal speech prior to subjugating native Americans . Furthermore , Seed effectively maps out several plausible pathways whereby these Islamic concepts--as well as important institutions like tribute-collecting ( jizya ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 ) , and ethnically segregated townships ( ahl al-dhimma ) ( pp. 84-88 ) --reemerged in the sixteenth century as important colonial practices and policies in Spanish America . <p> Although the Muslim " core " of the requirement was seriously challenged by Las Casas in his debates with Sepulveda in 1550 , it was not until 1573 that significant changes of wording severed the document from its Moorish moorings ( p. 95 ) . By that time , the major part of Spain 's conquest of indigenous territories had been completed . Thus , in Seed 's calculus of comparative colonialism , the requirement was the most pervasive instrument for extending Spanish political power in the Americas . <p> Chapter 4 ( " A New Sky and New Stars : Arabic and Hebrew Science , Portuguese Seamanship , and the Discovery of America " ) examines Portugal 's use of its own Muslim and Judaic intellectual past . Whereas Spain incorporated certain legalistic-political traditions in framing its overseas colonial policies , Portugal inherited the lion 's share of Iberian Arabic-Hebrew scientific traditions--a circumstance owing both to historical conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iberia in the mid-thirteenth century , Islamic traditions of religious toleration facilitated a climate of intellectual exchange between Muslim and Jewish scholars . One outcome of these collaborations was the production of a sizable body of Arabic scientific literature written ( with commentaries ) in Hebrew . Later under Christian rule , this corpus of knowledge and its Jewish caretakers would prove vital to Portuguese seafaring advances. 5 <p> In the fifteenth century , the challenge of navigating the unfamiliar currents , winds and tides of the southern hemisphere ( as well as its unknown nighttime skies ) , led Portugal to be the first Christian kingdom of early modern Europe to make use of trigonometry and the astrolabe , both of which they inherited from the Muslim world . Trigonometry , for instance , had been perfected for the purpose of orienting new constructions of mosques to face toward Mecca ( p. 119 ) . In the hands of Portuguese navigators , trigonometry became an indispensable tool for establishing the exact position of caravels as they tacked in and away from shore ( sometimes for weeks at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu of " coasting " after they encountered strong head-winds beyond Cape Bojador ( pp. 108-11 ) . Improvements to the astrolabe , notably its conversion from a nighttime to a daytime instrument for measuring the height of the sun and fixing one 's latitudinal position at sea , represented an even more spectacular implementation of Islamic knowledge ( pp. 120-28 ) . Later , such breakthroughs at sea were replicated on land in the form of new surveying techniques for delineating property boundaries and the limits of political jurisdictions . Rather than being based on landscape features ( rivers , hills , trees ) as they were in English and Spanish colonies , Portuguese land boundaries comprised imaginary lines expressed in terms of degrees ( angles ) and leagues ( distance ) . This assertion of space over place--that is , of measurements that could be independently verified by precision instruments as opposed to boundary traditions preserved by human ( and thus fallible ) caretakers of local knowledge--constituted one of the triumphs of Portuguese scientific imagination . <p> Much of Seed 's presentation in this section is narratively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple sub-plots of technical problems and solutions , ever fortuitously converging with prior information and designs , finally culminate in the " great " discovery or invention . Here , however , Seed is less concerned with those Portuguese feats known to schoolboys ( Vasco da Gama 's rounding of the Cape of Good Hope or Magellan 's circumnavigation of the globe ; or even the lesser-known discovery of Brazil or the first accurate astronomical description of the Southern Cross ) , but rather with how this legacy of scientific prowess translated into unique discourses of rightful possession . At first the Portuguese held that the mere fact of " discovery " or " first sighting " conferred possession , since these feats were accomplished by means of instruments and knowledge which they alone had developed . Later , the Portuguese would legitimate possession by producing highly accurate measurements of boundaries disputed with other European powers ( i.e. , " fixing by numbers " ) . Seed shows how this unique Portuguese legacy can be discerned from the Tordesillas Compromise of 1494 to present-day Brazilian property laws . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portuguese " ) , Seed looks at the epic rise of Dutch navigation and colonial adventurism in the seventeenth century as both a continuation and a rupture with Portuguese precedents . The existence of strong commercial ties between Lisbon and Antwerp fostered the transfer of Portuguese nautical expertise , arriving either in the form of navigational treatises or as first-hand knowledge acquired by Dutch sailors serving on Portuguese vessels . Not surprisingly then , the Dutch initially adopted the Portuguese-inspired notion that " discovery " alone , in the absence of visible signs of previous inhabitation , conferred the legal right of possession . In the over-competitive seas of the seventeenth century , however , " discovery " or " first presence " arguments would prove insufficient , especially as England and France ( with their large home populations ) were actively promoting " settlement " as the yardstick of legitimate possession abroad . Instead , the Dutch would eventually come to adopt the novel view that " commerce " --that is , constant sailing and trading in a specific area--was the basis for legitimating their possessions . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etymological sub-stratum and historical usages of key words with great success . After establishing the existence of a network of denotative relations between the Dutch words for " discovery , " " discrimination " ( i.e. , " meticulous sighting " ) and " description , " she goes on to highlight passages in Dutch-authored travelogues and geographies that suggest connotative equivalencies between " describing " and " claiming " ( pp. 161-63 ) . According to Seed , " description " was , in fact , more than a metaphor for the Dutch ; it was a mechanism of possession . It was by " industries of description " that the Dutch broadcast their overseas claims and colonial aspirations to the rest of Europe , for the best maps ( bearing Dutch place-names ) and the most accurate written accounts of world geography were produced in Antwerp and Amsterdam in the seventeenth century ( pp. 162-65 ) . <p> EVALUATION <p> Because of its ambitious scope , Ceremonies of Possession presented its author with overlapping challenges in the handling of sources , research design , and finished presentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparati of early modern colonialisms required sifting through an incredible amount of secondary historical scholarship ( produced in different national contexts and languages ) . Moreover , primary documents left by the agents and state bureaucracies of these colonial societies differed greatly in quantity and kind . In addressing these obstacles , Seed shows herself to be resourceful and creative , crafting a vessel capable of holding a heady swirl of disparate documentation within a cohesive whole . <p> In dealing with the almost prohibitive abundance of existing scholarship , Seed condensed her questions of inquiry to a manageable set of related themes : ceremonies of original possession ( acts of foundation , conquests , discoveries ) ; ceremonies for maintaining possession ( processions , boundary surveys ) ; legal and political arguments for legitimating possession ; and the " technologies " used for claiming possession ( cartography , astronomy , nautical science , etc . ) . She often uses narrative modes to introduce these themes , drawing closely on her sources to recreate case scenarios that effectively sensitize modern readers to specific social realities in the historical past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis to the documentation available for each society , Seed let the uneven nature of her sources determine specific approaches for each chapter . Often Ceremonies of Possession seems more like a collection of similar but autonomous essays . The chapter on the Spanish requirement , for example , expends far more energy tracing the Islamic-Iberian genealogy of a single text ; while the chapters on French processions and English " acts of possession " focus more on performances and constructions in New World contexts . Complicating the symmetry of her analysis further , the requirement was mainly a relic of the first half of the sixteenth century , confined to first-encounter situations between Spaniards and Amerindians , while the aforesaid English and French practices were used to establish , consolidate , and maintain possession over longer periods. 6 Thus Seed 's comparisons sometimes suffer a kind of apples-and-oranges syndrome . To combat this idiosyncrasy , Seed devoted a few pages at the end of each chapter ( and in the case of chapter 4 , creating a separate appendix ) for integrating her discussions and many excursions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not so easily resolved . Underlying Seed 's stated purpose of treating the " rationales and legitimation ... of imperial power as cultural constructions ... having a certain logic with respect to the cultural , political , economic , ecological and social history of each nation " ( p. 13 , italics mine ) , there is a tension , perhaps endemic to all comparative-historical studies , between essentialist and historicist modes of inquiry and argumentation . In uncovering and plotting the " logics " of different variants of early modern European colonialism ( which , with some qualification , are portrayed as unitary ) , Seed posits the existence of collective national behaviors and inductively reduces these to a set of essential differences . Although Seed tenaciously endeavored to contextualize each country 's legitimating discourses , possession ceremonies , and acquisitional technologies as historically unfolding phenomena , limitations of space ( and perhaps of time and energy ) prohibited her from realizing full serial analyses . As it stands , Seed 's convictions about the different " national logics " that informed the apparati of early modern colonialisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genealogies necessarily permit . <p> What distinguishes Cerermonies of Possession among works by historians of colonial Latin America is the weight placed on language , discourse , and culture as dynamic agents , not mere epiphenomena , in the articulation of colonial power . Seed has wandered far from the legal-political and economic-structural paths that formerly charted the study of colonialism . At the same time , the present work complements these approaches by dealing almost exclusively with the " dominant " half of the European-Indigenous equation , widely exploring and explicating the cultural field of the conquerers . By widening the definition of culture to include " familiar language , gestures , and objects , " Seed 's book advances us beyond older , but still common interpretations of early modern colonialism as being intellectually inspired and ideologically cemented by notions of universal Christianity or legacies of Roman imperialism . Some may complain that Ceremonies of Possession overindulges in topics that have little bearing on visible forms of social change , perhaps like a medieval map girded with monsters and chimera at its margins . Perhaps . To my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of a portulans or early coastal chart drawn from the first-hand experience of mariners . As Charles Olson wrote of Columbus ' cartographer in his poem " On First Looking Out Through Juan de la Cosa 's Eyes " : " ... before La Cosa , nobody/ could have/ a mappenmunde " So too here . As a map-making endeavor , Seed 's book traverses over immense stretches of **26;1291;TOOLONG of it outside her specific area of expertise . It remains to be seen if this book will inspire interdisciplinary scholars to further explore the differences among European colonialisms and chart the linkages that exist between the symbolic and material sides of this history . I 'm optimistic . <p> 2 . The literature of this field includes Nicholas B. Dirks'Conquest and Colonialism ( 1992 ) , an edited collection of essays that attempts to articulate common themes across regions , as well as an agenda for future comparative investigations . Monographic studies like Karen Vieira Powers ' Andean Journeys : Migration , Ethnogenesis , and the State in Colonial Quito ( 1995 ) and Vicente Rafael 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Early Spanish Rule ( 1988 ) , although focused on particular regions , can also be included here because their projects have been deliberately designed in light of current , general debates about colonialism and resistance , and thus generate conclusions readily accessible to scholars working outside these geographical areas . <p> 3 . Evidence of the persistence of this symbolism can be found in the eighteenth-century naval logs of Capt . Cook and , to a lesser degree , in the U.S. Homestead Act of 1862 ( pp. 35-36 ) . <p> 5 . According to Seed , " Jewish scholars were probably politically far more acceptable to Portuguese royalty than were Islamic ones , " since Portugal 's mission against Islam had been envisioned as an ideological and militaristic crusade . Portuguese scientific inheritance was further aided in 1391 after a series of pogroms against Jewish communities erupted across Castile ( followed in 1412 by anti-Semitic legislation in Aragon ) , resulting in the migration of many Jewish scholars to Lisbon over the course of the fifteenth century--the heyday of Portuguese nautical science ( pp. 118-19 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Jews in Portugal would play a role in debilitating Portuguese nautical and scientific superiority in Europe ( pp. 135-36 ) . <p> 6 . Another observation on this point : In her attempt to economize , Seed settled on a shorthand approach whereby " characteristic " forms of ceremony and practice stand in as symptomatic of national tendencies . This creates certain problems . To reduce the Spanish colonizing complex to the requirement , for instance , is to impoverish the full variety of localized forms of possession enacted by the Spaniards . Why does Seed analyze a text for the Spanish and examine accounts of " acts " and " processions " for the English and French , respectively , when accounts of Spanish town founding-rituals , including the planting of crosses and ceremoniously " walking off " streets and plazas , abound in the archives of Latin America ? 69401 @qwx479401

Still , Marshall is clear that in both the Atlantic and Indian cases the responses of local elites ( and their relationship with their British counterparts ) explains the divergent paths between " unmaking " and " making " empire . For instance , Marshall stresses that the American colonists did not view British expansion ( in this sense ) as a threat , but rather as the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in India a series of situational alliances between local elites and representatives of the empire lacked the same sense of shared commitment . Despite some fears that this expansion could harbor threats to British virtue that echoed the examples of Rome and Spain , these concerns for potential despotism or tyranny were more commonly articulated in response to the second of Marshall 's categories : empire . As used by Marshall , empire refers to ideas of coercion and rule as seen through the imperial ambitions and capacities of the British state . He notes that , in both political and military senses , Britain was increasingly skilled at waging war and defending the territory gained , and links these developments to the willingness of Parliament to exert its authority at home and abroad . As Marshall observes , the danger of this change in strategy arose when confronted with the dominant vision of empire held by the British during this time as being " Protestant , commercial , maritime , and free " ( p. 6 ) . In order to explain how Parliament 's actions and attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully explores three chronological periods , highlighting the growing tensions throughout the emerging imperial system , stressing the crucial years between 1763 and 1776 . <p> Marshall begins by examining events prior to and during the Seven Years ' War , culminating in the first Peace of Paris ( 1763 ) . According to Marshall , the importance of these events stems from the territorial gains that emerged , albeit in different manners , in both America and India . In the Atlantic sphere , the lands gained from France are cited as providing a crucial impetus for reframing government authority . While the colonists argued that their contributions to the war entitled them to envision their relationship with Britain as a " compact " of equals , the need to defend this new territory and control trade led Parliament to call for new administrative solutions that conflicted with colonial aspirations for near-autonomy . Thus , while the colonists saw the events of 1754-63 as producing a more " integrated " empire , leading figures in the metropole were led to reconsider the very basis of their empire , increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marshall clearly shows how , despite British efforts to manipulate local elites , " they often ended up being themselves manipulated for Indian purposes " ( p. 120 ) . The fluid political system in India during this time , coupled with the rivalry with France , gave the British ample opportunities to intervene and the East India Company seized upon these chances , particularly in forming a mutually beneficial alliance with Muhammad Ali Khan . For instance , in Bengal , the grant of the diwani , or revenue authority , to the Company in 1765 ensured a steady and profitable stream of revenue , but also deepened the interdependence of the British and local Indian elites . As the Company and the British government came to rely upon these resources , territorial control and defense became increasingly essential for the overall health of the empire . In each of these cases , the expanded calls for government authority , sparked by the acquisition of new territory , resulted in policy changes that ran counter to traditional British theories of empire that had valorized its " free " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the period between 1763 and 1776 , carefully showing how British and colonial elites engaged in a struggle to define the nature of political authority within the empire . In America , Parliamentary efforts to exert more control resulted in colonial fears of an encroaching " universal monarchy " that would undermine their freedoms . Whereas American writers such as James Otis stridently denounced the decay of British virtue and the rise of inflexible government coercion , his British counterparts contended that rising taxes were merely a realistic response to the growing costs of the imperial system . Marshall describes the problem facing British policy-makers in terms of competing strategies of assimilation and accommodation ; namely , should Britain " try to assimilate the king 's new subjects to British norms or to accept the existence of a new diversity within the empire " ( p. 183 ) . While the natural tendency of Whitehall leaned toward the former , the economic and political challenges of controlling and defending the Atlantic colonies made this a difficult task . As the British sought to convince colonial elites to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing sense of affinity between the colonies themselves that weakened the earlier ties between the metropole and the peripheries . During the 1770s , the British did endeavor to buttress support for Parliament and undermine the growing inter-colonial affinities by adopting different tactics for each colony , but these efforts too were doomed to fail as the gap between the realities of empire and the tradition of " freedom " became more apparent . In India , the British faced a similar problem during this period , as the commercial and military importance of these colonies increased . Just as in the Atlantic , the British sought to tailor their imperial apparatus to each of the presidencies under their control , eschewing the use of a uniform system of government throughout all India . Although most successful in Bengal , the East India Company and the British government worked closely with local Indian elites , who were more receptive than their American counterparts due to their understanding of empire : here the lack of shared cultural touchstones weakened the appeal of assimilation , and accommodation became the governing watchword . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar strategies in both the Atlantic and India , the attitudes and ideas of the local elites were primarily responsible for the divergent results in each case . <p> The final chronological period Marshall examines covers 1776 to 1783 , during which the results of these earlier strategies came to fruition . Returning to his original framework , Marshall contends that after 1783 expansion and empire moved on separate trajectories , although there was a continued commitment to empire . In the Atlantic , the sense of shared culture and ideals of an " empire of common Britishness ... broke apart on the rock of different interpretations of Britishness " ( p. 374 ) . Earlier models of assimilation became untenable as the empire that emerged from the Peace of Paris ( 1783 ) incorporated a markedly different population . While the Atlantic trade continued to be profitable , the growing importance of the diwani revenue meant that India was an increasingly crucial piece of the imperial system and received correspondingly greater attention from British policy-makers . Still , Marshall forcefully concludes by stressing that in each case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stemmed from the attitudes of local elites , since " imperial purposes appeared to be compatible with the interests of significant Indian elites , especially in Bengal , while American elites found them incompatible with their interests as well as ideologically repugnant " ( p. 378 ) . Thus , in the end , control of India was not a compensation for the loss of the American colonies , but rather the result of the manner by which the similar policies were accepted or rejected by the periphery . By exploring these developments , Marshall 's study provides an important service to those interested in bridging the gap between domestic and imperial histories of Britain during a crucial period . <p> Note <p> 1 .

This image so caught his attention that he whipped out his camera and captured it for posterity . Skip ahead in time to his return to the U.S. After he developed the film , he showed the picture around to various anthropologists and friends . One replied : " We know they 're all machos in Mexico . " <p> Thus begins anthropologist Matthew Gutmann 's journey into the worlds of Mexican men . To enter these worlds , Gutmann , along with his wife and seven-week old daughter , moved to Santo Domingo , a working-class colonia neighborhood , my translation ; hereafter , unless otherwise noted , all translations are Gutmann 's in Mexico City and the setting for this ethnographic study . In his book , he attacks--and puts to rest--the widely-held notion that there is a single , all-pervasive Mexican masculinity that of the " macho . " <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philandering , gun- and guitar-toting man , who 's sometimes lazy , other times hard-working , often hot-headed , frequently slow to anger--Gutmann claims , can be found in works as diverse as those of Oscar Lewis , Evelyn Stevens , and David Gilmore 1 , among other anthropologists . Under no circumstances would this " macho " dirty his hands changing diapers , cutting up vegetables , or washing dishes that would be " women 's work . " Absolutely no " macho " would let his wife be seen in public without him , unless , of course , she were walking the kids to school or buying food at the local market . And only he has the right to inhabit the streets after dark , to go wherever he pleases whenever it pleases him . <p> In this suggestive and compelling ethnography , Gutmann argues that not one , but a variety of masculinities are in play in today 's complicated worlds of Mexico City . After all , Mexico City , or el distrito federal ( DF ) --is a highly cosmopolitan , global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamburger as a taco , where cell phones , Los Simpson , and luxury gated communities butt up against corrugated cardboard " homes , " and where children shine shoes and sell gum on streets in a city home to more than 20 million residents . <p> While not directly tackling the thorny issue of whether or not " the macho " ever predominated as " the " masculinity in Mexico , Gutmann 's study instead reveals the real-life complexities of Mexican masculinity that exists today , by asking what " being a man " means . This meaning , negotiated and re-negotiated in daily practices and rituals enacted in multiple sites , is made not just by men , says Gutmann , but by men " and women . " <p> Moreover , just as Mexico City inhabits both the global and the local , Mexican masculinity , asserts the author , is also struggled over not in isolation but " in relation to the changes in cultural beliefs and practices that have occurred in urban Mexico over the course of several decades of local and global upheaval . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the complex lives of this working-class community should provide a potent antidote to the notion that especially virulent strains of sexism are found only in Mexico " ( pp. 11 , 4 ) . <p> Yet , although Gutmann provides that needed corrective and adds much to the literature both on masculinity and on contemporary Mexico City , I nevertheless found the book somewhat disappointing , due to underlying conceptual problems that often obscure the insight of Gutmann 's work . <p> The initial chapter outlines Gutmann 's basic argument--that masculinity is not static but continually contested--and lays out where this continuous action takes place on the ground . Yet , Gutmann claims , any study must account for both structure and agency . We must never forget that we are " all , in a very real sense , products of our societies . What constitutes good and bad gender identities my emphasis , the use of which is a subject for an entire other review or discussion and relations for women and men in Santo Domingo is not knowable through abstract discourse on culture " ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must instead analyze the daily practices of masculinity , " examples of what men say and do among themselves , and occasionally with women " --and use them " as illustrative of several central issues , from images of what to be a man means to different men and women at different times , to move towards a degendering of certain aspects of daily life among sections of the urban poor today in Mexico . " <p> Teasing through what men do--and say they do--Gutmann suggests that we can and indeed must reposition working-class and poor men and women , constantly " the objects of scorn and pity , " as subjects . He contends that they do not merely " survive " under social practices but instead " have learned to manipulate the cultural rituals and social laws of machismo " ( p. 3 ) . <p> The central seven chapters--respectively titled " Imaginary Fathers , Genuine Fathers , " " Motherly Presumptions and Presumptuous Mothers , " " Men 's Sex , " " Diapers and Dishes , Words and Deeds , " " Degendering Alcohol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Machismo " --explore the multiplicity of ways that men act as fathers , sons , husbands , and sexual beings . Interestingly , the book dedicates no specific chapter to exploring men 's relationship to work or as worker , the label that " man " and masculinity is often so closely linked to or conflated with . Here he lays out in great detail the numerous and varied ways in which men " perform " their masculinity , using not only men 's words and perspectives , but women 's , as well . <p> In " Motherly Presumptions and Presumptuous Mothers , " Gutmann focuses on the role that mothers play in making their sons boys and eventually men . He contends quite convincingly that " most men define their masculinity in relation to the women in their lives ... As often as not for these men , manliness is seen as whatever women are not " ( p. 89 ) . This chapter also shows the reader the richness and texture of community life , by exploring the multiple spaces and ways that women can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about women 's liberation , " traditional " female roles , and how women act today to unearth ideas about la mujer abnegada o liberada ( the submissive , self-sacrificing , and long-suffering woman or the liberated woman ) . Even though los Santodomingues ( residents of Santo Domingo ) have both a collective memory of women as active--even central--participants in the community , the author laments that most women and girls continue to bear the weight of traditional divisions of labor and cultural ideas . Still , " a transformation is taking place in the ways of thinking and doing , ushering in novel gender arrangements and imaginings " ( p. 110 ) . <p> Yet for all that Gutmann has done to erase the notion that all Mexican men , regardless of their class or sexuality , educational background , ethnicity or location within the country , aspire to , and act like , " the macho " ; for all he has accomplished in making Mexican masculinities more complicated , fluid , and changing--both of which are substantial achievements--the book has certain flaws too critical to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born to Die , " defines the study 's key terms and lays out the theoretical issues important to the project and methodological framework with which this study engages . Gutmann relies principally on Antonio Gramsci 's " hegemony " and " contradictory consciousness " ( here defined as tensions resulting from both a consciousness inherited uncritically from the past and one more experientially based ) , and Raymond Williams ' " emergent cultural practice " ( the idea that " culture " is not fixed but allows individuals to be cultural creators ) , which he , in turn , calls " cultural creativity . " <p> This chapter , however , is not particularly helpful in illuminating the richest part of Gutmann 's material , the minute details of the daily lives of the residents of Santo Domingo . First , none of these elaborately-constructed theories directly engages the concrete pressures facing today 's Santodomingueses . In that realm , the men and women Gutmann quotes speak much better for themselves . And secondly , although the theories themselves address issues of change , the book itself does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . For example , Gutmann insists early on that " by talking to and being with fathers and mothers , he learned to better distinguish between cultural customs that have been uncritically adopted from the past my emphasis and new ways of challenging these manners and habits that the men and women in Santo Domingo are creating every day " ( pp. 50-51 ) . However , in this book there is no specific past . As used , this term conveys some previous , all-encompassing , and unmentioned " before-today , " be it twenty or even one hundred years before . He succeeds far better at situating his material when he discusses the two cultural divides that los Santodomingueses themselves use : urban-rural and rich-poor , the former touching on the continuing internal migration from el campo ( the countryside or rural area ) to DF . Yet even here , certain boundaries crucial to his story remain under-analyzed . <p> For example , Tomas , a metalworker , once told Gutmann that machismo still ran rampant in los pueblos ( small towns ) . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought was a typical situation in the countryside : a man riding presumably a horse an hour along a path , his wife walking alongside him struggling to keep up . ' You see it all the time out there , ' he told me " ( Ibid. ; my emphasis ) . Unfortunately , Gutmann does n't tease through these divides and the necessary role they play in enabling the residents of Santo Domingo to be non-machos and thus " modern . " Instead , how los Santodomingueses position themselves as " modern " is only superficially and uncritically defined as the opposite of the backward " campo . " <p> The book 's most unsettling problem revolves around how he defines gender and the limitations that this definition imposes on how he " sees " the forms and spaces affecting the possibilities of men 's and women 's everyday lives . Gender , as the author defines it , is " the ways in which differences and similarities related to physical sexuality are understood , contested , organized and practiced by societies " ( pp. 11-12 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marking of Man and Woman with the socially-gendered beings of " man " and " woman , " and does suggest that there is a " diversity of gendered meanings , institutions , and relations within and between different social groupings " ( Ibid. ) , noticeably absent from this definition is the crucial issue of power . Difference is not the problem . The problem lies in the ways in which power is assigned to , linked with , and mobilized in those differences . It 's not enough to say , as Gutmann does , that gender(ed) differences , and their attendant practices , are continually contested . Rather , gender(ed) differences are contested specifically because those physical differences marked as significant , and the " men " and " women " they " produce , " are differently infused with and attached to power , and hierarchized within each historical context and particular space . Without understanding that power is the problem--and not difference per se--we lose the very analytical punch and explanatory insights that a gender(ed) analysis can provide . Potentially lost--or at least limited--are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender-mobilized power operating . <p> This non-power-based definition of gender is made clear in " The Invasion of Santo Domingo , " where Gutmann first describes Santo Domingo for his reader . In what could be taken as part of background information about the community , Gutmann talks about " the streets , " what he calls the " the distinguishing public spaces in the colonia " ( p. 42 ) . Yet " the streets " are not all that Gutmann makes them out to be . Nowhere in his innocent description or later in his analysis of Santo Domingo does the author really address " the street " as a gendered space within the colonia or whom this space is " open " to and when : to everyone during the day but ( primarily ) to men at night ( p. 42 ) . As anyone who studies Mexico , even cosmopolitan Mexico City , knows , " the street " is not a neutral space . Nor , for that matter , is it neutral in the United States . Yet nowhere in his vivid description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporally-gendered space , which men , women , and children inhabit during the day but which functions differently after dark . After dark , those drinking and listening to loud music on Santo Domingo 's street corners are generally men , not women . After dark " the street " is precisely the space where " decent women " do n't go , that is , unless accompanied/ " protected " by a man . While not all women observe--or can or have to observe--the " street 's " rules , men and women still talk about its unwritten limitations . Yet Gutmann never touches on " the street " or anywhere else as a gendered space , and thus overlooks the power specifically associated with men 's greater spatial and temporal access . By ignoring power as central to any definition of gender , he can not see the spaces/ways in which that power is differently mobilized and expressed in people 's lived experiences . <p> In another chapter , we again see what happens when Gutmann circumscribes gender to physical and social differences . That chapter , entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol " is part of most people 's lives in one way or another in the colonia " ( p. 175 ) . He concludes that alcohol consumption has been " degendered " for two reasons : 1 ) " far more women today drink alcoholic beverages , and in greater quantities , than they did in the past " ( Ibid. ) ; and 2 ) because men and women drink together more now than previously . According to his definition , when " there is a decentering of the perceived wisdom that associated an activity in this case , alcohol consumption especially with men or women , this process has been degendered " ( p. 190 ) . <p> Today , more women may--and do--drink in the company of men and in many social and family situations , some women drink as much as men . Still , can we really conclude that because the cantina , that bastion of male-bonding and intimacy , now allows women to grace its doors , that alcohol consumption is a degendered activity ? This substantial argumentative leap Gutmann fails to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , and how that changes , we need to explore how the meanings of these activities , engaged in by differently-gendered persons , are produced in the same and different contexts . <p> In conclusion , I wish that the author had stuck to what he does so well : illuminating for his readers the very complicated and textured lives of Santo Domingo 's men and women . In the end , this book simultaneously provides insights into the lives of residents in one neighborhood in the world 's most populated urban area , and clouds those very insights with an overwhelming deference to theories and theorists , none of which helps us to understand the realities of the colonia 's dwellers . More importantly , Gutmann fails to push through his gendered analysis and tease out the linkages between power and the gender(ed) differences it creates . Still , in spite of the book 's flaws , I wholeheartedly congratulate Matthew Gutmann for putting " the macho " to rest . He has drawn out with much complexity the multiple masculinities in play in a colonia of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ other permission , please contact H-Net@H-Net.Msu.Edu.

Extraterritoriality ( the legal right to subject one 's own nationals to national law in a foreign country ) was a key component of Western and Japanese imperial and ( semi- ) colonial experience in China and , to a far lesser extent , in Japan itself . The importance of extraterritoriality and the dearth of literature makes Cassel 's Grounds of Judgment ' both a refreshing and significant piece of work . <p> Drawing upon an analysis of China and Japan 's legal traditions , local legal wrangles and the process of legal modernization , Grounds of Judgment ' explores how extraterritoriality came to being , how it worked , and why the development and process of extraterritoriality was ultimately different in Japan and China . Importantly , picking up from recent trends in transnational colonial legal studies , Cassel uses a convincing model of a triangular relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptual lens to understand the whole process of the differing trajectories of the extraterritorial process in Japan and China . In other words , he examines treaty negotiations , and the operation of extraterritoriality in practice of the West and China , the West and Japan and Japan and China , highlighting the developments and connections between all three parties in the history of extraterritoriality . This approach quite rightly avoids the deterministic models of bilateral relations and national histories and offers more insight into the transnational and transhistorical ways multiple actors and processes served to create and develop extraterritoriality conceptually and practically . <p> Cassel begins this analysis in the first two chapters by examining China and Japan 's legal traditions and early treaty negotiations of extraterritoriality between Western imperial powers and China . He shows how China and Japan 's legal traditions were familiar with legal pluralism and personal jurisdiction , rather than a unifying territorial jurisdiction . In China , this was evident in its long tradition of mixed court tribunals in its borderlands with Russia and in the ethno-legal differentiation of Manchu peoples . A type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Portuguese had been allowed since the mid-seventeenth century to exercise legal jurisdiction in cases involving Portuguese plaintiffs and Portuguese defendants . As well as providing a necessary revision of how we understand Japan and China 's legal past , Cassel also argues that this plural legal tradition paved the way conceptually for the Qing authorities and Japanese officials to actively consent to the creation of mixed courts and the idea of foreign consular jurisdiction in the nineteenth-century treaty ports . This brings a fresh understanding of how we can interpret the beginnings of extraterritoriality in China . Perhaps we should view extraterritoriality and its establishment as more of a sort of continuation or borrowing from tradition , albeit one that was to become far more onerous to the Chinese state and people in the years after its establishment . <p> Moving on from an analysis of establishment of extraterritoriality , Cassel proceeds to show in the next few chapters how extraterritoriality operated in practice . Firstly , there is a study of the mixed court and British Supreme Court for China in Shanghai ( chapter 3 ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in Japan ( chapter 4 and 5 ) . Ultimately , Cassel insists , we must refrain from viewing extraterritoriality as a monolithic system or a transplant ; the trajectory and development of extraterritoriality in China and Japan was formed through different local disputes , institutions and local power , as well as through an ongoing triangular process of treaty negotiations and warfare , and practical process of legal jurisdiction ( involving China , Japan and the West , depending on the context ) . Domestic legal reform movements particularly in Japan played an important role in shaping its course . <p> The eventual abolition of extraterritoriality in the twentieth century takes up the final chapters of the book and it is here that Grounds of Judgment ' rounds up how China and Japan differed in their extrication from extraterritoriality . Cassel stresses that it was the process of treaty negotiations ( and treaty revision ) , between Japan , China and the West , and moreover the different ways the indigenous legal order was overhauled and centralized , which led Japan to rid itself of extraterritoriality faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own extraterritorial status in China . China , for its part , struggled to abolish extraterritoriality for a number of reasons , such as being initially far more accepting of mixed court jurisdiction and of the integration of these mixed courts into the Chinese legal system . Japan , conversely , contested some of these legal rights and treaties more assertively from an early stage , did not allow an integration of mixed courts into its own native court system and chose to discount this form of plural jurisdiction when reforming and centralizing its legal system in later years . <p> Without a doubt , given the dearth of literature on the subject , Grounds of Judgment ' is a vital study on the legal history , the process of extraterritoriality , and the legacies of imperialism in China and Japan in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . Through an exploration of the triangular relationship between China , Japan and the West , a more sophisticated understanding of imperialism emerges , and one that adds significantly to our understanding of legal development , legal tradition , imperialism and international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and the West were inextricably linked in the formation , maintenance and ending of extraterritoriality which was in turn at the heart of the foreign encroachments on Chinese and Japanese soil . <p> Whilst Cassel 's book is an absorbing , highly detailed and informative , a more intricate examination of the working of the courts , especially of the Western courts in China is missing , and one may want to question Cassel 's classification of the West ' as a singular entity , or at least have the terminology clarified a little more . Additionally , whilst Cassel 's analysis of China 's plural legal background is an excellent piece of research into the treaty negotiations of extraterritoriality ( and by far one of the best and most comprehensive so far ) , one may want to question the extent of how easily a conceptual transition was achieved between its legal traditions and a wholesale complicity or acceptance of the nineteenth century extraterritorial unequal ' treaties and practices on the part of Qing and Japanese officials . <p> Indeed , extraterritoriality is vitally important not just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan and especially China today , and Cassel rightly picks up this point in his concluding remarks . Why extraterritoriality and its legacy are important today is easy to see . It still shapes the way in which China 's political and legal elite understand and express its national sovereignty and how it staunchly criticizes foreign intervention has its roots in its legacy , and will indeed continue to be an important feature of China 's legal and political life for a long time to come . Grounds of Judgment ' is a must read book for an understanding of both Japan and China 's past and its present .

The idea of " a people " or " a nation " has proved enduringly useful to political leaders and politicians of all ideological casts and has been used to underwrite programs as diverse as foreign invasions , German National Socialism , and the American New Deal . Nationalism has proved such a useful and ubiquitous political tool because it so effectively binds together disparate--sometimes even warring--factions in society . It is this idea of nationalism as a political tool that David Waldstreicher explores in In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes . <p> Unlike traditional approaches to nationalism , this is a book about the construction of nationalism in the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary worlds . Nationalism in Waldstreicher 's view , was not the creation of an a priori idea of ethnic , racial , or other sanguinary identity , but a collective identification that was forged from the public celebrations of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation well beyond the bounds of the male voting public , celebrations created a new public sphere in the early days of the new nation . In this broad view , the history of nationalism is the story of the creation of rituals , public enactments that conveyed a sense of solidarity while they simultaneously contained and defused social and economic tensions . <p> In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes begins with the mobilization of popular energies that underpinned the success of the American Revolution , but also represented its greatest challenge . In a new country with a population acutely divided along the lines of race , class , gender , and region , one of the most pressing questions became how to contain social and economic contention while reconciling the competing visions of elites and common people . The answer proved to be a set of " national " celebrations--derived from English rituals and celebrations and hastily made-over to suit American purposes--that , spread through the medium of the revolutionary press , proffered a collective identity and a temporary sense of common purpose during the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but potentially women , African-Americans , even children-to participate actively or symbolically in the revolutionary movement , the new public sphere of nationalistic ritual became a venue for the construction of popular nationalism . <p> In one sense , the remainder of the book is a study of the extension and refinement of this fundamental process . The attempts of American elites to maintain their hold on power by extending national rituals into the 1780s met with surprising success . As Waldstreicher points out , much of this success came from the unsettled nature of the era . In the aftermath of revolution , wealth , personal identity , and even language seemed to float free from their previous meanings and everything--including the question of popular political participation--was called into question . Both the Constitution and the Grand Federal Processions that followed its ratification , provided a new , unified discourse that successfully , if temporarily , submerged the diversity of representations that had bubbled up during the Revolutionary years . <p> But only temporarily . The price of maintaining order through the deployment of nationalistic sentiments was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As intra-elite rivalries and divisions came increasingly to occupy the 1790s and early decades of the nineteenth century , the need for popular support became ever more acute and Federalists and Democratic-Republicans alike competed to devise celebrations that would gather support for their nascent party organizations . The process was never easy , for leaders of both parties faced a formidable obstacle in what Timothy Breen has called the " persistent localism " of the early American public sphere . 1 <p> The problem for leaders seeking consciously or unconsciously to create political parties , was to link local and national politics , thereby overcoming the persistent popular desire to keep government and politics local affairs . It has long been clear that something fundamentally changed in American politics during the early decades of the nineteenth century . Before 1800 , localism defined the outlook of non-elite Americans . But beginning with the rise of the Jeffersonians and culminating in Andrew Jackson 's campaigns of 1824 and 1828 , true national politics emerged .

" <p> This much has been well-understood , but what has been missing in historical accounts of this transition is convincing explanation . It is here that In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes makes its greatest contribution . In his long and complex discussion of the uses to which Democratic-Republicans put the rituals of nationalism , Waldstreicher reveals how the rituals of nationhood allowed local participation in national affairs while permitting even those beyond the political nation--women , for example--to participate in direct , palpable ways . Here , in short , was the cultural mechanism that would make national politics the personal affairs of millions of Americans for more than a generation . <p> If the early decades of the nineteenth century marked the nativity of an inclusive national politics , were there effective limits to its use and deployment in early national society ? Could well-orchestrated festivals and the mass press really encompass all Americans ? In his concluding section , Waldstreicher turns to the looming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . Like political party organizers before them , white colonizationists and free black community leaders battled mightily for the mantle of nationalism , in the process pushing the capacity of nationalist rituals to its limits . Like so much else in early nineteenth-century society , racism defined the boundaries of actual and symbolic inclusiveness in America . White society would not allow even the symbolic participation of African-Americans in their rituals of nationalism . <p> The value of a good book can be measured in two ways : in the things it tells us and in the things it does n't , but encourages us to ask . In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes is no exception . On the one hand , it provides us with a detailed and convincing analysis of the construction of nationalism in early national America . One the other hand , it leaves a large and important question unanswered . <p> Nationalism emerges from this study as a particularly powerful cultural formation , a formation uniquely able to neutralize the myriad conflicts of the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary eras . We are left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unique power . Does the power of nationalism reside in its essentially ambiguous or multivocal nature , a nature that allows for multiple interpretations of its meaning ? In this sense , by absorbing the social distinctions and divisions among groups contending for its definition , nationalism can be seen as a distraction from broader social and economic issues-a form of Lukacsian false consciousness . 2 Or was it that social divisions and identities were themselves so essentially weak and protean that people had not yet divided the world into rigid , conflicting categories such as classes ? This would have made the task of nationalism an easy one . Yet the same era that witnessed the creation of nationalism also witnessed the construction of the concept of class , a concept that was not easily assimilated into a mediating nationalism in the early nineteenth century . 3 In fact , faced with proliferating ideas of class , nationalism proved surprisingly fragile and ineffectual . In the long run , the most productive answer to the question of the power of nationalism might well come from the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an innate concept of human justice . 4 But however it is addressed , the question of the power of nationalism is central to a complete understanding of nationalism as a cultural phenomenon . <p> Waldstreicher chooses to elide these larger issues , claiming that " to uncover the metaphysics of national identity ... is to become prisoners of it ( p. 141 ) . " This is a good postmodernist argument , but metaphysics is not really the issue . We need n't hypothesize some essentialist notion of national character applicable across historical time and space as the only means of analyzing nationalism . We do , however , need to understand nationalism 's power as more than a sum of cultural techniques . This is especially true if we are to understand the enduring power of nationalism to mobilize ordinary men and women . Nationalism is easiest to understand among America 's elite : throughout history , an amalgam of nationalism and religion has always been the ideology of choice of powerful minorities seeking to maintain social order and their hold on the reins of government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elites have sought to construct a fantasy of equivalence among unequal and potentially rebellious members of society . <p> In this sense , elite recourse to nationalistic rituals is perfectly understandable : no elite can long remain in power by emphasizing the asymmetries of power in which they alone benefit . Simple interest thus goes a long way toward explaining conservative thought . But understanding popular compliance requires more . It is not clear that ordinary men and women have an economic or political interest in nationalism , yet the power of nationalism stems from its successful mass appeal . The laments of countless socialist and communist thinkers and organizers attest to the power of nationalism to derail the prospect of popular power from the nineteenth century to the present . Waldstreicher gives us ample evidence of its equivalent power in post-Revolutionary America . But his postmodernist stance notwithstanding , it is not enough to reveal only the mechanisms of nationalism 's creation and enduring power . The evidence and arguments of In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes make it clear that nationalism had significant resonance among America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attempt to understand why nationalism resonated so powerfully in the minds and lives of ordinary Americans in the years following the Revolution .

Fordham ( Department of Political Science , University at Albany , State University of New York ) Published on H-Pol ( August , 1999 ) <p> CONSTRUCTING THE NATIONAL SECURITY STATE <p> With some justification , much recent work on the history of the Cold War has focused on new sources in former communist countries. 1 Michael Hogan 's impressive new book reminds us that we still have much to learn from the American side . A Cross of Iron examines the enormous changes in the American state during the early years of the Cold War . Far from being an unproblematic response to international events , these changes were the subject of intense domestic controversy . Hogan 's central argument is that the institutions of the national security state reflected not only the concerns of those focused on the Soviet threat , but also the fears of those who worried that the United States might evolve into a garrison state . <p> Hogan 's narrative relates a series of conflicts over the construction of new state institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who represented an older American anti-statist tradition . Hogan argues convincingly that a coherent ideology of national security emerged from the Second World War . The wartime experience taught the adherents of this new ideology that the United States confronted an age of total war demanding a much deeper mobilization of civilian society to support military preparedness . The postwar confrontation with the Soviet Union made this mobilization an immediate need . As Hogan puts it , <p> " in the national security ideology , then , the nature of the Soviet regime put a premium on military preparedness , the immediacy of the Soviet threat made preparedness a matter of urgency , the long term nature of that threat required a permanent program of preparedness , and the danger of total war dictated a comprehensive program that integrated civilian and military resources and obliterated the line between citizen and soldier , peace and war . " ( p. 14 ) <p> The additional argument that peace and freedom worldwide were indivisible made the national security ideology 's conception of international threat even more terrifying . A threat to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a threat to them in an entire region , and eventually the entire world ( p. 15 ) . The domino theory was a premise of national security thinking in the United States from the beginning of the Cold War . <p> The elements of the national security ideology as well as the names of many of its proponents are familiar from many works of Cold War history concerned with the American response to international environment during the early Cold War era . Their opponents have received far less attention , however . The national security ideology threatened those who took their political inspiration from the longstanding tradition of a limited government role in the economy and society , as well as minimal involvement in international politics . Conservatives committed to these political traditions were suspicious of the expansion and centralization of the military establishment , the growth of international political and military commitments , and the increasing burden of financing all these activities . For many of them , the national security state was a particularly dangerous extension of the New Deal . A Cross of Iron makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national security state influenced its development. 2 <p> After introducing these two conflicting ideological poles in American politics , the book follows their proponents through the most important episodes in the development of the postwar national security state . In each case , Hogan finds that the institutions constructed indeed expanded the state and extracted greater resources from American society , but fell short of what the most strident proponents of the national security ideology had sought . The National Security Act established crucial institutions such as the Office of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Central Intelligence Agency , but none of these organizations had all the powers their advocates had originally envisioned . Similarly , Congress ultimately approved a system of peacetime selective service , but it defeated a more ambitious program of universal military training . Hogan argues that even the enormous military buildup prompted by NSC 68 and the Korean War was limited in some respects by concerns about excessive growth in the power of the state . Congressional conservatives hampered the administration 's efforts to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In every case , the institutions of the national security state bore the marks of both their advocates and their opponents . <p> Hogan returns again and again to debates over the national budget , another great strength of the book . The national security ideology 's stress on preparedness implied an enormous commitment of national resources , bringing the budget to the center of the political debate . Conservatives also viewed the budget as a critically important indicator of where the country was heading , elevating efforts to balance it to a kind of moral crusade ( p. 69 ) . As a practical matter , decisions about financing the national security program forced American leaders to set priorities . Some of the most important political conflicts of the postwar era were not over the intrinsic merit of policy goals such as maintaining a strong national defense , but rather over their relationship to other objectives , such as limiting the tax burden or maintaining a balanced budget . The budget process forced political leaders to determine in a very tangible way which of these goals were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their conservative critics might be papered over in some areas , agreement was more difficult on the budget . <p> Not surprisingly , the budget fueled some of the most intense political battles of the early Cold War era , including the inter-service conflicts over roles and missions . Even organizational issues , such as the level of authority the Secretary of Defense should have over the individual service secretaries , became problems primarily because of their implications for the budget . The National Military Establishment was consolidated into the Department of Defense in 1949 primarily because the first Secretary of Defense , James Forrestal , had been unable effectively to reconcile competing service demands for a greater share of the military budget ( 200-8 ) . <p> Decisions about spending and taxation also revealed most clearly the tensions in Harry Truman 's world view . Truman occupies a critically important position in Hogan 's narrative , embodying the conflict between the ideology of national security and anti-statist political traditions . Although he subscribed to many elements of the national security ideology , he was also committed to maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to funding the new national security state , Truman often found himself on different sides of the same debate , depending on whether he was confronting hawks within his own administration or economy-minded Republican members of Congress . As Hogan points out , Dwight Eisenhower found himself in a similar position as president , noting that each administration " often looked like a battleground between economizers , on the one hand , and national security managers , on the other " ( p. 7 ) . Given the range of views within their political coalitions , it seems unlikely that either president could have avoided this situation . <p> The pattern of conflict and compromise Hogan identifies is very useful for understanding the development of the national security state before 1950 . However , like all useful generalizations , it has its limits . It is difficult to characterize the military buildup that followed NSC 68 and intervention in the Korean War as another compromise like those that had preceded it . The advocates of the national security ideology ceded little to their opponents in this episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fit as well into the book 's broader narrative . Hogan overstates the importance of efforts to limit the buildup . Marshall and Lovett indeed eventually reduced the projected size of the military budget for the five years after fiscal 1951 to $190.6 billion from the $287 billion military planners had originally proposed ( p. 308 ) . However , these limits still contemplated an annual budget more than three times larger than that proposed before NSC 68 and Korea . In some years , it would exceed what the entire federal budget had been in fiscal 1950 ! This kind of economizing is radically different from the plans fiscal conservatives had put forward only months earlier to reduce the fiscal 1951 Pentagon budget below the $13.9 billion Truman had originally proposed ( p. 285 ) . The budgetary concerns of people like Robert Lovett--an early backer of NSC 68 ( p. 300 ) --are of a different order than those of the genuine critics of the national security state . After 1950 , national security managers could afford to economize at the margin because they had defeated their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in the series of compromises that took place between 1945 and 1949 , Hogan blurs the enormity of the break with the past it constituted . <p> Hogan 's treatment of the domestic side of the Cold War raises some important questions the book does not completely answer . Although McCarthyism was an important feature of the domestic politics of the early Cold War era , and has been linked to the development of the national security state by others , it is not examined at great length in this book . A Cross of Iron is ambivalent about the origins of McCarthyism , and the Red Scare 's relationship to the national security state . Hogan does not include concern about domestic subversion as part of the ideology of national security in the opening chapter ( pp. 10-18 ) . He notes later that those most concerned about domestic communism were conservatives , many of whom opposed most other aspects of the national security ideology . The Truman administration was merely " a reluctant partner in the anti-Communist crusade " ( pp. 315-6 ) . Later , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " national security mentality " and domestic anti-Communism among intellectuals ( pp. 420-6 ) . If , as Hogan implies , domestic anti-Communism is not a necessary adjunct of the national security ideology and the institutions associated with it , the reader is left to wonder how this linkage developed . <p> Overall , A Cross of Iron is a great contribution to our understanding of how the United States fought the Cold War . Moreover , it is an interesting case study of state making in an industrialized , democratic society . Hogan 's use of the work of historical sociologists on state making draws attention to the importance of institution-building , the extraction of resources from society , and resistance to these efforts . His use of the vocabulary they provide for the discussion of these issues increases the relevance and usefulness of his work for those interested in similar questions in other historical settings . Understanding the national security state is important not only for historical reasons , but also for understanding contemporary American politics and foreign policy . Although the Cold War has ended , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross of Iron should remain a standard work on the origins of these institutions for some time . <p> 2 .

Chidester <p> Zoot Suit Culture in the 1940s in the United States <p> Luis Alvarez has produced a book on Zoot Suit culture in the United States in the World War II years . Without much doubt , this finely crafted book is and will be the most definitive work on the subject for many years to come because of the wide array of sources used and the equally broad inclusion of ethnic groups . Alvarez uses the most modern social theory on culture and ethnicity , contested space theories , ideas regarding race rebellion , and historical social science theories to explain both male and female participation in Zoot culture . He views this culture as essentially , but not exclusively , a youth culture seeking dignity , as well as a place in the United States as legitimate persons with their own style , language , dance patterns , and sexual mores . In short , Zoot Suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle to which many minority youths and young adults became wedded in their private and public lives . Yet , many public officials , the police , and white military personnel regarded it as the outlaw style of a social group that required repression . They judged Zooters as criminals or juvenile delinquents . Style warfare evolved between those persons wearing Zooter uniforms , military uniforms , and wartime factory work garb , all of whom were in a contest for attention , dignity , and manhood or womanhood . In a limited public space , some people felt they should defend themselves and exclude the Other . This is the context in which Alvarez explains his book . Much of the information he includes comes from prior scholarship on Zoot society and culture . <p> Alvarez uses the most comprehensive and complex sources available on the subject of Zoot Suit culture . He examines a wide variety of archival collections and government documents that are scattered across the United States , as well as oral history interviews that he conducted . His secondary sources are the best collection used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These sources include a large number of well-known materials and new materials not widely used or even known . He makes good use of newspaper stories from across the nation on Zoot Suiters . For these sources alone and the excellent interpretive context that Alvarez uses , his book is the most definitive book ever on Zoot Suit culture and society in the 1940s , the zenith of this cultural phenomenon . <p> To explain Zoot Suit society and culture , Alvarez uses vital cultural and social science themes . He discusses how dignity was denied to minority youths in Los Angeles , the South , the North , and the Midwest in the political economy of the early years of World War II mobilization in the United States . Minority youths were turned away . They were not wanted in public spaces , in parks or on public streets in many major cities . Their presence was regarded as loitering . Jobs and housing , which racial discrimination often restricted , were difficult for them and their parents to find as migrations intensified . The President 's Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervasive . Minority youths resented this private and public discrimination against them and their parents . <p> Intense social class conflict and juvenile delinquency charges and counter-charges resulted in fights erupting between white authorities and minority youths and adults . The white press characterized minority youths as gangsters and juvenile delinquents , and police harassed them on public streets . Black and Hispanic youth recognized this racialization of juvenile delinquency in wartime Los Angeles and New York City . There was pressure on mayors in each city to repress and rigorously police minority youth . <p> Many Zoot Suiters were attracted to jazz music and ballroom dancing , and they were sometimes joined by some white youths who appreciated this musical and dance culture and Zoot Suit styles as well . This interracial mixing alarmed police , white parents , and whites in general . Many whites were committed white supremacists and benefited from their privileged white skin positions in getting first opportunities denied to minorities . More and more , minorities defied white hierarchy and publicly challenged the status quo or attempted to retreat to their ethnic enclaves where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race riots . Conflict resulted from these cultural challenges , and the police intervened to repress race rebel minority youths disenchanted with the doctrines and practices of domination . These altercations often led to the criminalization of minority youth and young adults with trumpeted charges , beatings , jailings , and convictions ; they also led to police records that dogged them and resulted in more reasons to segregate and discriminate against them . <p> Racial tensions erupted into mass racial riots and violence in New York City ; Beaumont , Texas ; Los Angeles , California ; Detroit , Michigan ; Mobile , Alabama ; and many other cities and towns . Police and white military personnel often attacked minorities and their youth , and especially Zoot Suiters . The white press often instigated and condoned violence against minorities and blamed them for the violence . The police took sides with white soldiers and civilians against minorities . On the one hand , minority newspaper writers and some legal defense groups noted and loudly protested against this racial partisanship against minorities . Many minority leaders defended themselves by claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupted work and reduced supplies to the front lines . On the other hand , whites self-righteously charged that minorities were violating the race rules of subordination and getting out of their place and that minorities were not justified in defying white supremacy . <p> In summary , Alvarez explains the era of Jim Crow and white supremacy as a problem that went unsolved during the 1940s . Minority groups and youth often fought for their individual and collective dignity , manhood , and womanhood . They fought for their right to use public space and for their inclusion as citizens in every area of American life and culture . Minorities in the World War II years demanded a Double V , or victory at home and abroad for democracy ; they fought on two fronts for this victory , and it was a frightful double burden . Alvarez explains Zoot Suiters as one of the tips of the spears in this complex fight .

The work offers a strong vaccine against western arrogance , both for advocates of the superiority of Enlightenment 's achievements and for enthusiasts of the necessity of the ties between Christian ( especially Catholic ) orthodoxy and ( economic ) liberty . <p> Gillespie argues that the first modern thinkers were nothing but Christian thinkers whose theology might be contrary to official church doctrine , but not un-Christian in their intention .

Descartes " sought to construct a bastion of reason against this terrifying God of nominalism " ( p. 171 ) . His attempt ended with the " ontological argument " to demonstrate the existence of God--an attempt that could not save him from accusations of being a skeptical atheist . Hobbes 's religiosity is unquestioned , unlike his orthodoxy , and his view of the world is " the result of his acceptance of the basic tenets of nominalism " ( p. 209 ) . <p> The last chapter speaks of an " early crisis of modernity , " whose power and effect is " broader , deeper , and older than the Enlightenment " ( p. 257 ) . Gillespie argues against the idea that the thought of Descartes and Hobbes was not an example of secularization , given the author 's assumption that " the secularization thesis is that God does not exist and that religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I share much of Gillespie 's disappointment in modernity and secularization , especially when he affirms that " the so-called process of disenchantment is thus also a process of reenchantment " ( p. 274 ) , given that " the Enlightenment ( and post-Enlightenment ) exaltation of human individuality is thus in fact a form of radical ( although concealed ) Pelagianism " ( p. 275 ) . Gillespie sees in the Enlightenment an impasse impossible to avoid , given its basic assumptions , and maintains that this impasse was the basis for the perversions of modernity taking place during the first half of the twentieth century ( the world wars , the Great Depression , the rise of totalitarianism , and the Holocaust ) . <p> Besides some corrigenda in the Latin terms ( for example : Catiline , not Cataline , p. 277 , and unio mystica , not mystico , p. 282 ) , the work can be recommended for many of its general prescriptions .

Although the book is especially useful when it shows the importance of nominalism in the path of Christian theology towards modernity , its overall vision of the relationship of Christian theology and modernity needs to be integrated with other issues the book only deals with marginally . One issue is the critical relationship between nature and grace , a problem that has had a huge , perhaps disruptive impact on the balance of the western ( Catholic and non-Catholic ) theological tradition , especially from the seventeenth century on . This issue constitutes a major rift in recent Catholic theology and its approach to the modern world and non-Christian religions . Another issue is the need to distinguish between modernity and secularization . Very few deny the modernity or postmodernity of some features of globalized Islam , even in its most radical interpretation , but secularization is typical of the geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition . In other words , the problem that research needs to address is not merely the nexus of Christian theology and modernity , but also the separate relationship between Christian theology and secularization . On this second issue , we have seen in the last decades a radical shift from the 1960s and the 70s , when mainstream Christian theology advocated the need for a " secular Christianity , " to the present , when " secularization " seems to be socially unavoidable but theologically almost irrelevant and culturally voiceless for theologians--except for some individual contributions , like Charles Taylor 's A Secular Age. 1 The role of individual rights in the religious discourse that confronts modernity seems potentially more important than secularization : " Moses gave Commandments to the children of Israel , not a code of rights .

Julius Nyerere was Tanzania 's head of state from independence in 1961 until his voluntary retirement in 1985 . During this period , the country went from a naive hope that foreign investment would launch it into " sustainable economic development , " through perhaps the most innovative , participatory and democratic effort to build socialism ( which he called ujamaa ) the world has ever seen ; to its current state of " adjusting " to the pressures of the World Bank/IMF , western donors , the new economic order , and the introduction to multi-parties . The reader will find in Tanzania 's story much that the past thirty-five years has visited upon the Third World . Those who are unaware of , or only partially familiar with , Tanzania 's efforts to transform itself into a socialist society will find an enormous amount of well-constructed , easy-to-understand information . <p> President Julius Nyerere , the central character in this story , will be recognized by the readers as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role model , an almost dangerously courageous champion of righteous campaigns in Africa and the Third World as a whole , a fearless confronter of nations and institutions that tried to interfere with Tanzania 's self-determination , a unifier of a vast and diverse economy and people , and a man of the people . Even the critical authors ( Read and to a lesser extent Legum ) pay homage to Nyerere 's talents and accomplishments . Showing a restraint that will hold their credibility with readers , the contributors can only leave us with the notion that here we are dealing with a giant , not just of African but also of modern , history . A volume such as this necessarily falls far short of fully conveying the dimensions and import of such a person . <p> Having spent five years working in Tanzania , having edited one book and written another on the efforts to build socialism there , I nevertheless found myself thinking many times as I read : " I did n't know that . " The book contains much that is new or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Green and Svendsen articles . The essays lay out the main policies and programs that made up Nyerere 's campaign to change his nation , and point to the many miscalculations , misconceptions , and errors that led to many failures . They also provide a rich sampling of Mwalimu 's thinking , his vision , and his arguments . <p> All too few of the authors ( Komba , Green , and Legum ) detail the extraordinary list of accomplishments that set Tanzania apart from the rest of Africa . For example , free and open elections were held every five years without a miss . For the most part freedom of speech was protected . Ninety-five percent of children receive a full primary education . Fresh water is piped into villages where nearly all rural people live . Tanzania 's long-term economic growth record is above the sub-Saharan African average , and it has a relatively equitable distribution of income . <p> Yet Tanzania suffered drought and flood , has remained one of the poorest countries in the world with no major metal or mineral deposits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 365,000 square miles . It started independence with a low stock of skilled people , and suffered greatly ( along with other poor countries ) from the crises in world capitalism of the late 1970s and 1980s ( oil price inflation and world recession and restructuring ) . And it is too often forgotten that Tanzania fought a successful war ( costing $500 million ) to rid Uganda of Idi Amin . <p> Still , for the most part I found the book a disappointment . Why do we hear from only one woman , Irene Brown ? How was it possible not to give us at least one Marxist view , when so much of what has been written about Tanzania has come from the Left ? And where are the voices of the peasants--more than 90 percent of the population--whom Nyerere devoted his life to leading out of " poverty , ignorance and disease " ? <p> Roger Carter in the Preface writes that the contributors were asked " to draw attention to those aspects of permanent value , which constitute Nyerere 's legacy to mankind " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser extent Ramphal and Mmari do this . Maliyamkono offers a peculiarly African assessment in his section : " The Legacy of Mwalimu Nyerere " : " A random selection of examples illustrating Mwalimu 's influence would include the number of children bearing his names .... His name is permanently linked to many municipal stadiums and to some of the surviving ujamaa villages .... many individuals have modelled themselves on Nyerere ... " ( p. 57 . ) The others either catalogue policies and ideas without much analysis ( the Browns , Omari , Komba , and Kweka ) or criticize without a deeper and historical framework within which to evaluate ( Read ) , or offer somewhat shallow reasoning based on personal conversations with Nyerere ( Legum ) . <p> Although the book gives us much detail about the main pillars of Nyerere 's thinking , policies , and programs , with the exception of Reginold Green 's contribution , it provides little insight and not much that is new . Green analyzes the tensions and contradictions between Nyerere 's objectives and those charged with fleshing them out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " draconian " ( p. 138 ) Preventive Detention Act , and quotes " a sympathetic commentator 's " view that Nyerere 's defense of it " can easily conceal an oligarch 's determination to hold onto power " ( p. 139 ) . Readers would have been better served with a contextual analysis than with moral assertions . <p> For instance , Read notes that the majority of those detained under the act were suspected criminals whose crimes most likely could not be sufficiently documented to bring them to trial ( p. 139 ) . Why did Professor Read not tell us about the state of crime and punishment in Tanzania , or about the total absence of adequately trained police investigators ( Green , p. 95 ) ? <p> We are told that area and regional commissioners and other officials throughout the countryside abused their power under the protection of TANU , the one-party state , and various laws , such at the Preventive Detention Act ( Kweka , p. 69 ) .

What should he have done ? What could he have done ? How did these contradictions arise , what efforts were made ( and by whom ) to resolve them , and why were they not successful ? A more accurate and thoughtful analysis would have given us insights into what Nyerere faced and the broader problems of transforming societies emerging from three hundred years of slave trade and colonialism , locked into an imperialist system of trade and aid . And we fail to learn about Nyerere 's own authoritarianism ; his acceptance of the notion that those with authority--from the family right through to State house--had the right to use that power to defend their positions against those who challenged them . <p> The goals Nyerere set for his nation in 1967 with the Arusha Declaration and supporting policy papers implicitly depended on a particular form of popular response for their success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cooperatives , and urban workers toward the goals of socialism and self-reliance . Popular participation , democratic decisions at all levels , creativity , and innovation were expected to be the engines of transforming Tanzania . The party would pave the way and provide support , and the government would introduce ideas , technology , and some resources into the process ; both would take care of the larger issues . <p> Many villages heeded the call , more than a few workers acted , and even progressive bureaucrats at various points along the line responded . But when they did , there was an inevitable conflict with those whose interests were lodged in the old system--to achieve and maintain material gains or power . Those with power defended and counterattacked . At these pregnant moments , neither Nyerere , nor TANU , nor the government stepped onto the side of the peasants and workers and bureaucrats , to use the power of the state and the party to resolve contradictions in favor of progressives .

Nyerere himself had certain blind spots that produced disastrous results at the implementation level . For instance , he was hopelessly enamored of foreign experts . Thus , he turned to McKinsey &amp; Co. , a management consulting firm , for the task of designing a top-to-bottom system for the State Trading Corporation ( STC ) , which was to be responsible for nearly all of the country 's internal trade and imports .

It seems curious that they were asked to write about Nyerere 's " Approach to Rural Mass Poverty , " when Irene Brown was Senior Lecturer of Political Science at the University of Dar es Salaam , and Roland Brown was independent Tanganyika 's first Attorney General . It is difficult to think of two living Europeans who knew Nyerere--from the 1950s onward--more intimately .

Named for the Texas town where it was promulgated , the Plan called for Tejanos to rise-up , take back Texas from the Anglos , and return it to Mexico . Although never a realistic scheme or taken seriously by significant policy makers , the Plan did play a part in the international reaction to the Mexican Revolution by partially motivating the famous Zimmerman Telegram on the eve of World War One . Although never meaningfully executed , the Plan was related during 1914 and 1915 to a series of gory raids against Anglo-American farms and ranches made by armed Spanish-speaking vigilante groups ( variously styled by Anglo-Texans as Mexican " bandits " or " revolutionaries " ) . <p> Although the relationship between the Plan de San Diego and border violence is not explicitly established by the historical records , these raids , at least in the minds of Anglo south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mexican Revolution northward across the Rio Grande River into U.S. territory . On several occasions , these bands of armed Spanish-speaking men fired on U.S. Army troops while , at other times , they committed rather bloody depredations against local Anglo-Texan residents of the lower Rio Grande valley , especially in isolated rural areas . These brutal incidents against U.S. Anglo citizens quickly prompted an aggressive counter response from the Texas Rangers , who answered these episodes with their own retaliatory depredations in kind against Spanish-speaking residents of the area , not always bothering to ascertain if the Tejano individuals they were targeting for nasty reprisals had been explicitly linked to the " Mexican bandit " raids against the English-speaking population . The result was over a year of turmoil and violence in the lower Rio Grande valley of south Texas perpetuated by both sides and marked by atrocities , depredations , cruelty , and bloodshed , with the net result that the Texas Rangers established fear and terror among the Tejano population in an effort to maintain Anglo-American social control . <p> No historian of Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint of its being a state-based occurrence that had enduring impact on areas north of the Rio Grande in the Unites States . Several fine studies have examined the Plan de San Diego Revolt from the perspective of the Mexican Revolution . Most notably , James Sandos in Rebellion in the Borderlands : Anarchism and the Plan of San Diego , 1904-1923 ( 1992 ) examines the various manifestations in south Texas that touched on the politics of the Mexican Revolution , especially the contributory ideas of the anarchistic Flores Magon brothers who motivated unrest from their headquarters in San Antonio at the outset of the 1910 Constitutionalist rebellion in Mexico . Sandos 's study clearly links the Plan de San Diego to the larger events and occurrences of the revolution in Mexico , but without specifically considering its long-lasting impact on the Tejano population . <p> Benjamin Heber Johnson 's study , Revolution in Texas , approaches the Plan de San Diego Revolt from a completely different perspective than Sando 's 1992 examination . Professor Johnson offers a solid reinterpretation of the revolt in Texas as a chapter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society in the Lone Star State . For Johnson , the actual Plan de San Diego was not so much a motivator of the violence as an excuse for igniting it . In advancing the proposition in a closely reasoned narrative , Johnson devotes little space to examining the Plan de San Diego itself and its larger relationship to the events of the Mexican Revolution . This is because , in his view , the violence of 1914 and 1915 along the lower Rio Grande was actually the manifestation of deeper , more profound demographic and economic changes in the region . These changes upset the prevailing racial , social , political , and economic norms that had defined the relationships between Tejanos and Anglos in the lower valley for decades during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries . This was especially the case in term of politics : the relationship between the Anglo-American political machine of the region and the progressive leaders of the Spanish-speaking community were fractured in the years before World War One by these changes . What had been a balance and accord between them came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad into the major cities and agricultural areas of the Valley , the influx of a demographically significant number of new Anglo farmers into the area brought by the railroad , and the collapse of the Jim Wells political machine . They created frustrations in the Tejano community that destabilized relations between the races of the region . The Plan de San Diego , linked to the Mexican Revolution as an impractical anarchist strategy , provided along the border an opportunity for action on the part of Spanish-speaking dissidents from both Mexico and Texas to move violently against the Anglo community north of the border . Hence , a series of vicious raids directed against English-speaking Texans cost dozens of Anglo lives , especially during 1915 . These raids , undertaken by Spanish-speaking vigilantes and raiders , known locally in the valley as sediciosos , enraged the entire Anglo community of south Texas and created a heightened indignation in official circles that made the whole area a smoldering power-keg . This resulted in the Texas Rangers arriving on the scene to end the depredations in a full-scale campaign of harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel and violent as the initial events which had begun the violence . Indeed , Johnson documents some cases in which the Rangers engaged in personal vendettas against Tejanos who had no role in the depredations against the Anglo residents . Other times , the Rangers lashed out at Tejanos who haplessly crossed their paths . No person of Latino heritage was fully assured of safety during this difficult time along the lower Rio Grande . <p> Johnson 's characterization of the Rangers serves as a powerful historiographical counterweight to earlier , more laudatory accounts written about their activities during this time . Indeed , the picture that the author paints of the Rangers can be seen as a very valuable corrective to the popular image of this organization . The Rangers , in point of fact , may well have been more vicious perpetrators of violence and mayhem than the sediciosos themselves in creating the local terror associated with the Plan de San Diego Revolt in far south Texas . In that regard , Johnson clearly substantiates his position with reasoned argument and graphic historical example . The summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any means , isolated events , nor were they limited to the Rangers as the only perpetrators . Local sheriffs and other town officials , along with the general Anglo populace , also became involved . Thousands of Tejanos accordingly fled the United States for Mexico in the face of the Sedicioso raids and the Anglo retaliations . <p> This book , however , goes far beyond assessing the violence that was so much an integral part of the revolt . In addition , it provides a full-scale analysis of the events that served as a prelude to the violence , while giving an even fuller assessment of Tejano politics and identity in the wake of the Revolt . In so doing , the author gives particular attention to the career of T. J. Canales , a lawyer from Brownsville who emerged as a leader of the progressive Tejano community . His hopes of economic and social advancement for Tejanos were dashed by the excess of violence . In spite of Canales 's best efforts , along with those who shared his views , Tejanos living in south Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties as their status declined from what it had been before the revolt . Reaction to the sedicioso raids increased Anglo-centrism . Johnson thus argues that the Plan de San Diego Revolt marked the major turning point in race relations between Anglo Texans and Tejanos in south Texas , creating a situation which would last for decades to the detriment of the Hispanophone population . <p> This book is particularly at its best in describing the atrocities and depredations that occurred on both sides of the struggle . The cruelty displayed by both the sediciosos and the Texas Rangers , as graphically described in this volume , would astound the sensibilities of any present day television watcher should such events be part a modern evening news broadcast . It is that focus which gives validity to the subtitle of this volume which cast these episodes as a " forgotten rebellion " that provoked a " bloody suppression . " All of the relatively limited historical literature dealing with this event has heretofore ignored the mayhem , vigilantism , and uninhibited carnage that occurred in south Texas during the Plan de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book should be required reading for every Texas historian , every student of Texas history , and any aware Texan who wishes to understand the origins of the twentieth-century state . <p> In addition , unlike the other studies of this revolt written from the perspective of Mexican history , this volume is focused entirely on Texas and events there rather that the rebellion 's role in the national history of Mexico . The author thus postulates that the lasting import of the rebellion can be seen in Anglo-Tejano race relations in south Texas instead of the Plan 's influence of the course of the Mexican Revolution or diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico . Hence , the book argues very persuasively that the Plan de San Diego Revolt was a major catalyst in the formation among Tejanos of a very distinct Mexican-American identity in the lower Rio Grande valley . The revolt and its carnage caused many Tejanos to flee permanently south of the river while many who remained had to live in reduced status and esteem in the eyes of the Anglo community . The revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic growth that reduced the Tejanos to the being the " others " of the region , thus creating several generations of identity politics in south Texas . The first manifestations of this came with the founding of the League of United Latin American Citizens in the decade following the revolt . <p> This book is based on solid research in primary sources and represents the pleasing product of an historiographical viewpoint that allows each side to tell its own story . In particular , Johnson has mined numerous repositories including the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin , the Center for American History at that same University , and the Texas State Archives . The narrative of the volume is well written and very engaging . This volume represents a major , important addition to the history of Texas and of its diverse peoples .

Born on August 11 , 1847 , and dying on July 3 , 1918 , Tillman dominated South Carolina politics from the late 1880s until the last years of the twentieth century 's first decade . He was born into a wealthy slaveholding family and became a wealthy farmer himself . He served as governor of the state from 1890 to 1894 and as a U.S. Senator from 1894 until his death . Many Democrats considered him the possible party nominee for president in 1896 . He maintained a national reputation until his death , speaking widely on many issues , the most popular and influential of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , the book is a political biography of Tillman and , to a certain extent , a discussion of South Carolina politics between Redemption and the early twentieth century , the years of Tillman 's political pre-eminence in the state . The book is more than political biography , however . Kantrowitz makes a major contribution with his analysis of the reconstruction of white supremacy . This aspect of the book is less about Tillman than the task he undertook , " to transform the slogan ' white supremacy ' into a description of social reality , reconstructing white male authority in every sphere from the individual household to national politics " ( 2 ) . One of Kantrowitz 's most important and telling points is his demonstration that white supremacy was " a social argument and a political program , " something constructed rather than a trait embedded in the culture or a social fact , and " consisted of ideas and practices , promises and threats , oratory and murder " ( 2 ) . Kantrowitz demonstrates that Tillman 's task was not simple and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent to which Tillman 's version of white supremacy spread to the entire country , however , is remarkable . <p> The heart of the book lies in an analysis of the changing nature of white supremacy in South Carolina during the fifty years following 1865 and its connection to class , gender , and white male honor . The book also demonstrates the importance of violence in the reconstruction and enforcing of white supremacy , a personal and commutarian white violence which had significant impact on class relations and white male honor . <p> The book 's introduction does justice to all these themes , and others . The first chapter , " Mastery and Its Discontents , " lays out the prewar tensions of white supremacy , covering ground largely familiar to those acquainted with the history of slavery in the American South . Chapter Two , " Planters and the ' Gentleman from Africa , ' " deals with Reconstruction in South Carolina and especially in Edgefield County . Here , too , Kantrowitz 's discussion often covers familiar ground in new ways . In particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and terrorism aimed at the freedpeople , their leaders , and Republicans in general was planned and organized , especially by planters , though they always denied it . <p> Chapter Three covers the continuing political crisis of the 1880s , marked early by Greenback , Independent , and Republican opposition and late by the Farmers ' Alliance programs . The rapid decline of white farmers into tenancy and dependence led to white insurgency and a challenge to white supremacy . The agricultural crisis underlay the violent assertion of white manhood and disfranchisement , which South Carolina elites chose as the only ways to avoid biracial politics , the collapse of white solidarity , and the loss of political and perhaps economic control . So the particular definition of white manhood which succeeded -- largely Tillman 's , as Kantrowitz demonstrates -- in great part flowed from economic crisis which required elite action . <p> When Tillman moved into formal politics in the mid-1880s , he rode a potential solution to the political problem raised by the agricultural crisis . Combining a producer analysis with attacks on his conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood between South Carolina 's white farmers and their economic independence and patriarchal authority . By tying white supremacy to the rhetoric of reform , Tillman short-circuited the Alliance and Populism in South Carolina . <p> In Chapter Five Kantrowitz uses a discussion of lynching and the dispensary system to describe the tension between the rule of law and white supremacy 's requirement that white men be able to enforce it at all times , which was the inheritance of the 1876 Hamburg Massacre and the Red-shirts . Chapter Six focuses on Tillman 's effort to write white supremacy into law as part of an effort to create " state laws and institutions that could nurture and sustain white farming households " ( 198 ) . The primary thrust of this effort was disfranchisement , and Kantrowitz organizes the chapter around the campaign in 1894 for a constitutional convention , coinciding with Tillman 's successful campaign for a U.S. Senate seat , and the convention 's activities , including dealing with disfranchisement , women 's suffrage , African American education , and raising the age of consent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Epilogue --concerns Tillman 's national role as both a Senator and a popular speaker , and the nature of his legacy in South Carolina , in the South , and in the nation . Kantrowitz outlines Tillman 's role in the 1896 capture of the national Democratic party by a coalition of western and southern Democrats organized around a demand for free silver . He evaluates Tillman 's senatorial career and gives considerable attention to his national impact as a popular speaker and lecturer , particularly on his most popular subject , " the negro problem . " <p> Because Kantrowitz focuses on one individual in one southern state , some readers may ask how well his conclusions apply to the rest of the South . The question is misdirected . While I think Kantrowitz may overestimate the impact of Tillman 's reconstruction of white supremacy on the rest of the South and on the nation as a whole , what he has to say about Tillman and South Carolina has a good deal wider application . <p> The issue is not really one of applicability but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bipolar . The important questions are " how different " and " how similar . " South Carolina , as Kantrowitz points out , had a very high proportion of blacks to whites , like Louisiana and Mississippi and unlike Texas and North Carolina . South Carolina had a smaller upcountry and fewer heavily white areas than other southern states . Since these two factors apparently played an important role in state politics in the South , especially after the Civil War , the political experiences of South Carolina might well be different from those of North Carolina or Texas , for example . Other differences may be important . The extent that his opposition facilitated Tillman 's political success seems greater in South Carolina than elsewhere , but it certainly was not unique . Hogg in Texas and Vardaman in Mississippi , for example , had similar luck with some of their conservative opposition . <p> Nor do the differences between South Carolina and other southern states detract from Kantrowitz 's identification of forces involved in the crusade for white supremacy that triumphed so universally in the South between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of Tillman 's coordination of producer with white supremacy rhetoric , especially around the issue of manly independence and honor , has great analytic strength and should be applied elsewhere in the South , if only because it ties together in new and very convincing ways the agricultural crisis , reform rhetoric , white supremacy , and white male commitment to patriarchal authority . Kantrowitz 's discussion of patriarchal power fills out what Nell Irvin Painter suggested in her essay , " ' Social Equality , ' Miscegenation , Labor , and Power : that white solidarity rested on the authority every white man theoretically held over the women in his household 1 . <p> I might consider class a greater element in Tillman 's thinking than Kantrowitz acknowledges , though he certainly gives it considerable weight . I suspect Tillman 's emphasis on white supremacy was more importantly related to his commitment to the continued dominance of the landowning elite than to his obvious belief in white superiority and the dangers African Americans posed to white civilization . On the other hand , Tillman 's career as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national campaign for white supremacy would have affected the position of the South Carolina elite only indirectly , though this is not true for some of the national changes Tillman recommended , especially revoking the fifteenth amendment and instituting a national pass system . <p> His position on the disfranchisement of white voters suggests the importance of class in Tillman 's advocacy of white supremacy . He was willing to disfranchise some whites in 1895 as the lesser of two evils . He also supported elimination of the understanding clause in two years , something which would disfranchise only white voters . His continued doubts about the capacity of many common white men for self-government and his willingness late in his career to consider a much wider disfranchisement of white men suggests Tillman followed his class interests at some expense to his commitment to white solidarity . <p> Kantrowitz 's work also raises two questions common to southern history in general , especially the post-1865 period . One of them is why poorer white men remained so devoted to white solidarity based on white supremacy . It did not serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disfranchisement -- both black and white -- pointed out to them . Nor did preservation of patriarchal authority necessarily require white supremacy ; patriarchal authority was possible without white prejudice or racism . The answer may lie partially with the notion of white male honor , the personal right of every white man to assert his independence and protect his household by any means available , including violence . There is some suggestion in the book that the connection of honor to white racism , especially that of poorer whites , may have been related to honor 's requirement for an inferior . White solidarity meant that the inferior could not formally be white , though informally it often was . The definition of white male honor might thus require a black inferior , helping to explain why poor whites might be so attached to white supremacy that they could overlook clear disadvantages to their self-interest in other areas . <p> The second question of post-Civil War southern history that Kantrowitz 's book calls up is the tendency of the opponents of the Democrats -- Republicans , Independents , Greenbackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often than the Democrats . The reasons why the Democrats used fraud and violence and formal and informal disfranchisement have been discussed often enough . Without these techniques they would have lost , and the economic power of the elites who controlled the Democratic Party depended heavily on their political control of state and local government . The lien system , a seasonal labor supply , the favorable tax structure , stock laws , and a number of other sources of economic power lay in state legislation . Why the other groups did not indulge more often in the behavior of the Democratic elites remains more of a mystery . They had a great deal to lose as well . Far more often than the Democrats , Republicans and Populists tried to honor formal democratic rules . Their commitment often left them vulnerable at polling places when Democrats were more than willing to intimidate voters and engage in almost any kind of fraud , all in the name of a higher purpose , the survival of the Democratic party and white supremacy . <p> The only thing I missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of religion . The gap is , however , not unique to this book . Southern political and economic history often seems written completely separately from the history of southern religion . Many of the white men for whom Tillman spoke and on whom Tillman 's effort to reconstruct white supremacy depended belonged to and attended church . Even if they did not , they shared evangelical Protestantism as a significant intellectual tradition . The Bible provided them with many of the common metaphors they used to understand the world around them . In one way or another , religion was an important part of their lives . As such , it must have played a role in their understanding of their patriarchal mastery over their households , their relation to other white men and women and to African Americans , and their commitment to white supremacy and the personal and communal violence so often used to enforce it . Likely these things in turn also had an effect on what they understood being an evangelical Protestant meant . <p> I can not do justice to this book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be identified with the work of those historians who are reshaping the southern history of this period by considering gender along with class and race , it is not simply that . It is an important integration of these three elements .

Like all outstanding books , this one should inspire years of debate and reach beyond its field and subject to influence a much wider audience . 69404 @qwx479404

This volume contains some of the most original material of the three . Remini has done much to straighten out the details of many incidents in Jackson 's early years which had long been encrusted with myth and folklore , or simply forgotten or ignored because of a paucity of sources .

Remini suggests that one powerful reason for Jackson 's sensitivity concerning the legal status of his marriage--and his towering rages against anyone who dared question his account of the event--was that Jackson and Rachel Donelson had , indeed , abandoned Nashville for Natchez ( then in Spanish territory ) and lived as husband and wife while she was still married to another man .

Remini provides clear and convincing accounts of these campaigns , balancing praise of his battlefield courage and tactical skill with well-founded criticism of his occasional strategic errors and his obsessive determination to secure removal , by force or treaty , of the Indian nations within the United States and to wrest Florida and other territories from Spain . Marred somewhat by an annoying use of supposedly dramatic sentence fragments , the first volume offers the most nuanced interpretation of the three , as well as sound analysis of the formation of Jackson 's complex character . <p> The second volume , The Course of American Freedom , covers a much more limited period , the ten years encompassing Jackson 's rise to national political prominence , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1824 , his triumphant election in 1828 , and his first term as President . Remini again provides a compelling narrative based upon extensive knowledge of manuscript and newspaper sources , but in this volume he announces an overarching thesis : The " Era of Good Feelings " should really be regarded as America 's first " Era of Corruption . " In a biography of Andrew Jackson , of course , this means that Jackson 's passionate belief in the decline of virtue among politicians , sparked largely by his fury over the so-called corrupt bargain between Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams which deprived Jackson of the Presidency in 1824 , was essentially correct and his reform goals were justified , sincere , and consciously revolutionary . Remini regards this interpretation as shockingly revisionist , but few recent historians have portrayed this period as a genuine " Era of Good Feelings " characterized by political cooperation , public virtue , and an end to partisanship . The personality-based factionalism which temporarily succeeded the First Party System was , and has routinely been portrayed as , rife with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics of Jackson 's earlier career . Remini presents what is often a narratively complex but interpretatively simplistic portrait of a spotlessly honest General Jackson courageously striving to advance the interests of the common man against his almost uniformly corrupt and reactionary opponents . Aside from a new preface to the first volume , Remini has not revised these volumes ; had he done so , this hostile characterization of Jackson 's opponents would likely have been moderated because , since the original publication of the Jackson volumes , Remini has written large-scale biographies of anti-Jacksonians Henry Clay and Daniel Webster . <p> The third and final volume , The Course of American Democracy , 1833-1845 , concludes the story of the Nullification Crisis and the Bank War , and then follows Jackson through his second term and his efforts , after he left office , to aid and influence his party and his chosen successor , Martin Van Buren . Perhaps most striking in this final volume is the realization that Jackson was in nearly constant pain and discomfort throughout the peak years of his power , much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which remained lodged in his chest . Episodes of coughing and hemorrhaging could leave him confined to his White House chambers for weeks , but he was almost always able to muster the power of will to conduct business and greet visitors . <p> During this period , the personal following surrounding Jackson coalesced into the Democratic party . Remini reminds readers that Jackson shaped the party not simply by force of personality but by his outspoken commitment to certain principles . Although personally wealthy ( at least until his adopted son squandered much of that wealth ) , Andrew Jackson was consciously and sincerely devoted to working men , both agricultural and industrial , and to the democratization of American government--that is , to opening government to all ( white male ) Americans and to crushing the influence of quasi-aristocratic cliques . Jackson 's ideas crystallized during his Presidency and his hostility to all banks--not simply the Bank of the United States ( the " Monster " ) --became party doctrine . Banks , to Jackson , deprived working men of their independence as well as their money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffrage , Jackson believed , had not only secured his election as the champion of the People but would guarantee that eventually virtue and justice would triumph . Jackson insisted upon limited government and public economy , except where the power of the Presidency was needed to protect the interests of the People . Remini does an admirable job clarifying Jackson 's own ideas ; although he quite properly criticizes Jackson 's economic ignorance , Remini also makes a largely convincing case for Jackson as a serious political thinker and not a naive frontiersman . <p> Too often , however , Remini equates Jackson 's beliefs with those of his entire party ; given Jackson 's dominance , this is not an illogical equation by any means , but it is still misleading . Seeking to refute accusations that the Democratic party was the party of rising , ambitious men of business rather than of workingmen , Remini provides evidence of Jackson 's own commitment to the interests of workers ; what Jackson believed , of course , may not have been what all members of his party believed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common goals with a multiplicity of motivations . As even Remini 's own evidence suggests , for example , many Democrats did not share Jackson 's opposition to all banks , and subsistence farmers and factory workers--both groups objects of Jackson 's sympathy--were not always in accord . Some Democrats considered themselves progressive reformers striving to end aristocratic privilege , while others considered themselves conservatives fighting the " innovations " of Whiggish social reform ; both groups could wholeheartedly support Democratic policies of limited government . While one would hardly turn to a Jackson biography for a detailed discussion of party ideology , greater attention to such works as Rush Welter 's The Mind of America ( available when these volumes originally appeared ) might have produced a more subtle interpretation . Reprinting the Jackson biography without updating , moreover , deprives Remini of the opportunity to discuss the hotly debated interpretation of Charles Sellers in The Market Revolution , an interpretation with which Remini might be expected to have some sympathy . In addition , Michael Holt 's forthcoming history of the Whig party will likely make Remini 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially simplistic . <p> That said , no historian has done so much to illuminate the labyrinthine personal relationships among Jackson 's family , friends , cabinet , and staff . Remini rightly criticizes Jackson 's choices in appointments and his poor judgements of character . His loyalty to friends such as Secretary of War John H. Eaton shaped and even created many of the controversies of his administration ; the personal relations of these men with Jackson also often determined their political future , as those who broke with Jackson over personal matters found their way into Whig ranks . At the same time , Remini--with equal justice--details the extraordinary managerial skills of such successful appointments as Amos Kendall , Jackson 's second Postmaster General . No other historian has devoted such attention to Jacksonian foreign policy , especially the drawn-out squabble with France . No other biographer has achieved a more nearly complete understanding of Jackson 's personality , and certainly few have placed such emphasis on his religious beliefs . On even the most familiar major events , such as the Nullification Crisis , or the Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially relating to Jackson 's own actions and motivations . He can convey at least a bit of sympathy for Old Hickory to even the most anti-Jackson reader ; readers , whatever their views on Jackson , will at least emerge with a solid grasp of Jackson 's character and ideas . Whatever quibbles this reviewer and other readers may have , these three volumes constitute one of the great American biographies . <p> This review was commissioned for H-Pol by Lex Renda &lt;renlex@uwm.edu&gt; 69403 @qwx479403 <p> Citation : R.

Babits 's Devil of a Whipping is a model study of the 1781 Battle of Cowpens that integrates " new military history " and its bottom-up approach with traditional operational history and a keen understanding of terrain and topography . Babits , an associate professor of maritime history and nautical archaeology at East Carolina State University , painstakingly combed through pension records , participants ' accounts , and contemporary maps in order to produce this sophisticated and deftly written examination of one of the American Revolution 's key battles . <p> The Revolutionaries ' victory at Cowpens was one of the brightest American tactical moments in the War for Independence and a contributing factor toward the eventual British surrender at Yorktown . Yet , despite the battle 's significance in both the final American victory and its own rightful status as a " tactical masterpiece , " it is , according to Babits , " not well known today " ( p. xii ) . Babits posits that this may be due to professional and popular interest in George Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories of the battle are conflicting , particularly regarding the number of troops involved . Thus the battle 's obscurity and participants ' and historians ' diverging standpoints provided Babits with the initial impetus for his research . The final spur came from Babits 's particular field of expertise , historical archaeology . Recent digs at the Little Big Horn and resulting computerized databases on artifacts , sites , and terrain have refined and expanded the sources on the Custer fight and led to revised interpretations of the battle 's final details . However , eighteenth-century ammunition used paper and cloth cartridges , not metal . Because of decomposition , archaeologists are prevented from plotting unit locations and the flow of battle at Cowpens . Nonetheless , the Custer example seems to have indicated to Babits that a similar kind of meticulous fieldwork might be applied to Cowpens vis-a-vis pension applications and the physical battlefield itself . <p> In December 1780 , Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene took command of demoralized American forces in the Southern Department , replacing Maj. Gen. Horatio Gates . Earlier that year , in August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had defeated Gates at Camden , South Carolina , taken Charlotte , North Carolina , and were poised to move further north on the American post at Salisbury . Greene 's command was suffering from inadequate supplies , poor discipline , and disease . The situation , however , was not entirely gloomy . That October , " overmountain " militiamen defeated a British thrust at Kings Mountain , South Carolina , destroying Cornwallis 's western flank column and forcing a British withdrawal to South Carolina . With Cornwallis refitting , Green had to maintain the momentum gained at Kings Mountain while addressing the problems facing his army . <p> By dividing his forces and advancing into South Carolina , Greene enabled his men to forage and refit while giving heart to Patriot forces and making Cornwallis 's hold on the state tenuous at best . Brig . Gen. Daniel Morgan , an experienced frontiersman and light infantry and rifle officer commanded a wing of Greene 's force , the Flying Army . While in the field , Morgan threatened the British supply base at Ninety Six , upsetting Cornwallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Greene 's division of forces and Morgan 's threat by sending after him a mixed force of regulars and Loyalists under the command of Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton . If Tarleton could destroy Morgan 's wing of the army , he would both protect Ninety Six and screen Cornwallis 's left flank in the impending invasion . Morgan understood that he would have to face Tarleton in battle , but he intended to do so on the ground of his choice and in his own time . <p> Morgan chose his ground well and drew his enemy to it with consummate skill . The site he selected was a well-known road juncture near the North Carolina state line , affording access to several nearby fords . Physically , Cowpens was a well-watered plain with low hills , gentle sloping ridgelines , rivulets , and scattered swampy areas . As Morgan withdrew northward , away from Ninety Six , he denied the pursuing British column any potential support from Cornwallis and the main body . While doing so , Morgan 's men foraged liberally , thereby depriving Tarleton 's men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 17 January , the Americans were rested , well fed , and in skillfully chosen positions . Morgan 's talent for reading terrain and posting troops was matched by his aptitude for leading soldiers and taking advantage of their strengths . Tarleton 's men , on the other hand , were exhausted , hungry , and marching straight into battle with little time for rest or preparation . The ensuing battle , which lasted less than an hour , was a stunning victory for Morgan and one of the most serious defeats suffered by British forces in the war . <p> Babits 's mastery of the sources , feel for the battlefield , and understanding of eighteenth-century warfare is undeniable . After combing through pension applications and other participant accounts , he subjected them to post-battle interview and time-sequence analysis methodologies like those employed by S. L. A. Marshall and John Keegan . Tables and descriptions of marching speeds , musketry , wounds , contemporary maps , and the battlefield itself underscore this impressive work .

Many history books have also been written on the exploits of the amaZulu , especially on the nation-building efforts of the founder of the Zulu nation , Shaka .

To understand a people therefore , it is sometimes necessary to understand the popular myths of the people . Klopper follows this tested mode to introduce the amaZulu to her reader through one of their popular creation myths that explains the meaning and origin of the word " Zulu " and the importance of cattle to the amaZulu . The first chapter also introduces the marriage traditions of the amaZulu and the concept of homesteads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a small chiefdom . According to Klopper , Shaka was a military ruler who organised and mobilised his army professionally ( and ruthlessly ) in order to expand his kingdom and increase his area of influence , especially in the area of trade with the Portuguese around Delagoa bay in present day Mozambique . This state of affairs subsisted until he was assassinated through the machinations of Dingane , his stepbrother , and a few of Shaka 's chiefs . Dingane later succeeded Shaka as the king of the amaZulu . <p> Subsequent chapters in this book explore the reigns of other Zulu kings and their primary focus on trade with the white settlers . They also explain the various methods each king employed to deal with first the British and later the Boers ( of mostly Dutch background ) in their incursions into the Zulu kingdom .

The conflict that fundamentally altered race relations and challenged traditional hierarchy in the South also forced women to reevaluate their place in society . As a result of their wartime experience , women " sought to invent new foundations for self-definition and self-worth " ( p. 7 ) . Disillusioned with their men who had proved unable to protect them and profoundly aware of their own limitations when independent , they emerged from the war with " a conflicted legacy " ( p. 256 ) . At war 's end , women were determined never to be helpless again , but they recognized the necessity of patriarchy to protect their status as white women . No gender solidarity here ; elite white women set to work to shore up their men and reestablish a social hierarchy that assured them a privileged place . Faust provides an elegant analysis of how the Civil War both undermined and sustained traditional patriarchal attitudes among elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and memoirs of five hundred southern women , in addition to a vast array of newspapers , novels , songs , government documents , and records of female organizations , Faust reconstructs the changing sense of self that Confederate women experienced as they confronted the perils of a war fought on their own soil . The turmoil caused by that war forced southern women to become " mothers of invention " on many fronts . At the commencement of the war , women moved from the private to the public sphere . Goaded by " feelings of uselessness " ( p. 20 ) , women organized to promote the patriotic cause . Building on Jean E. Friedman 's The Enclosed Garden : Women and Community in the Evangelical South , 1830-1900 ( 1985 ) , Faust recognizes the limited participation of antebellum women in public affairs and sees the war as a stimulus to the growth of female voluntary associations . Whether it was knitting socks , rolling bandages , petitioning the government , presenting patriotic tableaux , or raising funds for the cause , these organizations brought large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More , they assumed a different attitude toward the fruits of their work . Not content simply to turn over to the government monies they had raised , women affected public policy when , for example , they were emboldened to insist that their contributions should be spent for the purchase and building of gunboats to protect their homes , towns , and cities . <p> While women were inventive in restructuring households and doing without or substituting for accustomed goods , the most significant change in their lives came with the assumption of slave management . The peculiar institution was based on mastery . When responsiblity for managing slaves devolved to women , it challenged the concept of women as submissive , passive , and subordinate . Moreover , their inability to master their slaves ( a problem that became greater as the war ground on ) ultimately " did much to undermine women 's active support for both slavery and the Confederate cause " ( p. 56 ) . Frustration at their own inadequacy and defeated by their burdensome duty to control slaves , " many slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade themselves that the institution had become a greater inconvenience than benefit " ( p. 73 ) . Illustrative of the tension between the hold of traditional gender roles and the pull of women 's new self awareness is the experience of Lizzie Neblett . Feeling that she had failed to manage adequately either her overseer or her slaves , she was ready to give up the institution altogether ; yet she still longed for " one good negro to wait upon me " ( p. 70 ) . <p> Representative of the complexity of Faust 's portrait of southern women is her analysis of Benjamin Butler 's General Order No. 28 in New Orleans which , she demonstrates , " drove to the heart of the ambiguities in white southern women 's identities " ( p. 209 ) . To curtail women 's insulting behavior toward Union soldiers and thereby maintain order in the occupied city , Butler proclaimed his intention to treat all offending women as he would prostitutes . While recognizing the public power of women , he controlled them by threatening their identities as ladies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faust concludes , " Confederate women fled from the responsiblity of empowerment into the reassuring safety of tradition 's protective shelter " ( p. 211 ) . <p> Elite women 's struggles to survive in the war-torn South forced them into different roles ( of teacher , nurse , clerk , spy , and soldier ) , new habits ( of reading , writing , and dress ) , and changed attitudes ( toward religion , courtship , and marriage ) . They invented a sense of self , according to Faust , based on " individual right and identity , of self-interest , that was strikingly modern " ( p. 242 ) . When , in desperation , they began to insist that their men give up the war and come home , their demands were based on their perception that they , too , had " needs , interests , and even rights , not just duties and obligations " ( p. 235 ) . <p> In the end , southern women once again embraced patriarchy . Their rationale in accepting it , however , had changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us be the same as we have been " ( p. 3 ) . The Civil War had profoundly shaken women 's confidence in their men , religion , state , and society . With clear-eyed realism , they weighed the privileges of patriarchy against its inequities and chose " the cherished prerogatives of race and class , of whiteness and elitism " ( p. 233 ) . <p> Mothers of Invention is an important book that will be the foundation for future interpretations of the meaning of the Civil War to southern women . Faust has added complexity and ambiguity to our vision of southern women , and historians will hereafter have to contend with many of the issues she has raised . Some will assert that women had always known the value of patriarchy . They will ask whether the war , after all , was simply a chance women seized . <p> Mothers of Invention will require further invesigations into whether the war made significant , long-lasting changes for women .

Commissioned and compiled circa 1541-42 , during the administration of Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza , the codex consists of native-style , handsomely-colored pictorial scenes on European paper , recording important information about Aztec/Mexica imperial history , economic organization , and society . It was commissioned by royal officials ( it is not entirely clear if Viceroy Mendoza or officials in Spain initiated the project ) , and executed by Indian scribes and informants who still had first-hand knowledge of pre-conquest conditions twenty years after the fall of Tenochtitlan . <p> The original purpose of the Codex Mendoza seems to have been to provide royal policymakers with reliable information about the functioning of the former Aztec empire now controlled by the Spaniards . Beyond its practical value to the Spanish , the antiquarian value of the codex to modern scholars is immense , since two-thirds of the document may have been copied directly from pre-Hispanic pictorial sources .

Part One , " the conquest section , " is a history of the Mexica kings from the founding of Tenochtitlan to the arrival of the Spanish . For each king 's reign , a standard " annals " format was employed by native artists : Native-style year glyphs run along the margins of an initial page ( corresponding to his years of rule ) , followed by a series of place-glyphs pierced by flaming-spears ( representing the towns and regions captured during his military campaigns ) . Part Two , " the tribute section , " is an account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standardized format is employed by the native artists with each page corresponding to a distinct tribute-paying region : Place-glyphs of the towns within each tribute province are drawn along the left and lower margins of the page , while the type and quantity of tribute paid during the year are represented by images of tribute goods with Spanish glosses . Like its sister-document the Matricula de Tributos , Part Two of the Codex Mendoza provided the Spanish with practical information about Aztec tribute patterns and levels that served as a guide and yardstick for their own tribute-collection activities . The third part of the Codex Mendoza , " the daily-life section , " contains ethnographic data pertaining to the life cycle of individuals from birth to marriage ( fs. 57r-61r ) , as well as about the various occupations of priests , warriors and other professions . While Parts One and Two seem to have been copied from extant native pictorial manuscripts , the third section was added specifically for the codex . <p> The Codex Mendoza is rivaled only by Sahagun 's Florentine Codex as an indispensable source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico immediately before Spanish Conquest . Over the years , Parts One and Two of the codex have served as the basis of numerous reconstructions of the expansion and maintenance of the Aztec Empire . Publications by Barlow , Hassig , Van Zantwijk , and others have essentially summarized the information contained in the codex and made it available to wider audiences . Up to now , however , there has been no compendium of authoritative studies or facsimile reproduction of the entire Codex Mendoza readily available to scholars and students . Five years ago , the publication of Berdan and Anawalt 's magisterial four-volume The Codex Mendoza Berkeley : University of California Press , 1992 was the first major reproduction with English translation of the entire text since James Cooper Clark 's three-volume edition of 1938 . In addition , Berdan and Anawalt gathered and wrote state-of-the-art , up-to-date essays and commentaries about the codex that should serve us well into the 21st century .

These " maternalist " reformers ( Florence Kelley , Julia Lathrop , and Grace Abbot , among others ) endorsed a simple premise : the development of good Americans required good American mothering . Thus , they and their heirs counseled first immigrant mothers and later African-American mothers to shuck their own cultural idiosyncracies and hew to the precepts of mothering as practiced by the Anglo-American middle class . While recognizing their biases , Mink points out that this group of reformers did not adhere to the more lethal version of " Americanism " that branded Southern and Eastern European immigrants and black Americans congenitally inferior and therefore unable to benefit from the tutelage of their cultural superiors . To the contrary , these maternalist reformers felt sure that proper education would result quickly in a perfected motherhood that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord with appropriately gendered social roles . Mink labels this more benign outlook " racial liberalism . " These reformers insisted that the welfare of the child demanded state intervention on behalf of poor mothers of all races , thus participating in gender-based resistance to both laissez-faire capitalism and essentialist racism . In doing so , however , they reified distinctions based upon sex , incorporating women 's economic dependence as an essential component of good mothering , and they endorsed a single , culturally loaded standard for what good mothering looked like . <p> Mink divides this volume into three sections : the first deals with the development of maternalist social policy and reformers ' pursuit of state " mothers ' pensions " to enable mothers without husbands to care for children without waged work . The second section focuses on the attempt to employ education to achieve adoption of middle-class Anglo-American homemaking models by immigrant and black women . The third section describes the federalization of state programs supporting single mothers and the challenge to maternalism posed by World War II . Mink discusses the renunciation of maternalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . <p> Although much of this territory has been mined before , Mink offers a fine synthesis of the earlier work , as well as an enlightening perspective which focuses on assimilative goals . She begins by detailing the shocking data about illiteracy , mental deficiency , and the ill-health of military recruits during World War I , which allowed maternalist reformers to point to the consequences of inferior mothering . Explanations for the deficits appeared in racialized analyses , which provided opportunities for maternalists to assert the need for benefits ( support for single mothers , money for education ) to improve the mothering of unassimilated new immigrants in northern cities . <p> The Smith-Hughes Act , adopted in 1917 , offered federal support for vocational education in high schools , and maternalists used the money to advance education for women in homemaking .

Traditional cookery spelled continuing attachment to old-country ways and social workers viewed it with dismay ; " Still eating spaghetti , not yet Americanized , " wrote one social worker after a visit to an Italian family ( p. 90 ) . Home economists addressed the troubling topic in journal articles , in which one noted that Jewish foods were " generally overseasoned , over rich , over sharp , or overconcentrated " ( p. 91 ) . One pamphlet writer , in the hopes of correcting the diet of Mexican-American families in Southern California , advised preparing salads of spinach or fruits served with mayonnaise and sandwiches of lettuce or graham crackers . <p> Mink goes on to describe the way in which the fulfillment of the maternalist policy agenda during the New Deal foundered on the shoals of obdurate racism . The separation of benefits for widowed mothers from those for unmarried mothers led to racial sequestration that made the Aid to Dependent Children ( later Aid to Families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The maternalist belief in " education " toward a particular kind of mothering justified insult and intrusion ; maternalist endorsement of cultural conformity damned black families who declined to accept Anglo-American norms . After World War II supplanted the New Deal and lowered the barriers to work for white married mothers , maternalists found themselves increasingly unable to continue arguing that wage-earning and motherhood could not succeed together . <p> Mink notes that the maternalist legacy had important detrimental consequences : welfare adversaries could appropriate their argument that bad mothering , not economics , produced the problems of the poor . Payments for mothers to stay home with their children , therefore , were producing the problems they had been intended to solve . Since the black mother had never won the same degree of protection accorded white mothers--many state programs had always considered the black mother employable by virtue of her race and declared her therefore ineligible for welfare benefits--a program that appeared to permit chiefly black mothers to stay home with their children retained fewer and fewer supporters . Thus , readers of Mink 's book will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee of assistance to poor mothers in favor of a program requiring mothers to work at minimum wage . Moreover , her careful exegesis and the breadth of this study should make this volume a good choice for undergraduate and graduate students in the history of social policy . 69402 @qwx479402 <p> If there is additional discussion of this review , you may access it through the network , at : /state.

In seventeen chapters ( plus an introduction and epilogue ) , seven international experts in military history set out to consider their subject from 600 BCE to the present . In fact , their scope is narrower and more specific . It is to explain the rise to dominance of what its authors understand as " the western way of war . " This , Parker claims , explains the dominance of European or western culture--more than economic , intellectual and other factors . In his preface , Parker confronts the charge leveled against the earlier work that his focus is ( too ) Eurocentric . His defense against the charge has three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to cover adequately in a single volume the military history of all cultures . Secondly , and following from this , it would be a distortion to include some minor reference to the military traditions of those non-European cultures while devoting the vast part of the text to the European way of war . Third , and above all , the European way of war has become the dominant military culture in the last two hundred years . Either non-European states were conquered by that culture or they were obliged to adopt it themselves to survive . <p> This claim , of course , raises the question : just how do we understand this " western way " of war ? According to Parker , it has five key aspects or foundations . The first of these is the reliance on technological superiority--generally as a means of compensating for inferiority in numbers . Thus , starting with the Persian wars of the fifth century BCE , the West was usually able to field men whose ( technological ) fighting potential was superior to that of their opponents . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to guarantee victory . This problem brings us to the Parker 's second factor--superior discipline and training , which often made up for numerical weakness . Associated with this training was the fact that western armies won their victories for the most part on the basis of their infantry . Parker 's third factor represents a remarkable continuity in the western military tradition , or rather , in military theory . Typically , Vegetius 's compendium of Roman military practice , Concerning Military Matters , compiled at the end of the fourth century CE remained popular for more than 1,000 years : George Washington owned--and read and annotated--a copy . In part in consequence of this tradition , certain basic ideas have had a remarkable longevity , including for example , a belief in the desirability of decisive victory . Parker contrasts this attitude with a non-western view of war which was less determined , less destructive--and ultimately less successful . A fourth factor emphasized by Parker relates to the existence in Europe of a multiplicity of competing states . The struggle between them apparently stimulated military innovation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctuated equilibrium " model . In this model , short bursts of rapid change are separated by longer intervals of slower improvement . Thus , in the fourteenth century , English archers and Swiss pike men , or in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , the so-called artillery fortress ( those familiar with Parker 's work will recognize a hobby horse of his here ) shattered the prevailing equilibrium and provoked a phase of rapid adjustment and transformation . However , the ability to respond to such challenges rested on Parker 's fifth factor : innovation--adopting new technology and expanding armies and navies . Finding the typically enormous means to pay for this expensive strategy enhanced the power of the state in the West . Such power could provoke a negative reaction , but overall , the challenge of war--if successfully met--increased the effectiveness of the state . As Parker puts it , " states made war but wars also made states " ( p.8 ) . But success in this respect also depended in part upon the development of other instruments of power , particularly the financial institutions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn required the cooperation of those who supplied the credit or the means which underpinned it . Long-term credit in wartime thus represented a crucial " secret weapon " of the West . Not surprisingly , not all western states stayed the course . Sweden , for example--an aggressive and imperial power in the Baltic and north Germany in the seventeenth century--dropped out of the race following its traumatic defeat in the Great Northern War ( 1700-21 ) . However , the West as a block--Europe initially , subsequently joined by the United States--had found the means , that is , the military culture , that ensured " European ' " domination of the world , and which was already well advanced by the middle of the seventeenth century . <p> The rest of the book focuses on explaining these developments . Part 1 , " The Age of Massed Infantry , " covers the period from 600 BC to 300 AD , with chapters on the " Genesis of the Infantry , 600-350 BC " and " The Roman Way of War 250 BC-AD 300 ' " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 300-1500 AD ) includes chapters on " New Weapons , New Tactics 1300-1500 " and " The Gunpowder Revolution 1300-1500 " ; part 3 , " The Age of Guns and Sails " covers the period 1500-1800/1815 ; and part 4 , " The Age of Mechanized Warfare " covers the period 1800-2004 . Thus , the book 's coverage is extended beyond that of 1995 to include most obviously the Al Qaeda attack on New York in September 2001 , President Bush 's " war on terror " ( which , curiously , given its stretching of the nature and understanding of war , is not really discussed ) , the attack on ( or bombardment ) of Afghanistan ( 2001 ) and the invasion of Iraq ( 2003 ) . The volume is completed by an epilogue in which Parker briefly recapitulates the factors that distinguish the Western way of war . He also explains the successes of this way of war and seeks to divine future developments . Parker concludes that to maintain its ( military ) dominance , the West must continue " to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best done , he argues , by imitating the traditions outlined and analyzed in this volume , which thus is intended to function as something of a manual for policy-makers ( and their electorates ? ) . Some additional material is found in a chronology and in a glossary . Finally , there is a helpful bibliography , which inevitably , however , can only scratch the surface of the vast range of secondary literature which underpins what is essentially a work of synthesis . <p> Parker has edited a very readable and interesting volume , one which has already won widespread plaudits--for good reason . However ( and inevitably , given the ambitious attempt to cover the great sweep of the history of war over two millennia in little more than 400 pages ) , some anomalies and lacunae remain . Half of the book deals with the 2,000 years or so to 1800 ; the other half with the mere two hundred years since .

The War of Bavarian Succession ( 1778-79 ) , and the rather more important Russo-Austrian war in the Balkans against the Ottoman empire ( 1787-92 ) , are also missing . As for the twentieth century , the Spanish Civil War is covered very cursorily , and nothing is said about the destruction of Guernica by the Condor Legion , although it might be thought to have deserved mention as representing the testing of some of the new thinking about the use of airpower in war . Curiously , too , the concept of Blitzkrieg is nowhere mentioned . The volume also occasionally seems to be shy of engaging with influential theorists of war .

Last , but by no means least , given the attention devoted to contemporary conflicts ( notably the second Iraq war ) , and the lack of consensus about their justification , some will think the account , evenhanded and objective as it clearly seeks to be , insufficiently critical of the leaders who took their states to war . <p> Some readers will want more on their particular period , or war , or aspect of military ( or naval ) history , and less on others .

From Geneva , the seat of the League of Nations , there comes the news that the fervent plea addressed by the Bahfs of Irq to the world 's supreme Tribunal regarding an issue that for a time has stirred the Bahf world to its foundation has at last met with a noble and most gratifying response . <p> You will recall the references made in my previous communications , dated November 6 , 1925 , October 29 , 1926 , and January 1 , 1929 , to the forcible seizure of Bahullhs sacred house by the Shfah of Baghdd , to the appeals which from almost every quarter of the globe have showered upon the authorities of Irq for its restitution , to the long and unsuccessful legal proceedings to which the representatives of the Faith in that land have resorted , and lastly to the petition which they have addressed to the League 's Permanent Mandates Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intervention of the Council in their behalf . I am now informed that after mature deliberation the conclusion arrived at by the Mandates Commission , urging that prompt action be taken to redress the wrong suffered by the Bahfs , has been duly communicated to , and adopted by , the Council of the League , which in turn will formally communicate the recommendations of its Commission to the Mandatory Power . <p> Decision of League of Nations <p> From the official text of the minutes of the meeting of the Mandates Commission* , as well as from its authorized report to the Council , both of which have been made public , it is clear and evident that the terms of the conclusion arrived at are neither vague nor evasive , but set forth in unmistakable language the legitimate aspirations of an oppressed and struggling Faith . The decision neither implies compensation to the Bahf Community for the loss of the sacred buildings , nor does it expressly provide for the expropriation of the property by the State . To quote from the text of the official document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask the British Government to call upon the Government of Irq to redress without delay the denial of justice from which the petitioners have suffered . " ( *Minutes of the Fourteenth Session of the Permanent Mandates Commission , held at Geneva from October 26th to November 13th , 1928 , C. 568 , M. 179 ; 1928 , VI . ) <p> A glance at the minutes of the Commission 's meeting will suffice to reveal that in the course of the lengthy discussions conducted by the members of the Commission the following important facts have been stressed and recognized . The British accredited representative , present at the sessions of the Commission , has declared that " it was a fact that the Mandatory Power had recognized that the Bahfs had suffered an injustice and , ever since the award made by the High Court , the High Commissioner had been considering what means could be found to remove , either by an executive act or otherwise , the unjust effects of that decision . " Moreover , it has been acknowledged by the accredited representative that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they had expended on it sums that exceeded the value of the site itself , and were thus , in accordance with the provision in the still operative Turkish Law , entitled to purchase the site . Allusion has also been made in the course of the deliberations of the members of the Commission to the fact that the action of the Shfah community with respect to Bahullh 's sacred house constituted a breach of the Constitution and the Organic Law of Irq which , according to the testimony of the British accredited representative , expressly provided for the unfettered freedom of conscience . A question from one of the members had even elicited from the representative of the British Government the reply assuring the Commission that the Mandatory Power actually possessed means of exercising pressure on the authorities in order , if necessary , to insure that so fundamental an article in the Constitution would be respected . Furthermore , the opinion has been strongly expressed that the matter had assumed an " importance which exceeded that of the individual case of the Bahfs , " inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having been inspired by political prejudice , " with the consequent impression on the Commission that " from a moral point of view , conditions in Irq were not improving ; that religious passions still ran high and that peace had not yet been brought about between the various religious communities . " It has even been proposed to supplement the report submitted to the Council with the observation that , in the opinion of the Commission , " a country in which the Sovereign and the highest law courts are capable of so flagrant a denial of justice would probably not be considered to be eligible to become a Member of the League of Nations . " The minutes of the Commissions meeting further indicate that the contents of the letter addressed by the Prime Minister of Irq to the British representative in Baghdd and which accompanied the text of the petition of the Bahfs do not in the opinion of the Commission " meet any of the allegations of the petitioners " and are confined to a mere assertion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to the memorandum submitted by the Mandatory Power in connection with the Bahf petition , and to which the minutes briefly refer , it is expressly stated that His Britannic Majesty 's Government considers the ejectment of the Bahfs while the case was still undecided to have been an illegal action , that the reasons adduced to justify such action were hardly admissible , and that the final verdict of the Court of Appeal is unsustainable , contrary to the law , and tainted by political considerations . The minutes further declare that although any petition presented to the Commission appealing from a decision given by a Court of Law is to be considered as not being in order , yet as the petition submitted by the Bahfs reveals such a state of partiality , servility and sectarianism it has been found desirable to depart from the general rule and to regard the petition in question as receivable by the Commission . And among the concluding observations in the minutes of the Commission 's meeting regarding the Bahf petition is this significant passage : " The revelations made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irq in an unfavorable light . In a country where the conduct of the highest authorities has led the Mandatory Power to pass such severe criticisms , where the Supreme Court of Justice is under legitimate suspicion , and where religious fanaticism pursues minorities and controls power , a state of affairs prevails which is not calculated to insure the development and well-being of the inhabitants . The petitioners have suffered a serious denial of justice the direct responsibility for which rests on the authorities of Irq . The fact that this denial of justice could not be prevented or immediately made good was due to the weakening of the Mandatory Power 's control in Irq . The Mandatory attempted , but in vain , to redress the injury done to the petitioners by using the means of influence at its disposal under the regime set up by the 1922 Treaty vis-a-vis King Feisal and the Irq Government . These efforts would not appear to correspond fully to the engagements resulting from the British Governments declaration , which was approved by the Council on September 27 , 1924 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty of Alliance between the British Government and Irq was to insure the complete observance and execution in Irq of the principles which the acceptance of the mandate was intended to secure. " <p> This grave censure pronounced by the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations on the administration of justice and the general conduct of affairs in Irq , as well as the association of the humiliation afflicting Bahullhs sacred dwelling-place with the obligations implied in the Treaty of Alliance binding the Governments of Great Britain and Irq , not only proclaim to the world the enhanced prestige of that hallowed and consecrated spot , but testify as well to the high sense of integrity that animates the members of the League 's honored Commission in the discharge of their public duties . In their formal reply to the Bahf petitioners , the members of the Permanent Mandates Commission have , with the sanction of the Council of the League of Nations , issued this most satisfactory declamation : " The Permanent Mandates Commission , recognizing the justice of the complaint made by the Bahf Spiritual Assembly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such action as it thinks proper to redress the wrong suffered by the petitioners . " A similar passage inserted in the report of the Finnish Representative to the Council of the League runs as follows : " The Commission has also considered a petition from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahfs of Irq , a community which has been dispossessed of its property by another community and has been unable to recover it by legal means . The Commission is convinced that this situation , which is described as an injustice , must be attributed solely to religious passion , and it asks that the petitioners wrongs should be redressed . I venture to suggest that the Council should accept the Mandate Commissions conclusions on this case , which is an example of the difficulties to be met with in the development of a young country . " This report , together with the joint observations and conclusions of the Commission , have been duly considered and approved by the Council of the League , which has in turn instructed the Secretary-General to bring to the notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conclusions arrived at by the Mandates Commission . <p> Dearly-beloved co-workers ! Much has been achieved thus far in the course of the progress of this complicated , delicate and highly significant issue . The Bahf world is eagerly expectant , and fervently prays , that the Almighty may graciously assist the Government chiefly responsible for the well-being of Irq to take " without delay " such steps as will insure the execution of the considered judgment of the representatives of the Sovereign States , members of the Council , and signatories of the Covenant , of the League of Nations . <p> I will , if deemed proper and advisable , inform you of the manner in which the admiration and the gratitude of the National Spiritual Assemblies , representative of the divers communities in the Bahf world , should be expressed and tendered to the authorities of the League of Nations who have been chiefly responsible for this noble , this epoch-making decision .

Though as yet unresolved through a combination of causes , religious as well as political , it has already remarkably fulfilled Bah'u'llh 's own prediction , and will , in its own appointed time , as the means for its solution are providentially created , fulfill the high destiny ordained for it by Him in His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had no conceivable claim to it whatever , He had prophesied that " it shall be so abased in the days to come as to cause tears to flow from every discerning eye . " <p> The Spiritual Assembly of the Bah'fs of Baghdd , deprived of the use of that sacred property through an adverse decision by a majority of the court of Appeal , which had reversed the verdict of the lower court and awarded the property to the Shf'ahs , and aroused by subsequent action of the Shf'ahs , soon after the execution of the judgment of that court , in converting the building into waqf property ( pious foundation ) , designating it " Husaynfyyih , " with the purpose of consolidating their gain , realized the futility of the three years of negotiations they had been conducting with the civil authorities in Baghdd for the righting of the wrong inflicted upon them . In their capacity as the national representatives of the Bah'fs of Iraq , they , therefore , on September 11 , 1928 , through the High Commissioner for Iraq and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covenant of the League of Nations , approached the League 's Permanent Mandates Commission , charged with the supervision of the administration of all Mandated Territories , and presented a petition that was accepted and approved by that body in November , 1928 . A memorandum submitted , in connection with that petition , to that same Commission , by the Mandatory Power unequivocally stated that the Shf'ahs had " no conceivable claim whatever " to the House , that the decision of the judge of the Ja'farfyyih court was " obviously wrong , " " unjust " and " undoubtedly actuated by religious prejudice , " that the subsequent ejectment of the Bah'fs was " illegal , " that the action of the authorities had been " highly irregular , " and that the verdict of the Court of Appeal was suspected of not being " uninfluenced by political consideration . " <p> " The Commission , " states the Report submitted by it to the Council of the League , and published in the Minutes of the 14th session of the Permanent Mandates Commission , held in Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic and published in Iraq , " draws the Council 's attention to the considerations and conclusions suggested to it by an examination of the petition ... It recommends that the Council should ask the British Government to make representations to the Iraq Government with a view to the immediate redress of the denial of justice from which the petitioners have suffered . " The British accredited representative present at the sessions of the Commission , furthermore , stated that " the Mandatory Power had recognized that the Bah'fs had suffered an injustice , " whilst allusion was made , in the course of that session , to the fact that the action of the Shf'ahs constituted a breach of the constitution and the Organic Law of Iraq . The Finnish representative , moreover , in his report to the Council , declared that this " injustice must be attributed solely to religious passion , " and asked that " the petitioner 's wrongs should be redressed . " <p> The Council of the League , on its part , having considered this report as well as the joint observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 4 , 1929 , a resolution , subsequently translated and published in the newspapers of Baghdd , directing the Mandatory Power " to make representations to the Government of Iraq with a view to the immediate redress of the injustice suffered by the Petitioners . " It instructed , accordingly , the Secretary General to bring to the notice of the Mandatory Power , as well as to the petitioners concerned , the conclusions arrived at by the Commission , an instruction which was duly transmitted by the British Government through its High Commissioner to the Iraq Government . <p> A letter dated January 12 , 1931 , written on behalf of the British Foreign Minister , Mr. Arthur Henderson , addressed to the League Secretariat , stated that the conclusions reached by the Council had " received the most careful consideration by the Government of Iraq , " who had " finally decided to set up a special committee ... to consider the views expressed by the Bah'f community in respect of certain houses in Baghdd , and to formulate recommendations for an equitable settlement of this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee had submitted its report in August , 1930 , that it had been accepted by the government , that the Bah'f community had " accepted in principle " its recommendations , and that the authorities in Baghdd had directed that " detailed plans and estimates shall be prepared with a view to carrying these recommendations into effect during the coming financial year . " <p> No need to dwell on the subsequent history of this momentous case , on the long-drawn out negotiations , the delays and complications that ensued ; on the consultations , " over a hundred " in number , in which the king , his ministers and advisers took part ; on the expressions of " regret , " of " surprise " and of " anxiety " placed on record at successive sessions of the Mandates Commission held in Geneva in 1929 , 1930 , 1931 , 1932 and 1933 ; on the condemnation by its members of the " spirit of intolerance " animating the Shf'ah community , of the " partiality " of the Irqf courts , of the " weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion at the bottom of this injustice " ; on their testimony to the " extremely conciliatory disposition " of the petitioners , on their " doubt " regarding the adequacy of the proposals , and on their recognition of the " serious " character of the situation that had been created , of the " flagrant denial of justice " which the Bah'fs had suffered , and of the " moral debt " which the Iraq Government had contracted , a debt which , whatever the changes in her status as a nation , it was her bounden duty to discharge . <p> Nor does it seem necessary to expatiate on the unfortunate consequences of the untimely death of both the British High Commissioner and the Irqf Prime Minister ; on the admission of Iraq as a member of the League , and the consequent termination of the mandate held by Great Britain ; on the tragic and unexpected death of the King himself ; on the difficulties raised owing to the existence of a town planning scheme ; on the written assurance conveyed to the High Commissioner by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on the pledge given by the King , prior to his death , in the presence of the foreign minister , in February , 1933 , that the House would be expropriated , and the necessary sum would be appropriated in the spring of the ensuing year ; on the categorical statement made by that same foreign minister that the Prime Minister had given the necessary assurances that the promise already made by the acting Premier would be redeemed ; or on the positive statements made by that same Foreign Minister and his colleague , the Minister of Finance , when representing their country during the sessions of the League Assembly held in Geneva , that the promise given by their late King would be fully honored . <p> Suffice it to say that , despite these interminable delays , protests and evasions , and the manifest failure of the Authorities concerned to implement the recommendations made by both the Council of the League and the Permanent Mandates Commission , the publicity achieved for the Faith by this memorable litigation , and the defense of its cause--the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been such as to excite the wonder of its friends and to fill with consternation its enemies . Few episodes , if any , since the birth of the Formative Age of the Faith of Bah'u'llh , have given rise to repercussions in high places comparable to the effect produced on governments and chancelleries by this violent and unprovoked assault directed by its inveterate enemies against one of its holiest sanctuaries . <p> " Grieve not , O House of God , " Bah'u'llh Himself has significantly written , " if the veil of thy sanctity be rent asunder by the infidels . God hath , in the world of creation , adorned thee with the jewel of His remembrance . Such an ornament no man can , at any time , profane . Towards thee the eyes of thy Lord shall , under all conditions , remain directed . " " In the fullness of time , " He , in another passage , referring to that same House , has prophesied , " the Lord shall , by the power of truth , exalt it in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Standard of His Kingdom , the Shrine round which will circle the concourse of the faithful . " <p> <h> The Bahf World , Volume II , 1926-1928 <p> Extract from <h> Survey of Current Bahf Activities in the East and West <p> By Horace Holley <p> The Near East <p> Page 32 <p> .. The report of current activities furnished by the Spiritual Assembly of Baghdd conveys the information that during the autumn of 1927 the local Bahfs took possession of a house which had been purchased for dedication and use as a Mashriqul-Adhkr . A group of three buildings nearby will also be acquired in the near future , and devoted to the application of those social ideals which so vitally relate the Mashriqul-Adhkr to the needs of the present age . <p> Page 33 <p> The Baghdd believers are also taking steps to secure photographs of the cave in the Sargul Mountain near Sulimaniyye where Bahullh spent two years in solitude during the time He and His followers were banished by the Persian Government to Baghdd . It was this period of voluntary seclusion , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bequeathed to history irrevocable proof that Bahullh and not His half-brother , Subhi-Ezel , was in reality the one celebrated by the Bb and for Whom the Bbf Movement was the spiritual preparation . For by this act of voluntary retirement , Bahullh gave Subhi-Ezel unhampered opportunity to exercise the spiritual leadership over the Bbfs which the latter claimed as his right . The result , however , demonstrated Subhi-Ezels utter incapacity to maintain unity among the Bbfs , inspire them with faith and confidence sufficient to meet their many difficulties and guide them along lines of true future progress . Nothing but the return of Bahullh could re-quicken the flames of their ardor or supply them with the more universal principles of conduct and faith required to transform the Bbf Movement into a world religion . <p> At Baghdd , as in Egypt , an incident of utmost importance to all Bahfs has taken place . A house occupied by Bahullh during His exile at Baghdd and indicated by Him to be a permanent Bahf Shrine and a center of pilgrimage commemorating the gloomiest days and bitterest experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Bahf custodians by the local mulls and placed under Muslim jurisdiction . In connection with the episode , the American National Spiritual Assembly received the following statement written by the Guardian of the Cause on November 6 , 1925 : <p> " The sad and sudden crisis that has arisen in connection with the ownership of Bahullhs sacred house in Baghdd has sent a thrill of indignation and dismay throughout the whole of the Bahf world . Houses that have been occupied by Bahullh for well nigh the whole period of His exile in Irq ; ordained by Him as the chosen and sanctified object of Bahf pilgrimage in future ; magnified and extolled in countless Tablets and Epistles as the sacred center " round which shall circle all peoples and kindreds of the earth " lie now , due to fierce intrigue and ceaseless fanatical opposition , at the mercy of the declared enemies of the Cause. . <p> " Conscious of the fact that this property has been occupied by Bahf authorized representatives for an uninterrupted period of not less than thirty years , and having successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of First Instance , the Bahfs the world over can not believe that the high sense of honor and fairness which inspires the British Administration of Irq will ever tolerate such grave miscarriage of justice . They confidently appeal to the public opinion of the world for the defense and protection of their legitimate rights now sorely trampled under the feet of relentless enemies . " <p> from Bahf Administration , pp. 94-97 <p> Aroused by this unjustifiable seizure , the National and Local Spiritual Assemblies of all countries instantly communicated an appeal to the local authorities at Baghdd and also to the British Colonial Office . It may be of interest here to quote a few passages from the letter addressed to King Feisal by the American National Spiritual Assembly : <p> " We are prepared to recognize that the case must , for the present at least , be considered from the point of view of public policy rather than of simple equity , since the fanatical minority hostile to the Bahf Religion those responsible for the seizure have so little title to the property that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their desire to persecute the Bahfs . And where this spirit of religious intolerance is fanned to flame , matters of simple equity are all too frequently lost sight of in the graver public issues involved . <p> " Therefore we urge your Majesty to appreciate our feeling of special rever- <p> page 34 <p> ence for the habitation occupied by Bahullh during the period of His exile in Baghdd , our deep spiritual devotion for this scene of His loving sacrifice in behalf of universal truth , our whole-hearted resolution to assert the rights of the Bahfs in every legitimate way at our command , an attitude fully shared by our fellow believers in all lands . The case can not be considered as merely temporary and unimportant issue between Muslim leaders on the one hand and Bahf heretics on the other , nor as a dispute which can be measured in terms of the value of the property as real estate . The Cause of Bahullh transcends the limits of Irq or Persia . It is no movement of heresy or reform contained within the boundaries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious influence of His son , Abdul-Bah , have penetrated to the West as to the East , and the Cause stands ever more visibly as an independent Religion whose object is to promote the unity of mankind . <p> " If any of those opposing the Bahfs in Irq should protest that , as between Muslim leaders and the Bahfs the former deserve the support of the civil authorities because of their loyalty to the Religion of Muhammad , it can be asked by the Bahfs what Muslim leader ever inspired thousands of Christians with true reverence for Muhammad as a Messenger of God ? Yet this superhuman task has been accomplished by Bahullh and Abdul-Bah , whose writings on this subject have been published and broadcast throughout Europe and America , as we can make evident if required <p> " But perhaps there are those who will admit these facts , yet insist that the rights of the Bahfs to these shrines need not be observed for the reason that the religion founded by Bahullh is feeble and unimportant , lacking accumulated treasurers , impressive edifices , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced , the answer of the Bahfs is no less sufficient and clear . We need not point out , while a prisoner and an exile , Bahullh revealed certain spiritual messages to many rulers and kings to the Shh of Persia , the Sultn of Turkey , to queen Victoria , Napoleon III , the Czar of Russia , the King of Prussia and to the Emperor of Austria-Hungary . A similar message was sent also to the President of the United States . In these letters Bahullh established the ideal of universal peace , invoking the powerful rulers to observe this ideal , and prophesying the utter ruin of those who continued injustice toward their subjects and neglect the religion of God . Has this not all come to pass ? Have not the tyrannical thrones been overturned , while the ideal of universal peace now rules the hearts of men ? By this and similar events too numerous to mention , the power which spoke through Bahullh has been made manifest and the degradation of injustice been upheld for the whole world to behold . As between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who weight the importance and success of a religion in the scales of wealth , property and even numbers of adherents alone . " <p> The determination of the Bahfs to spare no efforts until these shrines have been restored , can be measured by the following reference to them in the words of Bahullh : <p> " Remember that which hath been revealed unto Our servant Mihdf in the first year of Our exile in the Land of Mystery ( Adrianople ) . Therein We have predicted that which will befall the house in the days to come , lest he be grieved over that which hath been wrought by the robber and aggressor in days past . Verily , the Lord thy God knoweth all that is in heaven and earth . We thus declared : Know thou in truth , this is not the first humiliation suffered by My house , for in days gone by the hand of the oppressor abased and dishonored it . In truth I declare it shall be so abased in the days to come as to cause tears to flow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that which lieth hidden beyond the veil , inscrutable to all <p> page 35 two photos , the Bahfs of Baghdd and of Egypt <p> page 36 <p> but God , the Almighty , the All-praised , and in the fullness of time , shall the Lord by the power of truth exalt it in the eyes of all the world , cause it to become the mighty standard of His dominion , the Shrine round which shall circle the concourse of the faithful . Thus hath spoken the Lord thy God ere the day of lamentation is at hand . We have revealed it unto to thee in this Our sacred epistle , lest thou shouldst sorrow at that which hath befallen the house through the assaults of the enemy . All praise to God , the All-knowing , the All-wise . " <p> <p> The Bah'f World , Volume III , 1928-1930 <p> page 198 <p> THE CASE OF BAH-ULL-H 'S HOUSE IN BAGHD-D <p> BEFORE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS <p> Text of the Petition . <p> To the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Permanent Mandate Commission of The League of Nations <p> Sirs , <p> In conformity with the provisions of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations , placing the well-being of the peoples of Mandated territories under the protection of the League , your petitioners respectfully appeal to you for protection and aid in their grievous suffering through the invasion of their right to complete freedom of religious belief and freedom to practice forms of worship in accordance with their customs ; a right guaranteed by the enlightened conscience of civilized mankind and by the specific provisions of the Mandate of the League ; of article 3 of the Treaty of October 10th , 1922 , between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of Irq , and of articles 6 and 13 of the Organic Law of Irq . ( Cf. Annex No. 1 . ) <p> Your petitioners and their fellow believers in all parts of the world are followers of the spiritual teachings of Bahullh ( 1817-1892 ) , Whom they look to and revere as the One Whom Siyyid Alf Muhammad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whom God would make manifest " ; a universal spiritual Teacher soon to appear , Who by the inspired understanding and power of His life and precepts would remove the differences separating the religions of the world today and usher in the era promised by them all of the ultimate spiritual unification of mankind . <p> In Bahullh your petitioners recognize this universal Teacher . They believe Him to be the supreme Manifestation of God thus far revealed to the world : that in Him converges and finds expression the aspiration and belief of the devout Hindu , Confucianist , Zoroastrian , Buddhist , Jew , Christian and Muhammad ; the aspiration and belief that , in His good time , God would send to the world His Messenger , divinely inspired to reveal to all peoples His truth , to the end that , guided by this new understanding , they might unite in universal fellowship and establish His Kingdom in this world . <p> From this brief outline of the supreme spiritual station which Bahullh occupies in the faith of your petitioners will be understood the sacred reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , places to them holy , and of sacredness , dignity and vital importance in their religious life and worship equal to that of places of like significance in the religious life of the followers of the other great spiritual Leaders of mankind . <p> One of the most sacred of these holy places , situated in Baghdd , your petitioners aver has been unlawfully wrested from their possession and they have been deprived of the spiritual solace and inspiration of its use in their worship . This it is alleged has been brought about through the machinations of the leaders of the Shfah sect of Islam , fearful of the spreading influence of Bahullh in His liberal teachings and acting in pursuance of the deliberate , relentless purpose of Shfah Islam since the inception of this movement in Persia in 1844 to interfere with and prevent the freedom of belief and worship throughout the world . It is against this alleged violation of their constitutional <p> The holy places in question consists of dwelling houses in Baghdd occupied by Bahullh and His family when they were driven into exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these houses and at the close of this momentous period of His life , while still in Baghdd , He declared Himself to be the universal Teacher heralded by the Bb . Thus these houses embody associations peculiarly sacred to His followers and , in addition , Bahullh Himself set them apart in His Writings as a place of special significance in Bah'f worship . <p> When Bahullh came to Baghdd this property was owned by one of His followers . Later Bahullh Himself acquired ownership of the houses . So bitter , however , was the feeling against Him among the Shfahs who formed then as now a considerable and influential group in Baghdd and so insecure was the protection offered by the government of Irq at that time , that it was not considered expedient that the property should be openly known as belonging to Him . Accordingly it has always been held in the name of some of His followers . Also no use of the houses that might draw attention to their nature as a holy place was permitted by Bahullh during the Turkish regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imaginary fears on the part of the Bah'fs unhappily is only too clearly proven by the unbroken record of persecution , pillage , torture and death inflicted upon them by the Shfahs since the beginning of the mission of the Bb , who Himself was martyred in Tabrfz in 1850 . History reveals no religious persecution more pitiless , more inhuman in the unspeakable tortures inflicted , more devastating in its confiscation of private property and its ruthless taking of human life than this chapter not yet closed of Shfah determination to destroy the faith of your petitioners and their fellow believers . Mercifully , since the adoption in Persia of a constitution guaranteeing religious freedom and since the accession of the Pahlavi dynasty , conditions there have somewhat improved ; but even as recently as July , 1926 , eight Bah'fs were brutally murdered in Jahrum and since then isolated instances of persecution in different parts of that country have continued to this day . Almost without exception in this long record of pillage and murder none of its perpetrators has been brought to justice , so powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearing similar outbreaks against them in Irq , where two of the most important centers in Shfah Islam are situated , the Bah'fs in Baghdd since the days of Bahullh had gathered together in private and made no public use of these sacred buildings . <p> After the Great War , however , the situation changed . Under the Covenant of the League of Nations Irq was mandated to Great Britain . The treaty between Great Britain and Irq and the Organic Law of Irq followed , and , as pointed out in the opening paragraph of this petition , all three of these solemn instruments guarantee freedom from interference with their religious worship to all peoples of Irq . None welcomed this great step forward in the advancing of civilization of Irq with a more profound gratitude and eager hope than did the followers of Bahullh . At last , after long years of enforced repression , they believed themselves free to express openly their cherished convictions and the deepest longings of their hearts . <p> At once Abdul-Bah , eldest son of Bahullh and leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions that the long neglected and unused property in Baghdd should be put in repair and made suitable for the use in their worship so long prayed for by the Bah'fs . Considerable sums of money were expended for this by Abdul-Bah several thousand pounds . No sooner was this activity openly begun , however , than the still smouldering fire of fanatical hatred of the Bah'fs burst into flame once more among the Shfah leaders and a plot was set in motion by them to seize for themselves these monuments so precious to the Bah'fs and thus deprive the Bah'fs for evermore of their use as a holy place . <p> But under the new political status of Irq , resort to the method of open attack , <p> page 200 <p> followed so long and so successfully where no restraint by the State authorities was to be feared , was not possible . More subtle means were adopted . The courts in Irq were made the instruments of their purpose . <p> Your petitioners will not go into the details of the long litigation which ended in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bah'fs from any further enjoyment of their property through a decision of the Court of Appeals in Irq . These details are set out fully in a memorandum of the case and in the majority and dissenting opinions of the Court of Appeals embraced in Annex No. 2 hereto attached . Your petitioners feel , however , that it is important to note here that the decision of the Court of Appeals was reached by a divided court , in which the British Presiding Justice dissented from the finding of his four native associates ; and also to draw attention to certain salient points in the litigation bearing upon the claim of your petitioners that the suit , though brought , as will appear , in the names of private individuals , was actually instigated by the Shfahs . <p> The proceedings were begun by obtaining an order from the Shfah Qdf of the Sharfah Courts , stating that the last owner of record of the property in question had died in testate and without heirs . Upon this order an exparte application was made to the same Shfah Qdf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , take it over and administer it . Fortunately the agent in charge of the premises for Abdul-Bah and acting under His instructions was able to defeat this attack by an appeal to the Government authorities , who intervened and had the court proceedings quashed on the ground that if the lawful owner of the property had died in testate and without heirs the property would escheat to the State and that the Sharfah Courts , consequently , had no jurisdiction to appoint trustees . Thus this first attempt by the Shfahs ended in failure . Shortly afterward , however , a new attack was made . <p> This time again an order was obtained from the same Shfah Qdf . Curiously , however , this order stated as fact the exact reverse of the previous order granted by the same Qdf . This new order declared that the self-same deceased , referred to in the previous order as having died without heirs , died with heirs , then deceased in turn , but through whom succeeded two heirs , brother and sister , then living . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sworn that there were no heirs of the deceased owner of record was accepted as valid by the Qdf on this second application when these same witnesses completely forswore their former testimony and now testified that this brother and sister were the heirs of the deceased . Upon this new order was based an application to the Baghdd Peace Court for the eviction of the defendants from the property in favor of these newly discovered alleged heirs . This was not a court of competent jurisdiction of the subject matter of the case , which the Shfahs well knew , and the decision again went against them . But they cleverly used the trail as a basis for creating public opinion against the Bah'fs and of raising a political issue through which they forced the Government to take an attitude that it is difficult to consider as other than hostile to the Bah'fs . <p> Pending decision of the Court and while the Bah'fs still occupied the property the Government arbitrarily intervened and ousted them from possession , giving the keys of the houses into the custody of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court sustained the right of the Bah'fs to the property and later they even obtained an order from the Court directing the Governor of Baghdd to deliver the keys them , the Government again intervened and prevented execution of the Courts order . <p> By this intervention of the Government in the Court proceedings the Bah'fs were deprived of their property in the summer of 1922 , never again retaining possession of it , though their legal right to it was unquestionable until the doubtful decision of the Court of Appeals late in 1925 . In the meantime this attitude taken by the Government greatly embarrassed and weakened the Bah'fs and added corresponding assurance and strength to the Shfahs . <p> Finally an action was brought in the civil Court of First Instance of Baghdd . This <p> Page 201 <p> action again was based upon the second order of the Shfah Qdf , as in the case brought before the Peace Court ; the same alleged heirs were named as plaintiffs and it was again sought to have them adjudicated the lawful owners of the property and so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This application was also denied , chiefly on the ground that the Bah'f representative had been in undisputed possession of the property for more than fifteen years required by the law of Irq to establish the right to possession as against any adverse claimant . <p> On appeal from this ruling , however , the Court of Appeals by a majority decision , the British Presiding Judge dissenting , reversed the finding of the lower court and decreed the plaintiffs the lawful owners of the premises , basing its decision largely upon the second order of the Shfah Qdf above referred to , the contradictory order affirming that the plaintiffs were the lawful heirs of the last owner of record of the property . <p> Your petitioners believe that a careful reading of the record of the court proceedings as set forth in the papers of Annex No. 2 will support their own view that , even on the merits of the case , the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals has resulted in a grave miscarriage of justice and that the dissenting opinion of Justice Alexander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and equitable conclusion from the facts before the Court . But your petitioners would again point out that it is not their purpose in this petition to discuss the decision of the Court of Appeals save only to those features of it which , in the opinion of your petitioners , so clearly point to their contention that the entire proceeding was brought in bad faith , with the real purpose of harassing the Bah'f Community , not at all to establish the rights of parties unjustly deprived of their property . <p> Immediately after execution of the judgment of the Court of Appeals the victorious plaintiffs in the action created a Shfah waqf of the premises in favor of a Shfah shrine of pilgrimage , and the buildings have become the gathering place of Shfah pilgrims known as Husayniyyih . <p> There is thus this sequence of events in the record : <p> 1 . The uninterrupted persecution of the Bah'fs by the Shfahs from the days of the Bb , the forerunner of the movement , in 1844 . <p> 2 . The sacred character to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The long private occupation and uncontested control of the property by representatives of the Bah'fs . <p> 4 . The open acknowledgement by the Bah'fs of its ownership and preparations for its use by them as a place of worship as soon as protection in their worship was guaranteed under the Mandate for Irq . <p> 5 . The immediate attempt by the Shfahs to seize the property and to have Shfah trustees appointed to take charge of it upon the basis of an order issued by the Shfah Qdf stating that the last owner of record of the property had died without heirs . <p> 6 . The failure of this attempt through intervention of the State , claiming the right of escheat in the property of a deceased person having no heirs . <p> 7 . The further attempt to seize the property through suits brought in the Baghdd Peace Court and in the civil Court of First Instance , on the basis of an order issued by the same Shfah Qdf stating that the last owner of record of the property had died leaving heirs and naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a short time before . <p> 8 . The failure of the Peace Court action , and the decision of the Court of First Instance in favor of the defendant Bah'fs , mainly on the ground that the alleged heirs plaintiffs had done nothing to assert their alleged rights for a period extending far beyond the statutory time barring such claims against an occupant claiming ownership . <p> 9 . Appeal by the plaintiffs to the Court of Appeal . <p> 10 . Decision by a majority of the Court of Appeals , the British Presiding Jus- <p> page 202 <p> tice , dissenting , reversing the decision of the lower court and awarding the property to the alleged heirs plaintiffs chiefly on the basis of the second , contradictory order of the Shfah Qdf . <p> 11 . No pretense , even , by the successful plaintiffs of enjoying the ownership of their newly acquired property themselves , but their immediate dedication of premises as a Shfah waqf . <p> 12 . The complete success of the Shfah plot to interfere with the worship of the Bah'fs by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Two of these vents are so important and bear so directly upon the claim of your petitioners that it is felt they warrant a closer examination , the two contradictory orders of the Shfah Qdf . Concerning these the British Presiding Justice says in his dissenting opinion : <p> " Indeed , I go further and hold that this court when shown two different orders , one declaring no heirs existed and another that an heir did exist , is entitled to say that it can not say which is the right order , and may therefore reject the claim in default of the plaintiff forthwith proving the matter in the proper religious court . " <p> ( Cf. last paragraph , page 4 , Dissenting OpinionAnnex No. 2 . ) <p> Yet the second of these orders thus characterized by the British Presiding Justice was accepted as competent by the majority Court without further proofs and forms the foundation upon which this litigation rests . But it will be remembered that this second order that this second order was sought only after the first attempt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can it reasonably be doubted that if they had succeeded in having a Shfah trustee appointed to take over and manage this property under the first order of the Shfah Qdf that these alleged heirs created by this second order would have been heard of ? Previous to this second order they had had no existence whatsoever in relation to the property . Neither they nor their ancestors intervening between them and the last owner of record of the premises had ever made the slightest claim to its proprietorship during the many years of its well-known occupation by the representatives of Bahullh and his family , although one of them , at least , lived in its immediate neighborhood . They are brought into being only after the complete failure of the Shfah plan without them . And important to note instantly the plot finally succeeds and the property is wrested from the Bah'fs , the houses become a Shfah waqf . Thus the fruits of the victory gained in the name of these plaintiffs and ostensibly on their behalf are never enjoyed by them but pass at once into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again sink into the oblivion in relation to the property where they had always been until the dilemma of the Shfahs called them forth . Their entire life as the alleged lawful owners of the property is measured exactly by the Shfah need of them in the execution of their purpose . It is submitted that the suspicion with which the British Presiding Justice regarded these two orders of the Shfah Qdf was well founded ; that they are inexplicable excepting as they form another link in the long , unbroken chain of Shfah persecution of the Bah'fs and that , coupled with the other undisputed facts of the record , they fully justify the charge of your petitioners that their constitutional right to freedom of religious worship has been made a mockery , and that the courts of their country , the very bulwarks designed for their protection , have been used against them for their oppression . <p> In addition to the evidence in support of this contention afforded by the legal record of the case itself , the outward accompanying facts that surrounded the litigation from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two informal courts where the first attempts to secure their ends were made , the Shfahs crowded the courtroom and through menacing gestures and speech exerted their utmost efforts to intimidate and influence the court ; and throughout the case powerful pressure was brought to bear by the Shfahs upon its issue through political channels , the press <p> Page 203 two old photos of the House of Bahullh being restored <p> Page 204 <p> and other means of publicity , Finally , direct intimidation of the eminent counsel employed by your petitioners to defend their cause was resorted to and so insistent and so alarming did these threats against his personal safety become that he at length felt obliged in self-defense to withdraw from the case at a moment most critical for the interests of your petitioners . Under these circumstances other counsel was secured with difficulty at the last moment , and in spite of his courage and devotion to the interests of your petitioners the presentation of their cause was severely handicapped . <p> Also , your petitioners feel that the attitude of the Mandatory Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindication of the justice of their claim . Appeal for aid in the intolerable situation created by the decision was at once made to his Excellency , the High Commissioner for Irq , and to his Excellency the secretary of State for the Colonies of his Britannic Majesty . Both of their Excellencies recognized the justice of the appeal and your petitioners are informed have brought strong pressure to bear to induce the Government of Irq to remedy this grievous wrong . Your petitioners also have reason to believe that , through the representations to them of their Excellencies , the Irq Government recognize the justice of your petitioners claim . <p> A letter dated 9th February , 1927 , addressed from the office of his Excellency the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the Mandatory Power to the representative of you petitioners , reads in part " <p> " I very much regret that we are still not in a position to let you know that a satisfactory solution of the Bah'f question has been reached . <p> " The matter is under active consideration by the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a decision . In a letter addressed to the High Commissioner on the 12th of January , Irq Prime Minister expressed the hope that he would be able to effect an early settlement of this question. <p> " Sir H. Dobbs , in reply to an inquiry , has assured me that he has been pressing the new Cabinet ever since his return to Irq . <p> " He adds that he thinks that the Cabinet will really try to do something now , either to expropriate or to induce the Court of Cassation to review its judgment . <p> " May I add that I greatly appreciate the patience which you have shown in the face of hope so often deferred ? " <p> None the less , the efforts of the Mandatory Power for nearly three years to induce the Government of Irq to act have so far been futile and your petitioners are now informed by the Mandatory Power that it considers that its further action in the matter would be fruitless . In a subsequent letter , dated 7th May , 1928 , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies of the Mandatory Power , it is stated : <p> " I have now learnt from Sir H. Dobbs the result of his conversation with King Feisal . It appears that he discussed the case with both the King and the Prime Minister . They expressed their great regret that , in the changed circumstances and the face of constantly developing Shfah agitation , they see no prospect of being in a position to give effect to the arrangement agreed upon . <p> " On receipt of Sir H. Dobbs report I lost no time in submitting the whole case once more to the secretary of State . Mr. Amery directs me to express to you his keen regret that , after a delay which must have been a severe trial to your patience , the negotiations should have reached so unsatisfactory an outcome . He feels , however , that it would be useless for the present at any rate , to bring further pressure to bear upon King Feisal or the Irq Government . " <p> Your petitioners believe that this ineffectiveness of the efforts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandate for Irq . Under the terms of the treaty form of this mandate far greater independence is granted to the Mandated State than in the case of any other of the mandated territories . And <p> Page 205 <p> Your petitioners believe that it is because of its loyalty to the terms of this treaty that the Mandatory Power has felt unable to exercise that greater degree of pressure necessary to induce action in this matter by the Government of Irq . Therefore your petitioners have regretfully felt compelled to appeal to the larger powers of supervision and control of the Mandated Territories that have been entrusted of the League of Nations . <p> Not that it is sought to restrict in any manner the independence enjoyed by Irq under its treaty with Great Britain . On the contrary , your petitioners are loyal citizens of Irq and desire to see their country attain as speedily as possible to that more complete independence entitling it to a place as full member of the League of Nations . But it is felt that this degree of national stability can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be utilized to further so flagrant a breach of the Organic Law of Irq as has resulted in this instance . It is believed that then righting of this wrong and the institution of such measures as will make the recurrence of a like happening in the future impossible will redound , not only to the benefit of your petitioners and their fellow believers throughout the world , but also to the lasting benefit of Irq itself , through the stabilization of its judicature and the consequently increased confidence in this department of its government among those States which still look with doubt upon its administration of justice . <p> Your petitioners are informed that the attitude of the Government of Irq , vis-a-vis the representations of the Mandatory Power in this matter , is due to its unwillingness , for political reasons , to risk an affront to the powerful Shfah element among its constituents . It is submitted that such a consideration of temporary political expediency has little weight when balanced against a consideration of the permanent welfare of the State , as it is in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental law of the State has been directly challenged . For more than three quarters of a century the followers of Bahullh have suffered from the influence of Shfah Islm over courts and governments in states of backward civilization . Your petitioners feel assured that merely to suggest that this influence is to be allowed to insinuate itself into and corrupt the administration of justice in a State whose law and institutions are under the jurisdiction and control of the League of Nations is to refute any such possibility . <p> It has been intimated that open use of the buildings by the Bah'fs for public worship might conduce to conflict with the Shfahs and possible riots and bloodshed and so be detrimental to public safety or order and contrary to the Organic Law . The followers of Bahullh have always been known as peace-loving , industrious and law-abiding citizens wherever they are found , and their religious observances are of the simplest form gatherings where alone prayers are recited , the teachings of Bahullh and all the Prophets of the past read and explained , and refreshment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in themselves , arouse antagonism . It is respectfully submitted that if there is danger of such peaceful practices becoming the object of fanatical attack and resulting disorder , it is the duty of the State to restrain the aggressors and to protect to the full extent of its power those conducting their observances in an entirely lawful manner . Otherwise , it is submitted , the very foundations of the State are in danger . <p> " We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations ; yet they deem us a stirrer up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and punishment that all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers ; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened ; that diversity of religion should cease , and differences of race be annulledwhat <p> page 206 <p> harm is there in this ? Yet so shall it be ; these fruitless strifes , these ruinous wars , shall pass away , the Most great Peace shall come . Is not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings and rulers lavishing their treasurers more freely on means for the destruction of the human race that on that which would conduce to the happiness of mankind . These strifes and this bloodshed must cease , and all men be as one kindred and one family Let not a man glory in this , that he loves his country ; let him glory in this , that he loves his kind . " <p> ( Cf. Annex No. 3 for further Bah'f teachings ) <p> <p> Your petitioners feel that they can not close their appeal without again expressing their profound regret that it has become necessary to present their Government in an unfavorable light before the League of nations , and rather than do so have suffered under this injustice for three years in the hope that it might be righted and such a measure so become unnecessary . They deplore having been obliged to lay open the sad history of Shfah persecution of the Bah'fs . They bear no i 'll will toward the Shfahs but , on the contrary , desire to live beside them in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive in certain Shfah beliefs , though they can not but maintain that such beliefs are an anachronism in a civilized community and in this instance have led to acts expressly forbidden by the law of Irq . Alone the sacredness of its subject matter to your petitioners has compelled them most reluctantly to present this petition . They ask no favor . They seek only that the laws of their country be justly administered and that they be accorded the protection in their religious worship which those laws guarantee . They no leave their plea in your hands , confident that your high sense of justice and of the responsibility of the League of nations for the " well-being and development " of the peoples of the mandated territories , " a sacred trust of civilization , " will lead you in your wisdom to recommend to the Council of the League a suitable remedy for this grave injustice and also the safeguards necessary to prevent for the future any similar offense against the laws of Irq . <p> Respectfully submitted at Baghdd this eleventh day of September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irq . <p> The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah'fs of Irq . <p> <p> The Bahf World , Volume III , 1928-1930 <p> Extract from <h> Survey of Current Bahf Activities 1928-1930 <p> by Horace Holley <p> Page 50 <p> The League of Nations and the Houses of Bahullh at Baghdd <p> During March , 1929 , the Council of the League of Nations adopted a resolution directing the Mandatory Power ( Great Britain ) " To make representations to the government of Irq with a view to the immediate redress of the injustice suffered by the Petitioners ( the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahfs of Irq ) . " <p> By this action the status of the Houses occupied by Bahullh during His residence in Baghdd from 1852 to 1863 , regarded by all Bahfs as a Holy Shrine , was accepted as an issue by the greatest international body yet come into existence . Through the intensity of devotion and reverence felt by believers throughout the world , inspired by Bahullhs prophetic statements concerning this Shrine , the matter had undergone successive transformation from an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest court of Irq , and finally after acceptance and approval by the Mandates Committee of the petition submitted by the National Spiritual Assembly of Irq , a case taken up by the Council of the League . <p> Page 51 <p> In our previous report of current Bahf activities , reviewing events that took place between 1926 and 1928 , the matter of the shrine at Baghdd was presented up to a point immediately preceding the adverse judgment passed by the supreme tribunal of that land . The events transpiring since 1928 may be most fairly described by quoting from official documents bearing upon the case . <p> The Bahf attitude toward these Houses appears in the following passage taken from the Petition : <p> " Your petitioners and their fellow believers in all parts of the world are followers of the spiritual teachings of Bahullh ( 1817-1892 ) , Whom they look to and revere as the One Whom Siyyid Alf Muhammad , the Bb ( 1819-1850 ) had heralded as " He Whom God would make manifest " ; a universal spiritual Teacher soon to appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precepts would remove the differences separating the religions of the world today and usher in the era promised by them all of the ultimate spiritual unification of mankind . " <p> " In Bahullh your petitioners recognize this universal Teacher . They believe Him to be the supreme Manifestation of God thus far revealed to the world : that in Him converges and finds expression the aspiration and belief of the devout Hindu , Confucianist , Zoroastrian , Buddhist , Jew , Christian and Muhammad ; the aspiration and belief that , in His good time , God would send to the world His Messenger , divinely inspired to reveal to all peoples His truth , to the end that , guided by this new understanding , they might unite in universal fellowship and establish His Kingdom in this world . " <p> " From this brief outline of the supreme spiritual station which Bahullh occupies in the faith of your petitioners will be understood the sacred reverence felt by His followers for places associated with His ministry , places to them holy , and of sacredness , dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of places of like significance in the religious life of the followers of the other great spiritual Leaders of mankind . " <p> " One of the most sacred of these holy places , situated in Baghdd , your petitioners aver has been unlawfully wrested from their possession and they have been deprived of the spiritual solace and inspiration of its use in their worship . This it is alleged has been brought about through the machinations of the leaders of the Shfah sect of Islam , fearful of the spreading influence of Bahullh in His liberal teachings and acting in pursuance of the deliberate , relentless purpose of Shfah Islam since the inception of this movement in Persia in 1844 to interfere with and prevent the freedom of belief and worship throughout the world . It is against this alleged violation of their constitutional and treaty guarantees that your petitioners seek your aid and protection . " <p> The Report of the Permanent Mandates Commission to the Council of the League , published in the Minutes of the Fourteenth Session of that body , is next presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts which have led them to appeal to the League of Nations . These facts can be summarized as follows : <p> " The founder of the sect , Bahullh , in whom the Bahfs recognize the inspired messenger of God , settled at Baghdd in 1852 after being exiled from Persia . He established himself and his family in certain dwelling-houses belonging to one of his disciples . This property which is the subject of the present litigation was subsequently acquired by Bahullh and on his death passed into the possession of his son Abdul-Bah . Bahullh resided eleven years in these houses , upon which his long residence conferred in the eyes of his disciples a sacred character . <p> " In view of the lack of security which prevailed under the former system of government and the constant hostility of the Shiahs , Bahullh decided never to reveal his ownership of the dwelling-houses in question , which to all appearance remained the property of one of his disciples , and for the same reasons the sect abstained from using these dwellings for the exercise of their religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention to the sacred character which they attached to this property . <p> " Matters remained in this condition until , with the establishment of the British mandate , the liberty of conscience and religion proclaimed in the Covenant of the League of Nations was confirmed in Irq by the Treaty of 1922 with Great Britain and later by the Organic Law of Irq . Taking advantage of a security they had never known before , the Bah'fs , under the direction of Abdul-Bah , * henceforth the leader of the movement , set about putting in to repair the dwellings sanctified by the residence of Bahullh with a view to the open exercise of their religion . ( *In 1922 the leader of the Bahf movement was Shoghi Effendi.Editor ) <p> " Then began the tribulations which they ascribe to the fanaticism of the Shiahs . The era of persecution and violence had passed , but the Shiahs resorted to intrigue in order to relegate into the background a sect whose development they feared . <p> " At first attempt on the part of the Qahdi of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question was frustrated by the intervention of the Irq authorities . A fresh application was subsequently made by the same Qadhi to the Peace court at Baghdad for the eviction of the occupants . <p> " The decision of the Court was still pending when the Government intervened afresh , moved by the state of public opinion caused by the Shiahs : the government ordered the Bah'fs to be evicted and the keys of the houses in dispute to be given into the custody of the Governor of Baghdad . After a judgment dismissing the application , the Peace Court made fruitless efforts to reinstate the defendants in possession of the property . Its decision remained a dead-letter , as the government maintained its refusal . <p> " The case passed from Court to Court and was finally brought before the Court of Appeal at Baghdad , which , by a majority of four ( the native members ) to one ( the British Presiding Justice ) , decided in favor of the plaintiffs ( the Shiahs ) . <p> " According to the petitioners , the property which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waqf property , the effect of which was to render redress from the injustice of which they complain even more difficult . The accuracy of this fact was disputed by the accredited representative of the mandatory Power during his last hearing before the Commission . <p> " Finally , the petition contains extracts from correspondence exchanged between the British Secretary of State and the representative of the petitioners , from which it will be gathered that the mandatory government has taken active steps through its High Commissioner in Irq with a view to inducing the Government of Irq to adopt a compromise which would give satisfaction to the complainants . This intervention remained without success . <p> " The Bahf community maintains that , on account of a series of intrigues inspired by religious fanaticism in which the administrative authorities of Irq were associated , it has been seriously disturbed in the exercise of its religion and deprived of property belonging to its religious head , to which the community attaches a sacred character , to the advantage of a rival sect . <p> " In support of its claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conscience and religion contained in the Treaty of 1922 between Irq and Great Britain ( Article III ) and in the Organic Law of Irq ( Article XIII ) , as also to Article 22 ( 1 ) of the League Covenant , which states that the well-being and development of the peoples ( of the mandated territories ) formed a sacred trust of civilization . <p> " The Commissioner draws the Councils attention to the considerations and conclusions suggested to it by an examination of the petition of the Bahf Spiritual Assembly of Baghdad and of the documents accompanying it . <p> " It recommends that the Council should ask the British government to make representations to the Irq government with a view to the immediate redress of the denial of justice from which the petitioners have suffered . <p> " Moreover , the Commission proposes to the Council that the petitioners be answered in the following terms : <p> page 53 <p> " The Permanent Mandates Commission , recognizing the justice of the complaint made by the Bahf Spiritual Assembly of Baghdad , has recommended to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redress the wrong suffered by the petitioners. " <p> The decision of the Council of the League of Nations , based upon the report of its Mandate Commission , has already been quoted . At this writing , the government of Irq has not yet conformed to the decision of the Council , a fact which is unsatisfactory to the followers of Bahullh , and unacceptable to them , even though they fully appreciate the difficulties created by the hostile and implacable Shiah element , representing a majority partying Baghdad . As the matter now stands ( July , 1930 ) , Great Britain as Mandatory Power is obligated to carry out the League decision , in which of course the British representative of the Council concurred , all Council action being by unanimous vote . Great Britain has also signed a new treaty with Irq in which the year 1932 is fixed as the date when Great Britain will recommend and endorse the acceptance of Irq by the League of Nations as a member state . It would appear inconsistent for the League to accept Irq as member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out the Council decision . The Bahfs are not concerned with political matters ; they desire only the precious privilege of exercising full control over property which in time will become a center of pilgrimage for the believers in all parts of the world . The good offices rendered by many representatives both of Great Britain and Irq are known to and deeply appreciated by the followers of Bahullh . <p> Additional facts are brought out in the following excerpts taken from Comments of His Majestys Government on the Petition from the Bah'f Spiritual Assembly , Baghdad , to the Permanent Mandates Commission : <p> " 5 . Under the Ottoman Empire the Bahfs had done as little as possible to advertise their presence , and their ownership of this property . A change of rTgime , however , gave them confidence , and the heirs of Bahullh , through their agents , the occupants , spent considerable sums on improving the property . This drew attention to the existence of property revered by Bahfs in the middle of the Shiah quarter , and incensed the Shiahs , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as enemies of their religion . The first step in the campaign was an application by certain Shiahs to the Shiah Qadhi , in Janaury , 1921 , to appoint agents to look after the property of Muhammad Hussain Babi , who had , they asserted ( as indeed appears to be the case ) died without heirs . This order was granted early in February , 1921 , and the Bahf occupants were evicted by the execution department . On representation by certain Bahfs the Minister of Justice instructed the appellate court to look into the case , with the result that on the 3rd of April , 1921 , the order of the Qadhi was quashed , on the ground that if Muhammad Hussain Babi had died without heirs , the property would have escheated to the State , and the Qadhis order putting in guardians at the request of persons was quite illegal . The Bahf occupants were consequently restored to possession . <p> " Note . The decision of the Qadhi was obviously wrong , and that of the appellate court right . The Bahf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have applied to be joined as parties . <p> " 6 . Having failed in this effort , the Shiahs determined to try again , and Muhammad Jawad and Bibi , the Shiah claimants , applied to the same Shiah Qadhi for a declaration that one Laila was the heir of Muhammad Hussain , and they were her heirs . A number of the witnesses were the same persons who had previously deposed to the fact that Muhammad Hussain had died without heirs . The declaration was granted on November 23 , 1921 . <p> " Note . Everything said in the petition about this stage of the proceedings is fully justified . The decision of the Qadhi was unjust as undoubtedly actuated by religious prejudice . <p> " 7 . Armed with this declaration the Shiah claimants applied to the Peace Court early in 1922 for the ejectment of the Bahf occupants . This case was never heard on its <p> page 54 <p> merits , as on February 22 , 1922 , His Majesty King Feisal issued an order to the Governor of Baghdad to turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent a breach of the peace . The Bahfs no longer being in possession , the suit to eject them was dismissed on June 17 , 1922 . <p> " Note . His Majestys action was illegal . But he feard a riot if the case went against the Shiahs , who , in general , were , at this time , seething with discontent and disloyalty . He therefore deemed his action , though illegal , necessary in the interests of public security . It is impossible to say at this stage whether he exaggerated the danger or not . Danger undoubtedly existed , but it can not be denied that His Majestys actions made things more difficult for the Bahfs . <p> " 8 . The property now being in the hands of the Governor , it became necessary for the parties to take some further step , and the first step was taken by the Shiah claimants , who , on October 2nd , 1922 , filed a suit in the court of First Instance , for ownership , against the Bahf ex-occupants . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this suit did not come on for hearing until February 1st , 1924 . In the meantime , on the 19th of July , 1923 , the Bahfs filed a suit for possession against the Governor in the Peace Court , which gave a decision in their favor on December 20th , 1923 . The Council of Ministers , however , with the approval of His Majesty , stepped in and instructed the Governor not to give up the keys until the question of ownership , as distinct from mere possession , was settled . <p> " Note . Here again the executives were actuated by a desire to avoid a breach of the peace , but their action , to which the High Commissioner took strong exception at the time by means of a written protest to His Majesty the King was highly irregular , and it is doubtful whether the irregular , and it is doubtful whether the emergency was grave enough to warrant it . <p> " 9 . The Shiah case in the Court of First Instance then came up for hearing , and on June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather ex-occupants , was given in default . They entered an opposition in the same court on July 17th , which was admitted . On October 9th , 1924 , the heirs of Bahullh applied to be joined as parties , claiming ownership on the strength of an admission by the Bahf occupants that they were not the owners , but merely agents of the heirs . This application was admitted , and on April 5th , 1925 , the Court gave judgment dismissing the case against the Bahfs , but making no mention of the claims of the heirs . Even , therefore , had this judgment stood , the ownership of the heirs would not have been established . The judgment was , however , upset on appeal , by a majority of four ( one Jew , one Christian , and two Sunnis ) to one ( the British president ) . Copies of the majority and the dissenting Judgment are enclosed with the petition , and it is necessary to discuss them in detail here , but two points in the majority judgment , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need special notice . One is the contention that possession by an agent for the full period necessary to establish that right on behalf of the principal . The second is that the Bahf occupants , not having established , or indeed claimed , their ownership , had no right to challenge the ( false ) certificate of heirship issued by the Shiah Qadhi in November , 1921 , vide paragraph 6 above , but that , if there were no real heirs , this could only be challenged by the state , and that , in the absence of any party with a right to challenge this certificate , it was not the duty of the court to enquire into the merits thereof . <p> " Note . These two contentions may be challenged in the dissentient judgment of the President of the Court , but they can not , not can the judgment based upon them , be described as unsustainable or contrary to law . A strong suspicion must , however , remain that the majority judgment was not uninfluenced by political consideration . <p> " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts have been made to induce the Irq government to rectify the injustice the British government is compelled to recognize , in that property which has been for years in the possession of the Bahf , without its ownership <p> Page 55 <p> Being legally established , has passed into the ownership of persons who have no conceivable claim to it whatever . Neither His Majesty the King of Irq not the Irq government have seriously attempted to deny this ; they have in fact agreed in principle to try and rectify the injustice . But on every occasion on which they have definitely been asked to take action they have found it impossible to do so , through fear of Shiah opposition . And it can not be denied that in the present state of Shiah feeling against a predominantly Sunni Government their attitude is intelligible . Interference at an earlier stage to prevent injustice would have been far less difficult than would be interference at the present stage to remedy it . Unfortunately such interference as there was , though its sole object was to avoid disturbance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken place . While , however , it is realized , that there has been an injustice , it must not be taken for granted that , had the cases been heard throughout by impartial tribunals , and with no interference from the executive , the heirs of Bahullh would have attained the property . It might have been held that the only persons who could claim ownership were the Bahf occupants , who did not claim it , and that , no one else being able to establish a claim , the property had escheated to the State . If such had been the decision , the State could at all events have kept the building from falling into the hands of the fanatical opponents of the Bahfs and might have turned it into a useful public institution of some kind , which , it is understood , would have satisfied Bahf sentiment . As matters stand , the Shiah Waqf or Pious Foundation , which at once makes an attempt by the executive to expropriate it very difficult and also greatly aggravates the situtation in Bahf eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole affair has from the beginning been mishandled by the Irq authorities and has now drifted into a position in which it is almost impossible to discover an immediate remedy . " <p> Letters written by Shoghi Effendi to Western Bahfs on January 1 and March 20 , 1929 , bearing on this case , are quoted elsewhere in this volume . <p> <p> The Bahf World , Volume IV , 1930-1932 <p> Extract from <p> Survey of Current Bahf Activities in the East and West <p> By Horace Holley <p> Page 75 <h> IR-Q <p> In April , 1931 , a National Spiritual Assembly after the model of the American Assembly was duly elected by delegates representing the Bahf communities of Baghdd , Avshiq-Mosul , Basrih , Huvaydar , Yaqubiyyih and Adhyabil . Following its election , the National Spiritual Assembly has prepared a draft of a constitution and by-laws based upon the American Declaration of Trust conforming published elsewhere in the present volume civil government as a legal corporation . This accomplished , each local Spiritual Assembly will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its local jurisdiction under a Declaration of Trust conforming to the instrument adopted by the Bahf community of the City of New York . <p> The Bahfs of Irq are profoundly conscious of their high mission as trustees of a Faith so intimately associated with their native land . It was to Baghdd that Bahullh was sent on the first stage of that long exile which , in conformity with ancient prophecy , culminated at Akk , Palestine . It was near Baghdd that Bahullh made the declaration of His Mission , transforming the Bbi Cause to the Bahf Faith . In Baghdd are situated those dwelling occupied by Bahullh during his residence in that city , and by Him constituted a Bahf <p> Page 76 photo of Bahf burial ground in Akk <p> Page 77 <p> Shrine , a center of pilgrimage throughout future times . <p> The significant history of those houses their seizure by Shiah Muhammadan enemies of the Cause about ten years ago , initiating a series of efforts by Bahfs to regain possession which led to a petition being made to the Mandates Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of The Bahf World , and is continued in a later part of the present article . <p> Meanwhile , from a report prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly of Irq , it is of interest to note that the local press duly published the decision of the Council of the League affirming the recommendation made by the Mandates Commission that the mandatory power , Great Britain , should see to it that the Irq government restore the houses of Bahullh to their rightful Bahf owners . The publication of this record made a tremendous impression upon the people of Baghdd , depressing the Shfahs and exalting the reputation of the Bahf Faith . The efforts of even a great number of Bahf teachers in promoting the Cause could not have accomplished so much result . <p> " For the first time , " the Assembly points out , " a public meeting has been held in Baghdd for non- Bahfs . The Y.M.C.A. , a British organization , invited Dr. Aflatum , Vice-chairman of the National assembly , to address its members and guests on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in February , 1932 , before members of the local British community as well as liberal minded Irqis . <p> " Last year the local daily Arabic papers began translating the full discussions of the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of nations , concerning the conditions of Irq , which included the case of Bahullhs House in Baghdd . This particular part of the discussions created a general impression as to the possibility of expropriation , and caused a widespread anxiety , nay , even rage ; and in particular among the Shfite Ulemas who did all in their power to stir and excite the common people against the Leagues decision . For nearly three months scarcely a day passed without one or more of the daily papers remarking on the Bahf House. Thus everyone in this country came to realize at last that there is <p> Page 78 <p> in the world a movement called the Bahf Faith which has its faithful adherents all over the world . " <p> <p> Page 97 <p> THE HOUSES OF BAHAULLAH AT BAGHDAD <p> The unusual chain of circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His exile in Baghdd , to the Council of the League of Nations , was described in this survey two years ago . The last link in the chain at that time was the decision of the League Council approving the recommendation of the Mandates Commission and instructing the secretary General to bring to the notice of the mandatory power , Great Britain , as well as to the petitioners ( the Bahf community of Baghdd ) the views and conclusions of the Mandates Commission . <p> This placed upon Great Britain a certain degree of responsibility in taking steps toward having the Irq government , whose membership as member in the League of nations was already imminent , restore to the Bahfs the houses unjustly seized by Shfih Muhammadan leaders of Irq and by them constituted an Islmic holy place which action had the intention of making it impossible for the civil government to restore the property without arousing intense fanaticism . On learning of the Leagues decision , Bahfs of East and West awaited the next step in this important case with profound interest . <p> It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Already applied for membership in the League , and that acceptance of Irq as member state would terminate the mandate held by Great Britain . The situation , then , has been that refusal of Irq to heed the advice of the mandatory power would mean that the League of Nations in September , 1932 , will be passing formally upon the acceptance of a new member state which has , to say the least , neglected to carry out a definite resolution voted by the Council . It would mean , further , that the mandatory power , which has spared no effort to see that justice is done to the Bahfs of Baghdd ( as related in previous volumes of this work ) , will be obliged to approve the application of Irq as member state before Irq has enabled Great Britain to discharge her responsibility as mandatory power in carrying out the decision recommended by the Permanent Mandates Commission . <p> Carrying the matter forward to April , 1932 , the following statement summarizes events since the last Bahf World was published . <p> The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of the case . The latter body proposed that the Bahfs of Baghdd accept financial payment in lieu of the restoration of property all Bahfs regard as a Sacred Shrine , an offer which the Bahfs refused . At the Sixteenth Session of the Permanent Mandates Commission , the Commission acted to urge Great Britain to remedy the injustice suffered by the Bahfs . The matter was then unfortunately delayed by the sudden death of the British High Commissioner , who knew the details of the case intimately , and of Sir Abdul-Muhsin . Following the drawing up of the new formal Treaty between Great Britain and Irq , the government of Irq appointed a strong committee to take up the question afresh . This committee reported the recommendation that the government expropriate the Bahf property together with a large area surrounding it and devote it to public use . This recommendation , politically advantageous because it denied the claim of the Bahfs at the same time that it removed the houses from Shfah control , was approved by the Government of Irq . <p> Meanwhile , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of International Justice , but this proved impracticable ; doubtless because it involved asking that Court to pass upon the power of the League Council to act . <p> On January 12 , 1931 , the British Government , in a letter signed by C. W. Baxter on behalf of Mr. Arthur Henderson , Minister of Foreign affairs , communicated to the League Secretariat the report of the special committee , mentioned above , appointed by the Government of Irq and transmitting also the measures taken by the Irq Government in execution of the committees recommendations . Two months previously the Permanent Mandates Commission , meeting at Geneva , had recorded in its minutes that " The Permanent Mandates Commission would not lose interest in the fate of this small community so long as it had not been granted the reparation which was its due . The way in which the government dealt with this question would be the criterion of the spirit of the government and the people . " <p> The letter dated January 12 , 1931 , is reproduced elsewhere in the present volume . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears that the Shfahs of Irq , who religiously are affiliated with Persian Muhammadans more closely than with Sunnfs of Turkey , have appealed to the Persian Government and this body in turn seems to have attempted to bring indirect pressure upon the League at Geneva . <p> As was made clear in previous references to this case , Bahfs see it a working of Providence to compel the world to realize the power of Bahullh . In His own time , the houses will be made an international Bahf Shrine . <p> <p> Page 237 <h> FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN <p> THE CASE OF BAHAULLAHS <p> HOUSE IN BAGHDAD <p> EXTRACTS FROM THE MINUTES OF THE <p> PERMANENT MANDATES COMMISSION <p> OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS <p> 1 . <p> EXTRACTS FROM THE MINUTES OF THE <p> SIXTEENTH SESSION <p> Held in Geneva from November 6th to 26th , 1929 <p> M. PALACIOS said that one matter which might throw light on the question of the degree of maturity of the Irq people and on that of the relations between the British Government and the Government of Irq was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been before the Commission . <p> In its report on the work of its fourteenth session the Commission had recommended that the council should invite the British Government to request the Government of Irq to redress the injustice of which the Bahfs had been the victims . This recommendation had been made by the Commission as a result of its examination of a petition from the Bahf Spiritual Assembly and of the observations of the British Government on the petition . M. Orts had been the Rapporteur . <p> The annual report of the mandatory Power did not refer to the matter , and it would be interesting to obtain from the accredited representative as exact information as possible regarding the measures taken by the British Government and by the Irq authorities as a result of the Council decision . <p> Mr. BOURDILLON said that the British authorities had informed the Government of Irq of the request of the Council , and had strongly pressed it to find a solution . The Government had suggested a compensation on a monetary basis . The British authorities , although not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon to submit to the Bahfs any proposal that the Irq Government had made . As it had been expected , this proposal had not been accepted . The Bahfs themselves had contemplated presenting a further petition , but , after discussing the question with the High Commissioner and the British advisers , they had agreed that it would not be in their best interests to do so . <p> Settlement of the question had been further delayed by the death of Sir Gilbert Clayton , and it would take some time for the new High Commissioner to make himself acquainted with all the details . In the meanwhile , however , the Acting High Commissioner and the Bahfs representative were following up the matter actively . <p> Mr. Bourdillon added that in the course of the last few days he had further discussed the question at Geneva with the Bahfs representative , and that , during this discussion , a solution had been suggested which he hoped would be ventilated shortly . <p> M. PALACIOS did not think this reply wholly satisfactory . He recognized that for <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisable to employ this roundabout method . On the other hand , both the Mandatory Power and the Mandates Commission had admitted that injustice had been done . It was desirable therefore that this injustice should be removed without delay ; such action would serve as an example . <p> The CHAIRMAN recalled that the Council had endorsed the Commissioners opinion and that , as a result , the Mandatory Power had to follow it . The present state of affairs was , therefore , all the more serious . <p> M. RAPPARD said that he might employ the Bahf case as an argument for the contention which has already been advanced . There could be no clearer example of the necessity for action by the Mandatory Power in order to prevent injustice . <p> M. BOURDILLON said that it was his firm conviction that a similar injustice would not be committed at the present time . Every effort was being made to remedy this particular injustice , but he would recall that it was very difficult to provide an immediate remedy for such cases . <p> The CHAIRMAN asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Council . What means existed for the administration of justice when the League of Nations demanded it ? A solution of this question would be very difficult to find . Mr. Bourdillon should examine the question not , of course , from the historic point of view , but in order to settle it . <p> 2 . <p> EXTRACTS FROM THE MINUTES OF THE <p> NINETEENTH SESSION <p> Held in Geneva from November 46th to 19th , 1930 <p> It will be noticed that there is no mention of what is called the Bahf case in the report under review . This is because the year 1929 closed while the matter was still under consideration , and no definite decision had been taken . The position when I arrived in Baghdd as acting High Commissioner at the end of September last year was that the late Sir Gilbert Clayton had been taken the matter up strongly with the Irq Government , and that the then Prime Minister , Sir Abdul-Muhsin Sadn , had undertaken to investigate the whole question with a view to deciding what steps could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tragic death of Sir Gilbert Clayton and Sir Abdul-Muhsin naturally resulted in a certain amount of delay ; but the first action of the present Irq Government , after the conclusion of the Treaty negotiations , was to appoint a strong Committee to go into the whole question . The terms of reference of the Committee were as follows : <p> " To consider the question of the claim of the Bahf community to certain houses in Baghdd , and , without going into the past history of the case , to indicate as soon as possible , what line of action the Government should adopt for disposing of this long-outstanding question . " <p> The Chairman of the Committee was the British President of the Court of Appeal , and the three Irqi members were the Director-General of the Interior , the Amfnul-Asimih , or Lord Mayor of Baghdd , and the Director of Judicial Administration . Their report was considered by the Irq Government as soon as possible after the return of the Prime Minister from London in September , and I am authorized to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the recommendation of the Committee . <p> The decision of the Irq Government is that the property in question , together with a considerable area surrounding it , should <p> Page 239 <p> Be expropriated by the Government for a public purpose for example , for a school , dispensary , or public gardens . " <p> Statement by the Accredited Representative , <p> Major Young . <p> In connection with the question of minorities , Mr. Orts asked whether the solution contemplated in the Bahf case was such as would satisfy that community . How could the transformation of its properties into a school , dispensary or public gardens constitute that reparation which , according to the recommendation of the Council of the League of nations , ought to be granted to the Bahf community for the injustice of which it was the victim ? <p> M. Orts wished to make it quite clear that the Permanent Mandates Commission would not lose interest in the fate of this small community so long as it had not been granted the reparation which was its due . The way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criterion of the spirit of the Government and the people . <p> The Commission notes a statement by the accredited representative that the Irqi Government has appointed a Commission to propose some method of providing redress for the wrong done to the Bahf sect by the denial of justice to that sect . It regrets that such redress has not yet been given , in spite of the Councils endorsement on March 4th , 1929 , of the Commissions conclusions . <p> Letter from the Accredited Representative , dated December 5th , 1930 . <p> I have had the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 6A/ 22103 /655 of November 20th , enclosing an advance copy of the observations of the Permanent Mandates Commission drawn up as a result of the Examination , at its recent session , of the administration of Irq . <p> 2 . The only comment I have to offer is that , in special observation No. 3 , on the subject of the Bahf case , the impression might be perhaps given that the strong Commission appointed by the Irqi Government to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts are , as I had the honour to explain to the Permanent Mandates Commission , that the report has been presented and accepted by the Irqi Government . <p> ( signed ) Hubert Young <p> 3 . <p> EXTRACTS FROM THE MINUTES OF THE <p> TWENTIETH SESSION <p> Held at Geneva From June 9th to June 27th , 1931 <p> M. RAPPARD observed that this point was important in view of the Commissions present task . It had to consider what hope there was of getting loyal cooperation as regards guarantees for minorities . <p> He noted one passage in the last part of the statement : " The Irqi State . " He read , " has shown itself jealous of the sanctity of international engagements . " He thought that the Bahf question and the question of the Kurds were not very significant of such an attitude . <p> Sir Francis HUMPRYS observed that the international engagements to which he had referred were chiefly with Great Britain , Turkey , the Nejd and Persia that was to say , with Irqs neighbours , with whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also the list of international Conventions given on page 37 of the report . He must join issue with M. Rappard on the suggestion that the Bahf case could be classed in the category of international engagements . <p> He agreed that the decision in this case had been unfortunate ; the question now was how to deal with a res judicata in a manner that was strictly legal . The idea of taking it before the Permanent Court of Interna- <p> Page 240 <p> Photos of Bahfs of Pretoria , South Africa and the Hazfratul-Quds of the Bahfs of Avashiq , Irq <p> Page 241 <p> tional Justice had been abandoned , but he hoped to be able to show the Commission that the matter was being dealt with satisfactorily . <p> M. ORTS recalled the severe criticisms made by both the Mandates Commission and the British Government itself of the supreme judicial authority of Irq and the highest authorities in the country for their partiality and weakness in connection with the Bahf affair in Baghdd . This affair was an example , which has not yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed at a time when the British authorities were still in a position to make their influence felt . <p> It was said that a Special Committee which had been instructed to examine the case in question had come to a decision which appeared to have been satisfactory to both parties . The decision was to expropriate the land on which were situated the buildings of which the Bahfs had been unjustly deprived , and to convert the buildings into public dispensaries . <p> It must be recognized that , if the Bahfs were satisfied with the decision reached , they were not difficult to satisfy . The expropriation had led to indemnities and the latter would be paid , not to the victims of the miscarriage of justice , but to those who benefited from judicial decisions which were notoriously biased . <p> At the last session the accredited representative had stated that similar occurrences could not now arise . It seemed , however , that the desire to conform with the recommendations of the Council , which should at the moment influence the actions of the Irq Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendencies of one section of public opinion . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS replied that the house in question had never been formally registered in the name of the Bahfs . In the case before the Court there had been some false swearing on both sides . The Court consisted of a British President with two other members , one of whom was a Jew and the other a Sunnf Muslim . The British President had thought the decision constituted a miscarriage of justice , and the British Government agreed with that view . The case had created much feeling , not on in Baghdd and elsewhere in Irq , but also among the Shfahs of Persia . The highest court in the country had pronounced in favour of the Shfahs by two votes to one . Sir Francis Humphrys asked the Mandates Commission how this decision could be legally reversed , as there was no higher court in the country . If the Government had ordered the Shfahs to evacuate the property and had returned it to the Bahfs , this would have been an illegal act . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving at a settlement . In the first place , enquiries had been made as to whether this case could be brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice . On this solution proving impracticable , it had subsequently been decided to appoint a Special Committee , with a British judge as Chairman , to suggest a practical solution which would be in accordance with the law . This committee suggested expropriating for purposes of public benefit , not only this house , but others in the district in connection with a town-planning scheme . It was not the intention that the structure of the house should be interfered with , but only that the necessary internal alterations should be made in order to convert the house into a dispensary . This had satisfied the Bahf as they were willing that the house should be put to some useful purpose . <p> Sir Francis again pointed out that , as there was no higher court in the country , any other solution of the question would have been illegal . <p> M. ORTS fully realised the legal difficulties . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was indicative . He would like to know , however , whether the Bahfs who had not obtained material satisfaction had at least obtained moral satisfaction . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS replied that he thought the decision must have given the Bahfs some moral satisfaction , since they would have access to the house when it was <p> Page 242 <p> situated in a public garden . Moreover , they were satisfied with the use of the house as a dispensary , as it would be used for the alleviation of misery to which the Bahf religion attached great importance . <p> M. ORTS asked whether it could not be decided that no change should be made in the arrangements of the buildings which were of sentimental value to the Bahfs . Such an assurance would , no doubt , give them moral satisfaction . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS repeated that the intention was that the building should remain , only internal changes being made for the purpose of its conversion into a dispensary . <p> M. RAPPARD supposed , with regard to the question of moral satisfaction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied before the solution prepared by the Government was finally adopted . But it was too soon for them to feel this satisfaction , as the funds had not yet been voted by Parliament . <p> The Bahf case was , however , not only a regrettable incident . Had it not a more general significance ? An injustice had been committed which would doubtless have been avoided if the Mandatory Power had maintained greater control . If the Mandatory Power had previously withdrawn from Irq , as it now proposed to do , the injustice would not even come to the notice of the League . The Commission was now asked to approve the withdrawal of the Mandatory Power . Was this not a very serious responsibility ? <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS did not understand how the Mandatory Power could have intervened in a judicial matter , or why there should be less likelihood of such cases being brought to notice in future . <p> M. RAPPARD replied there would be no possibility of appeal to the League . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS supposed that a case might occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute might be awarded to the wrong person . <p> This was the only case in eleven years in which the justice of a decision by the Irqf Courts had been questioned by His Majestys Government . <p> M. VAN REES asked whether there was a sentiment of hostility towards the Bahfs in Irq which might lead them to feel that they were in constant danger . He asked whether the judgement of the High Court reflected this sentiment of hostility or was merely a miscarriage of justice . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS replied that he knew of no cases where Bahfs were apprehensive for their safety . In the present case he thought the action was taken merely to obtain possession of the property and was not particularly directed against the Bahfs . <p> M. VAN REES explained that he had asked this question , as he had heard that the Bahfs felt themselves to be menaced . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS replied that he had no knowledge of it . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS explained that he had understood Mt . Ruppels question to be influenced by anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted from a document which was primarily concerned with that question . The intention was that the Irqfs should benefit equally with the foreigners from the strengthening of the judiciary . <p> The CHAIRMAN asked whether the British judge would not always be in a minority , since there were judges in each Court . This had happened in the Bahf case . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS said that this had been the position throughout the period under review , and pointed out that the Bahf case was the only case of a serious miscarriage of justice which had come to light during these eleven years . It was to be hoped that such a case would not occur again . <p> Page 243 <p> He ( M. MERLIN ) was very sorry he could not share that conviction of the accredited representative . He had reprehensions on the subject , which had been strengthened by the Bahf case and other cases connected with Kurds . He noted from page 78 of the report that certain changes in the judicial system were proposed . Again , on page 83 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was glad to see that British judges would remain for ten years , as he considered they supplied the surest guarantee of justice . He , like M. Ruppel , considered that , far from being restricted , as was proposed in the 1930 treaty , the number should be increased . <p> 4 . <p> LETTER FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT <p> Dated January 12th , 1931 , Transmitting the Report of the Social Committee Appointed by the Government of Irq to Examine the Claim of the Bahf Spiritual Assembly , Baghdd , and Communicating the Measures Taken by the Government of Bahf in Execution of the Recommendations Contained in the Report . <p> London , Janaury 12th , 1931 . <p> With reference to the last paragraph of your letter No. 6A/9245 /516 of March 25th , 1929 , in which you brought to the notice of His Majestys Government in the United Kingdom the conclusions reached by the Council of the League of Nations in regard to a petition from the Bahf Spiritual Assembly of Baghdd , I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Government of Irq . <p> 2 . The Government of Irq finally decided to set up a special Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. G. Alexander , President of the Irqf Court of Appeal , to consider the views expressed by the Bahf Community in respect of certain houses in Baghdd and to formulate recommendations for an equitable settlement of this question . I am now to transmit to you the accompanying report submitted by this committee to the Irqf Government on August 27th , 1930 , and to request that it may be communicated to the members of the Permanent Mandates Commission for their information . <p> 3 . I am to ask that the members of the Permanent Mandates Commission may at the same time be informed that the Irqf Government have decided to accept the recommendations contained in the report , which have also been accepted in principle on behalf of the Bahf community , and have directed that detailed plans and estimates shall be prepared , with a view to carrying these recommendations into effect during the coming financial year . <p> ( Signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bahf Case <p> In accordance with the Secretary to the Council of Ministers letter No. 2003 , dated July 12th , 1930 , addressed to the Ministries of the Interior and Justice , stating that we were appointed to form a special Committee to consider the case of the claim of the Bahf community relating to certain houses in Baghdd and to examine the " method " which the Government should adopt for dealing with ( or remedying ) this question , we have held three meetings on July 28th , 1930 , August 25th , 1930 , and August 27th , 1930 and , having gone through the proceedings of the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations and previous papers on the case and note by the Chairman of our Committee notifying that the Prime Minister has authorised him to inform the Committee that the object of its formation was to find out what measures can be adopted to constitute a suitable solution of the Bahf case referred to above , having regard to existing circumstances and conditions , and after careful discussion and deliberation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 244 <p> 1 . The competent courts have already considered the dispute over the houses in question which arose between two Bahf individuals by the name of Muhammad Hasa and Nrf , heirs of Bahullh , of one part , and Muhammad Javd and Bfbf , two Shias , of the other part , and issued final judgement to the effect that the first party had no right to the said houses . Therefore it is neither possible nor justifiable to consider the case from the aspect of the claim of the first party to the ownership of the houses . <p> 2 . If there be any justification at all to consider this case , it can only be on the ground of state interests and policy . On this assumption and having regard to the principles of the laws in force in this country and to present conditions and circumstances , only one course of action is possible namely that of appropriating the houses for purposes of public benefit by means of expropriation for such purposes of public benefit . <p> 3 . Such expropriation may be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that of the Municipality . As , however , the case regarding the houses has a " past reputation " ( sic ) arising from the fact that it had arisen between two parties of different creeds , and that their expropriation now is likely to be taken as a pretext for taking away the houses from those whose possession they are at present , who belong to a special creed , and as such will give rise to public agitation among the followers of this creed , and in order to avert such a risk , the operation of expropriation should be an extensive one and should cover the said houses and properties in order to give out that the purpose is one of public benefit . Assuming that the expropriation is to take place , we suggest that the operation of expropriation should be extensive so as to cover the properties surrounding the houses in question for the opening of a road or the laying out of a garden if expropriation is to be made for municipal purpose , or for a hospital ( or dispensary ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a square , if the expropriation is to be on behalf of and for the Government . <p> It should be observed that the state of the houses at Shaykh Bashshr quarter is such as will justify Government action in opening a wide square adequate for laying out a garden , or especially a play-ground for children and a promenade ground for women . The success of the childrens play-ground and womens recreation ground at North Gate furnishes the strongest proof that such a project of public benefit is essential . <p> As houses in Baghdd West are crowded and in a bad state and there are no play-ground for children , it appears to us that the Government will be perfectly in the right in expropriating a number of the houses surrounding the Bahf houses and in the laying out of a public garden ( park ) . If necessary , these ( the Bahf ) houses may be used for the construction of a special dispensary for women and children . <p> The existing dispensary to the North near Parliament House is common for both sexes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and women , such dispensary will be centrally situated among the crowded quarters and not on their extremity . As such , it should prove very useful for the inhabitants . <p> 4 . As will be plainly observed from the above details , the scheme will have to take financial conditions into consideration , as it will require a large provision of money . Also political considerations should be attended to , since religious feelings may be involved . <p> Therefore , and as the Council of Ministers are more competent to appreciate these circumstances , we leave it to them to consider what is advisable in the circumstances . <p> Dated August 27th , 1930 . <p> ( Signed ) G. ALEXANDER <p> NASRAT EL FARISI <p> SUBHI AL DAFTARI <p> NASHAT AS SINAWI <p> Page 245 <p> Photos of the early believers of Sfsn , Persia and the Hazfratul-Quds of the Bahfs of Tihran <p> Page 246 <p> 5 . <p> EXTRACTS FROM THE MINUTES OF THE <p> TWENTY-FIRST SESSION <p> Held at Geneva from October 26th to November 13th , 1931 . <p> M. ORTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petition had at last been settled . The Mandates Commission had examined this petition in November 1928 , 1 and , on the basis of its report , the Council of the League2 had , in March 1929 , invited the British Government to remedy the wrong done to those people . <p> At the twentieth session of the Mandates Commission3 the accredited representative had said that no steps had yet been taken . As the accredited representative was now perhaps before the Commission for the last time , M. Orts wished to ask him whether effect had been given to the Councils resolution . It might be argued that , as so much time had elapsed , the affair was of no further interest . It was , however , characteristic of the Muslim spirit of intolerance and the fears that spirit caused the Irqf Government . Those fears seemed to be stronger than the Governments desire , particularly at the present time , to avoid any appearance of disregarding the opinion of the League Council . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS repeated the explanations which he had given at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt in the mind of His Majestys Government that a miscarriage of justice had taken place , and he explained at length the various difficulties , legal and otherwise , which stood in the way of a revised settlement . The Irqf Government had , however , accepted in principle a solution of the problem which he regarded as satisfactory , and was determined to carry it out . <p> If the case had been cognisable by the Permanent Court of International Justice , it would no doubt have been settled by now , and he reminded the Commission that occasional miscarriages of justice were not peculiar to Irq . He much regretted the delay which had occurred and hoped the matter would be disposed of before next summer . <p> M. ORTS fully appreciated the difficulties of the situation . It should not be forgotten , however , that the Irqf courts had created that situation by their partiality and the Irqf Government by its weakness . He noted that no progress had been made in the matter . Religious passion was at the bottom of this injustice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were due to the same cause ; the Irqf Government was not strong enough to make a majority respect the right of a minority . That was a point which should not be forgotten . <p> M. Orts thought that the Commission would have to report to the Council that its 1929 resolution had remained without effect . <p> M. RAPPARD concluded from the explanations given that the case would have been settled if it had been subject to the jurisdiction of a supreme court . This would seem to denote , therefore , that there was merely a legal difficulty . He asked whether it would have been possible to overcome the legal difficulty if there had been no question of any religious fanaticism . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS replied that the legal difficulty was that the highest court in the country had awarded the property to the people who were now in possession , and there was no appeal against that judgement . Up to now , it had not been found possible <p> Page 247 <p> To settle the matter by negotiation out of court . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice had been to deprive the lawful owners namely the Bahfs of their property . The solution of expropriating that property could hardly be accepted as a reparation for the denial of justice . The present holders , who had no right to the property , would receive the compensation for expropriation , whereas the despoiled would obtain no other satisfaction than being , like every other inhabitant of Baghdd , allowed to enter the public garden and apply to the dispensary . At the very least , a decree might have been issued ( as had already been suggested ) that no change should ever be made in the arrangement of the places to which they attached a sentimental value . <p> Lord LUGARD asked whether it would be possible for the Irqf Government to make restitution by an Act of Parliament without reversing the judgement . <p> Sir Francis HUMPHRYS replied that a majority would not be obtained in Parliament . <p> M. RAPPARD asked whether the mandatory Power had had any hope of redressing the legal judgement when it enquired into the matter . Had there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis HUMPHRYS said there must have been , he thought , over a hundred consultations with the King , the Prime Minister , legal advisers , etc. , with a view to fining a solution , but without success . He referred to his remark at the previous session4 that this was the only case in eleven years in which the justice of a decision by the Irqf courts had been questioned by His Majestys Government . He would do his best to see that the proposed solution was put into effect next summer . <p> 6 . <p> Extracts from the Report to the Council of the League of Nations on the ordinary work of the Twenty-First Session of the Permanent Mandates Commission , held at Geneva from October 26th to November 13th , 1931 . <p> " The Commission learned with regret that the Mandatory Power had not yet succeeded in obtaining redress for the Bahf Community in respect for the miscarriage of justice of which it was the victim and to which allusion was made in the Commissions two previous reports to the Council on Irq.

With the help of the SS underground , Eichmann escaped captivity , was given a false set of identification papers , and subsequently lived in L++neburg Heath for four years working mostly as a lumberjack . In 1950 , the neo-Nazi group Odessa smuggled him to Rome , where he wandered from monastery to monastery until a Franciscan priest , well aware of Eichmann 's identity , procured a refugee pass allowing him to emigrate to Buenos Aires . In 1952 , he brought over his wife and children . <p> Eichmann 's trial turned him into a worldwide household name . He became " a metonym for the entire history of the Nazi persecution of the Jews ... the face of Nazi mass murder . " 1 The United Nations , the U.S. State Department , the New York Times , and the Washington Post , among other prominent entities , all opposed Israel 's intrusion into Argentina to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial was Harry Mulisch , a well-known 33-year-old Dutch novelist , who persuaded the weekly magazine Elseviers Weekblad to send him to Jerusalem to report on Criminal Case 40/61 , the number assigned to Eichmann 's case by the District Court of Jerusalem . Perhaps Mulisch 's own background had something to do with seeking the assignment . He was the son of a Jewish woman and a native Austrian ; his father faced three years imprisonment after the war for serving as director of a Dutch bank that played a key role in deporting Dutch Jews and seizing their property . Fortunately for Mulisch , he remained with his father following his parents ' divorce ; had he lived with his mother as a half-Jew , he too might have been targeted for deportation . Not only did Karl Victor Mulisch protect his son , but he also managed to get his wife released after she was picked up for deportation . All of her relatives perished . Hence Mulisch saw firsthand what it meant to be both victim and perpetrator . <p> Mulisch 's book contains fifteen chapters/articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " and " Jerusalem Diary II . " They cover , respectively , the time between April 6 and April 29 , 1961 , and June 19 to July 2 , 1961 . The other articles are cited by date of completion , not publication , to avoid confusion with the diary dates . The first article was completed on March 26 , 1961 , and the last on September 30 , 1961 . Like most reporters , Mulisch did not attend all the trial sessions--numbering nearly one hundred--that took place between April 11 and August 14 , 1961 , when the court adjourned . It reassembled on December 11 to render its guilty verdict on all fifteen counts of the indictment , twelve of which carried the death penalty . To all of the charges Eichmann pleaded " not guilty in the sense of the indictment , " meaning that although there was no blood sticking to his hands , he certainly " would be found guilty of complicity in murder " ( p. 51 ) . On May 29 , 1962 , the Court of Appeals confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eichmann was hanged , his body cremated , and his ashes scattered in the Mediterranean outside Israeli waters . <p> Criminal Case 40/61 covers a wide range of topics , including Mulisch 's travels throughout Israel , a country where " one can learn the meaning of courage from desperation " ( p. 31 ) . Mulisch 's observations on this and other subjects here reveal a dated book , not surprising given its publication during the Cold War and the infancy of the new state of Israel , which to Mulisch has " the atmosphere of a communist country , but without the pressures that poison life there . In short , this is the most agreeable atmosphere imaginable , currently probably to be found elsewhere only in Cuba " ( p. 44 ) . Other articles describe his journeys to pre-Wall Berlin in search of traces of Eichmann , and to the Auschwitz killing site . Mulisch also ponders the broader meaning of the trial , deeming it " the greatest public lesson in world history " ( p. 35 ) . He addresses Dutch complicity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinematic , and artistic images depicting Hitler 's world of horrors before its arrival in the flesh . <p> Whatever the constraints imposed on Mulisch by the immediacy of events , deadlines he had to meet , and selective use of limited written sources , his reportage is usually interesting , frequently penetrating , and always beautifully written . His descriptions of Eichmann in the courtroom 's glass cage alone are worth the price of admission . " Eichmann 's cold , grubby eyes do not leave the prosecutors for a second , hour after hour . Sometimes they sort of shoot sideways in a sudden tic . Then he shudders for a moment , and sucks his cheeks in , which makes him pull his mouth to the left " ( p. 37 ) . Mulisch 's renditions of Eichmann 's linguistic labyrinths are also priceless . They consist of " parentheses lining up with the next parenthesis , a fourth parenthesis with an ' on the one hand ' with a reference to earlier statements , then back to the third parenthesis . He would love to summarize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 127 ) . <p> Mulisch confesses he is " less concerned with what Eichmann has done than with who he is " ( p. 111 ) . Often he categorizes Eichmann 's essence both aphoristically ( one of his pretrial books was titled The Book of Aphorisms ) and more straightforwardly . Some examples of the former : " Eichmann committed the crime because he embodied his own reality " ( p. 4 ) . And Eichmann " did not know what he was doing when he transported his victims by the hundreds of thousands to the gas chambers ; in a sense he did not know that he was doing something " ( p. 4 ) . More tellingly : " If they had put an empty SS uniform in the cage , with an SS hat hovering above it , they could have had a defendant of greater reality " ( p. 41 ) . <p> There was nothing in Eichmann 's upbringing , Mulisch informs the reader , to predict the career he more or less stumbled into . The high school dropout eventually found employment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially hated Jews ; at most , he acquired the run-of-the-mill anti-Semitism typical of the city 's inhabitants . Fired from his job because of poor performance , he entered the SS in 1932 encouraged by a family friend , Ernst Kaltenbrunner , who later became chief of the Head Office for Reich Security ( RSHA ) . Bored by his work , in 1934 he successfully applied for a position in Himmler 's SD ( Security Service ) , where he commanded subdivision IV B 4 , responsible for Jewish Affairs . He briefly studied Hebrew with a rabbi and acquired a smattering of Yiddish . He paid a 1937 visit to Palestine , likely to negotiate with the Hagannah about increasing Jewish emigration there , but he and a colleague were expelled by British authorities after two days . Later in Argentina , he said , " Had I been a Jew , I would have been a fanatical Zionist " ( p. 22 ) . <p> Like much of what Eichmann says here , in later interviews , and at the trial , his comments must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts that Eichmann did not believe in anything but " the order , " which he worshiped as a mystical , superhuman power that had to be obeyed no matter where it came from . In a memoir written while awaiting trial , Eichmann writes that he would even have killed his father if he had received the order to do so . Mulisch agrees with Eichmann 's self-assessment , " Whatever they might have ordered me to do , I would have obeyed " ( p. 111 ) . That the nonfanatic Eichmann sent millions to the offertory of a heresy he did not believe in makes him , for Mulisch , even guiltier than true-believer murderers like Hitler and Himmler who can ( in vain ) use their beliefs as an excuse . <p> In a key chapter , " The Ideal of Psych-Technology , " Mulisch labels Eichmann " the symbol of progress , " the embodiment of human machines that obey their impulses without the capability of examining their natures , while providing the prototype for modern equivalents . Today 's mechanical men ( or Eichmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Israel . Millions of them roam the earth , willing to do anything because their societies order it , but often going unnoticed for years , " because no wars were lost or because no inhumane orders were given " ( p. 117 ) . The numerous examples of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the past few decades have shown what these automatons will do when provided an opportunity . Concludes Mulisch ominously , " We do not have to be wary of criminals ; we must continue being wary of ordinary people . We must keep one eye on the mirror " ( p. 117 ) . <p> As Hannah Arendt acknowledges in the postscript to her classic Eichmann in Jerusalem , Mulisch 's analysis of Eichmann 's psyche " coincides with my own on some essential points . " 3 She portrays him similarly as an individual lacking any conviction other than following " the order , " which for Eichmann was tantamount to obeying the law in the same way as did the respectable society around him . To do otherwise , Eichmann claimed , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bad conscience . She , too , accepts Eichmann as " terrifyingly normal , " emblematic of the new type of criminal who commits his crimes under circumstances that make it well nigh impossible for him to know or feel what he does . <p> Yet as insightful as both authors are about what made Eichmann tick , their analyses do not tell the whole story . There is evidence that indicates that Eichmann did take initiatives : for example , the 1939 forced evacuations of Jews to the Nisko region of Poland ; in deporting Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz in defiance of Himmler 's orders ( with the approval of Hitler ) to halt the transfers for reasons of expediency ; and in opposing the selection of some Jews for work , instead of immediately gassing all of them . There is even an occasion in September 1941 when Eichmann intervened to ship over twenty thousand Jews and Gypsies from the Rhineland , not to Riga or Minsk where they would certainly have been shot on the spot by the Einsatzgruppen , but instead to Lodz where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Eichmann initiatives challenge the notion that he was always the calm , dutiful civil servant that Mulisch describes . <p> Moreover , to deny that anti-Semitism played any role in Eichmann 's discharge of his duties is a bit of a stretch . Mulisch conjectures that had Albert Schweitzer been Reich Chancellor , and Eichmann received an order to transport all sick blacks to hospitals , he would have carried out the order with the same pleasure and promptness . That claim denies absolutely the impact on Eichmann of the pervasive and long-term Nazi promotion of anti-Semitism , in which Jews were designated the implacable racial enemy . <p> Intuitive , psychological explanations of the sort offered by Mulisch tend to downplay situational factors and group dynamics . Eichmann was ambitious ( frustrated that he rose no higher than the rank of lieutenant colonel ) and enjoyed the perks of his specialty : luxurious living quarters , sumptuous food and drink , mistresses , and gala parties , an ostentatious lifestyle that came in large measure because of Eichmann 's position . He was rewarded by the Nazis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departures to the slaughterhouses , ordering roundups and arrests , and issuing directives concerning categories of Jews to be exterminated . <p> Recent " perpetrator research " has established the impossibility of establishing a single motive as to why the different types of perpetrators--fanatics , technocrats , and ordinary Germans--voluntarily killed their helpless victims . Social psychology and learning theory help in understanding the willingness of so many Germans to kill with no pangs of conscience . Issues include the behavior of a dominant group , cognitive dissonance , contextual twisting , and the degree of difficulty in gaining group membership. 3 <p> Pointing to potential Eichmanns in our midst must not obscure the difference between what they might do and what Eichmann actually did do , and the implication that his lack of base motives mitigates his actions .

He is keenly aware of the difficulties of fitting the richness and complexity of Italian history spanning two millennia into a slim volume . His solution is to attend to the traditional focus of political history following the theme of nation building and the challenges , especially over the last two centuries , of forging a collective identity--an endeavor he correctly and usefully notes alternated between " materialist " and " idealist " solutions . Except in his early chapters , his attention to economic , social , cultural , and geographical considerations are of secondary interest . <p> The introduction stands as a well-crafted essay on the idea of " Italy . " The author , while tracing and acknowledging proto-nationalist ideas in the classically inspired works of Renaissance Humanists , in the prose of " literary patriots " such as Manzoni , d'Azeglio , and Mazzini , and more unevenly over time in historical writing , notably by Guicciardini and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real political application . He follows the conventional explanation that political nationalism was not initially home-grown but imported first into Piedmont when the Romantic nationalism of the French Revolution arrived on the peninsula . The Risorgimento raised questions of the political form in which the nation should be cast--questions revisited through the crises of the liberal state , fascism , the republic , and ever-present in the contemporary crises of authority and corruption in the 1990s . <p> To set the groundwork for the relatively new national experiment , chapter one briefly examines Italy 's geographical position , topography , agricultural resources , and limited mineral deposits in connection with a variety of economic , social , and political patterns . These include trade , diet , disease , emigration , peasant revolutionary activism , and religious practice and belief , as well as the persistence of linguistic dialects as divisive factors across regional , urban-rural , and social class lines .

The major political leaders of each regime are showcased and their careers examined in the light of the struggle of the emerging nation to modernize . Most of the attention in these chapters is on domestic history and here Duggan seizes upon the social , demographic , law and order , and economic issues of the past two centuries to help illuminate his thesis . He is most helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative , calling attention often to regional differences and tensions and discussing relations between the periphery and the official center of national power . In the final analysis , he does not shy away from trying to make sense of contemporary problems in Italy ( to 1993 ) , seeing them as the extension of long historical experience . He contends , emphatically , that the recent crises of political corruption , organized crime , and regional separatist or federalist movements demonstrate that " A nation ... is primarily an idea superimposed on material reality , which needs to be believed in or at least accepted , by a majority of the population . In Italy , such an idea has yet to find any clear delineation " ( p. 294 ) . <p> As a traditional introductory political history of Italy for English readers , the book is insightful and well-informed in its synthesis of up-to-date scholarship and historiography .

The book 's prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment will be for those readers who are seeking a new approach to Italian history in a general survey text , one that might integrate research from the camp of new historians concerned with broader social history , women 's history , and microstoria .

But Don Mitchell 's The Lie of the Land : Migrant Workers and the California Landscape is , in a double sense , ground breaking . Its originality lies in its analysis of the way that landscape has been produced in the Golden State . <p> Mitchell joins a group of art historians , environmental historians and geographers like himself--W . J. T. Mitchell , Mike Davis , William Cronon and Edward Soja , among others--who are re-examining landscape , not simply as a species of artistic representation , but as the process , at once material and symbolic , of re-shaping our natural and cultural environment . Mitchell has little patience for approaches which untether landscapes from the ground to which they refer by considering them to be " free floating . " He insists that landscape is a real space created historically , " a unity of materiality and representation , constructed out of the contest between various social groups " ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contested creation of workers and capitalists and , therefore , its evaluation raises more questions of political economy than aesthetics . To analyze the particular formation of California 's rural landscape , Mitchell brings the labor history of migrant workers into contact with the theoretical insights yielded from the group of scholars involved in what Soja calls the " reassertion of space in critical social theory . " This proves to be a fertile encounter . <p> His narrative begins with an analysis of the Wheatland Riot which erupted during a strike at a Sacramento Valley hop ranch in 1913 . Having been subjected to spectacularly bad conditions , workers went out on strike behind the leadership of former Industrial Workers of the World member Richard " Blackie " Ford . When a posse confronted the strikers , a riot broke out and two workers , a deputy , and the district attorney were killed . Mitchell claims that the event became a " fulcrum for leveraging a simultaneous progressive and repressive transformation of the California agricultural landscape " ( p. 40 ) . Partly in response to Wheatland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Housing ( CIH ) was mobilized . Mitchell points out that the CIH proposed an " environmental " solution to such labor strife : better living conditions would lead to worker contentment . By making the reproduction of labor power efficient by making workers and working conditions clean and modern , the promise of scientific management could be fully realized in California 's agricultural fields . At the same time as it was working to improve camp conditions , the CIH also spied on the IWW and did everything in its power to neutralize the Wobblies . <p> In addressing this seeming contradiction-- " progressive and repressive transformation " working together--Mitchell adds to our understanding of Progressives by revealing how they tended to see the agricultural landscape and the workers who toiled on it . Instead of asking political and social questions about the structure of California 's emerging system of agribusiness , Progressive reformers proposed a " landscape solution " to the problem of worker unrest . By rationalizing the flow of labor and modernizing worker housing , the labor problem and laborers themselves would be fixed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would make them more subject to repressive power . For workers , mobility was a form of power useful in waging strikes and evading systems of surveillance . In this dynamic , Mitchell finds an essential pattern : " The history of the California landscape is the history , on one side , of finding ways to control the movement of labor , and , on the other , of finding the means to make that mobility subversive " ( p. 195 ) . <p> Mitchell carries the story through the Depression , showing how growers ' organizations like the Associated Farmers worked to objectify and racialize workers by controlling space and how worker 's organizations like the Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union employed spatial strategies to resist exploitation . Indeed , he persuasively argues that the drama of migrant workers that fully came to the nation 's attention in 1939 with the publication of John Steinbeck 's The Grapes of Wrath and Carey McWilliams ' Factories in the Field was the product of a long-standing struggle over the meaning , use , and nature of landscape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , with the exception of one dissertation written in 1942 , have not been utilized . In fact , the CIH has received scant scholarly attention in the 28 years since Spencer Olin addressed the topic in California 's Prodigal Sons . By making excellent use of these and other primary sources , Mitchell 's cogent discussions of landscape and critical social theory are elaborated in a rich empirical web . <p> However , his use of the secondary literature is not without some problems . While I would grant that Mitchell 's approach does an exceptional job of revealing how the " California Dream " was built up out of systematic repression , it is not entirely fair to judge Kevin Starr ( who has just completed his fourth volume in his history of that Dream ) to be naively complicit in " erasing the traces of work and struggle " ( p. 20 ) . Starr certainly recognizes the ideological dimensions of the myth of California as a rural idyll , explicitly pointing out that " the nomadic farm workers of California were bearing these myths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 165-75 ) . In addition , Mitchell might have taken advantage of James Gregory 's American Exodus and Vicki Ruiz 's Cannery Women , Cannery Lives in order to add to his interpretation of how " Okies " inscribed their culture into California 's landscape and how gender and Mexican identity were part of the workers ' struggle over landscape . <p> The Lie of the Land is an original and provocative work , an admirably grounded effort to critically evaluate the power of landscape in California . It is a book to be reckoned with , and not only by those who are concerned with California 's cultural landscape . For anyone who wants to know more about how space is being reasserted in critical social theory , Mitchell 's book supplies at once a road map and an eye-opening journey into this promising new terrain .

Jurgen Osterhammel , author and co-editor of works on topics as diverse as the British empire , China , and Max Weber , declares that " the task of this book is to construct a theoretical and historical overview of colonialism with a minimum of value judgements . " ( p. 3 ) . Along the way , he promises to " probe questions that have rarely been addressed in scholarly studies , " including : how is " colonialism " different from other forms of dominance and expansion ? What is the relation between " colonialism " and " imperialism ? " And how do we understand colonialism in the modern era ? ( p. 3 ) . The result is a short introduction to " colonialism " that is both sweeping as well as comparative and at the same time offers a broad synthesis of the recent scholarship . <p> Osterhammel acknowledges that " colonialism " is multifaceted , uneven , and " a phenomenon of colossal vagueness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " with a central focus on both perpetrators and victims. ( p.4 ) This is why he devotes much of his first two chapters defining the word and its many related terms . He begins by contending that " colonization " is a process of territorial acquisition , " colony " a particular type of sociopolitical organization , and " colonialism " a system of domination . The basis of all three concepts is the notion of expansion of a society beyond its original habitat . These processes of expansion are a fundamental phenomenon of world history . ( p. 4 ) <p> So far so good . Osterhammel then discusses the " six major forms " of these " processes of expansion , " which include the total migration of whole populations , mass individual migration , settlers pushing a " frontier " into the " wilderness , " and the construction of networks of naval bases . Perhaps one of the most important forms of expansion , however , is what he calls " empire-building wars of conquest " or the " classic or Roman " form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. 8 ) . <p> This last classification will puzzle those who assume the word " empire " from the Latin word imperium ( meaning " rule " or " authority " ) and the related verb , imperare ( meaning " to command " ) originates from the time of the Roman Republic and is the basis for the concept of " imperialism . " According to Osterhammel , the " classic or Roman " example is not necessarily " imperialism . " For him , " imperialism " is the creation and control of what he calls " transcolonial empires . " " Colonialism " concerns only colonial politics , but " imperialism " implies both colonial and international politics where colonies are not " just ends in themselves , but also pawns in global power games . " ( p. 21 ) Thus , only Great Britain and the United States " have been imperialist powers in the full sense of the term , although the United States is an example of " imperialism without a major colonial empire . " France , Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited sense " while " colonial empires without imperialism " were the rule during the early modern period of European expansion . ( p. 21 ) . <p> Osterhammel similarly insists that " colonization " and " colony " should not be too closely identified with one another . Colonization can occur without creating colonies , such as during North America 's westward expansion in the 19th century . Conversely , colonies can result from military conquest , not colonization , with British India an example of " colonial rule without colonization . " ( p. 10 ) . After confessing that " juridical circuitousness " is " the price of terminological precision , " he lists what he considers the " major types " of colonies : " maritime enclaves such as Britain 's Hong Kong ; " settlement colonies " including French Algeria and Canada ; and " exploitation colonies " usually acquired by military conquest . ( pp. 10-11 ) . <p> The primary purposes of " exploitation colonies , " according to Osterhammel , are economic gain , strategic interest , and prestige . These colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indochina ( French ) , Togo ( German ) , Philippines ( American ) , and Taiwan ( Japanese ) have " autocratic governments by the mother country sometimes with paternalistic solicitude for the native population . " Yet , to complicate matters further , Osterhammel later explains that " colonialism " can take the shape not only of this type of " formal " colonial rule , but " quasi-colonial control " or informal rule , and even " non-colonial determinant influence " as well . ( p. 20-21 ) . <p> After these first two short , but somewhat bewildering , chapters , Osterhammel examines several large themes that require additional complex definitions and new lists . In eight brisk chapters , he marches his readers through the six " colonial epochs " from 1520 to 1960 ; the eight phases of " colonial conquest ; " the three types of " indirect rule ; " the colonial state 's three " basic sociological types of rule ; " the four principal results of the impact of European religion ; the three elements of " colonialist ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ =20 He also takes time to explain " colonial economic forms , " the ambiguities of " resistance , " and the culture of colonial societies . Osterhammel concludes his final chapter with the observation that while colonialism is not entirely responsible for " the current crisis of the southern hemisphere , " the " post-colonial rule world has retained forms of manipulation , exploitation , and cultural expropriation , even if colonialism itself belongs to the past . " ( p. 119 ) . <p> Osterhammel 's book does have some advantages over other similar works . It is certainly more coherent than Marc Ferro 's Histoire des colonisations : des conquetes aux independances , XIIIe-XXe siecle ( Paris , 1994 ) . Ferro 's book was recently translated and takes a broad view , but it is over four hundred pages long and poorly organized. 1 Colonialism is more compact and more comparative and is based on fresher secondary works than Raymond F. Betts 's highly readable Uncertain Dimensions : Western Overseas Empires in the Twentieth Century ( Minneapolis , 1985 ) and other books of comparable vintage. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger audience than either the collection of essays edited by Nicholas Dirks or Edward W.

Both contain standard texts as well as recent studies on colonial theory and other " big books " written in English , French and German during the 1980s and 1990s . Most of these works should be familiar to scholars of the subject , but those looking to acquaint themselves with the particular issues , fashions , and language of the field will find Colonialism a good starting point . <p> Despite these relative strengths , Colonialism presents a number of problems . Many of the definitions are very hard to follow and the lists wearisome . Together , they give the work a highly rigid and artificial quality . Oddly , the book is probably too brief and overly broad . When one disregards the references , index , illustrations , and the blank pages between chapters , only about ninety-six pages are left to examine the five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. 4 ) . For these reasons , this particular " theoretical overview " would not be useful as a student textbook . Further , it is easy to conclude after reading about " perpetrators , " " victims , " exploitation , " and " cultural expropriation " that Colonialism is more than a little hostile to European expansion , particularly the motives of the colonizers , and really does not contain " a minimum of value judgements . " Lastly , it is worth noting that appearing at the end of Osterhammel 's list of " selected readings " is H.S. Wilson 's recent African Decolonization ( London , 1994 ) which offers the following useful advice : <p> " Be gentle , as you fold away a cast off creed " seems especially appropriate to historians charged with explaining such recent , highly controversial processes as African decolonization . However beguiling the patterns and paradigms currently prescribed by the social sciences , historians must focus on people , their actions and their beliefs . ( p. 205 ) . 69403 @qwx479403

The Dutch , however , underestimated nationalist impulses , pushed their case too far , and in the process lost opportunities to regain their colonial control . In New Guinea , the Dutch attempted to hold on to a colony with little economic value . The United States and Australia supported the Dutch colonial overlords against a perceived communist threat even as the colony became a liability . Despite its rhetoric , both here and elsewhere , the United States preferred a continuation of colonial empires to the threat of communism under an independent country .

Thomas contributes a final chapter on Belgian and Portuguese Africa in which he notes that these histories were much more bloody and chaotic than the other decolonization models . But even this chapter extends the discussion rather than highlighting key comparative themes across the various case studies . The introduction briefly mentions dependency and modernization theories , but the volume largely lacks unifying themes or factors that the authors consciously pull as a central thread throughout the book . While not a truly coauthored work , it does have the significant advantage of drawing on the strong expertise of multiple scholars and the unique insights they bring to the material . <p> My biggest concern with this volume , however , is the perspective that it brings to the issue of decolonization . The discussions are largely contextualized in terms of domestic power struggles in Europe and international cold war concerns , and we learn more about European power politics than independence movements in the colonies . While the book includes extended discussions of parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . This is unfortunate , because the authors are aware of significant variations between the colonies and acknowledge in the introduction that those variations were vital factors in determining the different outcomes . A more serious engagement of what these developments look like from the point of the view of the colony rather than the empire would have significantly contributed to understanding these variations . <p> The final chapter on Belgian and Portuguese Africa is partially framed in terms of a cold war context and U.S. fear of Soviet-friendly states emerging in the region . The chapter , as well as the rest of the book , contains little discussion of how Nkrumah as well as other nationalist leaders , such as Patrice Lumumba and Am+lcar Cabral , were moving toward socialism as a way to lead Africa forward and keep their multiethnic societies from collapsing into fratricidal chaos . Thomas briefly mentions Cuban military support in the Congo and Angola , but significant South-South alliances receive little exploration . These alliances undeniably placed strong pressure on Europe 's moves toward decolonization , and are worthy of another book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As is typical of books designed to be used as texts , Crises of Empire draws principally on secondary material , with relatively few primary sources or archival investigations being brought into the study . Unfortunately , the sources are also overwhelmingly European in their focus . Although the colonial world contributed a significant intellectual production during the twentieth century , the authors have largely silenced these voices in this work . <p> The book might also have been strengthened with a broader historical framework , curiously missing , with some exceptions , in a volume penned by historians . Although the focus of this volume is on the twentieth century , as Nkrumah noted , these developments can be contextualized in terms of the collapse of Iberian empires at the beginning of the previous century . Perhaps more curious is a failure to mention the Haitian Revolution waged against the French , given that the French are a major case study in the current volume under review . <p> Furthermore , in terms of the authors ' historical interpretations , they seem to assume that the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little interrogation of how the decisions of various actors influenced these outcomes or what other possible outcomes or models might have developed . Examining this history from the perspective of the global South , situated in the context of successful liberatory struggles in Latin America , casts this history in a different light . Finally , while the authors present this volume as a text for students , it does assume a certain amount of background knowledge . Rather than an introductory text , it works best for its detailed and in-depth discussions of internal political discussions in Europe and how those impulses contributed to twentieth-century decolonization processes .

King 's most recent work , a study of the " Swan King , " Ludwig II of Bavaria ( 1845-1886 ) , outshines both . <p> The conventional wisdom about Ludwig II is that he was hopelessly insane , an assumption borne out in the 1970s in an article speculating that syphilis , contracted through homosexual activity , explained Ludwig 's increasingly bizarre behavior throughout his adulthood . Obsessed for several years with the music of the composer Richard Wagner , as well as with numerous extravagant architectural projects in the Bavarian countryside , Ludwig spent less and less of his time ruling Bavaria , a responsibility that had never held much appeal for him .

Most of the work on the ill-fated monarch revels in his myriad personal idiosyncrasies and in the lavish palaces that he constructed but rarely enjoyed . Speculations about his death--accident , suicide , or murder--moreover , detract from more worthwhile analyses of his life , and neglect the extent to which Ludwig 's own failings led to his removal from power . King seeks to preserve the mystique of Ludwig II while cutting through the mystery that envelops him . In this biography , Ludwig emerges as a man who was less deranged than lonely , eccentric , and self-absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a physically rigorous yet completely impractical education combined to create a youth rich in imagination but completely lacking in the qualities that were indispensable to effective political leadership or to enduring personal relationships . When this insecure and ill-prepared prince suddenly inherited the Bavarian throne at the age of eighteen , the resulting disaster was inevitable . Ludwig was no match for his own ministers , let alone for more adept statesmen , particularly Otto von Bismarck , who maneuvered Ludwig into offering the imperial German crown to the reluctant Kaiser-to-be , King William of Prussia . <p> This captivating biography of Ludwig II compares favorably to King 's earlier works . His affection for Ludwig is evident ; his insistence that the monarch was more sinned against than sinning makes this detailed examination of his life a compelling read . The story of the tender affection between Ludwig and his cousin , Empress Elisabeth of Austria-Hungary , depicted as the only genuine friendship in the lives of these two lonely souls , leads the reader to wonder if " Sissi " will be the next subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's younger sister Sophie , the stormy relationship with his idol Richard Wagner ( depicted as a mendacious and completely unsavory character ) , and a string of initially passionate encounters with young men are all treated with an eye to how previous chroniclers of the king 's life misinterpreted them . The blunders of Ludwig 's statesmanship in domestic policy before and during Bismarck 's wars of unification are treated with almost as much care . At the same time , King 's assertion that Ludwig 's bizarre personal behavior was not symptomatic of much deeper mental illness is not convincing . None of this , however , diminishes the value of this biography of one of the most colorful characters in German history . 69402 @qwx479402

Schwaller ( University of Montana ) Published on H-LatAm ( December , 1995 ) <p> Bigamists in Colonial Mexico <p> In his work , Richard Boyer has taken research in Inquisition records to a new level in addressing issues of colonial Latin American social history . Drawing on the model and methodology provided by such scholars as Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie and Carlo Ginzburg , Boyer has demonstrated how Inquisition materials can be used to investigate the details of colonial social life . In using Inquisition records , investigators must be careful to always keep in mind the purpose for which the material was gathered . In the case of the records consulted by Boyer , this was to demonstrate the involvement of the accused in a bigamist relationship . For these records to be valuable to the historian , and to free them from prejudice , misinterpretation , and deception , which might have been present in the original court action , the records must be utilized to expand our understanding of things other than the original central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the over-riding value of the work is the glimpse which it gives us into the social structure and social dynamics of Colonial Mexico . <p> The work is divided into five chapters , with an introduction and conclusion . One feature which should be noted at the outset , although not normally a feature in scholarly works , this book has a series of lovely white-on-black etchings which illustrate aspects of everyday colonial life . Boyer begins his study with an overview of the literature utilizing Inquisition records for the study of every-day life . He also comments on the general social composition of the cohort of bigamists he studied for the book , and explains the conventions which he used in translating testimony presented in the cases . He has chosen to use a translation style which falls short of reconstructing testimony as a first-person narrative , but which also is not totally cluttered by " dicho " and other stylistic conventions of court notaries . <p> The first chapter focuses on one particular case , that of Andres Gonzalez . In November , 1762 , Gonzalez was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman in Verapaz , in the Kingdom of Guatemala , and for the second a woman in Escuintla , in the province of Soconusco . Through a rather detailed study of the Gonzalez case , Boyer walks the reader through the procedures of the Inquisition , its history and how it came to have jurisdiction over cases of bigamy , as well as the types of documentation which the scholar can expect from the Inquisitorial process . While this was , strictly speaking , a judicial procedure , Boyer rightly notes that the end of the process was the reconciliation of the accused . The Inquisition sought to redeem the sinner and reintegrate him or her into the social fabric . <p> One of the most attractive documents for the social historian in an Inquisition record is the confession . When questioned by the Inquisition , defendants did not know the charges upon which they had been arrested , nor often did they know if they were the target of the Inquisitorial proceedings . Rather they were asked to make a general confession and search their souls for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this admonition , they were asked a series of genealogical questions , to identify immediate relatives , as far distant as grandparents , uncles and aunts , nieces and nephews . Then they were told to tell their own life history . These life stories are indeed rich sources for details regarding everyday life . These narratives , insofar as they do not touch on the issue under investigation , in this case bigamy , can serve as extremely faithful records of the past . Moreover , since many of the individuals mentioned in this autobiography were subsequently questioned by the Inquisition , there is independent corroboration of many of these odd details of life . Boyer points out that when touching on " ' sensitive ' matters touching on religious issues " ( p. 30 ) , witnesses might expect to be more guarded in their speech . Bigamy was merely a legal category and not a theological concept , and as such seems to have received a far more matter-of-fact treatment in the court records . <p> In the second chapter , Boyer analyzes the childhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that childhood was a time in which people acquired skills which they would use during their life .

Among the higher reaches of society , schooling would normally supplement learning in the home , the family would also tend to groom the child to seek out peers among their own social level , and to continue an upward striving towards the ranks of the nobility . Critical in these personal life stories are leave-takings .

It was a public recognition of a private transaction . Boyer discovers a wide range of variations among the marriages . Regardless of the circumstances whereby the parties entered into marriage , all recognized the indissoluble nature of the sacrament . What Boyer found was that where young people when entering into marriage tended to be compliant to societal pressures with regards to marriage , older and with more experience , the bigamists studied in this book exercised greater personal control over the second marriage , perhaps due to age , perhaps due to understandable caution confronting an illegal act . Boyer discovers different mores for different social groups ; not unexpectedly the lower classes were far more likely to enter into informal liaisons than the higher social groups . Boyer reinforces the findings of Patricia Seed , that betrothal and acts of betrothal were sufficient to consider that marriage had been contracted . <p> The main focus of the Catholic Reformation was to increase the access of the individual to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests to " front-line " activity . Likewise the Church then sought to enter into a contract with parishioners to focus on all aspects of spiritual life into the parish . One of the key chapters of Boyer 's study is the one which deals with married life . It was in the household that male dominance was played out at its most basic level . While the strictures of married life sought to confirm male dominance , and from the middle ages guarantee the known paternity of children , everyday life also reinforced male social control over women . <p> One might conclude that there was a qualitative difference between the first and subsequent marriages of the bigamists . On the contrary , Boyer finds similar joys and sorrows , suffering and success , love and hate , in the former as the latter . Boyer studies the implications of the reforms of the Council of Trent , which while strengthening the role of free will in the contracting of marriage , provided ample grounds for confusion and " folk casuistry " in attempts to get out of marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding illicit but consenting couples than running down rapists " ( p. 113 ) . Individuals who for one reason or another fled their marriage were also targeted . The marriages they left could as often as not be considered good and solid . Yet many , women and a few men , abandoned abusive relations and emotional situations with which they simply could not cope . The central feature , however , was that the social system was highly patriarchal and male dominated , which in most ways determined the potential courses of action for both men and women . As Boyer puts it , " married life can , therefore , serve as both a reference point and a vantage point for viewing the larger societal system " ( p. 164 ) . <p> The last chapter deals with what Boyer calls " The Flow of Information ; --the means whereby notice came to the Inquisition of bigamist relations and the general flow of information within plebeian society . People were , and are , curious about one another . That curiosity eventually resulted in stories , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories then flow as a currency of the social realm . Stories of one another began with personal identity and place of origin . From that starting point , the network of friends , relations , acquaintances , and circumstances filled in the necessary details . What emerges is the importance of the " patria " ( homeland ) , the desire of people to make connections with one another , and the fact that most places in the Hispanic world were inter-connected . ( The people did not attack Church doctrine , but tended to internalize it and allow it to become normative . ) <p> In concluding , Boyer revisits the initial purpose for which the Inquisition was established--that people might control one another . Yet the examples show that the peoples ' comprehension of doctrine ranged from negligible to substantial , and religious practice from nearly totally absent to daily routine . Most of the subjects of the Inquisition seemed to fear the punishment of the tribunal more than eternal damnation . In short , the initial dream for the Inquisition was too optimistic . Most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little time or interest in abstract notions of morality . It was a society of dominance and subservience , and one 's appropriate response to a given situation depended greatly on the position one occupied in society . Oddly enough , many bigamists got into trouble trying to regularize an irregular situation . They wanted to conform , and the second marriage was one way of doing that . <p> Boyer 's study is a rich and fascinating view of society , largely plebeian . It offers many important and subtle insights . The footnotes are rich and varied , and often times are extremely important insights into details of interpretation which Boyer decided not to place in the text . <p> The only disquieting feature is that Boyer does not directly address the issue of change over time . We know from Patricia Seed 's study on marriage choice , that between the 16th and 18th centuries there were significant social and legal changes . We do not see that there was any change among the bigamists , or the society that variously tolerated or denounced them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-sixteenth century without major distinction . Boyer briefly touches on these issues in footnotes , but allows the work to stand for itself . It might well be that the changes described by Seed were largely a feature of the upper reaches of society , and that plebian society either moved according to its own standards or slowly accepted the norms of the elite , and thus change would have fallen outside the range of Boyer 's study . <p> Boyer 's work is an excellent example of the detailed social history which can be written on the basis of Inquisitorial records . His is a well structured study , carefully examined and well reasoned . 69401 @qwx479401

Scheck gives a precise account of those situational factors and links them well to ideological ones , stating that racist Nazi indoctrination and stereotypes must be fully integrated into the chaotic context of fighting in order to explain the massacres . He remarks that there were no clear governmental or military orders authorizing such criminal behavior toward specific groups of prisoners of war in 1940 . In fact , many of those atrocities were committed by heavily indoctrinated elite Wehrmacht , or Nazi military units like the SS Totenkopf , or the Gross Deutschland . Those troops were already ( or would be , along with others , later on ) held responsible for racist behavior and excesses , as well as mass murders during May-June 1940 .

First observed in Poland after September 1939 , and culminating with Barbarossa and the Holocaust later on , this " race war " was part of a gradual process of barbarization and nazification of the German army that took place throughout the conflict . By differentiating the two types of warfare conducted by the German army in the West and in the East , Scheck smoothly integrates the massacres of those prisoners into the larger context of Nazi crimes , thus giving us anything but a short-lived historical interpretation of the behavior of German soldiers during the May-June 1940 campaign .

This focus on the women who composed the grassroots rather than the elite and leading figures illuminates ways in which ordinary women 's lives were transformed , and the invaluable service they rendered to the rise of antislavery sentiment in the north and west . <p> Jeffrey combines the insight uncovered by numerous secondary studies on leading women abolitionists and female antislavery organizations over the past three decades , with a creative and skillful analysis of primary materials on ordinary women who have not been examined previously . The result is a very useful study illuminating how for many of the women who participated in abolitionist activities in the early nineteeth century , their perspectives and actions transcended the prescribed female sphere of the antebellum period . Like their foremothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminists , the women foot soldiers of the abolitionist campaign were politicized and began to move into the public arena beyond domesticity . Jeffrey 's study illustrates that while supported by the conventional early nineteeth-century view of women as moral missionaries , charged by God and nature to uplift humanity and society , these women were able to challenge both secular and religious patriarchal authority and still claim to conform to the gender status quo . The impact , of course , was that as they challenged the status quo regarding race they inadvertently eroded the gender status quo . <p> In the introduction , Jeffrey explains that her discussion of the role and contributions of African American women , impeded somewhat by the relative scarcity of materials , was not as thorough as that of her examination of white women abolitionists . And this is a minor criticism .

Despite these limitations , Jeffrey does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special role played by African American women . For example , black abolitionists , like some white abolitionists , were just as motivated by the desire to free the slaves as to eliminate racial discrimination in the nominally free parts of the country .

Despite the obvious formal disadvantage of not having the franchise , women contiuned to play a very special function in partisan politics by their public addresses and appeals to male voters and polticians to support abolitionism .

He might also have pointed to a similar curious gap in recent English-language scholarship on the military aspects of Barbarossa , especially given the American fascination with World War II and Nazi Germany . In any case , on the first point he was certainly correct , and on the second , he clearly fulfilled his goal by producing an excellent synthesis of the first six months of the Nazi- Soviet war that manages to be both concise and yet surprisingly substantive . <p> Megargee begins his analysis with a succinct summary of background forces that helped shape the broader German national perception of eastern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harsh experience of World War I ; German soldiers ' perceptions of the East , the population of which seemed to them alien and primitive ; the shock of defeat and social collapse , which left most Germans dazed and disoriented ; the postwar rise in political violence ; the emergent myth of the " new man " who saw in war a model for life and embraced the notions of camaraderie , courage , ruthlessness , and the rejuvenation of Germany through force ; the search for culprits to explain Germany 's sorry plight ; and the curious mix of National Socialist ideas , which seemed both to be grounded in a larger European context yet also make sense of specific German circumstances . Of key importance , of course , were notions such as Social Darwinism , with its emphasis on the inevitability of struggle and conflict , and Lebensraum , which in the broad Nazi context transcended its original geographical meaning and came to incorporate notions of economics , racial purity , racial conflict , and war . As Megargee emphasizes , to Adolf Hitler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of contact between National Socialism and the military leadership of Germany . As the Nazis set out to create a Volksgemeinschaft , a racial community strong and cohesive enough to withstand the rigors of the next war , the military thought in terms of transforming Germany into a Wehrgemeinschaft , a fully militarized society in which all resources would be directed at the war effort , a failing that , in their minds , had contributed to the Germans defeat in World War I. One of the strengths of the first part of the book , then , is that Megargee quickly establishes the broad commonalities of thought and aims between Hitler and the army leadership . The fullest implications of Hitler 's notions of radical racial war might have left a few generals squeamish , but by and large a broad agreement existed between the two sides on the nature and purpose of the future war , as indicated by events in Poland in the autumn of 1939 . <p> In planning for the action that became Operation Barbarossa , Megargee notes a recurring characteristic of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One could also add that German leaders seemed constantly unprepared for the eventuality that enemy nations and leaders might fail to react the way they were supposed to , that is , to surrender . In the event , the failure of Great Britain to leave the war in the summer of 1940 left Hitler with many choices , but few that would guarantee a quick victory . Half-hearted efforts to subdue Britain either directly , through aerial combat and then invasion , or indirectly , by coordinating a strategy with Germany 's nominal Mediterranean allies , failed to produce satisfactory results , and in any case Hitler 's gaze kept returning to the East and the lure of Lebensraum . With little immediate risk of a two-front war , Hitler believed an attack on the Soviet Union , and with it the ultimate showdown with the " Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy , " promised great rewards with little downside . After all , the German military had just defeated France in five weeks ( something it had not been able to do in over fifty months in World War I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation that Winston Churchill 's fiery speeches could not disguise , and faced a Red Army presumably beheaded by Joseph Stalin 's purges ( a conclusion that appeared justified by its woeful performance in the Finnish war ) , which meant that it was certainly not as formidable as the tsarist forces defeated by the Germans between 1914 and 1917 . To be sure , the Germans had weaknesses of their own , most notably woeful intelligence on all aspects of the Soviet Union and a shift in war production ordered by Hitler that was to leave the army short of vital equipment . Arguably the worst failing , though , was that Hitler and the German military planners could never decide on specific , attainable goals for the operation that , once achieved , would ensure the defeat of the USSR . Indeed , as planning progressed , operational objectives became more diffuse . Early versions of Barbarossa took some notice of limited German resources and sought to limit both targets as well as coordinate the use of German forces so as to achieve maximum effect . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three different directions , with little coordination , too few resources to accomplish all the objectives , and finally , no agreement as to which of the thrusts was the key one . As Megargee points out , faced with this dilemma of too few resources chasing too many goals , German leaders responded with a mixture of hope and denial : hope for the best and denial that Stalin 's regime could survive the initial blow . <p> More importantly , as Megargee demonstrates , from the inception of planning , political and military decisions interacted and affected each other in a thoroughly complementary manner . If military planners had to face the prospect of too few food resources coming from Germany over an strained supply chain , for example , then improvisations would have to be made : the army could live off the land . This decision fit well with the larger economic , political , and racial aims of the war , since the goal of Lebensraum required the ruthless exploitation of land and resources in the Soviet Union . Indeed , a hierarchy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat troops , rear-area troops , German civilians , foreign laborers , and then , if anything was left , Soviet civilians . If this doomed millions of Slavs to death , so be it . In the Nazi racial categorization , they were deemed less worthy of life than Germans . Similarly , military concerns over security in such a vast conquered area meshed neatly with the " special tasks " assigned by Hitler to Heinrich Himmler and the SS . Even the fear , and then reality , of partisan war could be utilized as justification for eradicating the bearers of the " Jewish-Bolshevik contagion . " As Hitler understood from the beginning , and communicated on numerous occasions to his generals , this was truly to be a war of annihilation , and the great majority of the generals willingly , many even enthusiastically , transmitted criminal orders to their subordinate commanders , who in turned ensured their implementation . <p> In a book aimed at students or the general reader , Megargee demonstrates in a clear , concise , systematic manner , through each phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the campaign intersected , from the shared values to the way in which military victories or defeats affected ideological decisions . The murderous activities of the Einsatzgruppen , for example , would not have been possible in the first place without the victories on the ground produced by the military leadership , nor could they have sustained the relentless pace they achieved without significant aid from the army , which most frequently took the form of logistical assistance , information , and separation of special categories of prisoners for execution , but occasionally extended even to the soldiers ' participation in the killings themselves . Along the same lines , the lack of strategic clarity meant that despite the great operational successes of the campaign , the Germans found their momentum waning by the fall of 1941 , with prospects for a quick end to the war fading rapidly . In a cruel irony , however , this turn of affairs meant that the Germans could exploit the territories under their control even more ruthlessly , as well as more thoroughly implementing the now-operational " Final Solution .

Their common thread is cotton production and its effects on those who grew it . The fields of African social history and colonial history are , of course , well tended areas of study . This is not true of the history of agriculture in Africa , but thanks to Allen Isaacman and Richard Roberts we now have access to more yarns spun about the history of cotton than about any other cultivated plant . Isaacman and Roberts , both authors of books on the history of cotton , 1 jointly organized a conference on the social history of cotton in 1992 and edited this collection of resulting essays . <p> The introduction by the editors serves notice that this book deals with " colonial cotton regimes , " and their relations with African producers , but also promises insights into a broad range of important topics . Three themes are particularly important : that colonial states struggled with African producers over the allocation of their labor and disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were onerous to producing households , and that colonial rulers did not procure the supply of cotton they wanted . <p> Conceivably , these topics could warrant many treatments , but the approach here is explicitly one of social history : " Our task as social historians is to put African cotton growers--in the fields they worked , as part of the families with whom they lived , and with the communities whose webs of social relations defined their experiences--firmly into our scholarship and to try and capture the meanings of their experiences " ( p. 3 ) . The editors assert that this subject can enhance the field of social history , providing " a lens through which to compare the variety of African responses to coercion and incentives , the methods by which Africans carved out spaces for their own lives , and the ways in which Africans actually helped to shape both colonial cotton policies and their outcomes " ( p. 30 ) . <p> The first section , called " Colonial Policies and African Realities , " begins with a brief chapter by Philip Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton . Photo-synthetic requirements made the mid-latitudes much better suited to its cultivation . Porter concludes : " The only ' comparative advantage ' the tropical colonies had was the ability of the colonizers to exploit labor and thereby the affect the price of production " ( p. 49 ) . Subsequent articles in this section show that labor exploitation was not easy . Colonizers had difficulties providing sufficient incentives to direct African labor toward cotton production . Growing cotton for export was consistently uneconomical , and African farmers thwarted elaborate plans to boost production . <p> For example , Jan Hogendorn tells the remarkable tale of farmers in northern Nigeria taking advantage of the benefits of a colonial cotton campaign--to market groundnuts . This case illustrates the difficulty of fostering cotton exports without coercion . Groundnuts were more remunerative than cotton , required less labor , and could be eaten , depending on household needs . To the frustration of cotton boosters , the railway constructed for cotton transport gave farmers a new outlet for this preferred crop . New wealth from groundnuts fed a local market for cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in domestic , or parallel , markets becomes a motif in the other West African cases in this volume . <p> Donna Maier explores another pre-World War I case , of Togolese farmers frustrating German planners . She attributes an initial response to colonial markets to female farmers who included cotton as a secondary crop in their fields . However , without further incentives , cotton exports did not increase to compete with the local market or with exports of palm products . The chapter by M. Anne Pitcher looks at the inadequacy of coercive policies and the adoption of other methods in Mozambique and Angola after World War II . More than other pieces in this volume , this chapter concentrates on colonial policy makers rather than African producers . <p> The Gezira Scheme in the Sudan , as discussed by Victoria Bernal , differs from the other cases in that Britain remade the landscape with a huge ( 420,000 hectares ) irrigation project . In Gezira between 1925 and 1956 , tenants produced under terms dictated by the state , but these terms falsely assumed the population consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities . The scheme faltered over its cotton-growing requirements . Cotton cultivation demanded much labor , and Sudanese labor was not free , as planners assumed , but directed toward other , more profitable , activities . Because it was required , production continued , but with minimal effort . <p> Chapters Seven though Ten constitute the second part of the volume , titled " Struggles over Labor , Struggles over Markets . " The case studies in this section illustrate intervention by the colonial cotton regimes to increase production , and explores how cultivators experienced these measures . The case study of the Rufiji Basin of Tanzania , by Thaddeus Sunseri , introduces plantation cultivation to this volume . Here , plantation and peasant cultivation of cotton existed in tension . Sunseri details the compulsion by German rulers which led Africans to plant some cotton . He also describes how peasants retained the advantage in access to the labor supply , while plantations failed to gain benefit from mechanization or state policy . Yet , despite the peasants ' relative strength , they were cautious of cotton , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pre-existing historiography of cotton has emphasized colonial coercion , a theme underplayed by the essays highlighted thus far in this review , yet several essays in this section do consider coercive intervention . The essay by Isaacman and Arlindo Chilundo examines Portuguese coercive policies and their demise in northern Mozambique from 1938-1961 . This essay succeeds in exploring the experience of cotton growers in the fields and in their web of social relationships . The authors explore the methods of cultivation , outlining the environmental and labor constraints on cotton production and also analyzing the effects of the work calendar on daily life . Aware that chiefs and commoners , men and women , entrepreneurs and impoverished households had different experiences of cotton production , they argue that despite coercion , producers retained a degree of autonomy . <p> The chapter which puts the most emphasis on coercive policies , by Osumaka Likaka , takes colonial Zaire as its case . However , brutality is not the main subject , but is portrayed as one of many tactics of social control used by the state to increase production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on African harvest festivals , although it was never sufficient to overcome awareness that cotton was un-economical . <p> Certain aspects of these articles on coercion reveal tensions in the field of social history . For example , Isaacman and Chilundo establish coping and struggling as different categories of response to cotton coercion ( pp. 175-79 ) . The authors recognize the problem of categorization based upon an assessment of intentionality , and recognize that human action is fraught with ambiguity , however , they do not consider how this dichotomy compares with the increasingly questioned paradigm of collaboration and resistance . <p> That this paradigm requires critical evaluation is evident from the essay by Likaka . It is absolutely undeniable that cotton production in the Belgian Congo was a brutal affair , but his understanding of all cotton policy as social control contradicts the arguments made by other authors in this volume that cultivators were able to find autonomous space within the cotton regime . Cotton production in this essay is always understood as exploitative . For example , his analysis of production rewards fails to consider how material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain members of society . The interpretation of rewards of tools is that they were given " less to provide the technology needed to produce cotton than to manipulate consciousness " ( p. 214 ) . <p> That Europeans in colonial Africa attempted to manipulate consciousness is not news , and how African consciousness changed in the colonial period makes a fascinating study . However , any possible analysis of consciousness is stymied by characterizing those Africans who participated in and benefited from the colonial cotton regime as " collaborators " ( p. 205 ) . <p> The essay by Roberts on Mali between 1928 and 1932 continues the exploration of struggles over cotton production , however , while the other three essays in this section consider labor , this one looks at markets . The blurry line between incentives and coercion ( the flip side of the difficult demarcation between collaboration and resistance ) is evident in the policy of the French colonial regime , which was officially committed to free markets . Roberts explores the manifestation of this policy in colonial cotton fairs , which he describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a free market . ( A bizarre bazaar ? ) While the cotton fair revealed " the coercion of free markets , " it also became less free as the administration fixed minimum prices . An unintended effect of the promotion of longer-staple varieties and mechanical ginning was to increase domestic cotton consumption . Roberts 's discussion of the domestic textile industry includes an interesting consideration of the changing duties of men and women . That handicraft textile production remained robust is evident in that imports of cotton yarn into Mali significantly increased in the late 1920s ! <p> The last section of the book , subtitled " Cotton , Food Security and Reproduction of Rural Communities , " begins with an essay by Thomas J. Bassett which continues the examination of the interplay between colonial and domestic markets . More than the preceding Malian case , this study of a similar situation in Cote d'Ivoire highlights coercion in production and export marketing . Force temporarily increased cotton exports , but at the cost of food shortages . The more remunerative parallel market precluded permanent gains . Bassett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the techniques of cultivation , by describing the fields , and how coercion changed planting systems . <p> Jamie Monson 's piece gives the most attention to planting schedules and techniques , but her discussion of cultivation in Tanzania 's Kilombero valley , may surprise the reader by paying greater attention to rice than cotton ! However this attention to rice is well justified for it places cotton export production in the context of the wider agricultural and tenure system . The resulting essay offers an analysis of social stratification which avoids " the simple binary focus of earlier resistance/compliance models , seeing farmers as active agents within local , regional , and ultimately international circuits of social and political economy " ( p. 269 ) . <p> Elias Mandala 's study of changes in production and marketing in two districts of colonial Malawi explains how a situation of increasing poverty and hunger accompanied cotton commodity production in the 1940s and 1950s . This essay shows how people retained autonomy by providing the cotton grown " in their own gardens , " and also how food supplies declined as cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash crop economy in the context of actions by the state , merchant capital and peasants . <p> The triangulation of cotton , colonialism and social history in this volume deserves some comment . As this interplay works itself out , it is evident that cotton , the crop , is the junior partner of the threesome : the period of colonial rule and social arrangements arising from it determine the questions about the history of cotton cultivation . The benefit of the unequal triangulation is a volume featuring several state-of-the-art essays in colonial social history . <p> Readers will be grateful for this contribution , not least because the book sheds some light on the nascent field of African agricultural history . Consider James McCann 's 1991 review of that subject : " For the most part , African agricultural history has been subsumed in the past two decades under broader rubrics of economic , social , or political history . ... The emphasis on agriculture as a function of political economy has , understandably for the sake of source material and chronological proximity to current conditions , tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion of longer term trends rooted in ecology . " 2 With the exception of the essays in the last section , which reflect upon cotton growing in its context in African fields and diets , McCann 's comment applies to this volume . <p> Of course , it would not be fair to criticize a volume which explicitly defines itself as social history for failing as an agricultural history . However , the final essays in the volume show that agricultural approach can enhance the practice of social history . Also , an agricultural approach might call the third side of the triangle , colonialism , into question . As McCann points out , agricultural history reveals continuities between the pre-colonial and colonial periods. 3 <p> Cotton certainly received much colonial attention , but this book 's great emphasis on the colonial cotton regime obscures other questions about its history in Africa . For example , while the importance of domestic markets is repeatedly affirmed , the social impact of these markets in the precolonial and colonial period is under explored . The attention to European administration obscured these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope beyond colonial relations also might have alleviated troubles arising from the collaboration-resistance paradigm . 69402 @qwx479402

Following the path of Robin Law 's Ouidah : The Social History of a West African Slaving Port ( 2004 ) , Kristin Mann 's Slavery and the Birth of an African City analyzes the evolution of Lagos as a slave port during the transatlantic slave trade , an important Atlantic commercial center during the legitimate trade of palm oil , and as a prominent British colonial capital . <p> The book shows , on the one hand , how the rise of the slave trade in Lagos during the second half of the eighteenth century profoundly transformed the local society by expanding local slavery . On the other hand , it examines how the slave trade modified the way the elites controlled the local population . By examining the transition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author develops a meticulous study of the end of slavery and the slave trade in the region and the emergence of new labor organization . Chapter 1 retraces the Kingdom of Lagos 's precolonial history . Combining oral traditions and demographic data , the chapter examines the development of the town as a slave port . The influx of Europeans ( Portuguese , English , Dutch , and French ) and the growth of the slave trade transformed Lagos into an international port connecting West Africa and the Atlantic world . Mann describes social and economic daily life as well as the context connecting ( and sometimes opposing ) the Kingdom of Lagos and the neighboring states and empires , such as Benin , Allada , and Oyo . She explains how in the mid-seventeenth century the development of the plantation system in the New World provoked the rise of slave exports and its intensification during the eighteenth century . The chapter also examines indigenous narratives of the kingdom 's history . However , the connection between the intensification of the slave trade and the oral narratives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutinizes the organization of the Atlantic slave trade at Lagos in the second chapter . She shows the impact of the external slave trade on different social groups , but especially on the local elites , as the " growth of the external slave trade at Lagos brought substantial new income into the town " ( p. 59 ) . The data provided by David Eltis , Paul Lovejoy , and David Richardson helps to give an overview of the income generated by the external slave trade at Lagos . It shows how Obas , chiefs , and state officials benefited from the growth of the slave trade , which contributed to the development of the precolonial state . Local rulers " expanded their commercial and productive capacity and increased their political and military power " ( p. 66 ) , by investing in canoes , arms , and slaves . Finally , Mann argues that the expansion of the trade intensified what she calls " factionalism . " The conflicts within the kingdom ended up opening the doors to the British colonization . <p> Chapter 3 focuses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main argument is that the British invasion and occupation of Lagos were both the result of the country 's campaign to end the slave trade and of economic self-interest in the trade in palm oil . These two elements would then contribute to the expansion of British international trade and to the stability of the country . The chapter also gives an overview of the antislavery movement , showing how by the 1840s British antislavery action in West Africa allowed the British to identify Lagos as a major slave port and the kingdom of Dahomey as a main opponent to the end of the slave trade . At the same time , the " British bombardment opened Lagos to Christian missionaries in addition to new European merchants " ( p. 93 ) . With the annexation of Lagos , the basis for the creation of Nigeria was settled . The rest of the chapter explains in detail the economic , social , and administrative transformations of Lagos during the first two decades of British rule , as well as the role of some members of Lagos 's elite . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lagos is examined in chapter 4 . Palm oil was used as lubricant for machinery , while glycerine , its derivate , was used in medicines . Later palm oil was used to produce soap and candles as well . Industrialization and urbanization generated a new market for vegetable oils in Europe . During the second half of the nineteenth century , palm kernel oil was employed in the production of soap and in the food industry ( cakes , margarine , lard ) . Technological changes , such as the emergence of the steamship , created new opportunities for Lagosian merchants . Mann explains in detail how the growth of palm oil production increased the use of slave labor . In this chapter , she also gives a particular attention to the role of women in the palm oil industry . The organization of production and trade created new economic conditions , including credit . However , by the end of the nineteenth century , the oscillation of the trade , essentially based on international demand , indicated the fragility of Lagos 's exchanges with the external market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the slave trade , and slaves themselves . Abolishing the external slave trade was a priority on the British agenda for Africa 's west coast . However , after the occupation of Lagos , the government and missionary agents did not intervene in " domestic slavery , " which they saw as a lenient institution . They rather left " Africans themselves to organize the growing quantities of labor needed in trade , transportation , and production " ( p. 161 ) . The chapter also examines how the British officials dealt with fugitive slaves . Facing this situation , in 1861 the British started liberating slaves who sought their protection . Women were the majority of these liberated slaves . This can probably be explained by several factors : " gender imbalance in the slave population , the more limited opportunities of females to rise out of bondage through military service , and their greater opportunities to escape by entering domestic and sexual relations with men " ( p. 167 ) . Despite some British intervention , slavery and slave-dealing ( including child slaves , male and female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main strength of this chapter is to provide detailed information on the profile and the experiences of female and child slaves . <p> In chapter 6 , the author examines how the annexation affected the lives of slaves . Mann looks at three elements which created opportunities for slaves : 1 ) the principles of their work ; 2 ) local ideology regarding slavery ; 3 ) the increasing demand for people . Despite the fact that Britain did not liberate " domestic slaves , " the new colony created opportunities for some of them . Mann points out that during the second half of the nineteenth century Lagosians " employed slaves in many kinds of activities , including fishing , farming , palm produce manufacturing , craft production , and domestic work " ( p. 209 ) . Slaves were also used in transportation and wealthy slaveowners continued to use slaves to supervise different kind of activities . Some slaves ran away and others were able to gain access to land and develop new activities , especially agriculture . The author explains that after 1860 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marrying her , and later claiming the paternity of their children . One important element examined in this chapter is the use of ideology to justify slavery in Lagos . Some slaves could be rewarded for good service : they could win more autonomy in their work , receive support to establish families , and even accumulate property . Some slaves were able to gain their freedom and were incorporated into families . The strength of this chapter in showing that age and gender were important elements that modulated slaves ' experiences . <p> Chapter 7 examines the transformations of the use , tenure , and value of land . Mann argues that " changes in land tenure , and in the uses , value , and meaning of the land in the colony , lies at the heart of the story of emancipation of Lagos " ( p. 238 ) . The author presents the evolution of land tenure during the precolonial period . She also explains the development of alienation , commercialization , and privatization of land during the nineteenth century . But she also reminds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not put an end to family ownership . Some slaves and former slaves had access to land in the city or in the neighboring regions . This new situation gave them new rights and new opportunities . However , it also led to disputes between landowners and their dependents regarding control of land . These transformations also gave place to new uses of houses and land , by changing their value and meaning . <p> The last chapter essentially examines court records . Mann studies the strategies used by owners to continue exerting control on people of slave origin and other dependents . Even though most of the sources used in this chapter are court records , the author expresses some thoughts about memory . She argues that " slavery 's slow death " in Lagos explains why dealing with oral data in Lagos is more complicated than in other regions of Africa : " Although descendants of former slaveowners would sometimes talk discreetly about their families ' + r+t+ , few descendents of slaves would acknowledge their unfree ancestry and some appear to have erased it from memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these documents " traditional " religions and the fear of witchcraft were instruments of social control , especially over women . She also explains how property owners controlled people who depended on them to live in the town . Credit and debt also became mechanisms of control . <p> Mann has used a large number of written sources from archives in Britain , Nigeria , and Italy . Despite the fact that the volume of sources for the period before 1800 is not significant , the nineteenth century is widely covered . However , the thirty interviews were conducted between 1974 and 1985 , and although gender is a major concern in Mann 's work only four informants were women . This gap can be probably explained by the limits of the oral data collected . According to the author , at the time of her fieldwork it was much easier to get information from those Lagosians occupying higher economic and social positions . She explains that was difficult to find informants who admitted slave ancestry , this issue remaining a forbidden subject . This problem , also faced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth of the impact of slavery and the slave trade on the local population . But as this attitude has slowly been changing over the last fifteen years , more recent interviews likely would have enabled Hann to present a more accurate picture of how Lagosians , men and women , see the slave past of their families . <p> The book does not offer a specific section that examines the role of Muslim networks and the impact of Islam on the treatment of slaves in Lagos . In chapter 6 , Mann mentions that a " significant number of slaves imported into Lagos during the first half of the nineteenth century and subsequently were Muslims " ( p. 203 ) . Though she analyzes one case related to a Muslim trader , in general she does not explain who these Muslims were , where they came from , and what kind of labor they performed . <p> Moreover , the descendents of the community of returned slaves from Brazil are not represented among the informants interviewed by the author . In the fourth chapter , on the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph examines the role of Brazilian merchants . The author seems to not consider the importance of their activities because " most arrived with very little capital , and their commercial connections , so far as they existed , were to Bahia and the other Brazilian communities on the Slave Coast , not to Britain " ( pp. 125-126 ) . However , scholars such as Pierre Verger , Jerry Michael Turner , Manuela Carneiro da Cunha , Robin Law , and Milton Guran have shown that the Afro-Brazilian elite had an important economic and political role in Lagos , not only in developing agriculture but also in keeping the transatlantic connections alive through the trade with Brazil , especially with Bahia . Between 1877 and 1886 , Brazilian products , particularly alcohol and tobacco , ranked third among Lagos 's imports . <p> In conclusion , Slavery and the Birth of an African City is a valuable contribution not only to African history , but also to the history of slavery on the both sides of the Atlantic . The book takes into account the diversity of slaves ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . It offers new perspectives for the study of other West African ports that have yet to be investigated .

In lucid prose , backed up by careful and sophisticated research , she provides an answer to one of the most basic questions about the war and the region , a question best posed in the terms many professors have heard from freshmen students : " If most Southerners did n't own slaves , then why did they fight for the Confederacy ? " For her answer , McCurry looks at the South Carolina Low Country . <p> The Low Country represents the Slave South carried to extremes , characterized as it was by huge plantations , a majority slave population , and a political system unique in the South for its elitism . South Carolina was not " the South " any more than Massachusetts was " the North , " but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it an excellent place to ask some basic questions about the nature of antebellum society and its relationship to the political system . McCurry 's answers demolish some deeply cherished myths about the Low Country and cast new light on some very old questions in the historiography of the South . <p> McCurry 's book is about yeoman farmers , their families , their religion , and their relationships ( political and otherwise ) with the planters . McCurry notes that the very presence of yeoman farmers in the Low Country has been written out of history : they exist only as " the people " in the discourse of planter politicians . Ironically , two opposing groups are responsible for this -- the descendants of planters , who have found their self-created myth of the aristocratic Low Country both soothing and a lucrative tourist attraction , and antebellum travelers like Frederick Law Olmsted , who assumed the degredation of the non-planter white population and who usually saw in the South what he wished to see . <p> Through the use of quantified data , McCurry establishes the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the majority of the white male population in the region . According to McCurry , these farmers owned small amounts of land and possibly a few slaves . Their strategy for survival , as described by McCurry , will be familiar to any student of the new rural social history . They produced food first for family sustenance and then grew cotton for the market . Farmers were masters of small households and controlled the labor of their wives , their children and ( if they had them ) their slaves . Farm women worked the land alongside the men -- a fact of particular historical significance , given the pro- slavery advocates ' insistence that slavery kept white women out of the fields . <p> To this point , Low Country farmers may sound rather like farmers anywhere else in the South , or in parts of the Midwest for that matter . But McCurry understands the political significance of the household economy she describes and never let 's the reader forget it . Low Country yeoman farmers were " masters " in a slave society where that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small farms and families rather than plantations and slaves , yeoman farmers controlled their small worlds and their dependents just as the planters did theirs . As threats to slavery loomed , planter politicians developed a rhetoric of mastery that could be made to include non-slaveholders as well . Students of antebellum proslavery rhetoric will be familiar with the use of the family metaphor to describe slavery : slaves were family , they were dependent , and so were women and children , and to strike at slavery was to strike at -- shall I say it ? -- family values . Proslavery rhetoric frequently tied abolitionism together with feminism as challenges to the God-ordained authority of white men . McCurry makes it clear that this rhetoric was pitched to yeoman farmers , to whom the meaning was clear : an end to slavery meant an end to the privileges of the master for them as well as for their planter neighbors . <p> McCurry debunks the idea that southern whites of whatever class were united in a herrenvolk democracy based on race . Rather , yeoman farmers made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastery , but never deluded themselves that they and the planters were equal in power . Yet , according to McCurry , yeoman did not defer to planters or exist in a client-patron relationship with them . Planters had to defer to the rights of yeoman farmers as property owners and masters , since the farmer 's rights derived from the same value system that justified slavery . No one in South Carolina could afford to challenge the supremacy of a master ( of whatever class ) in his home or cast doubt on the legitimacy of his control over his dependents and his property . Planters also had to court yeoman votes . Even though South Carolina was the most un- democratic of Southern states , vesting unusual power in the state legislature , no one could get elected to that legislature without the vote of " the people . " <p> Master of Small Worlds uses gender as a category of analysis in a very sophisticated way . As noted above , gender relations help explain much about support for slavery . Gender roles -- the parts played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of class relations and religion . One of the most amusing , and at the same time saddening , parts of the book is McCurry 's description of the " gendered " relationships between planters and yeoman families . Men from both classes met in the militia and at political rallies ( although their different status was marked at such places ) , but planter women and farmers ' wives rarely met at all . When they did , their interactions as described by McCurry give the lie to any notions of cross-class sisterhood . <p> Religion , McCurry says , acted as a powerful unifying force in South Carolina -- a force that was firmly pro-slavery . Beginning in the early 19th century , revivals converted much of the white population of the Low Country to evangelical Christianity . Planters and yeomen worshipped at the same churches , although seating indicated the man 's status . McCurry does not believe that the evangelical impulse in the Low Country was ever seriously anti-slavery . From the first , evangelical preachers upheld the mastery of God and white men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters , whether those dependents were women , children or slaves . Although congregations occasionally intervened to discipline men whose treatment of their wives was truly awful , ministers asserted that emancipation for women or slaves was unnatural and would end Christian civilization . <p> When Lincoln 's election forced the secession crisis in South Carolina , evangelical ministers led their flocks out of the Union . McCurry points out that the insistence from the pulpit that God was on the side of the South was a critical factor in rallying cross-class support for the Confederacy . So was violence . Yeomen , in particular , suffered a crisis of fear in 1860 that led them to be suspicious of all strangers and to threaten Unionist neighbors and Yankee visitors to the region . <p> When South Carolina 's men went to war , McCurry concludes , they did not go as equals . Everyone understood that planters had more power than yeomen . But yeomen and planters shared " a definition of manhood rooted in the inviolability of the household , the command of dependents , and the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of 1860 , when they contributed their part to tearing the Union asunder , lowcountry yeomen acted in defense of their own identity , as masters of small worlds " ( p. 304 ) . <p> Not the least of the virtues of this book is that it is written very well , in clear and entertaining prose . My criticisms are very few . I wish the book had a bibliography . Although McCurry 's notes are clear and indicate the depth of her research , a bibliography is still a great convenience to the reader . On a more substantive level , I wish that this book had more to say about the relationship of yeoman farmers to slaves . McCurry reminds us that planters and yeomen were always conscious of the presence of the black majority , but this is a book mostly about whites . Nonetheless , this is simply one of the best books on Southern social history I have ever read .

Here he identifies a republican view of property rights linked to loyalty to a sovereign power . This community based sense of property rights held that disloyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As Hamilton demonstrates , some Republicans invoked this older view of property rights when they argued in favor of widespread confiscation and land redistribution during the Civil War . Former slaves similarly hoped that their loyalty to the Union might bring them " Forty Acres and a Mule " in freedom . It is the central thesis of Hamilton 's work that widespread confiscation failed during the Civil War because a newer doctrine of individual property rights overcame the older association of property rights with loyalty to a sovereign . During the first half of the nineteenth century , writes Hamilton , " an individualized , rights-oriented conception of property gained increasing dominance in American law and in constitutional interpretation . " In the postwar years , the Supreme Court , often led by Justice Stephen Field , reinforced the liberal theory of property rights and thoroughly rejected the older " conception of property ultimately held at the sufferance of the sovereign " ( p. 9 ) . <p> Military confiscation was a different matter altogether and Union commanders in the field made widespread use of confiscation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own military position . But , by definition , military confiscation took place in wartime and , while it could and did produce painful outcomes , its effects did not extend into peacetime . <p> Legislative confiscation is the central focus of Hamilton 's work . The widespread use of confiscation by state legislatures during the American Revolution to seize the property of disloyal persons expressed a republican view of property rights that linked them to community stability and wellbeing . Federalists responded to what they viewed as an excess of republican zeal in this regard by drafting a Constitution that prohibited state and federal bills of attainder . Furthermore , the Fifth Amendment linked confiscation to judicial processes and significantly curtailed the Revolutionary era tradition . In the early decades of the nineteenth century , Chief Justice John Marshall built on these constitutional foundations to advance the doctrine of vested rights in property . " At the heart of the vested rights doctrine , " writes Hamilton , " was the notion that the lines between legislative and judicial authority over property must be tightly drawn " ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " obligations of contracts " clause drew precisely that distinction . The vested rights doctrine steadily gained authority in the first half of the nineteenth century and , during the Civil War debates over confiscation , most Republicans ( with Lincoln at the forefront ) embraced the " strict sanctity of private property " ( p. 47 ) . Nevertheless , a minority of Republicans held fast to elements of the older ideology . <p> A leading voice in this minority was Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull . We are reminded by Michael Vorenberg 's recent work on the Thirteenth Amendment and again in Hamilton 's study that Trumbull deserves closer scholarly attention. 1 Trumbull led the effort to secure broad legislative confiscation during the Civil War and doggedly resisted Lincoln 's efforts to restrict confiscation by tying it to individual treason trials and limit its reach to life estates . Treason trials were time consuming and they imposed an onerous burden of proof on the prosecution . By limiting confiscation to life estates , moreover , Lincoln and his supporters assured a very limited market for confiscated property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property that could be claimed by heirs following the death of the disloyal , dispossessed owner . Lincoln 's successes in these areas assured that widespread land redistribution would not become an outcome of the Civil War . <p> By contrast , Trumbull argued for a sweeping confiscation act . In the legislation he proposed , disloyal persons forfeited their property to the United States immediately , completely , and permanently . The physical act of confiscation would be carried out by commissioners appointed by the president who would move south with advancing federal armies . Court proceedings would take place only in Border States where loyal civil government existed . And , even in these proceedings , confiscation would occur not in punishment for the crime of treason , but through procedures familiar in admiralty law . As one of Trumbull 's conservative opponents complained , " this bill proposes at a single stroke , to strip all this vast number of people of all their property , real , personal and mixed , of every kind whatsoever " ( p. 49 ) . <p> Trumbull 's plan failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from legislative confiscation . Historians have noted for many years that central government powers expanded significantly after the Civil War . But , in this area , as Hamilton notes , congress imposed new limits on its powers . What emerged as the Second Confiscation Act followed Lincoln 's view that confiscation must be linked to treason trials and limited to life estates . The only sweeping passage of the Second Confiscation Act was its provision for the immediate liberation of slaves of disloyal masters . <p> The conservatism of the North regarding property rights is further highlighted by the enthusiasm with which the Confederacy embraced confiscation as a new sovereign power . The Confederate Sequestration Act of 1861 declared all property owned by persons not loyal to the Confederate government to be the property of that government . Officials seemed to hope that the value of northern property seized would largely pay the cost of their war for independence . As in other areas of governance , the Confederacy embraced a higher degree of central state authority than did the Union government . As it happened , debts owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Loyal Confederate citizens came forward voluntarily to pay their debts to the government . In the postwar years , the U.S. Supreme Court viewed all of these transactions as null and defeated Confederates found themselves paying their debts twice : first in obedience to the Sequestration Act and later to their northern creditors . The doctrine of vested property rights overwhelmed Trumbull 's confiscation efforts and it continued to gain strength in the post war Supreme Court . Justice Stephen Field took the lead in this regard . The case of Miller v. U.S. ( 1870 ) involved the property of a Virginian ( specifically his shares in a Michigan Railroad ) that were seized in 1864 and sold at auction . The court upheld confiscation , but Field joined two other justices in dissent . Field accepted instrumentalist decisions when the effort to unravel ownership of confiscated property threatened the broader stability of economic relations . But , wherever possible ( e.g. Bigelow v. Forrest 1869 ) Field joined majority decisions that restored confiscated property to the descendants of disloyal persons . By the end of the nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thoroughly established that the older doctrine of community rights seemed anachronistic , " a remnant of Revolutionary republican fervor , " writes Hamilton , that had no place in modern America ( p. 107 ) . <p> Historians of Reconstruction have long noted that Radical Republicans forged a postwar consensus supporting equal rights and universal male suffrage at the same time that they debated but never embraced a plan for land confiscation and redistribution in the defeated South . Discussions of land reform died out as Republicans retreated from Reconstruction and as southern white Redeemers , emboldened by Andrew Johnson 's leniency , seized control of southern states . Hamilton suggests that this familiar Reconstruction narrative is misleading . Republicans came to power in 1861 not simply to vanquish the Slave Power but to advance a liberal legal agenda that placed the uncompensated confiscation of private property beyond the reach of legislatures.

He never became king of England , but he was the sovereign ruler of a large part of France . The prince was a brilliant soldier and commander , but he was " not a political animal , " and there is a strong argument for saying that he won the war but lost the peace because of his misgovernment of Aquitaine ( p. 153 ) . In pursuing his chosen themes , Green deliberately plays down the fighting , at which the prince was very good , and concentrates on the politics , where the prince was either rather hopeless or simply uninterested . In terms of religion and estate management , there is no real evidence that " the Flower of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt ( in chapters 2 , 5 , and 6 ) to relate his discussions about social , economic , political , and religious developments and events in England to the life of the prince is somewhat less convincing . Writing about the Black Death , Green admits " it is impossible to know what the prince thought of it " ( p. 52 ) . In the case of politics , the author certainly explodes the myth articulated on the Leeds statue inscription that the prince was " the Upholder of the Rights of the People in the Good Parliament " --he was very i 'll at the time--but even so , Green leaves something of a vacuum in his discussion . The same can be said of religion . Green shows that links between the Lollards and Joan of Kent ( or her court ) existed once the prince died in 1376 , but there is no sign of unorthodoxy on the prince 's part . After all , he was a lifelong devotee of Saint Thomas Becket , and that is why he is buried in Canterbury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at various points in his study . For example , he states that " chivalry , the identifying ethic of the aristocracy was under threat " ( p. 71 ) , and that " battlefields were becoming less chivalrous " ( p. 76 ) . These are arguable views ; other historians ( e.g. Maurice Keen in Chivalry ( 1984 ) ) , and certainly the Victorian burghers of Leeds , would have said that the late Middle Ages saw the flowering of chivalry , with the Black Prince as the finest bloom of all . It was certainly a period in which many treatises and biographies were written with chivalry as their focus , and when men ( and women ) took the idea very seriously . The thesis that chivalry was in some way in decline has been commonplace at least since Johan Huizinga 's Waning of the Middle Ages ( 1924 ) , but it is certainly not the only view . Green indicates himself that " chivalry was always seen as being in a state of decay " ( p. 78 ) . <p> The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . For example , as a child the prince owned a tent and full suit of armor with a spare helmet , he played dice , and he had pets , since there was a page with responsibility for his hares ( p. 11 ) . The prince married for love . Joan of Kent was a highly unsuitable match in the eyes of his parents--at least compared to a foreign princess . Like Wallis Simpson in 1936 , she already had been married twice and had a reputation for loose living as well as for beauty . Yet , the Black Prince married her in Windsor , where the present Prince of Wales celebrated his controversial second marriage . <p> Ideally , this book should be read as a companion to Green 's earlier biography . It is an excellent supplement--a typical product of the British academic establishment : learned , well written , properly documented , and , in this case , lavishly illustrated . The maps and tables are clear and helpful . Green is a reliable guide to the events of six hundred years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently interest historians , such as whether Edward III and his son pursued battle-seeking strategies , rather than taking the Fabian approach recommended by the late Roman author Vegetius . But , this book does not stir the emotions--at least of this Englishman--as a more straightforward rendering of the Black Prince 's story might , and undoubtedly would have done in 1903 . The easy pride that those English burghers of Leeds felt then has , alas , long since been dissipated .

Eitzen , however , locates his argument in something other than mere criticism of sport . He writes his critique from the position of an avowed fan . In so doing , he is able to value what is good about the institution while pushing for improvements . He writes that " even as sport excites and inspires , it has problems . Let 's not get rid of sport . Let 's make it better . For me , that means sport should be more fun , more inclusive , more humanized , and more ethical " ( p. 174 ) . <p> He is worth listening to .

At my college , with an undergraduate enrollment of about 2,200 , the Sport Studies department has grown to one of the five largest majors for students since its inception four years ago and has over 150 majors . Students come to it seeing the potential for future employment in a growth industry and hoping to engage in discussions of topics they value--football , basketball , and baseball--in , from their view , the often stultifying arena of academia . The challenge--whether teaching a course on sport and sociology , sport and American culture , or sport and economics--is to help students engage with how sport operates or , as Eitzen puts it , to take it seriously . He writes , " But do we truly understand sport ? Can we separate the hype from the reality and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sport is organized ? Unfortunately , many fans and participants alike have a superficial , uncritical attitude that takes much for granted " ( p. 4 ) . <p> At the heart of sport , Eitzen locates a duality which he sees as common to all human institutions , since it " has positive and negative outcomes for individuals and society " ( p. 4 ) . This last phrase is telling , for moreso than many other critics , Eitzen acknowledges the positives that sport can offer , writing that it " can be a magical , wonderful illusion " ( p. 174 ) . For instance , while recognizing that sport mirrors society in " the basic elements of bureaucratization , commercialization , racism , sexism , homophobia , greed , exploitation of the powerless by the powerful , alienation , and ethnocentrism , " Eitzen also argues that there is something transcendent about sport and that it satisfies our " human desire to identify with something greater than oneself " ( p. 3 ) .

Moreover , representing sport within a structure of a binary model can be somewhat limiting in how we are able to understand it . <p> Nonetheless , Eitzen is most interested in breaking through the barriers of the myths that surround sport so that we can more clearly understand its place in our culture . He writes : <p> " Too often we focus on the bright side of the dualities in sport , letting myths guide our perceptions and analyses .

" ( p. 8 ) <p> If in the first half of the book he often only delineates the dualities within sport , in the second half Eitzen begins to be more outspoken concerning the flaws of the institution that he loves . Here he extends beyond the presentation of paradoxes to presenting arguments about issues , such as big-time college athletics , sport and social mobility , and the personal ownership of professional franchises . In these chapters , Eitzen is at his best , combining the dual roles of the academic and the aficionado , bringing to sport criticism the language and enthusiasm of the fan and not just the skeptic . He rejects , for instance , Duke basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do not question Coach K 's genuine affection for his players or his sincerity about the glories of big-time college sport . I do question his perception and analysis . Coach K takes an individualistic perspective , which means that he does not see--and this is the crucial sociological point--the wrongs that occur because of the way big-time college sport is organized " ( pp. 108-109 ) . His close analysis of the operation of sport at major institutions of learning goes a long way toward articulating how and why so much of college athletics compromises higher education . <p> Throughout the book , Eitzen seeks to account for sociopolitical contexts in his discussion of sport , but in the last few chapters he is more forceful in bringing these contexts to bear on specific arguments and not only to show how sport reflects American culture . For instance , he lays out a synopsis of the reforms in the welfare system in America in the 1990s and skillfully contrasts the cutbacks in aid to the " welfare " provided team owners through public support for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contexts leads to clearer arguments and strong proposals for reform in how sport is organized . His chapter on college athletics is especially striking in his call for a widespread revamping of the system . He argues for changes at all levels , for example , shifting oversight of the system from the NCAA to university presidents , putting coaches into the tenure system , and restricting student eligibility and paying athletes a monthly stipend . He is not naive about the outcome , writing " the problem with the plan that I just outlined is that it will never be implemented " ( p. 131 ) . However , he recognizes the central problem and highlights it for readers in such a way that we must engage with it . " The dilemma is this : We like ( I like ) big-time college sport--the festival , the pageantry , the exuberance , the excitement , and the excellence . But are we then willing to accept the hypocrisy that goes with it ? " ( p. 132 ) . <p> Eitzen ultimately proposes changes within sport in eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of sport ; restructuring children 's sport so that they are peer-controlled and not adult-controlled ; expanding participation for youth and school participation so that all can gain from its benefits ; reforming big-time college athletics ; more rigorously enforcing Title IX so that girls and women move closer to equality ; pushing for greater representation for racial minorities in positions of authority ; shifting ownership of private professional franchises to the public , as with the Green Bay Packers ; and lowering the costs of attending a professional sporting event . These reforms matter , as he says , because " sport affects each of us , sometimes profoundly " ( p. 170 ) . Thus , Fair and Foul has real value for readers , especially those who seek to take sport seriously as a site of compelling cultural and sociological interest . Eitzen is right to see the connection between the broader culture and the more specific arena of sport ; not only does the culture shape sport in this country , but sport often helps shape the culture . Contemporary figures such as Tiger Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billie Jean King and Jackie Robinson--have had an influence that far exceeds their positions as athletes in a particular sport . <p> Eitzen serves us well in pointing out the complexity of sport--if we emphasize it only from a celebratory or a pessimistic perspective , we fail to engage with the wholeness of the experience for both participants and fans . If we are overly negative , we miss the opportunity to fully embrace the inspirational story of the cyclist Lance Armstrong , who has overcome testicular cancer to reach the top of his sport . If we look at sport with only rose-colored glasses , though , we will fail to recognize how much public money is spent on sport franchises while funding for the arts and for education is so often dropping . Eitzen 's book is most compelling , however , when he makes his most articulate arguments for change , when he goes beyond pointing out the paradoxes to taking a stand on them . His proposals for change are more persuasive in that he is open in acknowledging his own bias toward sport as valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , his belief in the possibility for improvement in what is often a monolithic institution--see the response to the inclusion of women at the Augusta National golf club--is contagious . He writes , " We can make changes in sport by making changes in social arrangements . We are not passive actors who accept society 's arrangements as inevitable . To the contrary , we can be actively engaged in social life , working for the improvement or even the radical change of faulty social structures . This notion that human beings construct and reconstruct society implies another notion--that the personal is political " ( p. 172 ) . In Fair and Foul , Eitzen welcomes us to join him in making choices that will demythologize sport and break the hold of the status quo so that more can enjoy and participate in this institution that has taken such hold of the American imagination . <p> Note <p> 1 . Throughout this review , I use the term " sport " and not " sports , " for this is the term that Eitzen uses and a term that is common in the field of sport criticism .

Josephine Fisher bases this book on interviews with over forty mothers and grandmothers conducted between May and December 1985 and March and June 1987 in Argentina . The eight chapters are chronological and highlight events that the Mothers found crucial . The book , which was written in 1988 , ends with the Mothers explaining why they continue to march every Thursday in the Plaza de Mayo . <p> The Introduction summarizes the history of Argentina since 1950 as one of economic decline , political instability , and military intervention . In spite of the phenomenon of Evita Peron , Argentine women remained subordinate to men and faced economic exploitation . Their political participation increased after they gained the right to vote ( 1947 ) and were encouraged by the Peronists to run for office . After 1955 , political activities were curbed for both men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , student protests , church groups , and small guerrilla movements . However , the women who joined the Mothers tended to be apolitical , traditional women who had kept to the home . They became politicized after their children disappeared , along with 30,000 other people ( p. 10 ) , and nobody could , or would , help them . <p> Chapter 1 , " The Kidnappings , " contains the testimony of the Mothers on how they learned their children and grandchildren--who could be anywhere from the unborn to 40 years old--had been kidnapped . Almost all kidnappings were violent and carried out by the security forces in disguise at night , when there would be few witnesses . Houses were left vandalized , and goods were stolen , including cars . If small children were present , they were often taken , too . Declaring a state of siege , the military gave itself a legal basis for suspension of habeas corpus and use of the death penalty . Institutions such as the judiciary , the Roman Catholic Church , Jewish organizations , and the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest any censorship . The English-language newspaper Buenos Aires Herald was the one exception and spoke out against the disappearances . <p> Chapter 2 , " The Mothers , " describes how they found themselves alone , terrorized , and powerless , going in search of their children . Even their relatives and friends accepted the official explanation that those who were arrested must have been terrorists . Often their husbands insisted that they cease their search and stay at home . As they stood in line in military headquarters , courts , prisons , and police stations asking where their children were they began to run into other mothers . Soon they began to compare notes and realize that the kidnappings were systematic . <p> Chapter 3 , " Las Locas de Plaza de Mayo " ( The Madwomen of Plaza de Mayo ) , speaks of the desperation of the mothers . They went to human rights centers such as the Center for Legal and Social Studies ( CELS ) and the Families of the Disappeared ( Desaparecidos ) and Political Prisoners and found they were powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lose more children in retaliation for their continuing search . In wrenching and agonizing terms , nine mothers describe their personal evolution from traditional thinking and roles to those of brave and courageous protesters . For it was these women who were the first to dare to mount a public demonstration in defiance of military order . <p> The women began to go in groups from one place to another inquiring after the whereabouts of their sons and daughters , and in some cases , after missing husbands . They became more desperate when some acquaintances or released prisoners began to report torture and killings . ( In the early days , a few mothers had been told where their children were and had seen them in prison . ) After a year of futility they decided to meet on April 30 , 1977 , in the Plaza de Mayo in front of the Government House , which also held the office of the Ministry of the Interior , which was responsible for all questions about disappeared persons . Subsequently it was decided to march every Thursday at 3:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wear head scarves by which to recognize each other when they went on the annual pilgrimage to Lujan . Finding that these attracted attention , they decided to wear them with an embroidered demand " Aparicion con Vida " ( Reappearance with Life ) " because we were no longer searching for just one child but for all the disappeared " ( Suarez , p. 54 ) . <p> Chapter 4 , " International Solidarity , " continues exploring the personal transformation of each of the Mothers by selecting eleven who are representative of the provinces , Roman Catholic and Jewish homes , working-class and middle-class backgrounds . Although the Mothers faced danger , threats , and hostility from relatives and others , they struggled on , finding strength in their group and drawing support from each other . They now perceived themselves as fighting for all who had disappeared . <p> As domestic repression intensified , they found unexpected support from outsiders , beginning with the Jimmy Carter administration 's blocking aid and loans for violations of human rights . The World Cup for Soccer that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press to Buenos Aires . Members of the Dutch soccer team came down to the Plaza with carnations for the Mothers , and Dutch television reported on the Mothers . The Mothers also collected money to finance the trips of some of their members abroad to visit the U.S. State Department , the United Nations , the President of Italy , and the Pope . ( They decided not to return to the United States because of U.S. involvement in Nicaragua p.86 . ) They wrote letters abroad in different languages . The Organization of American States ( OAS ) sent its Commission on Human Rights in September 1979 , and the Mothers lined up to testify while Argentine youth hurled insults at them . Money began to arrive from Europe and the United States , and support came from the Argentine exile communities . Two million Argentines had left after the military coup against Isabel Peron in 1976 ( p. 85 ) . <p> Chapter 5 , " The Association , " recounts the formal registration of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo as a Civil Association in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them from demonstrating on Thursdays during most of that year . Undeterred , they continued to meet , published a bulletin , and used a check for $25,000 from the women of Holland to buy an office that they named their " House . " Slowly mothers in the provinces heard about them and established affiliates . They also reached out to other organizations for support ; surprisingly , they got none from the CGT ( confederation of labor unions ) , even though 54 percent of the disappeared persons were from the working class . The Communist Party and the Soviet Union supported the military because the Soviet Union needed Argentine grains ( pp. 80 , 99 ) . On New Year 's Day 1980 the Mothers returned to the Plaza to march , catching the police off guard . In spite of detentions , beatings , and threats , they continued to march every Thursday , inviting foreign journalists to observe . <p> Chapter 6 , " The Fall of the Military Government , " traces the growing economic crisis in Argentina , the revival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peronists . Until 1981 , neither the parties , CGT , nor Roman Catholic Church publicly addressed the issue of disappeared persons ( p. 111 ) . The Mothers kept insisting that this issue be addressed . In 1982 the Grandmothers of missing children , many of whom were adopted out to childless police and military couples in Argentina , Uruguay , and Chile , became more visible . They held up placards with photographs of those small children as proof that not only adults disappeared . <p> The military declared war on England and fought over possession of the Falklands/Malvinas Islands . The Mothers , almost alone , declared that this was a diversion and that news of Argentine victories were lies . Argentines accused them of being unpatriotic and then apologized when they discovered they were right . Unfortunately , the politicians did not pressure the military out of power after their decisive defeat , but gave them time to regroup ( p. 117 ) and cover up evidence of their misdeeds . Elections were held in mid-1983 , and Raul Alfonsin of the Radicals won , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a group , the Mothers remained neutral and fought against the military 's self-declared amnesty law . On the last Thursday of military rule , 30,000 persons joined the Mothers in the Plaza de Mayo . <p> Chapter 7 , " Democracy , " examines why restoration of constitutional rule did not resolve the problems faced by the Mothers . Instead , the military and police escaped justice--only nine heads of three juntas were tried , and the three heads of the last one were acquitted . Torturers and murderers who followed orders under the doctrine of " obediencia debida " were let go . Argentines watched their television screens in horror as thousands of secret graves were exhumed and a team of DNA experts arrived from the United States to identify the bodies . Grandmothers began their search for the 208 to 400 missing grandchildren , and not one of the kidnappers was punished ( Interview with Carlotto by Fisher , p. 135 ) . In 1984 , kidnappings , threats , and bomb attacks continued even as the civilian government tried to persuade the security forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In December 1986 , Alfonsin signed an act that set a time limit on new prosecutions of military officers , and as the courts rushed to handle these cases , rebellions led by mid-level officers caused the Alfonsin administration to end all prosecutions of officers on active service ( p. 146 ) . <p> Chapter 8 , " The Future , " ends on a somber note as the Mothers and Grandmothers find little justice in a democratic Argentina . They have lost faith political parties , the courts and judges , the Roman Catholic Church , and the political process . What is uplifting is the transformation of the Mothers into caring human beings who became concerned for the human rights of all Argentines . They have gotten a baptism by fire , and many speak of their roles as women and mothers outside of the home . They do not see themselves as feminists , because they think the term negates their roles as wives and mothers . They see themselves as the only opposition to the government , and they " have to work together with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher , p. 158 ) . This is why they continued to march in 1988 . <p> The book should have been updated . The reader is left hanging--are the Mothers still marching ? Are they still concerned with building democracy in Argentina ? In addition , the Preface gives an overview of the book with mismatched chapter numbers , which should have been caught by the time of its second printing . <p> Jo Fisher 's historical and political analysis mixed with the testimony of the Mothers is well done . They have successfully carried the role of motherhood into the political arena and maintained its idealization . They are still struggling with harassment , poverty , patriarchy , and intolerance . They are growing old and conscious that their movement might die with them . One can only hope that their association will be able to broaden its appeal to younger generations and to men and women who did not lose family members . <p> This book is recommended for Latin American and women 's history , political science , and sociology classes . It is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's movement in the making . These women are building self-esteem and developing a political awareness . By 1987 they have become advocates of wage equity and gender issues although they do not consider themselves feminists . Equality in the home was not an issue .

The appearance of a second English version of Okot p'Bitek 's long poem is of course slightly paradoxical , given the poem 's content and given both Okot 's and Taban lo Liyong 's positions on the need to promote African language literatures . While the language question remains perennially vexed and vexing , the reappearance in a new version of this classic statement of cultural nationalism opens up fertile ground for translation theory and prompts further questions about appropriate post- ( rather than anti- ) colonial responses to African politics and neo-colonial globalization . <p> When Okot first published his self-translated Song of Lawino in 1966 , he stated that he had clipped the wings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poem with excitement and relish , it was difficult to tell whether he really had mangled the original or whether he was being falsely modest . Okot 's friend and colleague Taban lo Liyong thinks that Okot 's translation panders to English and English-speaking African readers by highlighting the poem 's " drama , humour , and ... striking figures of speech " ( Defence p. xv ) . His own translation , therefore , on which he has worked on and off for decades , sets out to be more faithful to the Acholi original and hence to " return the discussion to where it was : Lawino 's discoursing on African ways of life to fellow Africans without too much consciousness about the presence of the whites " ( p. xvi ) . <p> Having earlier criticized Okot for letting " a mere catechist criticize the West and Westernization " and in " simple " terms with little attempt at systematic intellectual argument , 1 Taban lo Liyong stresses in his new Preface the " deep philosophy " ( p. xv ) of Lawino-- " the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. xvii ) -- ; hence , Okot 's " Song " becomes Taban lo Liyong 's " Defence " or thesis , and Okot 's " Chapters " become " Submissions " presented before a " council of elders " ( p. xi ) . <p> Taban lo Liyong 's general difference of approach to translating the poem comes out in the details of his choice of diction , syntax , and style , too . These differences are sufficiently marked to justify the project because even a very cursory comparison reveals that to read Song of Lawino is not at all the same thing as to read The Defence of Lawino . In terms of structure and content , Song of Lawino has thirteen sections against the Defence 's fourteen , while many of the sections have been truncated or telescoped . Both versions eschew the rhyme of Wer pa Lawino , but Taban lo Liyong more closely reproduces the longer line-length and greater regularity of rhythm in the original Acholi . <p> In regard to poems in English , I have to say I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . In section three , for instance , Taban lo Liyong 's version runs as follows : <p> The dancers would all smoke cigarettes , like Europeans / Both women and men : smoke like Europeans / They would all suck their cheeks , like Europeans / They would all suck their tongues , like Europeans / They would lick the saliva from their mouths , like Europeans / Leaving men 's mouths plastered with paints , of Europeans / With which their women had smeared their lips ( p. 14 ) . <p> Okot 's version ( " You kiss her on the cheek / As white people do , / You kiss her open-sore lips / As white people do " Song p. 42 is far pithier , its graphic imagery rendered more effective by Okot 's opting for a second-person verb-form , and for the present rather than conditional tense . Reading the two versions side by side is occasionally like reading Achebe 's English , in which Africanization is achieved by content and vocabulary , against Gabriel Okara 's , in which Ijaw idiom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Okot repeatedly uses " stoves " , on one occasion Taban lo Liyong has Lawino produce the Okara-esque compound " fire-tops , " an attempt at defamiliarization that , whatever its accuracy , seems scarcely convincing . Elsewhere , Taban lo Liyong displays a more uneven use of register than in Okot 's version . Whereas Okot 's Lawino speaks a consistently forceful and frank English , Taban lo Liyong 's Lawino shifts between direct colloquialism ( " messes me up " p. 34 ) and an archaic formality verging on pomposity ( e.g. , " Atop the pressure-stove ... " ( p. 34 ) , or " It entails waking up betimes " ( p. 48 ) , or the odd mixture of " Father and mum " ( p. 101 ) . <p> One of the most interesting points of comparison in the two translations , however , is in the retention or non-retention of selected Acholi words . Okot 's version , which is more fluently English in idiom , syntax , and phrasing , generally does not translate Acholi words for plants , customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Acholi culture . <p> Taban lo Liyong 's practice is less consistent , but when he does translate such terms into English equivalents , the effect markedly dilutes the poem 's Afrocentrism ( or Acholi-centrism ) which damages our sense of Lawino 's being completely rooted in and deeply confident of the value of her own culture . For example , Defence has Lawino referring to Ocol 's ineptness " at playing the gourd percussion , or responding in the chorus " ( p. 20 ) ; the latter phrase , in particular , has much less cultural specificity than Song 's version in which Lawino castigates Ocol for his inability to " beat rhythm on the half-gourd / Or shake the rattle-gourd / To the rhythm of the orak dance " ( p. 50 ) . Similarly , Defence 's use of " lyres " and " castanets " --both instruments with very precise European referents--at least partly invalidates G.A . Heron 's claim that the great strength of Song is its abandonment of stock European imagery . <p> Ultimately , the value of The Defence of Lawino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okot 's English poetics . In some ways reading Taban lo Liyong 's version after long familiarity with Okot 's is like reading Valerie Eliot 's facsimile of The Waste Land after long familiarity with that seminal poem , but it seems to me that the anglophone Okot was the Acholi Okot 's own miglior fabbro . The choices he made were good ones . <p> Frequently , as with Pound 's pruning of The Waste Land , they involved omitting sections and phrases that would have grated on English-trained ears and English-trained taste . More significantly ( and less subjectively ) , they have to do with structure and characterization . Song gives us a much more coherent and consistent Lawino whose personal anger with her husband is more satisfactorily tied to the broader anger she ( and Okot and Taban lo Liyong ) displays with men like him who in becoming Westernized have shunned their roots . We see the relative effectiveness of Okot 's version most strongly in section eleven where Okot has Lawino addressing her husband the politician directly ( as " You ... " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as " They ... " ) . Above all , Song preserves the force of metaphor , not least in the central , proverbial injunction not to uproot the pumpkin , where Taban lo Liyong 's version is apt to explain the metaphor or otherwise weaken it by cumbersome literalness . <p> This review has largely concerned itself with comparison between linguistic choices rather than the original content of Wer pa Lawino , and given the thirty-five year lag between the appearance of the two versions , I think it is fair to approach The Defence of Lawino in this literary-academic manner . However , as S. Raditlhalo rather belligerently puts it in his preface , " the battle is not yet won , the homesteads must be repaired " ( p. ix ) . The question might be , though , whether the battles of the ' 60s ( of the generation of Okot and Taban lo Liyong ) are really the same as those Africans ( we all ) still need to fight in the twenty-first century . Especially in the face of the scourge of AIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of educating women , some aspects of Lawino 's wholesale rejection of Western science , medicine , and labor-saving technology still need to be viewed with some skepticism . Latter-day Lawinos should definitely continue to urge their Ocols not to uproot the pumpkin , but equally emphatically they should not throw any babies out with the bathwater .

Her intent , outlined in her acknowledgements , was to produce a transcription , translation , and scholarly introduction for the original diary of Ursula de Jesus , a seventeenth-century donadas in the Convent of Santa Clara , Lima . This is where the worth of Van Deusen 's book lies . She has indeed transcribed and translated substantial excerpts of the original text and placed firmly the document within its historical context . Van Deusen should be congratulated for obtaining permission from the Order of the Poor Clares to publish these lengthy extracts since they will be of great interest to their academic audience . <p> While women 's spiritual autobiographical writings from the early modern period are always regarded with interest , Ursula de Jesus ' diary is a particularly fascinating document . Ursula ( 1604-66 ) was a black woman who began life as a slave but later became a freewoman of color and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She became an acknowledged mystic noted for her visions and communications with God ; approached by souls in purgatory wishing to speed their progress to heaven , Ursula became a purgatorial intercessor . Black religious women are obscure figures in history , particularly in colonial history , but are now emerging in an increasingly active area of scholarship . To have moved from a position of slavery to the status of a mystic rendered Ursula notable to her contemporaries and also an engaging historical figure . Her diary is a typical spiritual autobiographical account of its time but it stands out for its reflection of Ursula 's incongruous identity as a gifted holy woman and a slave . Indeed , her account is only one of a handful of known biographical accounts of a woman of color . This work is thus of interest to historians of religion , women , and race as well as literary scholars . <p> Part 1 of Van Deusen 's work vividly brings to life the historical context in which we find Ursula de Jesus . This is an excellent introduction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lima . Here Van Deusen also explores the significance of Ursula 's role as an intercessor and where we can locate her in the medieval and early modern feminine spiritual tradition . Thus part 1 of this work comfortably guides the reader through the transcript and translation of the diary . <p> Ursula de Jesus 's diary was committed to paper from 1650 onwards , at the behest of her confessor , the Jesuit Miguel Salazar . While Van Deusen does not dwell on this fact , Ursula 's diary illustrates the frequent collaboration between confessors and celebrated women religious in the seventeenth century . It is only in recent years that this active collaboration has become a source of interest for historians of religion who now argue that the increasingly powerful confessors of the post-Tridentine age drew on the help of prominent holy women to further their careers and develop exemplar models of feminine piety . An exploration of the relationship between Ursula and Salazar would no doubt be an interesting study . <p> As an example of an early modern spiritual autobiography , Ursula de Jesus 's diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertinently notes that the diary illustrates the universality of these guidelines . Ursula was careful to express that she wrote not under her own initiative but under the direction of her confessor , since it was necessary to express subservience to male authority . The account of her spiritual development also conforms to the genre . She identified an epiphany or a " St. Paul on the road to Damascus " type moment when she first felt her spiritual awakening . For Ursula , this moment was a near escape from a fatal fall ; she was saved , she believed , by the intercession of the Virgin of Carmen . She later received a sign from God that she must dedicate her life to his service when the convent chapel caught fire . Her subsequent novitiate experience is described in terms of exceptional piety and self motivation . Ultimately , in 1666 Ursula suffered a " good death " and died as though in a state of ecstasy ( p. 5 ) . Thus , Ursula 's diary recounts her life in accordance with typical narrative structures of contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope for the individuality of the author to shine through the text . Indeed , Van Deusen notes that female writers had to use accepted literary techniques , or " stratagems of the strong " such as subservience and humility to enable them to air their own opinions ( p. 51 ) . Moreover , it is the particularities rather than the conformities of Ursula de Jesus 's diary that make it an engaging read . Van Deusen explores in convincing depth the ways in which Ursula 's diary departs from standard hagiographic works from Europe and Latin America . Ursula 's multifaceted identity as an African-Peruvian woman , a slave , a freedwoman , and a religious servant in an enclosed community all shape her diary accounts . Seventeenth-century Lima experienced the same profound spiritual renaissance and feminization of piety that we see in parts of contemporary Europe . Women of color who tapped into this movement could gain the opportunity for notoriety and empowerment . This was indeed the experience of Ursula who was later compared to other noteworthy blacks such as the Queen of Sheba and celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by racism and hierarchy informed many of her narrative choices . For example , her visions were often concerned with race and race relations . Ursula 's visions expressed her belief that while the mortal world was one of inequality , all souls were ultimately equal before God . The souls that appeared to her were both black and white and indicated that purgatory was a place where distinctions of race , class , and gender were expunged . <p> Van Deusen 's work has brought to light a fascinating historical character whose autobiographical writings impact upon many different areas of academic research . My only criticism of the book is that its scholarly introduction could have been an academic study in its own right . For me , the work raises unanswered questions , as all thought-provoking studies do : What was Ursula 's relationship with her confessor ? How well known was Ursula beyond the convent ? To what extent did her male superiors take the orthodoxy of her visions seriously ? How widely were the diary and subsequent biographies written by her male superiors circulated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made available a fascinating source that will be of great use in subsequent research .

To make ends meet , Knight wrote articles for local newspapers--a necessity after marrying a customs official 's daughter and starting on a family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled in for the vacationing Bombay Times 's editor in 1857 . <p> The indigenous newspaper industry that Knight thrust himself into in mid-nineteenth-century India consisted of motley small-circulation daily or weekly sheets printed on rickety presses . Few extended beyond their small communities and seldom drew together the disparate mix of castes , tribes , and regional subcultures of contemporary India . The media were more often dominated by the Anglo-Indian presses , which promoted purely British interests . Knight , in impassioned fashion , recognized a void to be filled . <p> When the Sepoy Mutiny exploded , Knight broke with the rest of the Anglo-Indian press that decried Indian savagery and instead blamed the violence on the lack of discipline and poor leadership in the army . Unpopular with the Anglo community , Knight 's critique struck a chord with the Times'sIndian shareholders , and he was quickly made editor permanently . Knight continued to critique the mismanagement and greed of the British Raj--annexation policies that appropriated native lands and arbitrarily imposed taxes on previously exempt land titles , ridiculous income taxes , and educational systems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sycophancy to his Indian bosses , Hirschmann instead sees the moral indignation of one whose own experiences as a social outsider had led to an ingrained sympathy for the disadvantaged and disgust for the duplicities of British rule . <p> Knight led the Times to national prominence .

In 1861 , he changed the name from the Bombay Times and Standard to the Times of India . Seven years later , business quarrels led him to sell his shares to his Times of India partners and launch a new venture , a periodical called the Indian Economist ( 1869 ) that focused on financial news . Two years later , he returned to journalism by founding the Star of India ( it would become the Indian Statesman in 1872 ) .

Forced back to full-time editorship of the Statesman , Knight quickly built it into a worthy rival of Calcutta 's Anglo-Indian dailies , the Englishman and the Indian Daily News . He kept up his advocacy for Indian causes and mocked the British invasion of Afghanistan in 1878 as expansionism and the empire 's hiding of the famines occurring on the northern frontier . His reporting embarrassed the government into ratcheting up its relief efforts . <p> By 1879 , Knight returned to England disgusted by Conservative policies and sought to affect British public opinion . The weekly London Statesman denounced the British Raj 's expensive and morally bankrupt hypocrisy in exploiting India and in fomenting war with Afghanistan . As hard as he tried , however , Knight 's London Statesman was not a sustainable concern .

As Hirschman suggests , this was likely not inadvertent . Knight 's prickly personality and flagrant antipathy for the British Raj ensured that he was not to receive prominence in the accounts of British India or the empire . With this biography , however , readers will recognize the common theme of a reformer who stood up to the economic and social hierarchies of society on behalf of those without a voice . <p> What makes Hirschmann 's work an even greater contribution is that it shows that even while Knight may be disregarded by his countrymen , he was one of those editors ( no doubt helped by his outsider status ) who carried the Western-style principles and values of public dialogue and press through the empire . By engaging and melding Western traditions with the diverse cultural traditions of India , he helped to empower indigenous people to use the periodical press as a tool to criticize government in public debate and fight for their rights and needs amid the emergence of an expanding public communication system .

Wortman describes the themes , style , and meaning of court ceremony from the founding of the Romanov dynasty in the early seventeenth century through the reign of Nicholas I ( 1825-1855 ) . Depending on the accessibility of sources , he focuses more or less evenly on the details of specific reigns to provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolving myths and motifs of imperial rule--symbols that at once projected and legitimized the sovereign 's authority . As backdrop to his narrative , Wortman touches briefly on developments in European court ceremony and devotes considerable attention to the ways in which Russian monarchs embraced , adapted , transformed , and sometimes denied their predecessors ' scenarios of rulership . He is especially interested in how the autocracy attempted to elicit and sustain feelings of loyalty among those through whom it governed : the nobility , military elite , officialdom , and church hierarchy . He also wisely and unavoidably eschews the issue of how society in its constituent elements received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staged events " were supposed to be perceived by the participants and the audience " ( p. 7 ) . <p> There are few surprises in the characterizations that emerge from Wortman 's absorbing study of coronation ceremonies , church holidays , and various secular celebrations , such as those marking military victories or the opening of Catherine the Great 's Legislative Commission . It is clear from Wortman 's account that historiographical depictions of particular rulers derive from the continuing " theater of power " and that the themes and policies identified by historians to distinguish reigns frequently are consistent with the official representations . In the reign of Nicholas I public rituals began to depict the private sphere of family life and thus became less indicative of actual policy concerns , but until that time the motifs of rule corresponded fairly closely to subsequent scholarly understandings of individual sovereigns . Although it is impossible to determine where the personality and innermost feelings of a given ruler ended and the myths of his or her court began ( Wortman 's sources generally were produced by artists and writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible exception of the formidable and ruthless Peter the Great ( 1689-1725 ) , Russia 's supreme autocrats were themselves intellectually and psychologically bound by their own images of rulership . Alexander I , according to Wortman , died a broken and dispirited man because of his failure to live up to his elusive ideal . Whether the internalization of a scenario occurred among its creators or audiences makes no difference ; the immediate power , controlling efficacy , and enduring influence of Russian court mythologies remain evident . <p> The purpose of the monarchy 's " theater of power " was " to present the ruler as supreme and to vest him or her with sacral qualities " ( p. 4 ) . Already in the fifteenth century and continuing until the late nineteenth , the sources of sacrality were Christian and foreign ( i.e. West European ) . Each ruler performed the imperial myth differently , but the divinely sanctioned image of the Byzantine emperor survived . The ruler 's role as defender of Orthodoxy justified ongoing imperial expansion , and the identification with Western values and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general population . It is impossible to summarize fully the multiple themes and motifs presented during the long period covered by this book . There are , however , several pan-European issues of development that Wortman traces in terms of court ceremonies and the imagining of rulership . These include sources of sacrality , symbolic roles of women , Western ideals of government , the relationship of the sovereign to his or her subjects , and after the French revolution , notions of nationality and nation . <p> Although Peter the Great 's father , Aleksei Mikhailovich , presented himself as a model of piety , the Baroque culture brought to Russia in the Nikonian church reforms set the stage for Peter 's emphasis on the personal characteristics of a tsar who brought secular well-being to his subjects through human agency .

What changed were the personal characteristics needed to perform these functions and the political principles and values they represented . Thus , Peter the Great 's scenario depended on the godlike heroic achievements of the individual ruler to justify power , Elizabeth 's on displays of happiness and rejoicing , and Catherine the Great 's on her role as enlightened legislatrix , philosophe , and pedagogue . Eighteenth-century depictions of sovereignty consistently associated monarchs with classical gods and thus secularized authority by sacralizing human accomplishments . At the end of the century , the penetration of enlightenment values , so vigorously promoted by Catherine , produced a scenario of the ruler as human and humane being . Both Paul I and Alexander I fashioned themselves as great men whose higher human qualities resulted not from otherworldliness but from enlightenment . <p> The desacralization of the emperor--though not the belief in his unlimited power--reached an endpoint in the imagery of Nicholas I , who brought the nineteenth-century intimate sphere into full public view with a dynastic ideal that portrayed the tsar as loving husband and caring father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's rulers could safely evoke the principle of heredity to justify their power without also undermining their own legitimacy , and it was not until the reign of Nicholas I that patrilineal succession , freed of murder and rebellion , became firmly established . Ironically , by that time new models of government based on popular sovereignty and the nation had taken root in the West ; consequently , in his short-lived dynastic scenario , Nicholas also had to remove the autocratic ideal from its European origins and develop a conception of rulership that posited a distinct Russian love for the monarch expressed in the acclamation of the people . This motif survived in some circles until the demise of the old regime , but already in the next reign ( the subject of part one of Wortman 's second volume ) , Alexander II would attempt " to reconcile autocracy with the liberal model of mid-nineteenth-century Europe " ( p. 417 ) --an effort described by Wortman as " the tragic finale of the myth of foreignness " ( p. 417 ) that since the reign of Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruling elite and the subject population . <p> Wortman 's narrative is aesthetically pleasing and intellectually enriching ; his sources include engravings , paintings , architecture , sculpture , memoirs , literature , the periodical press , and most importantly , official descriptions of ceremonies and processions .

He also has effectively mined Soviet and Russian accounts that cover some of the physical evidence presented here . The sixty-seven illustrations are equally helpful , even though it is not always possible to see the details described in the text . Aside from giving a fascinating and intrinsically interesting description of " myth and ceremony in Russian monarchy , " Wortman highlights the individuality of each ruler 's " scenario of power " ( and the connections between them ) and thus reminds us of the importance and historical impact of his or her personal qualities--those very qualities that Peter the Great made so central to the justification of power and that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative monarchists to support the autocracy .

Her work is part of a " newest " labor history that incorporates cultural approaches . <p> Enstad argues that contemporary historians have misunderstood women 's relationship to popular culture by viewing it as a frivolous distraction to labor 's real business of serious union politics . Instead , she argues , that working-class women shaped popular culture to dignify themselves as workers , Americans , and especially ladies . Enstad begins by discussing how mechanization and rationalization of labor encouraged the middle class to categorize and rank fashion and fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral , sincere , and tasteful , while demeaning products for the working class as inferior or cheap . They particularly derided working-class imitation of their more expensive styles of clothing as well as their reading matter . <p> Enstad next examines how working-class women used and understood these products to forge their own culture and identity as workers , Americans , and ladies . She extends Michael Denning 's discussion of the relationship between dime novel plots and working-class women 's identity as ladies by exploring how they looked at , purchased , read , and imagined fiction. 1 She explains how foreign-born women proudly read books in English as symbols of their Americanization . She also augments the work of Christine Stansell , Kathy Peiss , and Susan A. Glenn on working-class fashion by discussing how purchasing , wearing , imagining clothes enabled working-class women to construct their own culture as workers , Americans , and ladies. 2 Sometimes working-class women felt like ladies when they wore middle-class stylish dress , such as silk underwear . More often , though , they invented their own styles of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French heels . <p> Enstad 's most unique contribution to labor history is her next two chapters on the uses of popular culture during the shirtwaist strike of 1909 . In the first chapter , she looks at various representations of striking women . Newspapers generally portrayed the strikers as fashion hounds to dismiss their claims for higher wages as the irrational demands of disreputable women . Middle-class supporters took another tack . They denied that the strikers dressed fashionably and depicted them as charity cases of deserving poor . This characterization , according to Enstad , deprived striking women of political agency . In contrast , labor leaders from the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , the Women 's Trade Union League , and the Socialist Party represented women strikers as political actors , labor heroines who fought injustice . However , like the middle-class supporters , union leaders also portrayed strikers as powerless victims , playing into the ideal of dependent women needing protection . Union leaders also employed fashion to promote this image by depicting strikers as ill-clad and frail . Like middle-class strike supporters , union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also viewed fashion as a symbol of irrationality . According to Enstad , historians have continued to dichotomize working-class women 's political identity and fashion because they relied on union records . In doing so , historians have misunderstood the diversity of working-class women 's culture and resistance. 3 <p> The second of these two chapters examines working-class women 's uses of popular culture as resources during the strike . For example , when strikers picketed , they imagined themselves as fighters , typical of the dime store heroines . Like their literary role models , they demonstrated aggressiveness by throwing eggs at scabs or ripping buttons off their clothes . Even the strikers ' grievances were informed by popular culture . When dime store heroines fought licentious employers , they shaped strikers ' criticism of sexual harassment . Another grievance came from the strikers ' love of fashion . They demanded dressing rooms to hang up and protect their regular clothes from the dirt and grime of the shop . Despite this invaluable resource for reinventing themselves , popular culture , according to Enstad , did not promote any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicalism or conservatism . <p> In her last chapter , Enstad turns to films as another cultural resource that working women employed to maintain their dignity and shape their identities . Like the other forms of popular culture , working-class women enjoyed adventure serials because of the heroines ' aggressive escapades . They used films as another resource to claim public space , such as gazing at posters or socializing at movies without parental interference . Films enabled women to identifying with screen heroines as working women like themselves . Fans became " movie stuck " aping the mannerisms , dress , and language of their idols , and even imagining themselves as actresses . When women bought movie tickets for themselves or dressed up to attend a show as a couple , they laid claim to public space through film . <p> Enstad 's work provides labor and women historians with useful insights . She extends and challenges the voluminous literature on working-class women 's culture as roots of resistance. 4 Enstad reminds us that leisure as a component of working-class culture influenced labor unrest . But , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she expands culture to include dime novels , films , and fashion . Her work comes closer to Stephen Norwood 's study of telegraphers labor activism. 5 However , while he sees a tension between fashion and labor activism , Enstad rejects this tension and reminds us of the malleability of all forms of culture , even those that working-class women did not create . Moreover , she makes a good case that popular culture does not necessary promote either a conservative or radical agenda . <p> I do , however , have some concerns with Enstad 's work . The first stems from her assumptions about class and culture . Because of her limited sources on working-class women themselves , Enstad presents middle-class representations of working-class women based on their own words , but rank-and-file working-class women 's self-representations based primarily on their behavior . Because of these regrettable , but understandable , unparallel sources , Enstad can not get a handle on working-class discourses . As a result , she assumes that working-class women at times stood outside of the dominant middle-class conversation about fashion and film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion as frivolous , while most working-class women embraced those same fashions . More likely white working-class women also saw fashion as frivolous , but not their own fashion . I would like to learn more about how they constructed their own fashion as acceptable . We already know that middle-class women criticized wealthy women 's fashion , and we might expect working-women to join in that disapproval . We also know that immigrant and second-generation women rejected clothes from the old country as old fashioned , but did they criticize other women 's clothes ( such as African American ) as frivolous ? Did Italians and Jews make fun of each other 's clothes ? In other words , how did these white working-class women use popular culture to construct an identity in relationship and in opposition to other women , including women of color ? Because Enstad 's sources barely reveal a female working-class discourse , she has examined practices to understand working-class culture . In doing so , she confuses behavior and discourses . This means that she portrays the WTUL leadership as out-of-touch , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , how did the WTUL leadership construct their own definition of lady , worker , and American ? Did they know that they were out-of-step with the rank-and-file ? In what ways did leadership and rank-and-file self-identities overlap ? In other words , if the two were so out-of-sync , how did the rank-and-file accept their leadership ? <p> The problem of sources also mars the early chapters of the book . Until the chapters on the shirtwaist maker 's strike , the sources were a bit skimpy . I particularly worried about the frequent uses of middle-class authors , like Dorothy Richardson , to present both working-class practices and culture . More significantly , too many points rely on theory rather than historical evidence . Besides the obvious problem with this , I found the many references to theorists in the text distracting . If the theory were consigned to the footnotes , those who wanted to refer to them could do so . Because of the frequent discussions of theory , I can not imagine assigning this to typical undergraduates who will miss out on the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working-class culture and union politics . <p> And finally , I 'm not sure that Enstad benefitted by discussing all three forms of popular culture . Without her dissertation 's focus on the relationship between dime novels and fiction , the section on film appears disconnected . Since the 1909 strike is the guts of her study , the apolitical section on film seem out of place and belong as an article rather than another chapter . <p> Despite these criticisms , Nan Enstad 's book is an important work . By showing how working-class women embraced and used popular culture , she has breathed life into working-class women 's history . And that 's an accomplishment . If labor historians can continue in this direction , they will revive class as an analytical category and labor history itself , but with lots more fun this time around . 69404 @qwx479404

In A Plague of Sheep , Elinor G. K. Melville focuses on human environmental ignorance where the sixteenth-century Mexican Valle del Mezquital is concerned . Above all else , the reader is struck by the extent to which Spaniards ignored the obvious changes recorded in their own relaciones between 1548 and 1581 . In the 1540 's , Spanish observers recorded that this valley , which is to the north of Mexico City and includes Tula , was fit to grow wheat , with stands of oak and pine forest . Yet , by 1581 , the relaciones record an arid region , home of mesquite , prickly pear cacti , and the maguey . In the interim , the overstocking and overgrazing of sheep , complemented by other factors such as deforestation to acquire mining beams and charcoal , had transformed irrigated Otomi ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quick to point out that for too long the Otomi ' have been associated with the prejudicial remarks of the Mexica , and with the semi-desert landscape of the post-conquest Mezquital : " In the process the Otomi ' were displaced , alienated , and marginalized , their history and that of the region mystified . The Otomi ' are identified with the alien conquest landscape , not with the fertile , productive landscape of contact . Their skills as cultivators were forgotten , their reputation as eaters of beetles , bugs , and the fruit of the nopal cactus confirmed . " ( p. 115 ) Melville 's book does a great service by stressing this point alone . <p> However , far from writing a simplistic fable of the evil European and the noble Mesoamerican , Melville is to be praised for her recognition that sheep alone , or Europeans alone , do not explain the transformation of the Mezquital--itself a late seventeenth-century name for the region , and one only applicable after the impoverishment of the region 's fertility . Like Alfred Crosby , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melville looks at ungulate irruptions ( i.e. , the arrival of hoofed animals on virgin soil ) as complex phenomena . On one level , the introduction of European hoofed animals was a vital aspect of " ecological imperialism " ( as brilliantly argued by Crosby in the book of the same name ) . It transformed regions in Argentina and the present-day United States into " neo-Europes . " Yet , an ungulate irruption is also always a variable which can be acted upon by different climatic and soil conditions . In the Mezquital , overstocking and overgrazing were linked to deforestation in the pursuit of lumber . Without trees or consistent groundcover to aid the soil in absorbing water , plains flattened by hoofs gave rise to increased flooding ( which was recorded ) and constant soil erosion . A combination of factors led to the impoverishment of the soil . Still , a classic pattern of ungulate irruption is detected by Melville : from increase to overshoot to crash to equilibrium . ( pp. 45-55 ) A chapter comparing events in Australia is included to demonstrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not loose sight of the particulars of her own case as a result . Humans definitely exascerbated the damage which can be done by sheep . In 10,029 km2 between longitude 98 degrees 35 ' -104 degrees W and latitude 19 degrees 35 ' - 20 degrees 55'N , the area of land converted to pastoralism constantly increased ( from 2.6% in 1539 to 61.4% in 1599 ) , but the density of sheep actually reached a peak some time between 1579 and 1589 , only to drop by 1599 . This demonstrates the period of " overshoot , " during which sheep are introduced at such a fast pace that they outstrip available resources , thus yielding an eventual drop in the sheep population . The introduction of intensive stock-raising marked " an ecological revolution " for the Mezquital , but Melville also points out that the indigenous population did not live in a state of nature prior to the conquest . Among other things , their agriculture and irrigation contributed to soil erosion , but " the Spaniards did not simply augment processes underway . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mezquital within decades . ( p. 59 ) All in all , the book truly contributes to an historical profession that too often sees nature in terms of the longue duree of Braudel . Melville provides a balance . <p> On a more critical note , her fascination with statistics , though necessary to her study , often leads to some dubious quantifications . This reviewer admits that he can not conceive of easy ways out of the difficulties facing Melville in her " calculation of grazing rates . " In fact , she must be commended on her scholarly honesty when she admits the difficulty in estimating the area actually grazed by herds of sheep : how many officially registered croplands provided seasonal grazing ; how many Amerindians grazed sheep within village lands , which were off-limits to Spaniards ; etc. ( pp. 81-84 ) . However , Melville 's final leap in this difficult situation is to provide " the simple estimate of the densities of sheep on the total area .... " ( p. 84 ) Against those who would criticize her for this , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her calculations , she may actually be decreasing , not increasing , the densities involved . Her choice is a conservative one , but her general omission of detailed reference to Amerindian lands and herding practices begs for further research in another monograph . She does note that Amerindians received 78.9% of the grants made for sheepraising activities between 1560-5 ( p. 137 ) , and that twice as many Amerindians received grants as did Spaniards in the 1590 's ( p. 149 ) , but she then goes on to argue that this was the result of economic necessity since the land was being made unviable where agriculture is concerned . While her Spaniards are quite multidimensional in their motives , her Amerindians remain the victims of a monocausal motivation . A perusal of Nahuatl-language sources by some scholar in the future might reveal whether Amerindian nobles saw themselves as forced to abandon their cultural traditions , or whether they conceived of their pastoral choices as wise ones . The mere fact that we can find attractive traits in cultures other than our own in the twentieth century may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures in the past . If nobles took to sheep-herding , was it forced cultural betrayal , or was it a lack of ethnocentric bias in the face of a profit-making opportunity ? Individual Amerindians may have had individual motives , just a some Spaniards started to worry about pasture conservation . ( p. 160 ) <p> Still , Melville 's final point is well made . By 1600 , if all involved were thinking like rational investors , the only viable economic choice for many was the large hacienda . Since more and more land was less and less fertile , wider ranges were required to graze the same number of sheep . Likewise , the disastrous drop in the Amerindian population after the epidemic of 1576-81 made sheepraising a logical alternative to more labor intensive practices like agriculture . European sheep and the humans who owned them had altered the environment as nothing else had : " By 1600 pastoralists controlled the means of production in the Valle del Mezquital .

From the functionalist and structural-functionalist treatises of Robert Montagne , Jacques Berque , and Ernest Gellner through the interpretive frameworks of Clifford Geertz , Lawrence Rosen , Vincent Crapanzano , and Kevin Dwyer to the Foucauldian and post-Foucauldian approaches of Paul Rabinow , Dale Eickelman , and Abdellah Hammoudi the anthropology of Morocco has been one of the privileged loci for theoretical innovation in the discipline . David McMurray 's long-anticipated ethnography , In and Out of Morocco , very much deserves a place in this illustrious lineage . Although its fine-grained analysis of daily life in the northern Rif border town of Nador appears to privilege the " native 's point of view " over infra-disciplinary conversations or analytical discussions , in the end the book offers a surprisingly innovative perspective on one of the central themes in contemporary anthropology : namely , the impact of globalization--as mediated in this case by patterns of migration and smuggling--on the construction of local identity and national subjectivity . <p> Based on field research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mediated by the constant flow of goods and people across the border with Melilla , Spain , Europe , and beyond . It demonstrates how these flows have effected a transformation of systems of wealth and status , as labor migration and smuggling have become alternative strategies for social mobility , and as European products and styles have inserted themselves into local games of distinction . Indeed , McMurray points to a veritable fetish of the foreign within Nadori consumption practices , a fetish that extends not only to recognized imports--such as Belgian carpets , Mercedes cars , and Marlboro cigarettes--but also to local products endowed with an aura of the foreign , such as taos ( " peacock " ) China plates pirated in Fez , or the Casablanca-made " Skep Skol " line of swimwear , the logo of which mimics European brands . One of the most striking consequences of this simulacral economy is , as McMurray narrates , the erosion of the depth of the local .

In the first place , the absence of husbands and fathers , due to protracted work in Europe , entails a re-negotiation of dynamics of honor and shame as social diacritics of masculinity and femininity . While male migrants seek to maintain domestic authority through house construction , remittances , and unexpected telephone calls--and indeed often employ such technologies to enforce a greater degree of gender seclusion than in previous periods--their absence does provide greater space for the women and children of the household to construct wider patterns of sociality and life aspirations . Furthermore , the book shows how the increased connectivity to Europe itself created new avenues for women in public life , whether as foot smugglers of everyday goods from Melilla , or as singers ( cheikhas ) of Rifi ay-aralla-bouya ballads , often about the impact of migration on male-female dynamics , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , McMurray indicates how the increased consumerism of foreignness in Nador has commodified and commercialized a particular form of masculinity that , with Marlboro in hand , takes a condescending disinterest to local Moroccan life . <p> While these transformations in and of themselves may not be surprising to students of contemporary Morocco , what makes the book powerful and innovative is its particular melding of detailed life history accounts and interpretive ethnography with more theoretical reflections . Like the work of Crapanzano and Dwyer , the conversation between informant and anthropologist takes center place throughout the book , with the latter repeatedly underlining the subjectivity of his interpretations and refusing to make any analytic closure . The life history of Haddou , a Nadori migrant to Dusseldorf , constitutes the entirety of second chapter , and the chapter that immediately follows balances that story against six others , each representing different perspectives on the migrant experience .

For instance , in but one of many fascinating interpretive moves , McMurray employs actual and apocryphal tales of smuggling to demonstrate , via Achille Mbembe 's discussion of postcolonial aesthetics , how the " border theater " of trafficking and policing , while appearing to constitute a form of subaltern resistance , symbolically legitimates the state 's monopoly of ceremony and violence . <p> Given these thematic concerns and methodological contributions , In and Out of Morocco will be of great interest to scholars of the Middle East , gender , and globalization more generally .

Luongo ( Department of History , University of Michigan ) Published on H-Africa ( April , 2003 ) <p> Seeing Maasai <p> This book offers a complex , engaging study of development interventions among Maasai in Tanzania from the early colonial period through the mid-1990s . It historicizes development as an analytic category , as a transnational process , and as lived experience through careful attention to the workings of culture , power , and place. 1 <p> Reading ethnographic and archival sources together , Hodgson details how the interpenetrated meanings , practices , and interpretations of development and Maasai-ness have shifted over more than eighty years . The book traces what Hodgson terms the " paradox " of development among Tanzania Maasai : how nine decades of development interventions have actually limited security and opportunity ( p. 6 ) . Its theme is that the failures of development interventions reside primarily in their unchanging formulations of Maasai culture as essentially " conservative , " " pastoralist , " and gendered male. 2 <p> Hodgson 's argument is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed individually and collectively over the last eighty years , images of Maasai cultural stasis have not . Second , these images have consistently molded how administrators , non-governmental organizations , and a host of other development agents and practitioners have imagined and implemented development interventions among Maasai . Third , the invariability of these images , Hodgson argues , ( re ) produces fixed , though not especially accurate , conceptions of the " problems " of Maasai development and , in turn , a set of largely unchanging formulae to deal with them . <p> The book ably develops these arguments through a sharply theorized introduction , six chapters integrating data generated via oral and archival historical research , semi-structured interviews , a census , participant-observation , and five " Maasai Portraits , " short , life-historical vignettes based on the author 's extensive ethnographic work in the Embpong , Mti Moja , and Emairete communities . The chapters , conclusion , and epilogue are further organized and integrated around three principles : gender as a field of interaction , development as a technology of rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 addresses how gender structured the social , political , and economic worlds of pre-colonial-era Maasai . Reading a range of ethnographic and historical archival documents with more recent archaeological and linguistic data as well as with her own oral sources , Hodgson explores the organization of pastoralist production , trade systems , political power , ritual , and space to develop a coherent picture of the meaning of " being Maasai " in the 1890s. 3 The chapter does not simply provide a portrait of Maasai relations , but challenges common presumptions and contemporary discourses about the historic gendering male of Maasai power , production , and pastoralist identity . Hodgson finds ( in part through a nuanced , feminist , against-the-grain reading of early German ethnographic sources ) that Maasai women played important roles in pastoralist production , functioned as their communities ' main traders , participated in political processes , and were " central to the ritual sphere " as mediators between Maasai and their God , En'gai ( p. 32 ) . Thus , while gender was a central nexus of " social organization which distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibilities , " it did not make power the sole provenance of Maasai men during the pre-colonial period ( p. 26 ) . <p> Chapter 2 concentrates on how colonial imaginaries " shaped the practices and policies " of British colonial administration and the meanings of Maasai-ness and the ways in which these imaginaries contributed to the gendered redistribution of power and authority in Maasai communities . The gendering male of " being Maasai , " Hodgson argues , originated during the colonial encounter between British and Maasai , and was reinforced through the praxis of Indirect Rule through which colonial authorities " mapped their Victorian gender ideologies on to their understandings of , and interventions in , Maasai life " ( p. 67 ) . These ideologies presumed Maasai men to be at the center of a clearly constituted " public sphere " and to exercise political authority in this space ( p. 67 ) . Administrative policies and practices informed by British gender norms in turn facilitated the evolution of social , political , and economic realities which excluded Maasai women from spaces and roles through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political/private , etc. --built around gender spoke to a colonial project of categorization aiming to organize people socially and spatially into easily administrated entities . Ethnic identity , Hodgson argues , was a key element of colonial control. 4 Under Indirect Rule , " the British strove to consolidate and bound people into distinct categories--'tribes ' --and then place these tribes within demarcated , controllable , spaces " ( p. 49 ) . The process of categorizing ethnic identities was based both on colonial imagining about Africans and on the exigencies of administration . Imagining Maasai to be a readily identifiable race of nomadic warriors " free from the domesticating concerns of ' modern ' man " ( p. 49 ) reinforced the gendering male of Maasai-ness and helped drive colonial practices and polices to " align people , place , and rule " ( p. 51 ) . For example , Hodgson addresses how the creation of the Maasai Reserve was cast in terms of reuniting and revitalizing scattered Maasai , but was motivated by the colonial administration+s concerns with containing what they saw as the " chaos " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 52 ) . She also details how development interventions in the reserve from early water conservation initiatives to later livestock programs were couched in rhetorics of " material well-being " and " social progress , " but in fact forwarded the politico-economic agendas of the colonial state ( pp. 75-81 ) . In short , this chapter demonstrates how colonial development projects were not altruistic interventions but technologies of rule . <p> Chapters 3 and 4 further develop this theme , tracing the 1956 Maasai Development Plan ( MDP ) and development 's centrality to the newly independent nation-state . The MDP was a five-year plan whose stated goals were to clear tsetse-infested areas , expand water supplies , and test alternative forms of grazing and fodder production ( p. 101 ) . But like earlier development interventions and post-war " modernization " schemes in other British colonies like Kenya , the MDP was " deeply intertwined with colonial imperatives to order , control , and compel " progress and production ( p. 121 ) . 5 Hodgson argues that in categorizing the MDP in ethnic terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " backward , " thereby justifying broader interventions in their affairs ( p. 121 ) . Also discourse and practices surrounding the MDP perpetuated the gendering male of Maasai- ness . By focusing on the " male " pursuits of pastoralism , engaging Maasai males as authority figures , and purposefully excluding women from MDP initiatives , the plan contributed to Maasai women 's ever- increasing marginalization ( p. 118 ) . <p> Like their British predecessors , post-colonial authorities deployed development with its " modernist narrative " and " agenda of progress " as the " legitimating project " of the Tanzanian state ( p. 148 ) . However , while the colonial state organized development interventions around its imaginings of a " distinct " Maasai identity ( and vice versa ) , Maasai-ness was embarrassing to a post-colonial state aiming to implement the Ujamaa or " familyhood " brand of socialism ( pp. 149-152 ) . Development interventions like the dress code campaign and the collective villagization campaign , Hodgson argues , served both to underscore and to stifle elements of Maasai life that the state categorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Maasai men as political actors , forcing their , at least , nominal membership in TANU by " requiring that all individuals buying or selling cattle ( who were almost always men ) produce TANU membership cards " ( p. 189 ) . Such policies have in effect masculinized citizenship among Maasai while circumscribing women 's opportunities and images of themselves as political . <p> This review has focused on the production of knowledge about Maasai , perhaps at the cost of under-representing an important and well-executed theme of the book : how Maasai men and women themselves " came to interpret what it means to be Maasai in different ways " ( p. 276 ) . Maasai perspectives crescendo through the text , serving not only to enflesh narratives of development , but to problematize the image of development as " good " or " bad " ( p. 275 ) . While the last two chapters of the book are organized around nuanced , ethnographic treatment of contemporary Maasai experiences of development , Hodgson is particularly adroit in earlier chapters at working " memory " to overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to insist " it has always been this way " ( p. 9 ) . Overall , Hodgson renders a portrait of development among Maasai that shows " there is no homogeneous Maasai ' woman ' or ' man , ' rather women and men of different ages , social statuses , and so forth whose interactions , both ideal and real , vary considerably " ( p. 39 ) . <p> Hodgson 's meticulous and well-documented ethnographic and historical research make this book a valuable resource for scholars of African pastoralism and for other regional specialists , while its sharp theoretical approaches and creative methodologies render it a worthwhile read for both anthro-historians and women and gender studies specialists .

Burrow 's , The Crisis of Reason : European Thought , 1848-1914 . Beginning with Richard Wagner and Mikhail Bakunin as exemplars of the Promethean spirit of the " Generation of ' 48 , " Burrow traces a familiar story--one of hopes joyfully held only to be dashed and plunged into disillusion and darkness . Tragedy is the trope Burrow adopts , and given the great shadow of the First World War that lurks at the end of the period he canvasses , it is well chosen . Burrow 's ability to harness that trope and offer a study that ranges widely , analyzes ideas and thinkers astutely , and at the same time entertains , marks his notable achievement . <p> Burrow 's aim is to allow the reader to " eavesdrop " on past intellectual discussions , while simultaneously being faithful to the intellectuals and their ideas , controversies , and the " intellectual deadends " of the past ( p. x ) . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thematically overlapping circles " throughout the book 's six chapters ( p. x ) . As a result , Burrow successively deepens his analysis of particular thinkers and more completely relates how cultural , social , and political events shaped their thought and activity . Thus , we get a better sense of the full trajectory of individual thinkers ( e.g. Marx , Herbert Spencer , or Hippolyte Taine ) , as well as important concepts like the notion of the autonomous self . It is a structure and technique that could easily lead to confusion and opacity , but Burrow 's practiced hand keeps the reader aware of their place and progress throughout the text . <p> A particular strength of the book ( not surprising given Burrow 's past work on Darwin ) is the discussion of science and its impacts during the period . The first two chapters trace the development of materialism and the triumph of scientific method as a mechanism for inquiry into all human activities . Burrow presents a trenchant discussion of the progress of materialism , from the foundational Kraft und Stoff ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernst Mach . His vivid analysis allows the reader to experience the elation of the materialists as they appeared to slay holy superstition--only to be dogged by charges of founding their own metaphysics through the equivalence of matter and energy . One path away from dogmatic materialism was Mach 's emphasis on sensation . He sought to place knowledge on phenomenological , not metaphysical , grounds . Knowledge did not offer a royal road to the truth , but was merely an ordering of sensations into concepts that one could employ in their daily life . In Burrow 's description , " Knowledge , in the newer version , was not a self-justifying ideal , the goal of humanity in its highest manifestation , as comprehension of the world in its totality , as in the neo-Hegelian conception of Renan and Taine ; it was an organizing instrument in the struggle for life " ( p. 61 ) . <p> Ernst Haeckel and his supporters , Burrow rightly points out , presented another alternative to straight materialism . Burrow goes some way toward recognizing the importance of Haeckel and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat ghostly figure who appears and recedes throughout the text . One is left intrigued , but ultimately unsatisfied , with his treatment of such a central , but controversial figure . Nevertheless , Burrow does an excellent job of tracing the overall path of physical science in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . <p> An exemplary effort is also produced in the discussion of the life sciences . Burrow 's familiarity with Darwin and the various evolutionary schemes that led to a budding of " Darwinisms " is welcome and apparent . His discussion of classification , or taxonomy , and its importance to questions of evolution is solid . Just as probing is Burrow 's treatment of the range and importance of Herbert Spencer and his theories . Burrow demonstrates the Lamarckian underpinnings of Spencer 's entire body of work , especially his understanding of social evolution . Thanks to Lamarckian notions of adaptation , Spencer argued that individuals in a highly complex society could learn , over time , to regulate their conduct in society without perpetual recourse to a strong central government . Thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the division of labor with his desire for a classically liberal government and society . Social evolution , according to Spencer , would ultimately allow government to " wither away . " ( p. 73 ) As a counterpoint to Spencer 's use of evolutionary arguments for his social theories , Burrow offers the example of Emile Durkheim . He cogently presents Durkheim 's arguments for social integration based on the creation of a moral order . ( p. 76 ) He does so in such a clear and concise way that his explication serves to delineate not only the differences between Spencer and Durkheim , but it also underscores the many forms in which evolutionary ideas ( both Darwinian and non-Darwinian ) could appear . <p> Conceptions of the self are also a central concern of the text . In chapters four and five Burrow considers the development ( and destruction ) of the notions of the autonomous and transcendental self . His discussion is well constructed and clearly presented . His judgements are sound . For example , in his discussion of J. S. Mill and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's call for individual emancipation and the creation of an autonomous self appeared thin when one asked the simple question of " How ? " Mill relied on injunctions to develop one 's individual " character " ( p. 156 ) . But how to discover , and simultaneously mold , one 's character remained largely unexplained . <p> The transition from nineteenth-century confidence to modernist conceptions of decadence and degeneration is also nicely presented . Burrow identifies many of the leading ideas and issues that led to a modernist movement determined to shatter the tyranny of the concept . Using examples like the Futurists , Burrow contends that , " Modernism ... was concerned , as a defining characteristic , not only with disrupting the serial character of logic and narrative but with challenging the techniques of representation , verbal and visual , by which the illusion of a world of stable characters and things , governed by intention and causality , had been sustained " ( p. 240 ) . One might search long and hard before finding a more cogent , and useful , definition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burrow has produced a thorough and accessible text that is more than just a survey of the intellectual history of the period . His sources , listed in a select bibliography , are apt and used well . The illustrations are well chosen and enlightening .

One can only hope that the forthcoming volumes in the Yale Intellectual History of the West series will be as well executed . <p> Copyright 2001 by H-Net , all rights reserved .

All of the characters involved -- members of Congress , lawyers , cooperative and uncooperative witnesses in the persons of screenwriters , starlets , union officials , and left-wing professors -- are students in my survey course on Twentieth Century America . In the past we have culled the scripts from a variety of sources and the personalities and situations often from our own imaginations . Thanks to Ellen Schrecker 's excellent new book , the terrorized students in History 262 and in other U.S. History classes dealing with the issue of political repression will have a better background in the problem and better materials with which to work . <p> In addition to her award-winning No Ivory Tower : McCarthyism and the Universities ( 1986 ) , Schrecker has produced a number of important articles on anticommunism and is currently writing a general history of McCarthyism . <p> The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best short overview of post-World War II anticommunism I have found . Certainly there are more detailed and nuanced discussions , but none more suitable for teaching purposes . Schrecker begins with a very short introduction to the Communist Party , USA -- its history and changes in the party line and leadership between its foundation in 1919 and the beginning of the Cold War . ( Some membership figures over time might have helped a great deal here to gauge the nature of the threat such as it was . ) Subsequent chapters deal with the international and domestic roots of American anticommunism ; the succession of espionage cases in the late forties and early fifties ; anticommunist investigations and legislation at the federal , state , and local levels of government ; the destruction of Communist front organizations and the left-wing unions ; the problem of blacklisting in a wide range of institutions and organizations ; liberals ' struggles against McCarthyism ; and the period 's political legacy . Joe McCarthy himself plays a suitably small role in this narrative ; one chapter describes the rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communist subversion . In a rather short space , Schrecker manages to convey why it is such a mistake to equate the widespread influence and implications of anticommunism with the career of one politician . Schrecker , who is generally identified with a revisionist interpretation of communism and anticommunism , i.e. , with the notion that both were products to some degree of America 's own political history , provides an account that is both readable and balanced . <p> As with her narrative , Schrecker begins her collection of nearly fifty documents with materials reflecting the experience of the communists themselves , including excerpts from several of the interviews used for the 1984 documentary film " Seeing Red . " A portion of William Z. Foster 's 1947 book The New Europe conveys the thinking behind the party 's reversion to a more orthodox Marxism-Leninism in the wake of Earl Browder 's 1945 fall from power . Other documents include FBI reports from Freedom of Information Act files ; letters between the Ethel and Julius Rosenberg ; the Attorney General 's official list of subversive organizations ; excerpts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; testimony from Alger Hiss , Whittaker Chambers , and others before Congressional investigating committees ; the CIO resolution to expel the United Electrical , Radio , and Machine Workers of America ; and opposing contemporary interpretations of the whole situation from Sidney Hook and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas . <p> I happen to be writing this review as I read The Secret World of American Communism ( 1995 ) by Harvey Klehr ' , John Earl Haynes , and Fridrikh Igorevich Firsov , which employs documents from the former Soviet archives , text , and notes to detail the connections between individuals and groups of American communists and the Soviet espionage network . With this new book , we know much more about this particular aspect of the American communist experience which clearly served as a rationale for the political repression illustrated in Schrecker 's The Age of McCarthyism . But as Klehr ' , Haynes , and Firsov point out , most American communists had nothing to do with this espionage ; they ususally joined the party to fight against home-grown injustices or the very real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet monolith in the public mind , and many of them paid a high price for their ideals . While The Secret World of American Communism is carefully written and edited and makes no claim to represent the " true " experience of American communists , the danger , of course , is that it will be ( indeed is already being ) used to justify the political repression so well conveyed in Schrecker 's book . <p> The Age of McCarthyism 's usefulness as a teaching tool is enhanced by a glossary of terms which are keyed to bold-face words and phrases in the text ; a chronology of events ; a substantial bibliographical essay ; and more than a dozen photographs and editorial cartoons . The book will be quite useful even in a large lecture class like mine , but it will serve as a particularly invaluable discussion and research tool in smaller contemporary U.S. classes or in seminars on radicalism and political intolerance . 69401 @qwx479401

" This gloss on one of the most famous slogans of the counterculture--Timothy Leary+s " Tune in . Turn on . Drop out . " --symbolizes the paradoxical relationship between American consumer capitalism and the counterculture of the sixties . As Thomas Frank argues in this fine book , American business underwent its own cultural revolution in the sixties , a process that paralleled , and in many ways even anticipated , the broader cultural upheavals of the decade . Focusing on developments in advertising and men+s fashion , Frank complicates standard notions of hippie innocence and corporate venality to offer a complex and compelling study of the dynamic nature of capitalism and the ways it foresees , deflects , eviscerates and absorbs alternative value systems . <p> The sixties , of course , is still very much a contested decade in the national memory . For conservatives , like Robert Bork and Newt Gingrich , it symbolizes a period in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedonism . For those more sympathetic to the political and cultural changes of the period , the sixties witnessed a welcome challenge to the rigidity and repression of the gray-flannel fifties . But as Frank indicates , out of these diametrically opposite readings emerges a consensus that business represents order , stability and tradition while the counterculture represents freedom , anarchy and liberation . Thus is posited a simplistic vision of capitalism as a static entity . In fact , though , capitalism is extremely dynamic and consumer capitalism in particular demands not repression , but self fulfillment and immediate gratification . <p> Many histories of the sixties describe the relationship between business and the counterculture as a process of gradual co-optation as capitalism cynically created an ersatz version of the authentically rebellious youth movement . Abe Peck , for instance , has defined the era as " from counterculture to over-the-counter culture , " citing Columbia Records ' infamous advertising campaign , " But the Man can+t bust our music . " 1 As Frank shows , though , the story is not so one-directional . Instead , key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulating their own critique of the staid post-World War II business culture several years before the development of the counterculture . In significant ways this emergent business culture articulated the same anxieties that would motivate the counterculture : fear of conformity and alienation and , ironically , revulsion at the manipulation of consumerism . <p> Advertising in the fifties emphasized images of conformity and complacency . As articulated by such influential figures as David Ogilvy and Rosser Reeves , the philosophy of advertising aimed at a mass audience which was to be reached through constant repetition of a single , simple message . Images focused on happy families living in suburban bliss . Underlying this attitude was a fundamental lack of respect for the intelligence of the consumer . As Frank says of the fifties , " Never has advertising been so unwilling to acknowledge the myriad petty frustrations , the anger , the fear that make up so much of daily existence , consuming and otherwise . Never has it insisted so dogmatically on such an abstractly glowing vision of American life . And never has it been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mass society of the fifties , of which advertising was only one example , did not go unchallenged . A number of critics , such as David Riesman , William Whyte , John Kenneth Galbraith and Vance Packard , expressed dissatisfaction with the sterility of American culture and the manipulative nature of consumerism . And , as Frank argues , these criticisms found sympathizers within the advertising industry itself , where some were chafing at the restrictions of the dominant Ogilvy-Reeves philosophy . Fueled by people like Bill Bernbach , Howard Gossage , Jerry Della Femina and George Lois , a creative rebellion in advertising developed in the early sixties challenging the vision proferred by advertisers in the previous decade . " But the ads of the creative revolution not only differed from those of the gray flannel past , " Frank argues , " they were openly at war with their predecessors . What distinguished the advertising of the 1960s was its acknowledgement of and even sympathy with the mass society critique .... It deftly punctured advertising+s too-rosy picture of American life and openly admitted that consuming was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I ) n the sixties , advertising actively compared a new , hip consumerism to an older capitalist ideology and left the latter permanently discredited " ( p. 54 ) . The philosophy of the creative revolution stressed the consumer+s intelligence , the fact that both advertiser and consumer realized the manipulative and depersonalizing nature of mass society . Thus was created what Frank labels " hip consumerism . " Ads for Volkswagen , for example , deliberately flaunted its lack of style change as an attack on the auto industry+s policy of planned obsolescence . <p> Beginning in the early sixties , the creative revolution increasingly identified itself with youth . As Frank says , this focus only partly derived from an attempt to capture the youth market . More importantly , he argues , " youth " symbolized an attitude , a break with the old patterns of conformity , an emphasis on the new and exciting . Therefore the image of youth could be applied to a variety of products not necessarily aimed at young people . Consumers were invited to join the Pepsi Generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . " <p> Stressing youth as a form of rebellion against the conservatism of the old order , advertisers of the creative revolution viewed the counterculture that began to emerge in the second half of the decade with sympathy . They adopted many of the trappings of the counterculture : psychedelic graphics , rock music and hip fashions . And if this vision of the counterculture remained superficial and unconvincing to those actually involved in the youth culture ( as it did ) , that was all right with the advertisers because young people were not necessarily the primary intended audience . After all , they did not have to be told to " think young . " <p> A similar process also occurred in the men+s clothing industry with the " Peacock Revolution . " Men+s fashion , which had remained virtually unchanged for decades , began to change profoundly in the early sixties . As Frank says , " The garment industry threw itself headlong into revolution for reasons of its own : the counterculture merely happened along at precisely the right time with what the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right palate of looks " ( p. 186 ) . By 1967 , these tendencies had coalesced into an archetypal character , " The Rebel , " whose sartorial choices symbolized his resistance to conformity . Once again , images of youth and counterculture were used to target an audience that was neither youthful nor countercultural . <p> As Frank recognizes , in many ways this work is marked by an old-fashioned sensibility . Recent scholarship has tended to focus ( perhaps too much ) on resistance to capitalist culture industries , showing how people appropriate the messages of these institutions to serve their individual or group needs . By focusing on culture producers rather than consumers , Frank not only restores a needed emphasis on the role of power in cultural discourse , but provides a fascinating look at " the creators of mass culture , a group as playful and even as subversive in their own way as the heroic consumers who are the focus of so much of cultural studies today " ( p. x ) . <p> The development of hip consumerism , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the validity of critiques of fifties+ mass society , representatives of the advertising and fashion industries sought to speak to those who felt alienated , who craved authenticity . Industry representatives , particularly younger people dissatisfied with the bureaucratic and creative strictures on their work , articulated their own variation on the frustrations of living in a consumer society . But in this view , the solution to such problems lay in increased consumption . And , as Frank argues , in the period since the sixties , hip consumerism has become the dominant ethos for " transform(ing) alienation and despair into consent " ( p. 235 ) . <p> In Frank+s view , both defenders and detractors of the counterculture are mistaken in portraying the sixties as a period of " fundamental cultural confrontation .... ( I ) nstead ... the counterculture may be more accurately understood as a stage in the development of the values of the American middle class , a colorful installment in the twentieth century drama of consumer subjectivity " ( p. 29 ) .

It was already firmly within the value system of consumer capitalism . While this argument is not necessarily new--it has been variously made by such critics as Michael Harrington and Christopher Lasch--it serves as a useful corrective to more recent scholarship which has tended to minimize the role of power in cultural discourse . For one of the most significant forms of hegemony wielded by the dominant culture is the power to determine the nature of its own countercultures . As Peter Fonda said in Easy Rider , " We blew it .

Though trained as a butler , Hughes adapted quite well at the salt works just north of Mobile . He and his wife , Matilda , hired as a cook in the works , soon became favorites of the state Salt Commissioner , Benjamin Woolsey . Within the local slave community Hughes established a significant economic niche by selling tobacco plugs . With Woolsey 's blessing , Hughes operated his business for much of the latter period of the war and made a sizable income . But the collapse of Confederate authority in South Alabama brought this " happy interlude " to an end ( p. 28 ) .

The Hughes family continued on to Canada after reconnoitering with Matilda 's mother ; though many former slave-emigres in Canada returned to the United States following the war 's end , Hughes never felt confident that his freedom would be protected in postwar America . He would later return to the United States and settle in Milwaukee , but his movement to Canada after the war reveals an intriguing counter-migration largely ignored by historians .

Exempt from Confederate military service because of his occupation , Sam Agnew avoided some of the harrowing battlefield experiences of his fellow Confederates .

The Agnew plantation slaves did not flee or threaten the Agnew family in any way , but they " simply quit working except as it suited them " ( p. 82 ) . Like other ex-slaves in Mississippi , the Agnew 's freedmen and women negotiated sharecropping arrangements that galled the sensibilities of planters unaccustomed to bargaining with blacks . The ex-slaves worked the Agnew plantation until the end of the year and , in a symbolic reminder of the changing times , eschewed the customary " Christmas gift " offered by the paternalistic household head ; by New Year 's Day , all of Agnews ' former slaves left the plantation for places unknown . In many ways , Sam Agnew 's story is a familiar one , recounted most famously by historian James Roark in his book Masters without Slaves. 1 But Ash personalizes the sense of loss , despair and alienation among the master class with particular clarity and emotional resonance . <p> In the Upper South the Civil War and its aftermath embroiled the population in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Cornelia McDonald lost her husband , Confederate Colonel Angus McDonald , to disease shortly after he was released from a military prison in 1864 . A widow and mother of seven children , Cornelia McDonald endured the downfall of the Confederacy from the vantage point of Lexington , Virginia . Her friends in the tightly knit college town of Lexington , including the wife of General William Pendleton , helped Cornelia survive the difficult winter and spring of 1865 .

In many ways , Cornelia McDonald found her voice in protest against the imperious Union officer occupying the town . In defiance of Union authorities , but always careful to avoid rebuke , she was a " master of the cold stare , the condescending voice , the subtle insult " ( p. 159 ) .

For much of the war , the state 's Confederate government established a considerable foothold in East Tennessee despite the region 's Unionist majority .

Once the Union army established control of the east in late 1863 , Confederates like John Robertson found themselves on the run . By late 1864 Robertson surrendered to Union authorities and took the new oath of loyalty . John Robertson tried to end his war in 1864 , but ongoing guerrilla and counter-guerrilla struggle in East Tennessee continued to ensnare Robertson for another year .

If the postwar migration of African Americans from the South to the old Northwest is a largely understudied phenomena , the flight of former Confederates--especially those fleeing local Unionists--to the North , garners even less attention from historians . The irony of fleeing to the land of the former enemy did not escape John Robertson , but for him the war was as distant as the Old South .

Perhaps Ash feels that the four mini-biographies alone paint a compelling portrait of Southern life in 1865 . Certainly Ash offers a " balance of breadth and depth " by focusing on the lives of these four " ordinary " individuals ( p. xiii ) . But some discussion regarding the overall struggles common to all Southerners would have helped place each individual story in the context of larger changes in postwar Southern life .

Patterns of west African history emerged in Ghana which would recur in other states as well : long-distance trade based on gold and salt ; the king as focal point of political power ; and the relationship between traditional religions and Islam . <p> Six short chapters make up the book .

Chapter Five , " The Fall of the Empire , " relates the legend of the killing of Bida and Ghana 's subsequent misfortunes , historically made manifest in the presumed conquest of Ghana by Almoravids in the late eleventh century .

The text , however , is marred at times by historical anachronisms or exaggerations . For example , the Almoravid conquest of Ghana is assumed without question . However , current scholarship on west Africa has sharply challenged this ( cf. David C. Conrad and Humphrey J. Fisher , " The Conquest that Never Was : Ghana and the Almoravids , 1076 , " History in Africa 9 1982 , pp. 21-59 and 10 1983 , pp. 53-78 ) . When writing of discoveries at Kumbi Saleh , Green concludes that " during the Middle Ages--when most of the people of Europe suffered disease , fear , ignorance , and oppression--the Soninke people of the Empire of Ghana enjoyed a world that was rich in culture and famous as a center of learning " ( pp. 48-49 ) .

The map at the beginning of the book is clear enough , but could have easily illustrated more of the geographical features discussed in the text ( e.g. , gold and salt producing regions ) .

The high-quality photographs alone do much to give the reader an impression of Sudanic history and culture .

Kiernan has made an immense contribution to the field of genocide studies--and to fields ranging beyond it . The result of extensive research and deep reflection , it challenges scholars of genocide with its bold theses ; delivers a laudably inclusive inventory of genocidal violence spanning many centuries ; and represents a powerful example of a well-synthesized world history , one that will be highly valuable for scholarly as well as non-academic audiences . <p> Rather than simply subjecting his readers to an oppressive account of human slaughter--although inevitably the book does this as well--Blood and Soil offers an original analysis , uniting these dreadful episodes from antiquity to the present . Kiernan argues that a convergence of four factors underpins the causes of genocide through the ages : racism , which " becomes genocidal when perpetrators imagine a world without certain kinds of people in it " ( p. 23 ) ; cults of antiquity , usually connected to an urgent need to arrest a " perceived decline " accompanying a " preoccupation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cults of cultivation or agriculture , which among other things legitimize conquest , as the aggressors " claim a unique capacity to put conquered lands into productive use " ( p. 29 ) ; and expansionism . Kiernan has developed and enriched this theory over the course of several books and articles . In the influential The Specter of Genocide ( 2003 ) , co-edited with Robert Gellately , Kiernan concluded his own essay by arguing in a more tentative fashion for the combustible potential of these elements : " As in the Armenian Genocide , the Holocaust , Cambodia , Bosnia , and Rwanda , the tragedy of East Timor demonstrates the virulent , violent mix of racism , religious prejudice , expansionism , and idealization of cultivation . Each of these factors is , of course , often a relatively harmless component of nationalist ideology . Taken singly , none is a sufficient condition even for mass murder . But their deadly combination is a persistent feature of twentieth-century genocide. " 1 <p> In Blood and Soil , Kiernan places obsessions with antiquity and agriculture more prominently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , genocidal violence was " reinforced by cults of antiquity and agriculture " ; in several cases from early modern Southeast Asia , expansionism in combination with cults of antiquity and agriculture provided " an intellectual backdrop to mass killing " ; in other examples , " settler preoccupations with antiquity and agriculture " contributed to genocidal outbursts ( p. 168 ) . It is not always readily apparent how or why these factors--in particular , obsessions with agriculture and antiquity--produce genocidal violence , but the author is modest enough to acknowledge that those factors " often accompanied genocide but can not fully explain it " ( p. 168 ) . <p> Occasionally , the analytic reader may question these categories . For instance , confidence in the book 's chief thesis may be undermined by the caveat , made in the introduction , that " catastrophes lacking more than one of the major features of genocide ... identified " were " excluded " from this study ( p. 38 ) . And Kiernan sometimes stretches to incorporate the agrarian and antiquity themes , as when seizing upon the utterances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by individuals in the service of violent regimes . In a 2001 article on the Cambodian genocide , Kiernan pointed to another genocidal dynamic--the " twin peaks " of " national ambition and national insecurity " --that could have been a stronger impetus in some of the episodes chronicled in Blood and Soil than the convergence of the four factors the book stresses. 2 Kiernan occasionally invokes but does not develop this theme of ambition alongside insecurity in Blood and Soil . ( In relation to Bosnia , for example , Kiernan quotes Norman Cigar in arguing that Serb nationalists ' " dualistic self-view of superiority and accompanying vulnerability bordering on paranoia " fueled the genocide p. 588 ) . <p> Nonetheless , Blood and Soil 's patient accumulation of detail and evidence should win over readers who may initially be skeptical of its principal arguments . While Kiernan 's thesis is probably more easily adaptable to ancient , medieval , and early modern genocides than to those of more recent times , Blood and Soil amply demonstrates the murderous potential of this combination of ideological forces in atrocities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslavia . The author also skillfully applies his theory to certain heavily researched topics , such as Nazism 's ideological origins and precursors . " Land and race were linked , " Kiernan avers , in the ideology and movements of the late nineteenth century that saw the German peasantry as the " true embodiment of the Volk " and that fused romantic agrarianism with other strains of conservative and nationalist thought ( p. 378 ) . <p> In addition to its bold effort at unifying disparate historical events , Kiernan 's book is distinctive in other fundamental ways . In contrast to other major overviews of genocide , two-thirds of Blood and Soil is devoted to mass killings that predate 1900 . More than two hundred pages--all of part 2 of the three-part book--are devoted to " Settler Colonialism , " chronicling atrocities that accompanied land-grabs and ethnic cleansing in Ireland , colonial North America , Australia , the United States , and nineteenth-century Africa . The section on Africa begins with the French efforts to conquer , pacify , and settle Algeria between 1830 and 1875 , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second section is in some ways Blood and Soil 's strongest , a powerful complement to the recent work of A. Dirk Moses , among others , that links not simply colonialism , but also settler colonialism and imperialist occupation , to racism and genocidal violence . And , as Kiernan reminds us , some of the victims of the Europeans ' colonial depredations acted with relative magnanimity : Herero chief Samuel Maharero 's order " to spare women , children , other Africans , and non-German whites " certainly stands in sharp contrast to General Lothar von Trotha 's infamous " extermination order , " as well as the bellowing of German newspapers that " no war may be conducted humanely against nonhumans " ( p. 382 ) . <p> It is no longer easy to be surprised by the capacity of humans to commit cruel , depraved crimes against one another . As Yehuda Bauer wrote , " The horror of the Holocaust is not that it deviated from human norms ; the horror is that it didn't. " 4 Nonetheless , numerous startling revelations leap from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps alone among genocidal perpetrators , the Khmer Rouge prolonged its murderous activities long beyond the end of its reign , sporadically massacring Vietnamese who were unfortunate enough to fall into its hands as late as the 1990s ( p. 554 ) . Kiernan also introduces or re-introduces readers to certain grisly figures who deserve a more prominent place in history 's gallery of depraved killers : the sixteenth-century Japanese feudal lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi , for instance , whose efforts at expansion and unification entailed the murder of tens of thousands of Koreans , and , more obscurely , the following century 's pitiless Javanese ruler Amangjurat I , whose victims included numerous close family members and associates . <p> A trailblazing work such as this one should not only posit original ideas but also elicit questions . Among the issues that Blood and Soil prompts further reflection upon : How small can a targeted group be for us to classify its extinction or near-extinction as a genocide ? 5 The destruction of the Pequots , who declined from about four thousand in 1647 to approximately five hundred a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resulted from a calculated policy of the English authorities . Kiernan also offers an incisive account of the genocide of the Tasmanian people , whose numbers were nearly identical to those of the Pequots two centuries earlier . Modern-day students of genocide can be inured , in a sense , by the massive scale of the Holocaust . But Kiernan implicitly suggests that , although the Pequots ' and Tasmanians ' numbers were relatively small , their cruel fates should indeed be included in a litany of genocidal crimes . <p> A slow-motion genocide , such as that of North America 's indigenous peoples , also presents a challenge to scholars . Kiernan reports that the native population " north of the Rio Grande " declined from roughly 7,000,000 to 600,000 in the three centuries following the arrival of the Europeans in 1492 ( p. 219 ) . Little question would remain that such a catastrophic decline , had it occurred over the course of only a few years , would qualify it as " genocide . " The great expanse of time involved , the multiple shifts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diversity of experience of the many dozens of Native American nations have contributed to the controversy over how to characterize the tragedy of North America 's indigenous peoples . For his part , Kiernan--who is admirably flexible and undogmatic in his use of the terms " genocide , " " genocidal acts , " and " genocidal violence " --has no qualms about including this long , complex story in two of the book 's finest and best-researched chapters . <p> Another question for genocide scholars to consider : Should we regard the issue of intent with greater wariness and circumspection ? 6 At times , the perpetrators made it easy to assign genocidal intent : " Kill Koreans one by one , and empty the country , " commanded Hideyoshi in 1597 ( p. 129 ) . But it is often not so simple to determine intent , and perhaps when mass suffering and death results from criminal indifference , or could have been easily predicted by a conquering or occupying power , that power is no less guilty of genocide , if other elements of the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book and appears elsewhere ; as Kiernan notes , the International Law Commission ( established by the UN in 1948 at the time of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ) holds that " a general awareness of the probable consequences " of destructive acts " is not sufficient " ( p. 17 ) . This may be one of the elements of the classic definitions of " genocide " --along with the exclusion of political groups in the 1948 definition--that is overly legalistic and in need of revision. 7 <p> One additional area of further investigation that is suggested by Blood and Soil : the similarity of the cults of violence of certain presumably " left-wing " regimes ( such as the Khmer Rouge ) to fascist cults of violence . The lyrics of Khmer Rouge anthems that Kiernan quotes are highly reminiscent of the quasi-religious glorification of violence and martyrdom of the Iron Guard , the Arrow Cross , and other European fascist movements of the interwar and World War II era . These lines from the Khmer Rouge 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for readers less familiar with the Cambodian example : " Glittering red blood blankets the earth--blood given up to liberate the people " ; the even less elegant " Rainfall in Pisakh " includes the lines , " our anger shoots out at the imperialists ... and their reactionary lackeys , killing them until they disappear " ( p. 548 ) . <p> While the chapter Kiernan devotes to China has a somewhat rushed quality , it skillfully incorporates Maoist China into the continuities traced in this book . " Even if half the population of the world were wiped out this would not be a total disaster , " opined the Great Helmsman ( pp. 530-531 ) . Such utterances were not uncommon from Mao , who offered to sacrifice unbelievable numbers of his own population to support world revolution . It would be illuminating to explore the ways in which Mao and others developed , nurtured , and then inculcated such a nihilistic disregard for human life . As to whether the label of " genocide " should be applied to the horrors of Maoist China , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao , and simply designate his rule as " the worst non-genocidal regime , " in Jean-Louis Margolin 's astute and precise phrase--which is sufficient to place it where it belongs in history. 8 At any rate , Kiernan 's specialization in Asian studies is evident not only in his examinations of twentieth-century Cambodia , China , and Japan , but also in his chapters on late medieval and early modern East Asia--episodes that are rarely if ever discussed in other large-scale overviews of genocide . Yet geographically the book is well balanced , and few Europeanists venture as far outside their " comfort zones " as Kiernan does here . <p> Ultimately , any of the book 's weaknesses result from its admirable ambition and breadth , and are heavily outweighed by its substantial contributions and strengths . Blood and Soil is unsurpassed among works of this nature in examining and uncovering the ideological and philosophical , as well as cultural and political , underpinnings of genocide . However reticent some scholars may be to accept the book 's thesis concerning the role of cults of antiquity and agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold , richly suggestive theory , which is already exerting a strong influence within the ever-expanding field of genocide studies . <p> 3 . While this is entirely consistent with current Holocaust scholarship , it might be time to reconsider the emphasis we place on the " industrialization " of the Holocaust as a distinguishing characteristic . See Donald Bloxham and Tony Kushner , The Holocaust : Critical Historical Approaches ( Manchester : Manchester University Press ) , 68-70 . <p> 5 . See Adam Jones , Genocide : A Comprehensive Introduction ( New York : Routledge , 2006 ) , for a brief but illuminating discussion of this issue . As Jones points out , " We readily use ' war ' to designate " both small-scale wars , such as the so-called Soccer War of 1969 between Honduras and El Salvador , " as well as epochal descents into barbarity " such as World War II .

It will also examine problems inherent in interpreting personal testimony based on memories of events that occurred several decades in the past . <p> Esteban Mesa Montejo discussed his past with the Cuban ethnologist Miguel Barnet in taped interviews carried out in 1963 . At the age of 103 , most likely Esteban Montejo understood that he was the sole living runaway slave on the island and that his words and memories might be considered important enough to be published . For that reason , he delved into topics of particular interest to himself and to the interviewer Barnet . These included forms of African religious expression and Montejo 's recollections of life as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba . The book includes what appear to be actual quotes from Montejo along with sentences and paragraphs shaped by Barnet to provide a readable account of the life of a black man in Cuba during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century . <p> Born in 1860 as a slave , Esteban Montejo witnessed some of the most turbulent moments in all of Latin American history . With the end of sugar production on the Caribbean island of St. Domingue as a result of the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , Cuba became a major exporter of sugar from its plantations in the decades before Montejo 's birth . To satisfy an insatiable demand for inexpensive labor , planters and merchants transported thousands of African slaves to Cuba from the 1780s to the 1860s , among them Montejo 's parents . Given the presence of so many recently arrived Africans in his midst , Montejo had an extraordinary opportunity to witness African cultural expression and various forms of resistance to the slave regime .

The narrative includes Montejo 's remembrances of the War for Independence ( 1895-1898 ) , better known as the Spanish-Cuban-American War . The subsequent presence of United States troops as an army of occupation ( 1898-1902 ) deeply influenced Montejo 's worldview . The book ends in 1905 with the death of the Cuban general Maximo Gomez . <p> The narrative is divided into three sections . In the first section entitled " Slavery , " Montejo offers some of his most poignant and insightful commentary . He believes that " nature is everything . Even what you ca n't see " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 17 ; Aching , pp. 35-41 ) . In a tropical environment where sickness and painful insect bites were common , Montejo delights in recalling the manner in which Africans used natural herbs and potions for healing . Black women and men from various African nations resided on the sugar plantations , including Musungo Congos , Mandingos , Gangas , Lucumis and Carabalis . Montejo comments on the games played by Africans , sugar refining in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and religious practices . He rejects the myth that Africans committed suicide by hanging or drowning themselves , but argues instead that they flew back to their homeland with a religious object ( known as a prenda ) tied to their waist . Slaves loved music , particularly the use of the drum . Montejo laments that the " white man 's music had no drum at all . Tasteless " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 33 ) . Montejo depicts the Africans with whom he lived as people of great physical beauty , compassion , and sensuality . He also presents clear evidence of the brutal treatment inflicted on these African slaves by masters and overseers . Planters often locked their slaves in stocks for two or three months for minor offenses , and whipping was common . " The barracoon slave quarters was bare dirt , empty , and lonely " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 24 ) . Slaves rose at 4:30 a.m. and then worked from 6:00 a.m. until sunset cutting sugar cane and working in the mill . <p> In a chapter entitled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to escape . After throwing a rock that hit the head of the overseer , he ran from the fields into nearby wooded hills . Similar to the escaped slave Sethe in Toni Morrison 's novel Beloved , Montejo lived in constant fear of capture . Unlike the majority of fugitive slaves in the United States who fled from masters in the American South with a destination in mind ( the American North or West ) , Montejo preferred to remain alone in the thick forests of Cuba . For several years , he communicated with no one . Whenever he heard dogs barking , he immediately took off his clothes to prevent the animals from picking up his scent . Montejo lived in a cave for many months , and was always careful about the sounds he made and the fires he built . When possible , he stole pigs and food crops from small farms . He allowed his hair to grow long into a kinka ( most likely meaning dread locks ) . " You live half wild when you 're a cimarron .... My legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good being a cimarron . Because I was my own boss , and I defended myself on my own " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 52 ) . Upon learning that slavery had been abolished , Montejo ended his life of seclusion and began to search for employment at the sugar plantations . <p> The title of the second section is " The Abolition of Slavery . " A better title might be " The Aftermath of Slavery , " given that the chapter covers the decade following final emancipation in 1886 . Montejo labored as a free worker at the Purio and Ariosa central sugar mills during these years . He endured long days cutting sugar , clearing fields , and maintaining the machinery of the mills . His cynicism about race relations and treatment of the workers is evident from the outset . " There were masters , or rather , owners , who believed that blacks were made for locking up and whipping . So they treated them the same as before . To my mind blacks did n't realize that things had changed with emancipation because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... The white man believed they were the owners of humanity " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 62 ) . Montejo criticized the lack of education provided for black and mulatto children , and the fact that competent blacks were barred from entering elite professions . Reserving some of his most scathing criticism for the Catholic hierarchy , Montejo claimed that " with women they priests were devils . They converted the sacristy into a whorehouse .... The priests put women in caves , in holes in the ground where they had executioners ready to kill them " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 80 ) . Other topics of great interest that he touches on include the use of identity cards and passbooks to control the movement of workers , the harsh daily life of peasant women , modernization of the mills ( he observes that " progress is amazing " ) and increasing deforestation of the Cuban countryside . <p> In a wide-ranging discussion , Montejo provides a wealth of information about social life in late-nineteenth-century Cuba .

The religious holiday of San Juan , celebrated each year on the 24th of June , included festive parties attended by overdressed men and women of the elite , cock fights , horse racing and card playing , along with dances known as the mani , the jota , the zapateo and the tumbandera . Houses of Santeria , where " only black people went " to practice their African religion , also hosted parties during the feast of San Juan . Instead of following Catholic rituals , however , the participants paid homage to the Yoruba god of iron , farmers and war known as Oggun . Clearly , Montejo is very interested in the African contributions to Cuban culture . " I come to the conclusion that the African was wise in all things .

Montejo alludes to the presence and contributions of Chinese , Canary Islanders , Filipinos ( all of whom had been brought to Cuba by planters as a cheap indentured labor force in the nineteenth century ) , gypsies , and creoles . He remembers with emotion a strong sense of sharing and community which flourished among the compesinos in the countryside . <p> In a third section entitled " The War of Independence , " Montejo comments upon his experiences during the fighting against Spain , which lasted from 1895 to 1898 . Cuban guerrilla tactics and the use of the machete to cut off the heads of their enemy instilled terror among young Spanish troops . Cuban soldiers became known as Mambises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mambises fought heroically throughout the war , and Montejo attributes the victory over Spain to their actions . " The conduct of our troops was a model for others , as anyone will tell you who fought in the war ... we were brave and put the revolution above everything else .... Even so , many colonels and other officers shit off-target every day . They did things that not even little children do " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 183 ) . Cubans paid a terrible price for victory ; a tenth of its population died and two-thirds of the wealth of the island was destroyed ( Langley , pp. 13-14 ) . Montejo condemned propaganda tht minimized the role of black soldiers in the war . He claimed that 95 percent of blacks had fought , but their involvement and sacrifices did not prevent them from being " left out in the street " after the hostilities ceased . <p> United States troops landed on Cuba in 1898 during the final weeks of the war . In the words of one historian , " in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandalously provisioned , and ravaged by tropical disease--swiftly defeated a demoralized , dispirited Spanish army and snatched the fruits of victory from the mambises , the Cuban guerrilla fighters who had fought gallantly in a struggle of three years ' duration " ( Keen , p. 414 ) . During the occupation that followed , American troops brutalized the Cuban populace . Montejo claims that many United States soldiers abused Cuban women and called blacks " nigger , nigger . " Yet , it is interesting to note that he also recalls that " the Americans were the only ones to put a stop to the pimps , " and that " the white Cubans were as much to blame as the Americans for the poverty and social inequalities because they let themselves be ordered around in their own country " ( Barnet 1994 , pp. 193-94 ) . Memories among Cubans of two occupations and an intervention ( 1898-1902 , 1906-9 , 1912 ) by the United States endured . <p> In an afterword to the narrative entitled " The Alchemy of Memory , " Miguel Barnet offers his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He emphasizes the responsibility of the writer to interpret the ideas and words of marginalized persons and the underclass . This is accomplished through effective oral communication and close consideration of how best to write about the " true identity " of the common people . " The function of the testimonial novel sic as rescuer of a foundational language , as a rescuer of the old historical novel sic , should be to give back the original sound of storytelling to the contemporary novel . It should be interpreted as the burgeoning of a new cultural language , in battle with real deceit that is propped up by long-standing cliches " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 204 ) . Certainly Barnet 's suggestions have been heeded . Some of the most insightful social commentary and historical analyis emanating from Latin America in the past three decades has appeared in the form of testimonial literature ( see for example I , Rigoberta Menchu : An Indian Woman in Guatemala and Maria Teresa Tula , Hear My Testimony : Human Rights Activist of El Salvador ) . Yet , the appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlook complex questions that arise when judging the Biography of a Runaway Slave as a historical source . <p> With regard to Esteban Montejo , the reader encounters difficulties gleaning clear information about many aspects of his life . How long was he a fugitive ? Did he in fact end his life as a cimarron in 1886 when slavery officially ended ? If this date is correct , Montejo would have been twenty-six years old , and not twenty , as he estimated in his testimony . He provides stimulating details about a rich culture shared by enslaved Africans . Yet , it is most likely that he learned about African culture after emancipation , and then worked backward in the taped interviews to portray such cultural practices as common at an earlier juncture . Such an approach can easily distort analysis of actual conditions and the true historical record . Montejo portrays himself as a rebel during his first forty-five years of life , yet he never entered a quilombo ( escaped slave community ) or joined with other fugitive slaves to steal from plantations . One wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to the present circumstances he encountered in post-revolutionary Cuba of 1963 . Montejo notes on the last page of the book that " If I could , I would tell the whole story , all of it " ( Barnet 1994 , p. 200 ) . What is he alluding to ? Perhaps his unhappiness with continued racial discrimination in a revolutionary Cuba whose leadership claimed that such practices had ended ? Or is this actually Miguel Barnet speaking about censorship that he had endured as a writer ? The result , in the words of William Luis , is that " the narration can not be conceived as a chronicle with a historical development but as a fictional discourse which breaks with history and is subject to the strategies of memory " ( Luis , p. 205 ) . <p> Questions also emerge regarding Miguel Barnet 's role in writing this testimony . As the transcriber and editor , he played a critical role in determining which topics would be addressed in the discussions and what ultimately appeared in print in the book . He changed words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed would be most readable and most true to what Montejo wished to say . But we also need to consider that Barnet determined which events would be included for personal political reasons . Barnet had been part of a group of poets known as El Puente , named after a private publisher of that name which existed between 1960 and 1965 . The revolutionary government claimed that members of the group were homosexuals and antisocial , and subsequently repressed or marginalized its members . Therefore , Barnet was seeking to reestablish his credentials as an acceptable writer in the new literary establishment of Cuba of the early 1960s . It was at this juncture that he read in a newspaper that Esteban Montejo was alive and well . Barnet most likely decided ( wisely ) to devote the bulk of the book to slavery , the Ten Years ' War and the Independence War because such themes would not raise a controversy . Each episode had been directly affected by foreign intervention , and therefore appealed to a regime seeking to demonstrate that it had fulfilled the revolutionary aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends in 1905 . Esteban lived through the 1912 Race War in which thousands of African-Cubans were slaughtered by other Cubans . Why does Barnet not include such an important episode when we know that Montejo expressed strong opinions about this violent event in the taped interviews ? Perhaps Barnet understood that an analysis of the Race War , one in which foreigners played virtually no role , would not be acceptable to the Cuban revolutionary government ( Luis , pp. 199-218 ) . The book received immediate international acclaim , and Barnet quickly regained political and literary stature in Cuba . <p> The Curbstone revised edition of 1994 is translated by W. Nick Hill . Mr. Hill makes some mistakes in his preface . I know of no first edition of Biografia de un cimarron dated in 1966 . Rather I believe the first Spanish edition appeared in 1968 , published in Barcelona by Ediciones Ariel . The first English translation of the book , entitled The Autobiography of a Runaway Slave , was not published in the United States in 1968 , but rather in London in 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " last country to overcome this affront slavery to the human condition in the Americas " ( Barnet , p. 13 ) . Rather , that distinction falls on the nation of Brazil , which officially ended slavery on 13 May 1888 after flourishing for more than three centuries . In spite of these errors , W. Nick Hill has provided readers with a solid translation of this testimonial narrative . It is a book that can be used with great success among advanced high school students and at the college and university level . Most students who participate in my " Comparative Slavery and Emancipation in the Atlantic World " seminar at Idaho cherish this book as much as I do . After reading the Biography of a Runaway Slave , one does not quickly forget about the extraordinary life of Esteban Montejo or the power of words , spoken or written . <p> Note : I would like to thank James W.

That curious idea has become less fashionable recently , but one group of the revisionists ' successors continues to insist that it 's to the inner workings of the royal Court rather than to Parliament or the " country " that we should turn if we want to understand Stuart politics . Alastair Bellany 's splendid new book on the Overbury affair and its many public representations suggests that the Court historians may be right--though not , I suspect , in quite the way that they have intended . <p> Sir Thomas Overbury was the mid-level courtier whose murder in the Tower in 1613 led to the downfall of James I 's favorite , Robert Carr , when the crime was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensable assistant in the young man 's transformation from handsome royal bedfellow to apparently serious statesman ; he read the foreign dispatches for him , drafted the letters , and did much of the hard work that his patron was either disinclined to do , or incapable of doing . But he made the mistake of opposing Carr 's marriage to the glamorous Frances Howard , daughter of the Earl of Suffolk , an alliance that would cement his ties with the powerful , pro-Spanish , Howard clan . The problem was that Frances was already married , to the Earl of Essex , and that she took an implacable dislike to the censorious Overbury . So while the proceedings leading to the annulment of her marriage went forward ( Essex had to be humiliated by proving that he was impotent ) , Overbury was maneuvered into disobeying a royal order to accept a diplomatic appointment and put in the Tower . There he was poisoned by people employed by Frances , possibly with the knowledge of the Earl of Somerset , as Carr had now become . Three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perhaps the most lavishly extravagant of Jacobean court weddings , celebrated in masques and verses by some of the greatest literary luminaries of the age : Jonson , Campion , Chapman , Donne . <p> In 1615 it all came out , and there ensued a series of sensational public trials culminating in those of the disgraced Somerset and his Countess . Several of the lesser participants were duly hanged , but as one of them had feared , James I and his judges made " a net to catch the little fishes and let the great ones go " ( p. 233 ) . The Earl and Countess were indeed found guilty of murder , but were pardoned by the King and allowed to live out their lives in secluded disgrace . Scholars have generally accepted their guilt , though in 1993 David Lindley , in The Trials of Frances Howard , argued that the lady 's offence lay as much in her representation as the stereotypical sexually independent woman so much feared by contemporaries as in whatever had been proved against her on unassailable evidence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice , Sir Edward Coke , and the Attorney-General , Sir Francis Bacon , certainly contained all the ingredients of the most melodramatic Jacobean tragedy : poison , sorcery ( Frances consulted the magician Simon Forman on how to make Essex impotent ) , the promotion of provocative and unfeminine styles of clothing , and worst of all suspicions of Catholicism . The trials brought before the public a sordid picture of court immorality and disorder . <p> The affair has attracted plenty of attention from that day to this , but it has generally been marginalized by political historians , who have tended to see it as simply a seventeenth-century version of our own supermarket tabloid sensationalism . It was , Bellany shows , much more than that . He is perhaps a bit too lenient towards Carr , and towards Frances Howard 's great uncle , the powerful Earl of Northampton , who undoubtedly knew more about the murder than would have been good for him if he had not himself conveniently died in 1614 . But the guilt or innocence of the Somersets and their Howard relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in is the deployment of the scandal in political discourse , and his purpose is to use it to interrogate important aspects of early Stuart political culture . This requires him to explore the complicated court intrigues which led to Carr 's replacement as royal favorite by George Villiers , the future Duke of Buckingham , and this he does with great skill . He also surveys the mechanisms--the authorized accounts of trials , the unauthorized narratives in newsletters and less professional correspondence , the scandalous verse libels that circulated so widely in both oral and written form--by which reports of the affair were transmitted from the Court to a large and socially diverse audience . The Overbury scandal became so important because a voracious public appetite for news already existed both in London and the provinces . <p> Thomas Cogswell , Richard Cust , and other historians have taught us a good deal about the circulation of political news in Jacobean England , and Bellany 's case-study confirms their findings . But even to those familiar with the general contours of the " news culture " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come as something of an eye-opener . Among much else Bellany provides the clearest and most intelligible account that we yet have of the " powder poison plot " about which Coke kept dropping dark hints during the trials . <p> Carefully combing through a wide variety of sources , he clarifies the paranoid suspicions that the tragically early death of Prince Henry , James 's Protestant and staunchly anti-Spanish heir , had been the result of a sinister Catholic conspiracy in which Robert Carr was himself involved ; that Overbury knew enough about this for the conspirators to have to dispose of him ; and that their intention was to go further and poison James and his Queen and enable the Catholics to seize power during the resulting confusion , thus achieving by poison what Guy Fawkes had failed to do by gunpowder . Unfortunately for James there later emerged some carefully coded suspicions that he himself knew something about his son 's murder ; on this , Bellany might have made more of Sir Anthony Weldon 's story about the King 's panic when he thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was writing thirty years later , but he had been in the Court at the time , and got the story from the Lieutenant of the Tower , Sir George More , who was in a good position to know . At all events , the fact was that the popish plot was spawned within the Court , not outside it as in 1605 , and James 's subsequent pardon of Somerset made it hard to present the episode as a repeat performance of the earlier one in which a virtuously Protestant King providentially escapes from being poisoned by evil Catholics . Instead it presented that " image of a popishly corrupted royal court " which eventually played such an important role in the undermining of the Stuart monarchy ( p. 210 ) . <p> Bellany sometimes piles on more details of court intrigue and foreign policy than the non-specialist will find easily digestible , but his story is dramatic enough to compensate for this . One useful part of his book is its engagement with the now-familiar gender implications of court politics . Like Lindley , Bellany shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public discussions of the scandal to typify the conventional image of the sexually-emancipated disorderly woman whose independence and moral libertinism threatened the basis of the patriarchal system . Frances and her confidante Mrs. Turner also provided sensational examples of the way in which sorcery and witchcraft were continually stalking the land , and their promotion of the famous yellow ruffs and other foreign fashions undermined the submissive modesty expected of virtuous English ladies . Bellany rightly connects the affair with the debate over gender roles that became so acrimonious a few years later , a debate which was indeed partly triggered by the Overbury affair , in the misogynist tirades of such authors as Thomas Tuke and Joseph Swetnam . The associations between unruly women , popery , poison , and witchcraft lived on in Protesant paranoia for years to come , as the work of Frances Dolan ( regrettably absent from the book 's bibliography ) has also recently reminded us . James himself , as Bellany notes , was alleged to have been poisoned by Buckingham in a conspiracy in which the Duke 's Catholic mother played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for too long regarded as ridiculous and as having affected only the stupid and credulous . In recent years it has become harder to dismiss it in this way ; after Bellany 's book it will be impossible to do so . <p> In the short-term history of factional court politics , the scandal hastened the downfall of one royal favorite ( Carr ) and the establishment of another ( Villiers ) . But it did not lead , as for a time in the autumn of 1615 seemed possible , to a major shift in James I 's policies towards the anti-Catholic , anti-Spanish stance advocated by the Earl of Pembroke and the " patriot " group which had hailed Carr 's disgrace . More important was its long-term contribution to enduring beliefs in James I 's tolerance of court corruption , moral disorder , and popery . <p> James 's successor cleaned up the immorality , but in other ways Charles I 's court presented ( rightly or wrongly ) the same impression of popish influence which he inherited from his father . The groundwork for this had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal left in the political memory . Bellany 's rich and perceptive analysis of the Overbury story 's survival in the plays , pamphlets , and libels is thus a major contribution to our understanding of the Stuart period . It will also surely be of interest to a wider circle of historians studying the relationship between high politics and public opinion . Let us hope that Cambridge will soon bring out a paperback edition that ordinary readers can afford .

The female students adopt her as a figure of empowerment , to the extent that one of them took Joan as a confirmation name . The male students lean more towards film depictions , most recently with Leelee Sobieski and Mila Jovanovich . Then after losing interest in the novelty of a medieval woman in men 's clothing , the discussion heads for the obvious question--so , how did she do ? Excellent biographical works of Joan of Arc address her role as a saint , national hero , a commoner amongst the French nobles , and proto-feminist , but none of them address why Joan , in a single year , reversed the course of the Hundred Years ' War . <p> Leading a late-medieval army was no simple task and the problems were numerous : recruitment and retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; supplying and moving a force across rough country and bad or non-existent roads ; dealing with century-old aristocratic disputes that complicated borders ; and command and strategy . Add to this the dismal morale of the 1420s , after the successes of Henry V of England , and the French situation looked a morass of continued defeatism and chaos . Introduce to this one teenage girl , bearing a message from God and a chorus of saints . <p> DeVries , whose previous work shows a mastery of medieval military techniques and events , tries to unravel Joan 's effectiveness as a military leader . Using all extant accounts of her campaigns , he pulls together a compelling picture of a gifted natural soldier , who took advantage of France 's remaining assets to defeat the English ( who had weaknesses of their own to be exploited ) . Was this a miracle ? Not in the context presented here , which may lessen the glamour attached by students , but adds to the understanding of the Joan phenomenon . Although nobles were trained to lead armies , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective of the commoners was one of their own who possessed sense and held out a chance of keeping them alive ; nobles knew they would be ransomed from captivity . This made it possible for Joan to gain command , and through early successes , to keep it . These commoner leaders did not need years of sword training , jousting experience , or knightly etiquette to judge a battlefield . Indeed , Joan 's peasant background ( of wealthy , not indigent , peasants ) may have made her more flexible toward adopting gunpowder artillery as well as more willing to use unconventional tactics . <p> This work is refreshing in that , after a brief nod to Joan 's vetting by the court as a theologically sound virgin ( neither of which was a great recommendation as a medieval military leader ) , DeVries does not dwell on her gender , just her leadership . Interestingly , she seems to have had the extraordinary effect on her troops of not just defusing their lust toward her but , as Jean the Bastard of Orleans noted , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrating the context for a number of the actions that have categorized Joan as feminine , or ( in the World History textbook ) spiritually important but militarily marginal , DeVries makes the case that Joan 's concern for dying English soldiers , crying at her victories , preventing looting , and issuing warnings to garrisons about to be besieged were not signs of weakness . It was important to Joan that the rules of " just war " be followed . Moreover , her emotions could be seen in male noble commanders and functioned as part of their concern for client soldiers and the French territory they were there to liberate . <p> DeVries explains that Joan 's strengths were in lending the army confidence though her total belief in their mission ( messages from God should not be scoffed at given their importance to contemporary societies , for example , Shi'ites in Iraq ) , which allowed them to move quickly and engage in frontal assaults on fortified positions . She brought out the best in her subordinates , brought out pockets of French support against the thinly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Burgundian enemies , and had the strategic vision to insist that the English be chased out of the Loire to the Battle of Patay , rather than be allowed to escape and regroup . For an amateur , her grasp of siege tactics , artillery , and terrain were exceptional . Instead of making generalized claims , DeVries solidly backs these observations with primary documentation that show her contemporaries agreed . <p> The end of Joan 's story is familiar to military historians of any era . After her victories , Joan was no longer politically or religiously convenient to the French court , whose petty feuds and questionable loyalties Joan had criticized and tried to reform . Additionally , there is the tantalizing suggestion that Joan might have considered ranging outside of France , presented in a letter threatening that she would engage the Hussite rebels in Bohemia . Imagine a Joan not tied to France , but instead acting as the avenging angel of the pope ; this was not impossible , since most of Europe remembered the actions of Matilda of Tuscany in the Investiture Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to fruitless military theaters and denied the crucial opportunity to rebound from small defeats , as the court refused her key logistical support . DeVries does not dwell on the trial and execution , or Joan 's post-mortem career as a saint and national symbol , but he carefully debunks popular myths concerning Joan , including the theory that she was an illegitimate child of the Duke of Orleans . <p> The book is beautifully produced , with glossy color plates of medieval illustrations , clearly drawn maps , and photographs that allow a visualization of the challenges she confronted . Only a few small points detract from the work . The genealogy tables in the appendix leave out many of the women DeVries establishes as key to Joan 's career , so that a non-specialist is at sea when trying to place them in the court . Moreover , he tosses into an otherwise fine summary of the Hundred Years ' War , the comment that John of England was " Lackland " from his disasters in France ( he was Lackland for not inheriting part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his title before becoming king ) . <p> With this book , Joan has been taken off the pedestal of sainthood and put back where she belongs , on top of a siege ladder on the walls of Orleans .

According to Lee , Hamer was not simply a strong black woman who met all threats and challenges with determination and fearlessness . Her reality was more complex . <p> In For Freedom 's Sake , Hamer 's story is not one of " complete triumph over all odds or complete victimization . " Her successes and rewards often brought " enormous personal pain , disappointment , and exhaustion . " During the last years of her life , Lee tells us , Hamer " was left virtually alone to assess the consequences of her sacrifices made in a quest for freedom " ( p. xi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived with both serious illness and extreme financial hardship . Her disability insurance was insufficient . Friends and family donated clothing and food . In 1977 she suffered from depression and breast cancer that resulted in a mastectomy .

Hamer confided this to her good friend Eleanor Holmes Norton , who helped her purchase one ( p. 176 ) . <p> Those were the last years of the woman who , as an elected delegate of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party ( MFDP ) , stunned and captivated the 1964 Democratic National Convention and the nation with her graphic description of life for poor blacks in the Mississippi Delta and the violence and intimidation they met when attempting to register to vote . Lee 's point is that to appreciate fully Fannie Lou Hamer 's life and " the meaning of Hamer 's life for Hamer , " we need to recognize both the personal difficulties and public successes she experienced ( p.180 ) . They are equally important , she argues . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public together to examine the roots of Hamer 's activism , Hamer 's own self-constructions , and the interplay of gender , race , and class in all aspects of Hamer 's life . A brief summary of each chapter will illustrate Lee 's skill and outline the structure of the book . <p> Chapter One recounts Hamer 's childhood and young adulthood as the youngest of twenty children in a family of sharecroppers and domestic laborers in Montgomery County , Mississippi . Lee details the factors that shaped Hamer 's racial and gender identities and locates the sources of her radicalism in both personal history ( the life experiences and example of her mother Lou Ella Townsend ) and political/economic experience ( the " direct link between race and access to resources " ) ( p. 12 ) . <p> Chapter Two focuses on Hamer 's emergence as a leader in Sunflower County and the issue of gender and leadership in the civil rights movement . Hamer criticized the traditional black male leadership . The clergy came under special attack for selling out . Hamer was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the leadership of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . SNCC recruited Hamer in 1962 , and she took pleasure in the fact that she and the students stood outside the mainstream of civil rights leadership <p> In 1963 , Hamer and a group of other Mississippians made a trip to South Carolina to participate in voter-registration work . On the return trip , the group was arrested , jailed , and savagely beaten by police in Winona , Mississippi . Hamer and others were subjected to sexual indignities as well--indignities that Hamer omitted from her public accounts of the beatings . Lee speculates that Hamer 's reticence stemmed from her awareness that her grandmother and mother had suffered a lifetime of sexual abuse at the hands of white men , as well as her desire to counteract negative images of black women 's sexuality . These events are discussed in Chapter Three . <p> Chapter Four traces SNCC activities in the Delta , the formation of the MFDP , increased local harassment of Hamer and her husband by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national stage as a spokesperson and fundraiser for SNCC and the MFDP among northern audiences . In fact , Lee argues , SNCC became quite dependent on Hamer 's money-raising skills . Interestingly , Lee suggests that some SNCC members were so captivated by Hamer 's grassroots authenticity that they may have had a tendency to exploit or objectify her . One SNCC member referred to Hamer as " a Mrs. Hamer . " Lee argues that " the irony of Hamer 's leadership was that her very personal , down-home style led some to impersonalize her as a type " ( p. 77 ) . There is an important discussion as well of Hamer 's reaction to and concern about the while female volunteers of Freedom Summer ( pp. 74-76 ) . <p> Lee 's account in Chapter Five of the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention stresses Hamer 's refusal to compromise on the seating of the MFDP delegates and her differences with the NAACP , Roy Wilkins , Martin Luther King , Jr. , the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , and Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disillusionment with traditional middle-class black male leaders and their white liberal counterparts reinforced her commitment to local solutions to local problems . <p> In Chapter Six Lee discusses Hamer 's move from the national stage to more community building at the grassroots level . In the immediate aftermath of the 1964 convention , Hamer criticized the NAACP for its lack of commitment to local self-determination . Problems also surfaced between the MFDP and its parent organization , SNCC . The organizations traded charges about local versus national control and the degree of radicalism in each organization . Hamer split with SNCC and continued to work through the MFDP to develop a political agenda that focused on housing , education , and welfare . <p> Lee argues throughout the biography that Hamer worked for economic as well as political rights . She makes this point most forcefully in Chapter Seven , which uncovers Hamer 's role in the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union ( MFLU ) for the first time , and Chapter Eight , which covers Hamer 's efforts to establish a freedom farm cooperative in the Delta region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was founded in Shaw , Mississippi , in 1965 . Forty-five cotton day laborers , domestic workers , and tractor drivers organized to address the exploitation of black workers and the lack of economic opportunity for blacks in the Delta . Lee makes the interesting argument that the MFLU , with its emphasis on self-determination and self-reliance , anticipated some of the black nationalism of the emerging black power movement . With her involvement in the MFLU and her effort to establish a self-sufficient cooperative farming enterprise , Hamer " appeared to be in transition to full scale anti-poverty work " ( p. 143 ) . <p> By calling attention to the economic-justice wing of the civil rights movement , these two chapters make an important contribution to movement history . That wing has a distinguished history in its own right , dating back at least to A. Philip Randolph 's founding of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in 1925 .

That battle , of course , is still being waged . <p> Lee 's study makes significant contributions in a number of ways . To her credit , she has written a much-needed political biography that avoids sentimentality and iconography with respect to Hamer 's personal life , public career , and important role in the civil rights movement . The biography goes a long way toward assuring that Hamer will avoid the popular and historical fate of Sojourner Truth , who for so long was treated only as icon , symbol , and authentic former slave in the eyes of a white audience . <p> Finally , For Freedom 's Sake enters into contemporary historiographical debates about the role of women--black and white--in the civil rights movement , gender and leadership style in the movement , the long tradition of black women 's involvement in politics--especially in the South--from Reconstruction forward , the decentering of Martin Luther King , Jr. , and other prominent national leaders in the narrative of civil rights history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local and national levels . <p> Copyright 2001 by H-Net , all rights reserved .

The cover of the previous edition , published in 1971 , was dominated by a drawing of a deteriorating apartment building , an image appropriate for a book about a slum . The cover of this new edition is a peculiar choice to illustrate Osofsky 's unrelentingly bleak story . It features a photograph of three young , elegant African-American women of the jazz age , decked out in fancy clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harlem Osofsky does n't show us , the Harlem of hope and glamour . <p> Osofsky has organized his work into three parts . In " Part One : The Negro and the City , " Osofsky writes of the early black neighborhoods of Manhattan , far south of Harlem . He describes the pressure put on these old neighborhoods by the early twentieth century migration of African-Americans to northern cities . Osofsky argues that as racism and economics excluded black residents from many parts of the city , and as the old black neighborhoods began to burst at the seams , African Americans were poised and ready to take advantage of the 1904 real estate bust in Harlem . <p> In " Part Two : The Making of a Ghetto , " Osofsky describes the real estate bust . In the late nineteenth century , when the elevated railway reached Harlem , developers built luxurious homes , and wealthy white people began to move in . However , when real estate speculation moved ahead of the railroad , the market collapsed . Fine apartment buildings stood tenantless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payton , Jr. , saw the collapse as an opportunity , and through his African-American Realty Company , he convinced cash-strapped landlords to accept black tenants , opening the door for a rapid African-American migration to Harlem ( p. 92 ) . <p> " Part Three : Harlem Slum " is the story of the once-exclusive neighborhood 's decline . More and more black people moved to Harlem , willing to pay higher than market rents for the opportunity to live in fine housing . Osofsky writes that high rents and low wages soon strained the growing black community , as did the influx of rural migrants with little training in urban sanitation , and the reluctance of racist landlords to maintain their property once black tenants had moved in . In addition , Osofsky argues , housing built for people with larger families , along with high rents , encouraged Harlem 's new residents to take in boarders . Osofsky claims that such living arrangements further compromised a family structure already severely weakened by the legacy of slavery , and contributed to juvenile delinquency and the general decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black family are among the most troubling and dated in the book , though his original point that overcrowding was a serious problem may be granted . Osofsky writes that Harlem in the 1920s came to be characterized by poverty , congestion , disease , and crime , a legacy which Harlem had not been able to escape ( pp. 134-47 ) . <p> In Osofsky 's telling , this is a Harlem without hope . From the moment in 1904 when Philip Payton 's first tenants moved in , the Harlem of the 1960s was fore-ordained . Osofsky 's is a vision of Harlem that relegates the Renaissance to an epilogue , in which he portrays it as a false image masking the squalor that was truly Harlem . In his story , the hope and the promise of Harlem are lost . <p> The sense of hopelessness and inevitability that drive Osofsky 's telling of Harlem 's history severely weaken his work , as does his slighting of Harlem 's glittering image and of the cultural achievements of the Harlem elite . Despite a particularly strong chapter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osofsky gives too little attention to positive aspects of Harlem life . In addition to allowing greater leverage in politics , concentrated settlement provided a wide audience for black art and literature . It also meant the chance for black businesses to flourish and for a black middle class to develop , and it provided support networks for new migrants from the South , advantages of Harlem life which Osofsky does not discuss . <p> Despite the bleakness of the story he tells , Osofsky illuminates aspects of Harlem 's history neglected by other authors . Nathan Huggins , in Harlem Renaissance ( 1971 ) and Jervis Anderson , in This Was Harlem ( 1981 ) , for example , write of Harlem as though the Renaissance were the essence of Harlem life . Cabaret culture and the publishing and art worlds , significant though they were , had little to do with the day-to-day lives of the majority of Harlem residents , lives which Osofsky strives to put at the center of his story . Huggins 's book was the standard text on the Harlem Renaissance until David Levering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a more critical look at 1920s Harlem . But even Lewis , who argues that the Harlem Renaissance was manufactured by a small elite and was largely irrelevant to Harlem 's masses , has little to say about the everyday lives of Harlem residents . Osofsky , in contrast , attempts to describe life as it was for the majority . <p> Harlem has not been so blessed with historians as Chicago . Osofsky 's contemporary , Allan Spear , wrote a similarly bleak history of the " ghettoization " of Chicago 's African Americans in Black Chicago ( 1967 ) , describing black life there as a battle with the overwhelming forces of racism , poverty and overcrowding . Since then , James Grossman 's Land of Hope ( 1989 ) and Nicholas Lemann 's The Promised Land ( 1991 ) have given us more nuanced and complete stories of the formation of the black community of Chicago , stories placing the goals , hopes and actions of African Americans at the center . Evidence drawn from oral histories , literary sources , and African-American newspapers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency of ghetto residents rather than their victimization by outside forces contribute to a richer and more complete picture of the lives of black people in Chicago . Grossman and Lemann each give attention to both hardship and hope . <p> Harlem 's history , unfortunately , has not yet had its Grossman or Lemann . Osofsky 's book remains the best there is on the formation of the Harlem 's black community , its shortcomings a product of the time it was written rather than of any serious deficiency in scholarship . The fashionable , smiling women on the cover of this new edition make clear what we are missing in the history of Harlem : a story that successfully unites the hope with the faults . Until such a book is written , Harlem : The Making of a Ghetto should remain on our required reading lists . 69402 @qwx479402

" Before I went South , " the Maine-born , former Union general explained , " ... I do not think that any amount of human testimony could have induced me to believe in such a condition of society as exists in Mississippi . " 1 Ames knew that it was difficult for northerners to believe that heavily armed paramilitary organizations would scatter peaceful political gatherings , that ballot boxes were stolen and burned , that public officials could be gunned down in broad daylight in the center of town , and that battles erupted between white and black militias in response to local elections . <p> The electoral violence of the mid-1870s remains perplexing . Although historians have documented the violent counterrevolution that undermined Reconstruction , the general public knows little of these events and seems skeptical that white terrorists could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nicholas Lemann 's intention in Redemption : The Last Battle of the Civil War is to bring this forgotten story to a wider audience and explain why southern democracy and civil rights were snuffed out . <p> Redemption covers incidents of political violence in Mississippi and Louisiana between 1873 and 1876 . Beginning with the Colfax massacre , Lemann lays out the major themes of the Redemption period . On Easter Sunday , 1873 , a heavily armed white paramilitary force attacked black supporters of the recently elected black sheriff of Grant Parish who were holed up in the courthouse . Surrounded and outgunned , the black defenders held off the white army from behind earthworks , but the tables turned once the whites succeeded in setting fire to the courthouse . With nowhere left to hide , the blacks tried to run away but were cut down by a barrage of gunfire . Some were captured and then summarily executed ; others held out in the courthouse , only to be consumed by the flames . At least seventy-one blacks were killed at Colfax . The struggle between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , power : " who could vote and hold government office " ( p. 4 ) . <p> The other notable aspect of this period was the lack of accountability for the violence . The new sheriff of Grant Parish headed the army of white supremacists and was uninterested in probing his own actions or his supporters . A Republican state judge attempted to initiate criminal proceedings , but a mob of armed white men forced the judge to back down . The federal courts obtained indictments and three convictions , but the Supreme Court , in the landmark Cruickshank decision , negated these results , ruling that it was the states ' , not the federal government 's , responsibility to protect citizens ' rights . The effect was to validate the violence of the white terrorists as a means of wresting control of government from the hands of Republicans . For years , Democrats had tried all manner of intimidation , persuasion , and coercion to convince freedmen not to vote with the Republican Party . In 1873 , the solution presented itself--drive black elected officeholders from power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liner , the intent of the violence was " to strike terror to the hearts of these negro men " ( p. 157 ) . <p> The Civil War " had , in effect broken out again , " claims Lemann , but this " Last Battle " was very different from the theater of war in the 1860s ( p. 28 ) . To be sure the Union army played a pivotal role in protecting state officeholders , particularly in New Orleans , but the federal military presence in the 1870s was a shell of its former self . More pointedly , this new conflict was a war within local communities , not a sectional conflict . White neighbors faced off against black neighbors , southern Democrats vs. southern Republicans . It was not just the last phase of the Civil War but a new sectarian conflict that ripped apart communities all across the South . <p> Given the internecine component of this period , it is odd that Lemann chose Adelbert Ames as the main protagonist . As a white northerner , Ames had much less at stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican politicians and ordinary black Mississippians , he benefited from state police protection and never considered Mississippi his home . But Ames 's experience as an elected governor of Mississippi ( 1874-76 ) puts into high relief the revolutionary changes in racial attitudes and the equally sweeping changes in partisan politics . <p> At the end of the Civil War , Ames , like most white northerners , was skeptical that freedpeople deserved citizenship and equal rights . Nonetheless , he saw in the newly enfranchised black voters an opportunity to achieve substantial political power . After a short term as military governor , he convinced Mississippi 's legislators ( many of them black ) to make him a U.S. senator . Next , he married Blanche Butler , daughter of Benjamin Butler , a leading Radical Republican with close ties to President Ulysses S. Grant . His quick ascent seemed to presage a long career in politics . While campaigning across the state , he realized that his earlier view of simpleminded freedpeople did not begin to describe the sophisticated black voters who he encountered at large political rallies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ames became convinced that African Americans ' rights needed to be protected and that he was the one to do it . By 1873 , Ames had won the governorship outright , ushering in " a new political order " that was as revolutionary as it was short-lived ( p. 61 ) . <p> Not long after Ames settled in the governor 's mansion , White Liners seized control of the county government in Vicksburg . " Well-financed terrorists , " writes Lemann , " were engaged in what seemed to be a planned campaign to unseat the Republican Party , and undo Negroes ' civil rights and voting rights " ( p. 76 ) . In the next year , the white supremacist campaign repeated itself in places like Yazoo City , Clinton , and Port Gibson as armed white mobs seized local government offices and dared Ames or President Grant to send troops to re-establish legitimate governance . Reluctant to send the state militia since white militiamen would not fight other whites and the use of black militiamen threatened to expand the ever-widening conflict , Ames begged Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming elections in Ohio and a northern public that had soured on federal intervention , dithered and delayed . With federal and state power seemingly impotent , White Liners broke up Republican meetings , intimidated black voters , hunted officeholders , and murdered black community leaders . From the relative comfort of the governor 's mansion , Ames witnessed the unfolding chaos but could do little to arrest the tide . Writing to his wife , Ames accurately understood the implications of the terrorism : " Yes , a revolution has taken place--by force of arms--and a race are disfranchised--they are to be returned to a condition of serfdom--an era of second slavery " ( p. 132 ) . <p> Applying the lessons from the 1875 election , Democratic parties in South Carolina , Florida , and Louisiana instituted the so-called Mississippi Plan and overthrew the last remaining Republican governments in the former Confederacy . The abandonment of black citizens became complete when Republicans cut a deal to elevate Rutherford B. Hayes to the presidency . The South , in the words of the terrorists and their fellow travelers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redemption story was just gaining traction . In the last chapter of the book , Lemann charts how the story of black incompetence , carpetbagger malfeasance , and federal abuse of power spread from Thomas Dixon to William A. Dunning to John F. Kennedy , and in the process became a defining myth in American culture . <p> There is much to like about this book . Lemann , the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University , utilizes an array of manuscript collections and congressional records to bring this neglected history to a wider audience . Although the book adds little to the scholarship on Reconstruction , the story is well told and suitable for undergraduate courses . <p> A few mistakes , however , tarnish slightly what is otherwise a forceful presentation . The Black Codes applied not just to freed slaves but to all persons of color ( p. 34 ) . Hiram Revels was never " Mississippi 's leading black politician , " but a compromise candidate with limited influence ( p. 48 ) . More troubling is Lemann 's use of racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he sought to use " contemporary " words to make the story more " vivid and resonant , " and so he favors " Negro " over " African American " or " black " ( p. xi ) . Other contemporary terms , such as " freedmen , " are curiously neglected even though the author cites sources that use the same words . In an otherwise highly readable book , it is distracting when Lemann refers to a young black man seeking entry into West Point as a " colored boy " ( p. 47 ) . <p> Despite these criticisms , Redemption succeeds in linking southern political violence of the 1870s to the Civil War , demonstrating that the war was about citizenship , equal rights , and democracy . Furthermore , Lemann shows that the Reconstruction effort , in spite of its internal problems , succumbed to an unprecedented wave of terrorism . Hopefully , this critical look at Redemption will help to puncture the myths that remain a fixture in popular memory of Reconstruction .

John Hennessy 's " We Shall Make Richmond Howl : The Army of the Potomac on the Eve of Chancellorsville " presents a fascinating portrait of the Union Army 's mood in the months just before Chancellorsville .

The history of the abortive abolition of slavery in Guadeloupe has attracted some attention in French scholarly circles , thanks to the recently passed 2002 bicentennial of the re-imposition of slavery there. 1 To the extent that students of Latin America in the English-speaking world have noticed the revolutions in the French West Indies at all , the tendency has been to pay attention to the striking example of Saint-Domingue and assume that conditions in other colonies paralleled those found in the " pearl of the Antilles . " <p> Laurent Dubois 's work provides needed contrast to our easy over-generalization . For Guadeloupe was not Saint-Domingue . First , of course , the outcome was **27;1596;TOOLONG slaves became Haiti 's citizens , peasant farmers , and sometime laborers in the first black republic . Meanwhile , Guadeloupe 's slaves , after a brief , shining moment as " new citizens " of France , went back to slavery until 1848 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony , to spend their declining years playing up their victimization at the hands of barbarous slave rebels and pressuring the French government for reimbursement for their lost " property . " Guadeloupe 's white ruling class forced the slaves back into their chains , returned to plantation farming , and to prosperity , for a while . And Saint-Domingue 's intermediate class of free people of color , after vacillating between pressing for equal treatment within the plantation system and support for the black revolutionaries , generally took their place at the head of the rebel armies and entered the era of independence as a new ruling class . Guadeloupean free coloreds participated in the struggles for equal rights , first for their own class , then for all people of African descent . Ultimately , though , they were defeated and ended up being oppressed even more brutally than before the revolution . <p> A lot of the difference between these two outcomes can be ascribed to geography . Indeed , we who study Saint-Domingue are not unaware that things did not turn out so well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we generally just note that Guadeloupe is smaller and thus harder to defend from sea-borne attack . It is , but Victor Hugues managed to not only defend the island against the greatest naval power on earth at the time but to attack neighboring islands and give the British fits throughout the whole region . An explanation for the failure of the revolution in Guadeloupe required more analysis than it had been given . Laurent Dubois has provided that analysis . <p> One major argument over the revolution in the French Caribbean is the degree to which it can be considered an outgrowth of the French revolution and to what extent it was a " revolution from below , " in the words of Carolyn Fick 's work on the Saint-Domingue slave uprising. 2 Dubois shows us that the two need not be mutually exclusive . Slaves and free people of color received and understood the ideas coming from France . They did not need white people from far away to tell them that freedom was better than slavery and democracy better than tyranny . They took advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropole to help frame and advance their own pre-existing claims . Dubois illustrates both the flow of ideas and the way Guadeloupeans of African descent made these ideas their own . In the 1793 slave uprising at Trois-Rivi+-res , which forms the principal subject of the second part of Colony of Citizens , rebel leaders successfully claimed that their movement was directed against treacherous royalist whites , and escaped punishment . They took advantage of the Jacobin discourse that ascribed Royalist sympathies to the planter class , while at the same time refraining from attacking a plantation owned by a noted Jacobin . They avoided ( for a time ) the generally dismal fate of most slave rebels , with one individual subsequently becoming a free overseer on state plantations ( before finally being shot by a Bonapartist firing squad ) . <p> It is interesting to contrast the relationship between the agricultural laborers and the Hugues administration with that which existed in Saint-Domingue between the Toussaint L'Ouverture administration and its agricultural workforce . Toussaint also required former slaves who had no other employment ( e.g. , typically military ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers also resisted these orders as best they could , with actions from flight to sabotage to outright rebellion--very similar to the reactions of slaves before the revolution . Toussaint crushed resistance with military force , executing troublemakers with little compunction--even equating resistance to labor laws with treasonable support for the enemies of the Republic as Hugues did . Yet , when Bonaparte 's troops came after 1802 to re-impose the slave system , Toussaint fought , alongside the former slaves . The resistance in Saint-Domingue was more or less universal , while , as Dubois points out , Guadeloupe 's ( white ) administrators and substantial elements of the island 's ruling class supported the re-imposition of slavery . In both cases , though , the agricultural laborers fought against a return to their old status . They , at least , could tell the difference between unpaid labor service to the state and chattel slavery , and preferred the former . <p> One role which new citizens and the Hugues administration both saw as crucial for the successful transformation of slaves into citizens was military service . Newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic , both as infantrymen and as sailors on corsairs . Prior to the revolution , enslaved men could gain freedom through military service . During the period of emancipation , on the other hand , they justified their claim to the freedom they had already been accorded by being willing to fight for it . They were often the only people available to fill the ranks of the French armed forces , as white soldiers from the metropole could not penetrate the British blockade while local whites tended to be lukewarm in their support of the revolution . Republican armies in the eastern Caribbean were two-thirds black . Hugues was able to lead his armies on a rampage throughout the eastern Caribbean , seriously damaging British hegemony . The Peace of Amiens took away this important function that black men could fulfill and made it much easier to imagine turning them back into agricultural laborers . <p> The last part of Colony of Citizens is the sad story of how slavery was re-imposed in Guadeloupe . Some years ago , France celebrated the one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the 1848 abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dubois 's work recaptures this forgotten chapter , and shows how it played out in this peripheral French Caribbean colony . Peripheral or not , the story of Guadeloupe is important to our understanding of this period , if only because of the alternative viewpoint it gives those of us who study the somewhat happier story of Saint-Domingue . The savage repression of the re-enslaved in Guadeloupe , including even those who had supported the coming of Bonaparte 's expedition , parallels the vicious brutality of the Leclerc regime in Saint-Domingue and shows why the Haitian rebels of 1802-03 fought so hard . And the persistent memory of freedom in Guadeloupe , despite all the efforts of Bonaparte 's enforcers to obliterate it , restores one 's faith in human freedom and dignity even in the midst of oppression and degradation . <p> Indeed , Dubois argues that this relatively peripheral rebellion deserves general attention because the modern concepts of human rights and human dignity were , in a sense , invented in the Caribbean . The anti-slavery struggle , both by the enslaved and by their liberal European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples for freedom during the eighteenth-century revolutions . There is a growing body of work on the impact of the Haitian Revolution on struggles against slavery throughout the Atlantic. 3 It is rather commonplace now to see the idea of global standards of human rights as a child of the abolition movement . Groups as diverse as the modern women 's movement and anti-abortion protestors claim to be the heirs of the abolitionists . Guadeloupe 's sufferings and defeat may be even more central to this tradition than Haiti 's victory , since the Guadeloupean rebels never claimed to be anything but citizens of a French Republic in which equality and the liberty of all were respected . Thus Louis Delgr+-s set an example for Schoelcher , the architect of the 1848 abolition , and for all his heirs to this day . <p> On a more practical level , this book is very useful to scholars and teachers of the Caribbean and the Atlantic revolutions because of the wealth of sources that it draws upon . Saint-Domingue 's public records , sadly , descend into a great silence starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notarial acts from the revolutionary period , and then very , very little for the early national period . In Guadeloupe , on the other hand , the French genius for accurate and complete ( not to say excessive ) record-keeping was faithfully exercised throughout the revolutionary period . Therefore , Dubois has a good deal to go on in telling the story of the Guadeloupean revolutionaries . He has plantation records maintained by the Republican administration . He has court records . He has records of births , deaths , marriages , name changes , deeds for land , manumissions of slaves , and the like . Thus , while students of the Haitian Revolution have to rely on letters from generals , other military records , and the occasional diary to reconstruct the changes in society that went on during the revolution , Dubois has the genuine article : the stuff of a proper social history . <p> In conclusion , I feel that A Colony of Citizens merits the attention , not only of a few readers in the rather limited field of French Caribbean studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery and abolition , the genesis of human rights , or even just a mighty lively story .

Determined to overthrow Republican regimes , Mississipians devised what would become the model for Democratic redemption elsewhere , the so-called " Mississippi Plan .

" This statute allowed convicts to be leased out if their sentences were less than ten years . Since whites were usually only charged and convicted for the most serious of crimes , their sentences entitled them to the relative safety of the state penitentiary at Jackson . <p> As it developed in Mississippi , convict leasing successfully replaced racial bondage with a system of racial castes while at the same time fueling the economic development of the late 19th century " New South . " The use of convicts for everything from raising cotton , to building railroads , to extracting turpentine gum spread rapidly . It solved the problem of high fixed labor costs , since minimal expenses for food , clothing , and shelter were necessary .

Vardaman . Using race-baiting and fears of black lawlessness and criminality to gain power , Vardaman was convinced that a prison farm , " like an efficient slave plantation , " was necessary to provide young African-Americans with the " proper discipline , strong work habits , and respect for white authority " ( p. 110 ) that the end of slavery had eliminated .

The famous song " Midnight Special " was based on the train that left Jackson every Saturday night to carry the wives and lovers to the prison for their Sunday visits . Olshinsky also chronicles the " other Parchman , " the white men and women of both races who served their time there . <p> But Parchman Farm , as bad as it was , was a reflection of larger problems .

" Weimar 's affluence of cultural expressions and intellectual observations , together with the fragility of the political order and the violent demise of the republic , have been repeatedly described by scholars as either the most lucid example of the contradictory nature of modernity , or a distinctive case of deviation from the modern " project . " In tandem with this tradition , David Durst 's Weimar Modernism employs a synthesis of Ernst Bloch and Fredric Jameson 's observations in order to argue that post-World War I German " philosophy , politics , and culture " were essentially related to " the development of modernism " ( p. xxii ) . <p> Durst bases his explanation of the inherent correlation between Weimar and modernism on the similarities of Bloch 's account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic of capitalism " in a stage of incomplete expansion . The coexistence of contradicting social and cultural formations " from radically different moments in history " ( the " simultaneity of non-simultaneous " ) , which characterized the Republic 's reality according to Bloch , corresponds with Jameson 's depiction of the second stage of capitalism 's expansion and its cultural product : modernism . The identification of Weimar culture with " modernism " is thus achieved due to the incomplete expansion of modern capitalism , resulting in the existence of various premodern residues within Germany 's social realities and cultural discourses . In other words , Weimar culture should be regarded as an extraordinary example of modernism because , as Bloch pointed out , Germany was " the classical land of non-simultaneity " ( p. 21 ) . <p> As frequently indicated by scholars , " modernism " is an exceptionally problematic explanatory category. 1 Facing this difficulty , Durst adopts Jameson 's definition of modernism as a distinctive " structure of feeling , " which is particularly compatible with the coexistence of non-simultaneous phenomena to which Bloch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first objective of this book is to trace the developments of that " structure of feeling , " or " modernism , " which was allegedly shared by Germans during the Weimar years . It is noteworthy , however , that most of the time Durst establishes his arguments on the works of distinguished intellectuals and artists ( such as Adorno , Heidegger , Kracauer , Hausmann , and so on ) , rather than on inspection of popular culture expressions and social behavior . The extent to which these intellectuals ' reflections on popular cultural tendencies actually reflect general " structures of feeling " is still , at least , debatable . <p> Recounting the developments in the Germans ' structure of feeling between 1918-1933 , Durst points to three distinct periods . Each marks a different prevalent tendency among Weimar contemporaries . The first period indicates the years of hyperinflation ( until 1924 ) , which resulted in a culture of " contemplation , " or , in Luk+cs 's words , " passive cognitive stance of the individual over a heterogeneous social object , event , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates to the years of economic stabilization ( 1924-1929 ) , which are characterized by Kracauer 's famous assertion about the " cult of distraction " ( p. 89 ) . Finally , the third period starts with the international economic crisis of 1929 and is identified with Ernst J++nger 's conception of the age of " total mobilization " ( p. 149 ) . <p> The advantage of this depiction is evident : the seemingly fragmented cultural and philosophical endeavors of the Weimar era would be portrayed in this way as taking part in one , relatively coherent discourse of " modernism . " Based on Jameson 's conception of modernism , Durst 's argument rests upon the actual existence of essential relationships between these three " structure(s) of feeling " and the " simultaneous appearance of conflicting historical realities . " The second objective of Weimar Modernism , therefore , is to confirm these fundamental connections . In execution of this task , Durst utilizes theories of the most prominent intellectuals of Weimar years , and highlights surprising similarities between seemingly unrelated theorists ( for example , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although Bloch 's argument for the non-simultaneity of post-WWI German reality was only coherently formulated during the 1930s , this idea can already be traced in his earlier writings , as Durst convincingly shows . Crucial to the development of Bloch 's idea was his dissent with Georg Luk+cs in the years following the latter 's conversion to Marxism . According to Luk+cs , the crisis of modern culture is a result of the inherent contradiction of liberal capitalism : the contradiction between an ideology of subjective freedom and a social order of industrial production ( pp. 12-13 , 44 ) . Modern Germany , he argues , was thoroughly under the effect of the " homogenizing dialectic of capitalist synchronicity " ( p. 19 ) , which resulted in utopian ideas ( such as Bloch 's early 1920s thoughts ) and the " pseudorevolutionary " art forms ( e.g. the avant-garde 's montage , p. 64 ) , which is passive by nature . To respond to such an attack , Bloch sought to reach beyond Luk+cs 's economic reductionism , and sought to explain the " crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by emphasizing the important role of premodern elements in the Weimar economy , administration , and--most importantly--in Germans ' perception of reality . Since the concept of " non-simultaneity " rejects a homogenizing capitalist totality , the new art forms are no longer a mere symptom of the crisis of liberal capitalism , but an " account of ... reality as actually experienced " ( p. 25 ) . <p> Intriguingly , the key concepts of the theoretical dispute between Luk+cs and Bloch were echoed in the writings of some prominent Dadaists in the early 1920s . Like Bloch , they found the reason for the crisis in the residues of premodern foundations present in the core of Weimar culture ( Hausmann writes , " the first expressionist was ... Martin Luther " , p. 45 ) . Like Luk+cs , however , they identified the essence of the crisis with the passive , contemplative character of the older art form . The future vociferous conservative critic of Weimar parliamentarism , Carl Schmitt , takes a similar approach in the early 1920s . Concentrating on the political sphere , Schmitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political leaders of the republic . This residue of premodern perceptions leads bourgeois regimes to chronic passivity . <p> Nevertheless , the paths of the above commentators diverged quickly , together with the economic stabilization and shift of emphasis among various intellectuals--from critique of passivity , to critique of the " cult of distraction . " The assertion that hyperinflation and the relatively quick stabilization of German economy after 1923 had had a vast effect on the break from prewar cultures and the beginning of the age of mass ( consumption ) culture is today almost a truism . Durst argues further that the vast devaluation of currency ( the unthinkable gap between gold and its paper money representations ) also generated new evaluations of the relations between the self and its artistic representations , and hence , new forms of abstraction in expressionist art . Consequently , the stabilization of currency resulted in desertion of abstraction and the emergence of face-value realism of the neue Sachlichkeit ( pp. 86-87 ) . The marginalization of prewar cultural phenomena , such as expressionism , left room for a new critique of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Durst chooses to highlight here Kracauer 's reflections on the " mass ornament . " When intellectual contemplations became commodities ( Weber ) and the city " salaried masses " tried to forget their insecurity , a new popular " cult " was formed around the consumption of culture , which now gave an illusion of synchronized reality without any trace of " nonsynchronic " elements . However , Durst stresses that this sense of harmonious capitalist order was not symptomatic of the German new " structure of feeling " after 1924 . Between Bloch and Kracauer , Durst sides with the former , who maintained that even in Weimar big cities premodern perceptions were still prominent ( p. 98 ) . Even if it was never fully realized in 1920s Germany , the threat of a synchronized capitalist regime led significant thinkers back to the idea of the simultaneous existence of non-simultaneous formations--this time not as a cause for the crisis , but as a solution to it . <p> Facing the alarming tendency of the city masses to embrace the culture of mass commodification , Theodor Adorno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using and adapting elements from different musical traditions , Adorno wrote , Alban Berg 's Wozzeck " transforms the familiarity of the past into the strange perspective of the future " ( p. 121 ) . In other words , Berg found a way to present non-simultaneous elements simultaneously in his music ; this is the only way art could fight the totality of capitalism ( p. 117 ) . Adorno was not the only one to identify the false synchronization offered by the " cult of distraction " and the need to find a substituting conceptual framework to this system . Durst reads Heidegger 's Being and Time , for instance , as a ( Kracauerian-like ) critique of urban society of the late 1920s : " not surprisingly , " he writes , " Heidegger describes the inauthenticity of the ' Dasein ' in terms of distractedness " ( p. 139 ) . The fast change in Heidegger 's thoughts in the beginning of the 1930s symbolizes for Durst a new phase in Weimarian " structure of feeling , " a tendency towards " total mobilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In his works of the early 1930s J++nger sought to promote a new age in which the worker would be totally mobilized to act for the goals of the new imperial state . Alas , total mobilization , according to J++nger , was prevented in Germany before--and most notably during ? " World War I , because German society lacked the " inner armament " ( p. 150 ) . The problem , according to J++nger , was " ideological fixation " on outdated liberal ideas , or , put simply , the simultaneous existence of antiquated ideas of the past within the present . Like Bloch and Adorno , J++nger saw in the false synchronization of capitalism an enemy to be overcome ; unlike them , he understood the coexistence of non-simultaneous elements as an obstacle rather than an answer to contemporary crisis . Notably , similar to Bloch , J++nger appreciated the effect of montage ( for this essentially meant photographic montage ) ; the work of the montage in his books , however , aimed to encourage elimination of the non-synchronized elements , and not--as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durst the beginning of National Socialism 's victory over the democratic republic . The Nazis showed as early as the elections of 1929 a skill for mobilization of voters , basing their popularity by appealing to the " level of feeling " ( Durst recounts here Carl Mierendorf 's observation of 1930 , p. 181 ) . Walter Benjamin 's analysis of Bertolt Brecht 's epic theater serves as an epilogue to the book , as an example for a sad , unsuccessful attempt to lead popular support away from Nazi totality . Against the level-of-feeling 's symbolic totality of fascism , Brecht 's epic theater evokes " disruptive , critical thought , " which eradicates " hypnotic illusion " ( p. 183 ) . Benjamin 's appreciation of the " montage " quality and of the " interruption " of the viewers ' experience in Brecht 's 1930s theater recalls Bloch 's definition of the coexistence of non-simultaneous elements , as well as Adorno 's quest for synchronization of non-synchronized elements in avant-garde art . Total mobilization , however , according to Durst , proved to be much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weimar Modernism , therefore , tells the story of Weimar Germany as an extreme case of Jameson 's " modernism , " of the simultaneous existence of contradictory elements ; the end of the republic is accordingly depicted as the true change from non-simultaneity to total mobilization . It is an enriching survey of an intellectual discourse in one of the most fascinating periods in the history of modern thought and culture . The weak point of the book , and maybe of its genre , is revealed in the intersections between the descriptions of critical intellectual discourse ( of prominent philosophers , cultural critics , and elite artists ) , and portrayals of the " structure of feeling " supposedly common to Weimar contemporaries . The abundance of scholarship on popular culture in the Weimar Republic does not always correspond with Durst 's findings in the critical writing of intellectuals . For example , were ideas of total mobilization really absent , or negligible , in popular culture of the stabilization period ? Again , was the extreme right the only side that effectively employed emotionally appealing symbolism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The study of the Weimar Republic calls , indeed , for an additional synchronization of allegedly non-synchronized elements : synchronization of the critical intellectual discourse--to which Weimar Modernism contributes an interesting synopsis--and actual everyday practices in the modern urban sphere , the mass consumption and production of popular culture , as well as collective memory/memories and self-perceptions.

Roger Kurtz ( Department of English , State University of New York , Brockport ) Published on H-AfrLitCine ( December , 2004 ) <p> A Light Look at the Oral Traditions of East African Asians <p> The oral traditions of East Africa have been the subject of fairly intensive study by historians for over fifty years now , and in the process of sifting the oral record for clues to the region 's past , scholars have developed a fairly sophisticated set of methodologies by which to do that sifting . In the field of literary studies , serious scholarly attention to orality is somewhat more recent , although in the past two decades the study of oral literature has become well established in the educational curriculum at all levels . To meet the demands of that part of the curriculum Kenyan , publishers have produced a number of textbooks on oral literature , and the volume under review is one of a series on that topic from East African Educational Publishers ( EAEP ) . The series was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maasai and includes titles on the oral literature of the Luo , Kalenjin , Gikuyu , and Embu . Other titles , one presumes , are forthcoming . <p> Oral Literature of the Asians in East Africa , like others in the series , follows a set format . It begins by laying out the social and historical background of the community under discussion ( in this case , the Asian community in East Africa ) followed by annotated examples of that community 's oral literature , organized by genre ( in this case , the four categories of narratives , riddles , proverbs , and songs ) . Because it is intended as a school text , each chapter concludes with a series of discussion questions . <p> EAEP is to be commended for including a volume on the Asian community in its booklist , as this adds to the documentation of the important Asian experience in the region . As the authors note , in the East African context " Asian " and " Indian " are interchangeable if not entirely accurate terms to refer to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , Pakistan and Bangladesh " ( p. 110 ) . The Asian presence in East Africa is at least three thousand years old , but the recruitment of laborers at the end of the nineteenth century , to build the Uganda Railway , brought in a large contingent of Indians at that time . Many of East Africa 's Asians are fifth-generation descendants of that influx . Two of the more interesting recent examinations of the Asian experience are Cynthia Salvadori 's Through Open Doors ( 1983 ) , which gives a rich overview of the diverse religious practices of the Asian community , and a fascinating exhibit at the National Museums of Kenya in 2000-2001 . Curated by Sultan Somjee with extensive input from the Asian community , " The Asian African Heritage : Identity and History , " provided a brilliant overview of the Asian experience in the region . Mubina and Sanaullah Kirmani 's Oral Literature of the Asians in East Africa adds to the documentation of that experience even as it broadens our concept of East African literature . These are both worthy achievements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general history of the Asian community , along with a discussion of the characteristics and typical performance practices of that community 's stories , songs , riddles , and proverbs . Naturally , tales about the journey from Asia to Africa figure prominently in this tradition , as do stories about work on the railroad . <p> Chapters 3 through 6 discuss each of the genres in turn . The chapter on narratives includes twenty-three excerpts , most of them originating in India and including , for instance , accounts from the Ramayana and several stories about Birbal , the clever advisor to the Mogul Emperor Akbar . In the next chapter we are offered sixty-eight riddles on a variety of topics , for example , a favorite : " There are two brothers , born in the same house , having the same name , exercising great power of life , yet they have no power of life in themselves , " with the answer , " nostrils . " A fifth chapter lists 124 proverbs . Some of these are self-evident ( " twenty in hand are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the authors offer necessary commentary . For example , " the trees bend when they bear fruit " is a reference to the importance of remaining modest when one acquires education or knowledge . Finally , the chapter on songs sets out the lyrics to lullabies , play songs , love songs , marriage songs , work songs , songs of separation , songs of the sea , and funeral songs . <p> The book is at its best when it focuses on what is specifically East African in the Indian experience . For instance , the authors ' account of Pir Baghali , a railway laborer who possessed extraordinary spiritual powers , is wonderful : <p> " He was an honest and hardworking man . He was always helpful to the needy and was kind to both people and animals . He was known to be strong and athletic , and could run fast enough to catch a peacock or a vulture before it could fly away .... It is said that during construction of the railway , the kerai or vessel filled with concrete and sand which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few inches above his head . Pir Baghali was a pious man . It was said that through his prayers , he could help keep the wild animals away and thus keep the labourers ' camp safe . When he died , he was buried next to the railway line on Mackinnon Road . A mausoleum has been built there in his memory . Till today many travelers , regardless of whether they are Hindus , Muslims , Sikhs or Christians , stop by his graveside to pay their respects , give offerings and pray for their safe journeys . People say that they arrive safely at their destinations because they had stopped at Pir Bahgali 's graveside . The trains running on the railway line he helped build customarily slow down at Mackinnon Road to pay tribute to this legend " ( pp. 2-3 ) . <p> The collection is hampered by two major flaws . The first is that it fails to describe and balance the many different traditions that constitute the Asian community in East Africa . To do a volume on this wildly heterogeneous group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're not always told which Asians a particular riddle , proverb , song or story pertains to . Rather than by genre , perhaps the authors should have organized the collection by ethnic tradition , with an emphasis on what is particular to that tradition . This would allow the authors to avoid blandness such as " birth is an important event in the homes of East African Asians " ( p. 10 ) , as well as generalizations that do not necessarily apply in all cases , such as " religious myths and legends are told in places of worship by priests " ( p. 16 ) . <p> The second problem is an unfortunate overemphasis on those oral traditions that originated ( and still exist ) in India to the detriment of those traditions that emerged from the Indian experience in East Africa . It is the latter that is more significant here and should properly be the focus of the book . We need more stories like those about Pir Baghali . The authors refer to other tales from the railway construction , including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not actually include those tales . Dedicating precious space to retelling parts of the Ramayana seems a poor choice , since those stories are available elsewhere . <p> As the chronicle of an oral tradition , Oral Literature of the Asians in East Africa is seriously flawed in its scope and methodology . The collection is amateurish in the sense that its compilers clearly love their topic , but the collection is not grounded in the critical methodologies that have been developed in the fields of literature and history for dealing with the oral tradition . Scholars of African literature and culture may find the work of interest but of limited scholarly value . <p> We must keep in mind , of course , that the primary audience for this volume consists of secondary students in the Kenyan schools . Discussion questions at the end of each chapter ask students to compare the readings with oral traditions ( narratives , riddles , story-telling moments , and so forth ) of their own communities . One can easily imagine how in a place like Kenya , given the right set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Historians , political scientists , and pundits in the media tried to prognosticate the effects unification would have on Germany 's relations with its neighbors , especially in East Central Europe and the Balkans , where a wave of revolutions reawakened old national disputes . <p> As Michael Libal , then the head of the Southeast European Department of the German Foreign Ministry , notes in Limits of Persuasion , it was in this supercharged atmosphere that Germany 's recognition of Croatian and Slovenian independence in December 1991 exploded onto the European diplomatic arena . Countless observers seized upon the German decision to grant international legal status to these two small former Yugoslav republics as a harbinger of a major shift in German foreign policy . Indeed , not a few European and U.S. diplomats and journalists saw the German decision as the first step down the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped themselves into a frenzy over the alleged emergence of a " Fourth Reich " which sought to dismember Yugoslavia and to reestablish the fascist " Independent State of Croatia . " <p> Michael Libal takes it as his task to provide a detailed account of German diplomacy in the period from May 1991 to the recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina in April 1992 . Libal divides his book into three parts . He intends the first part of the book to be used as a primary source . The second part of the book stands as Libal 's personal attempt at scholarly analysis and as a bid to correct extant errors in the literature on the collapse of Yugoslavia. 1 In the final part of the book , Libal attempts to present some lessons from the diplomacy of 1991-1992 . For his analysis , Libal notes that he takes " the Yugoslav perspective , in the sense that I have viewed German policies primarily as responses to the Yugoslav crisis as it unfolded " ( p. 159 ) . <p> According to Libal , the many observers who criticize German recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s and 1980s and the context of Yugoslavia 's collapse . The long-standing German Foreign Minister , Hans-Dietrich Genscher , was in many ways Yugoslavia 's best diplomatic friend during the 1980s. 2 However , in 1991-1992 , Genscher became the lightning rod for Serbian attacks on German diplomacy , and these left Genscher embittered . Intriguingly , Libal argues that the good bilateral relationship that Genscher had built with Yugoslavia actually caused Germany to underestimate the separatist rhetoric in Slovenia and Croatia in the late 1980s and early 1990s ( p. 5 ) . Libal therefore dismisses the Serbian government 's argument that Germany planned a conspiracy to dismember Yugoslavia , achieving through diplomacy what German military power failed to sustain during World War II . <p> After Croatia and Slovenia declared independence in June 1991 , war erupted in Yugoslavia . Although Slovenia extricated itself rapidly from the escalating conflict , the vicious and prolonged attacks by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) on the towns of Osijek and Vukovar in the Eastern Slavonian region of Croatia caused a groundswell of outrage in German public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelling of towns and " ethnic cleansing " into the homes of Western Europe , and German reporters filed frequent reports about the mounting atrocities in Croatia . Libal points out that German public 's indignity at the war in the former Yugoslavia provided powerful impetus for a shift in the German government 's attitude towards the continued existence of Yugoslavia . Indeed , in September 1991 , Genscher told the JNA that " the hour of recognition moved closer " every time a cannon or tank fired a shot into a civilian settlement ( p. 45 ) . <p> The impact of German public opinion on German policy formation is interesting , yet Libal fails to pursue its evolution . In this regard , the omission of any mention of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung editor Johann-Georg Reissmueller 's one-man editorial crusade for recognition of Slovenia and Croatia is particularly odd . Although it is perhaps asking too much , more emphasis and explanation of the effect of the domestic political pressure on German policy-makers would have been useful . ( Cynical observers might correctly note that the German government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the introduction of a common European currency . ) For example , Libal only briefly alludes to German annoyance with the rapidly growing influx of refugees from the former Yugoslavia . In my opinion , Libal also perhaps overly downplays the feeling of many Germans that Croats , and Slovenes should have a right to exercise self-determination just as the German people had done in 1989-1990 . <p> Although Libal 's narrative occasionally slips on small details , he correctly identifies the problematic role of self-determination and Yugoslavism in the crisis of 1991-1992 . Libal describes how the President of Serbia , Slobodan Milosevic , disgraced the already battered image of Yugoslavism by using it as a cover for a policy which attempted to force the Yugoslav republics to be subjugated to a strong centralist government based in Belgrade . He also correctly highlights the hypocrisy in Milosevic 's periodic espousal of self-determination . Serb nationalists who trumpeted the right of all Serbs to reside in one state did not ( and do not ) extend the same right to Albanians . As Libal writes , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kosovo beginning in 1987 gave the other Yugoslav nations a hint of what might be in store for them once Serb nationalism had triumphed . This entailed , however , the risk for Serbia that at some time in the future its jealously guarded ' internal affairs ' might become an object of federal concern or even intervention ... " ( p. 121 ) . <p> Libal spends an understandably large portion of the book attacking the canard , repeated countless times by scholars and diplomats alike , that Germany forced the European Community ( EC ) to recognize Croatia and Slovenia without any regards for the subsequent consequences for security in Bosnia-Herzegovina . He provides a detailed account of the negotiations leading to the December 15 , 1991 decision of the European Union to recognize Croatia and Slovenia on January 15 , 1992 . An arbitration commission was to deliberate on the eligibility of those Yugoslav republics applying for recognition of statehood . <p> Libal tries to address the criticism that the German decision on December 23 , 1991 to accelerate recognition of Croatia and Slovenia left Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , it made it convenient for states like France and Britain , which had been uncomfortable with the decision in the first place , to accuse Germany of bullying the EC into recognition . Libal states that this came as a surprise to Genscher , who had received assurances that Germany 's decision would not be regarded " as a violation of the consensus that had been reached " ( p. 85 ) . Yet the precocious German decision aggravated those who had hoped to see a truly common EC foreign policy emerge on the former Yugoslavia . Germany thus became a scapegoat despite the fact that other governments , such as Denmark and the Netherlands , were equally supportive of Croatian and Slovenian independence . <p> Germany was also criticized for ignoring substantial human rights abuses in Croatia and the absence of security guarantees for the Serb population of Croatia . Thus , the arbitration commission established by the EC recommended that the EC postpone recognition due to questionable protection for minority rights in Croatia . In this case , Libal argues plausibly that forcing Croatia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more human rights abuses than would recognition of Croatian independence . Nonetheless , it remains arguable that Germany and the other EC states could and should have been much more vigorous in their scrutiny of the Croatian government after recognition . <p> It is clear that Germany can not be blamed for the outbreak of war in Croatia and Slovenia , as some of the more extreme critics of Germany have accused . After all , fighting erupted in June 1991 , and Germany did not shift in favor of recognition until the late summer of that year . It is more difficult to dismiss the criticism that German recognition of Croatia aggravated the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Libal is effective here , noting that the President of Bosnia-Herzegovina , Alija Izetbegovic , did not see German recognition policy as a danger to Bosnia-Herzegovina ( p. 77 ) . Moreover , it was the United States more than Germany which led the campaign to recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina in the spring of 1992 . Libal rightly views German policy as a part of the general Western underestimation of the consequences of conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride to Germany 's generosity in accepting the burden of the refugees from the former Yugoslavia beginning in 1992 . <p> To Libal , the only fault of Germany in 1991-1992 was to advocate forcefully the recognition of Slovenia and Croatia despite the full knowledge that it did not have the military and political latitude to bear the responsibilities and consequences which this would entail . " The essential flaw in German policy was of course that Germany herself could not really contribute to an implementation of the policies that logically flowed from her own attitude ; namely , to the protection , by military means if necessary , of the smaller Yugoslav republics and nations against Serb aggression " ( p. 163 ) . Yet he argues that the only alternative to recognition would have been morally irresponsible , namely , to force Slovenia and Croatia to remain in a Yugoslavia dominated by Serb nationalist-communists . <p> On a general note , Part II of Libal 's book tends to turn into a recycling of the arguments from Part I. Libal has read widely and does a strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yugoslavia 's collapse. 3 Yet to those readers who are already familiar with this literature , Libal 's arguments will be predictable after reading the first part of his book . In addition , one can not help but think that his exhaustive dismissals of the conspiracy theories surrounding German recognition of Slovenia and Croatia grant the more absurd of these theories more than their fair " day in court . " A good example of this tendency is Libal 's chapter entitled " Shadows of the Past : Did Germany Re-enact History ? " <p> In sum , Libal argues that " at all times German behavior was perfectly legitimate and perfectly consonant with the principles and the practices of European Political Cooperation sic , unless one wants to deny Germany the rights exercised by other member states ... " ( p. 150 ) . Although one can disagree with Libal 's assertion of perfect political synchronicity , his account underlines how hypersensitive other European countries were when Germany picked up the mantle of a fully sovereign foreign policy after 1989 . In the end , one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the recognition of Slovenia and Croatia was the appalling behavior of the Serbian government , military , and paramilitary troops in the fighting in the autumn of 1991 . <p> At the outset of his book , Libal notes that it is highly unusual for diplomats to write about such recent developments before retiring .

It would appear that societal development depends on how freely any society or culture combines these two in formulating blueprints for actions that address its needs . Messay Kebede 's book , Africa 's Quest for a Philosophy of Decolonization , sets out to demonstrate , through an intellectual tour of the important aspects of African philosophical discourse and with ethnophilosophy as reference point , that the problem at the core of Africa 's many problems has to do with the loss of this freedom . Believing that philosophy is an important key to the understanding of Africa , the author attempts to locate where each of the African philosophical trends imprisons this freedom so that Africans can benefit from a more integrated philosophy in their various efforts to open up their societies for development . The question of what and whose standards are to be used to measure this development is a different matter . <p> It is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound analyses of thought , African and European , into a lucid prose free of jargon . This will make the book accessible to people without professional training in philosophy . Since , in the final analysis , the book is about how to decolonize the African mind , it begins in the first of the nine chapters by painstakingly showing the errors of the architects of colonization and originators of the myth of inferiority of the African . He shows why , like all myths , this is not to be equated with knowledge , but should be seen as an enabling myth for the colonial project . In chapter 2 we get a very sympathetic reading of Placide Tempel 's Bantu Philosophy . It is difficult not to come away from the reading of the chapter with the feeling that the only thing wrong with Tempel 's view of Africans is that as a Christian clergyman , he steered what was a profound and original thinking towards the ends of his Christian mission . In the same way , Kebede gives a very sympathetic ear to John Mbiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cesaire , all constituting the school of ethnophilosophy , pointing out what he perceives as their strengths and weaknesses . On the critics of ethnophilosophy , whom he calls professional philosophers , it would seem that most people familiar with the works of Paulin Houtondji and Marcien Towa in particular would agree with Kebede 's characterization of their view of philosophy as " the ultimate incarnation of rationality , " " closing their eyes to the considerable part mysticism and irrationality play in philosophical systems " ( p. 90 ) . The one thinker who has attempted to provide an enabling myth for African renaissance , Cheikh Anta Diop , is rightly shown to be exhibiting , when the chips are down , " his allegiance to western norms " ( p. 111 ) . Kebede also makes judicious assessments of thinkers like Kwasi Wiredu and , of course , Frantz Fanon . The latter 's arguments for the healing virtue of violence in the colonial situation comes under a severe critical scrutiny . <p> When he comes to the contributions of V.Y. Mudimbe and Anthony Appiah , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as sure-footed , clearly stumbling and clutching the air in a few places . It is difficult , for instance , to fit this view of Mudimbe 's work into the general tenor of the argument : <p> " The promise of an authentic discourse on Africa seems unable to secure a vision superior or better to the one suggested by negritude . Since the best qualities ( rationality , science ) are already taken by the west , what is left for African particularity if not the lower attributes of nonrationality ? Add that relativism encourages the debunking of positive values under the pretext of uncovering western inventions ... what Mudimbe has achieved does not seem to surpass negritude " ( p. 127 ) . The same Mudimbe 's work had earlier been shown to " reiterate the absolute primacy of deconstruction , " since " what comes first is thus subjective liberation , the decolonization of the mind " and " talk about difference without hierarchy and opposition becomes possible only when western concepts are deconstructed " ( pp. 124-125 ) . <p> With the strong helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground to forcefully establish the main thesis of his book , namely , " If modernity is equally a tributary of rationality and ideological representations , we need to understand the condition under which rational thinking and ideological beliefs come to collaborate instead of impairing each other " ( p. 211 ) . Africans , in particular , need to understand how much decolonization of the mind is " a prerequisite to the rekindling of the mythical impulse suppressed by the fascination for western rationality , whose paradox is that it is itself inaccessible without some idealism " ( p. 218 ) . But before that , the author makes brilliant analyses of the problems of elitism , identity , and ethnicity in African societies . <p> Some readers may find unclear the distinction the author makes between myth and the Marxist notion of false consciousness . But more problematic questions may arise from Kebede 's notion of choice ( p. 209 ) . Choice may be a condition of freedom and self-reliance , but the question not addressed is why Africans made the choice they made . If what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of choice , " how was the decision arrived at by all Africans , if we are to avoid " racial , natural characteristics , " or " objective determinations " ( p. 209 ) ? The point is that if you adopt the " act of choice " argument , apart from the questions of how and when the choice was made , you run into problems of explaining the wisdom of any choice . The very possibility of wrong choices is a good reason to stick to the idea that there are different types of rationality and people of all races have the same potential abilities for developing them . If , as in the case of African peoples , a particular type is suppressed for historical reasons like the colonial impositions , what is required is to recuperate what has been suppressed , not " changing lanes " , but replacing what has been weakened in the engine ( p. 209 ) . This brings me to my final point . At the end of what is otherwise a good foreword , Joseph Kunkel hopes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western attitudinal opening to our brothers and sisters in this emerging continent .

Welch comments that reports given by the Lakota , Cheyenne , Crow and other Indian nations were usually dismissed as contradictory . Welch cites the example of Curly , one of Custer 's Crow scouts whose testimony was misunderstood or mistranslated or simply geared to please eager newspaper interviewers . Historians now believe that his original account may have been right on target . <p> In contrast , traditional oral history accounts are often supported by facts from unexpected sources . Dr. Beatrice Medicine tells the story of her father 's acquaintance who had visited and told him that at dawn on the day of the battle , there had been an unusual number of birds flying above the Little Bighorn River .

Private Charles Windolph ( last living white survivor of the Battle of the Little Bighorn ) writes what he saw and heard on June 25 , 1876 , as he looked down into the Little Bighorn Valley . He comments that there were great fires blazing and that there was " the steady rhythm of Indian tom-toms beating their wild victory dances " ( p. 289 ) . The perspective changes from below , from the Cheyenne perspective .

In fact the question is left open as to whose last stand it was . By the early 1890s most American Indians were already on reservations . He makes it clear that he does not want to make Custer the character the camera followed or the man whose death has always been the point of telling the story . The writers have done their homework both in oral and written history , both white and Indian . Although the index contains a complete topic reference outline with main and subheading referrals , Welch and Stekler unfortunately do not provide the useful bibliographies that such contemporary non-Indian historians as Evan Connell Son of the Morning Star , New York : Harper Perennial , 1985 and Robert Utley The Lance and the Shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All sources ( including the above ) appear in Welch 's Notes , but it is rather difficult to sift and sort them out .

Although this is the first American Indian history to include traditional Indian oral history accounts of the Little Bighorn , many historians still consider the book too Indian biased . Welch notes , " Dee Brown 's Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee was not sold at the visitor center . However , I have recently heard that the Custer Battlefield Historical and Museum Association , which had the bookselling concessions and therefore had to approve books to be sold , is no longer associated with the battlefield or the Park Service in any capacity .

History among Native Americans is oral history . Welch relates the importance of place for the Blackfeet as being in and part of that place . The author connects oral history stories to place in the retelling of the Marias Massacre ( the battle that took place between the Blackfeet camp of Chief Heavy Runner and the American Army on January 22 , 1870 . See map " The Indian Wars 1866-1890 , " pp. ii-iii . He tells the story and then brings the reader-listener one-hundred and twenty years forward , into the late twentieth century ( 1990 ) with a contemplative description of the very spot the battle took place .

Even without looking at the ... photograph , we knew what we were seeing " ( p. 43 ) . <p> There was no monument . Only a photo to guide Welch and his party to the Big Bend of the Marias River . Welch connects himself to the event as he tells the story of his great-grandmother , Red Paint Woman , a survivor of the massacre : one-hundred and seventy-three Indians were killed , fifteen fighting men , ninety women , fifty children . Contemporary field trips to the site by Blackfeet educators George Heavy Runner and Daryl Kipp , descendants of the chief and scout , help contemporary Blackfeet children understand how the massacre determined their place in Blackfeet history . The stories are not separated from the land . Relating the past places and events in story to the present is a good example of the traditional Blackfeet perception of time .

But the difference that really mattered , Welch explains , at least within a non-Indian framework , is that Custer dies and Baker did not . In Custer 's death , the myth of the savage and the fallen hero were played out to the fullest to a white reading audience in the embellishments of the press . More than this . Welch maintains that " Custer 's Last Stand has gone down in history as an example of what savagery the Indians are capable of ; the Massacre on the Marias is a better example of what man is capable of doing to man " ( p. 47 ) .

The author , a former general manager of Reuters News Service , considers western broadcasting in general , though his real focus is on the four main broadcasters of the period : the British Broadcasting Service ( BBC ) and the three American-backed networks--Voice of America ( VOA ) , Radio Free Europe ( RFE ) and Radio Liberty ( RL ) . In particular , he looks at their use of " black " broadcasting--that is propaganda disguised as news and cultural programming ( in contrast to " white " propaganda " which is simply straight propaganda ) --to wage the Cold War . According to Nelson , radio was not only an important weapon in the Cold War , but the most important weapon . Furthermore , he argues that Western broadcasting succeeded in sustaining the hope of freedom from communism one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that it was responsible for the eventual downfall of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union . <p> Arranged chronologically , the book begins with a brief discussion of international broadcasting 's early days at the start of the century . Ironically enough , it was the Soviet Union that pioneered its use to reach into the vast corners of its empire . European powers then picked up the practice to keep their own colonists and empires in touch with what was happening in the metropole . However , real development in nations ' broadcasting abroad took off in World War II , when radio provided both information to those in occupied territory and propaganda to German citizens . <p> Following the war , and especially after the onset of the Cold War , the American and British governments decided to continue and expand their international broadcasts . However , both faced domestic struggles over funding and whether or not they should be in the propaganda business ( and how anti-communistic , if at all , the tone of their radio programs should be ) . These struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author charts the fortunes of the networks throughout . Nevertheless , both governments decided that radio was an important weapon of psychological warfare in the Cold War . The BBC began broadcasting in Russian to the Soviet Union in 1946 , and the VOA followed in 1947 ( with the expansion of additional languages , nations , and broadcast hours over time ) . Not long after , the Soviet Union began jamming . The jamming continued at varying levels throughout the Cold War ( until 1988 ) , and the author notes that the level of jamming served as a fairly accurate measure of the Cold War 's temperature . <p> Nelson also looks at the role the radios played in major crises behind the Iron Curtain ( the Berlin uprising in June 1953 , Hungary in 1956 , and Czechoslovakia in 1968 ) , as well as the role they played in the 1980s with Mikhail Gorbachev 's policy of glasnost ' . Nelson ends with Boris Yeltsin 's successful use of RFE to rally support and overcome the attempted putsch of Gorbachev in August 1991 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have done work on the BBC , RFE/RL , VOA , or psychological warfare and the early Cold War. 1 However , Nelson brings much of it together in this broad overview of western broadcasting while covering the entire Cold War era . <p> A strength of the book is Nelson 's consistent attention to the reception of western broadcasts in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union . He mines Russian , British , and American sources to measure how many people were actually tuning in . He also pays attention to when they were listening--on a regular basis or during crises ( when listening increased , as well as the variety of networks listened to ) . Recent scholarship has emphasized the success of cultural programming , 2 but Nelson focuses on western news programs . For the most part he shows that people tuned in to learn about international affairs as well as news concerning their own county ( with the Chernobyl disaster being one of the more significant events as Soviet citizens first learned of it from foreign news ) . He agrees with others that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they provided more straightforward news . However , his work does reveal regional variations of listener preference , with some countries even preferring the more vitriolic RFE . While Nelson is attentive to listenership throughout the Cold War ( and hence the impact of western radio ) , his information is interspersed throughout , making it difficult to digest and difficult to judge change over time in listening habits and preference . In doing so , he simply assumes a straight continuum of success for western broadcasting . In this respect , it would have been more effective if he had devoted a single chapter to the subject , tracing listenership through the years , radio by radio , and country by country to gauge the success of the radios . <p> Nelson 's chapter on other major western networks which broadcast to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is a notable contribution to the field . Here he looks at Vatican Radio , Radio France Internationale , Radio Canada , Radio in the American Sector ( Germany ) , and Deutsche Welle . He discusses the reasons and scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Canada 's interest in broadcasting because of its large Dukhobor population and Vatican Radio 's expanded broadcasting and listenership following the ascension of John Paul II to the papal seat . In general , though , this section is much too brief and would be well worth expanding . <p> Also interesting ( though scattered throughout again ) is how people in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union used western broadcasts for their own purposes from the 1960s onward . Not only did they listen to western radio to receive information of their own country , but also to get information out to others . For example , Solidarity used RFE to broadcast the group 's meeting times and places . Nelson brings this point to a climax with Yeltsin 's use of RFE to marshal the people behind him in August 1991 , while Gorbachev listened to the BBC as he was held under house arrest in the Crimea . It is this interaction between the targeted people and the radios that bolsters Nelson 's conclusion that western radio went beyond sustaining hopes and actively helped end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must disagree with the author 's main point that radio brought the communist system down . One can agree that radio served as a way for people to learn of things happening abroad and within their own countries . One can further agree , to some extent , that the radio broadcasts ' helped sustain people 's hopes ( though one may question how true this was after 1956 , and certainly not after 1968 ) . However , in regard to western radio being the primary reason as to why communism fell apart in the end , I can not agree . Focusing on the radios alone , Nelson neglects to tell what was happening in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe through these years . He neglects the physical suppression of rebellion and dissent , the economic stagnation from the 1970s onward , as well as the moral rot of the regimes , which Gale Stokes has so elegantly pointed out elsewhere. 3 Dissatisfaction with the system was not simply a result of western radios . Rather , dissatisfaction was a result of the moral rot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies of the communist regimes themselves . People did not need western radios to tell them this . They experienced it day to day . Furthermore , with little or no hope of western intervention , people were forced to find ways of living outside the system to sustain themselves . Thus , they used the radios to fit their own purposes given their own situations . <p> Perhaps the most glaring problem with the book is that Nelson never probes the issues in any depth . In particular , Nelson claims that radio was the most important weapon in the Cold War , yet he never discusses its overall role in Cold War strategic planning or what exactly it was supposed to achieve as a measure of psychological warfare . While he notes the name change of RL ( from Radio Liberation to Radio Liberty ) , he never discusses the radio 's ( changing ) purpose--was it simply for sustaining the hope of people , to discredit communism , or was it to help pave the way for liberation ? Again , he offers no explanation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matured over time . He also does not adequately account for the continuation of western broadcasting through the 1960s and even today ( though he does note the decreased funding and broadcasting hours all faced ) . In general , more work by historians is needed on the subject of radio in the latter stages of the Cold War . <p> Nelson 's lack of depth is even more surprising given the impressive array of sources he has compiled and gone through . His bibliography and notes evince this--he cites numerous primary sources from British , American , and Russian archives , plus personal interviews that he conducted . As a broad overview this book will appeal more to a general than scholarly audience . Nonetheless , his bibliography is impressive and anyone who is planning to do work on radio warfare , psychological warfare , or any of the major international broadcasters of the Cold War will want to consult his bibliography before beginning . 69403 @qwx479403

The focus on religion highlights a dimension of city life that often does not get much attention in American urban history .

An extended meditation on religion and the city in American history , it is perhaps the most valuable part of the book . Explaining how revivalists and reformers of the nineteenth century had constructed a " normative fiction of small-town virtue " ( p. 18 ) and contrasted this with negative images of the city and those who inhabit it , Orsi goes on to outline many of the ways different religious groups have navigated American urban terrain . In fact , he says , " the truth is that much of what is characteristic of modern American religion has developed in cities " ( p. 43 ) . Taking this further , Orsi states that urban religion " is what comes from the dynamic engagement of religious traditions ( by which I mean constellations of practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing exchanges among generations and in engagement with changing social , cultural , and intellectual contexts ) with specific features of the industrial and post-industrial cityscapes and with the social conditions of city life .

Extending his study to 1990 to bring Puerto Ricans and Haitians into the mix , he describes how the former came to feel excluded from the annual festa while the latter was welcomed into it . The situation is a little different in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , an Italian and Puerto Rican neighborhood about which folklorist Joseph Sciorra weaves a well-crafted and nuanced ethnography on religious processions as ethnic and territorial markers .

Art historian David H. Brown sheds light on Vodou 's Afro-Cuban cousin , Santeria , with a lengthy account of the religion that moves from Cuba to Miami , New York , and Union City , New Jersey . Both essays help demystify these often misunderstood faiths , both of which are syncretic religions created when west African slaves and their descendants on these islands eventually merged their conception of orichas , or orishas , with Catholic saints that represented similar traits ( also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Candomble in Brazil ) .

The goals of the course were to enable students to begin to identify the myriad ways that American Indians shaped and participated in southern history and to seek ways of exposing the Indian role within southern history . Black , White , and Indian fit the bill in expected and unforeseen ways . My class read several articles from throughout the twentieth century that tried to expose the " central theme of southern history . " Indians were notably absent in all such efforts , but race , in some form or another , was nearly a constant , from the racist U. B. Phillips early in the century , insisting that southern history was best explained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's country , " to later explanations focusing on what makes the South unique from the rest of the United States , especially culturally . Southern Indians , Saunt 's book makes clear ( better than any other work presently available ) , participated in and were victimized by the entrenchment of racism and racial understandings of human abilities by southerners and Americans generally . That dichotomy between Indians as enablers of racism and Indians as victims of racism guides Saunt 's book and exposes sometimes discomforting realities of life for southern Indians since the United States arrived in their world . <p> As the subtitle suggests , this is a story about a family , the Graysons , refracted through the lens of race against the backdrop of U.S.-Indian relations from the late eighteenth through the early twentieth centuries . As other recent works on the Creeks , such as Andrew Frank 's Creeks and Southerners : Biculturalism on the Early American Frontier ( 2005 ) , have made clear , racial intermarriage was a common phenomenon among the Creeks . Unlike those other works on the Creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial ancestry became to not only American officials but also the Creeks themselves . The Creek Indian Graysons descended from Scottish trader Robert Grierson and his Creek wife Sinnugee . Grierson lived in the Creek Nation , participated in the emerging market economy , and owned African American slaves . Two of his children , William and Katy , had children with African American partners in the early nineteenth century . However , as Saunt portrays it , both William and Katy had to make momentous decisions about how they would relate to African Americans--relatives or not--in the future , and their different choices shape Grayson family relations to the present day . Katy left her African American mate and married a Creek man of high stature named Tulwa Tustanagee . She and her new family , like her father , owned slaves and pursued profit-making activities . William , on the other hand , had seven children by a Grayson slave named Judah . When Grierson died in 1823 , he left slaves and other items to Katy and other children , but nothing to William , demonstrating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William 's choice with favor whereas he did Katy 's . William worked for a decade to gain ownership of his partner and their children from another sister named Elizabeth and then headed west in 1834 to Indian Territory , where he soon had them registered as free citizens in the Western Creek Nation . Katy , her family and the rest of the surviving Graysons and their slaves arrived in the west a couple of years later , but none of them lived close to William and his family . Although , as Saunt points out , it is easy to admire William 's devotion to his family and support his decision , it was Katy 's non-African offspring who would benefit most from the decision that she made as William 's family found that they were constantly discriminated against , vulnerable to slave-catching raids , and desperately poor . <p> A major strength of Saunt 's book is how it demonstrates that Creeks crafted most of the legal discrimination that William 's children and other Creeks with African ancestry experienced in Alabama before Removal as well as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racism in the early-nineteenth-century United States became embedded and fortified in legislation passed by the Creek national government with some non-African Graysons playing a role in crafting laws that negatively impacted the status of their part-African relatives . Such legal actions worked to strengthen Creek claims to sovereignty by bringing them into line with mainstream white American thinking , while also reserving privileged access to lands and other resources to an increasingly white-looking Creek elite . The Creek national government , to put it simply , was racist , just like its American counterparts at the national and state levels . Saunt makes light but effective use of post-colonial notions about how colonized peoples embody the views of the colonizers as a sort of coping mechanism , but by focusing on one family and exposing how relatives treated each other across generations , Saunt places responsibility for these discriminatory policies squarely on the shoulders of the Creek economic elite . Though we are left to wonder how so-called full-blood Creeks with no interracial ancestry viewed these developments , since Saunt does not discuss them in depth , it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Removal to today the Creeks are a people divided deeply by race . <p> A key moment among Indians on the march towards defining peoples racially was when eastern Indians began in the late eighteenth century to speak about white , black , and red peoples being created separately by the Great Spirit . Saunt cites such talk in a speech given in 1823 or 1824 by the Seminole leader Neamathla , in which he stated that blacks were created to labor for whites and Indians , while whites were given the " weak " skills of writing and using compasses , and Indians were made as warriors . While obviously a masculine ideal , the story emphatically placed people of African descent at the bottom of the social scale at the moment that southern whites and Indians were busy making that a reality . ( Though whites held onto the single creation story found in the book of Genesis in the Bible . ) The meaning of such stories depends a great deal on the storyteller , however . In 1847 , this same " Origin of the Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man " accompanying him , made the round of southern newspapers such as the Charleston Mercury and the New Orleans Weekly Delta . In that version , the basic skills of the races remained the same , but whites were to rule and instruct the others . Ominously , the Seminole storyteller in the article warned that " while these relations exist , peace and harmony will prevail ; disturb them and no other result can follow but annihilation to the Black and Red race " ( emphasis in original ) . 1 White southerners in 1847 may have altered the original meaning of Neamathla 's story to fit their notions of race , while seeking an American Indian justification for their racist views . Though not cited by Saunt , this later version of the Seminole separate creations story also supports the trajectory of Creek and white American understandings of the racial hierarchy that he exposes . Once in Indian Territory , after Removal , elite Creeks increasingly emphasized their European ancestry and tried to define Creeks with any amount of African blood as black and second-class . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal citizenship was Katy Grayson 's grandson , George Washington Grayson , known as " Wash . " Wash fought for the Confederacy , lost an economic fortune when Oklahoma statehood abolished communally held Creek lands , and became chief of the Creeks in the early twentieth century . It was Wash 's autobiography that prompted Saunt to explore this topic of race among the Creeks in order to explain the numerous ellipses in the book when topics of African ancestry among the Creeks , especially among Wash 's relatives , arose. 2 Wash was certainly a racist and hypocritical for denying the existence of his African-Creek relatives . Saunt suggests that the level of Wash 's hypocrisy went beyond denying that he had relatives with African blood ( a not uncommon southern phenomenon ) , to denying that Katy 's other offspring had African ancestry as well . Controversy about the racial identity of the Grayson descendants starts with the first coupling between Grierson and Sinnugee , for Saunt claims that Sinnugee , being from the " Spanalgee or Spanish clan , " was a captive or run-away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Sinnugee 's racial identity is probably impossible to ascertain beyond a doubt , and some of Wash 's contemporary descendants vehemently deny the possibility of African ancestry ( pp. 213-14 ) .

On one level it is a routine seventeenth-century witchcraft case , remarkable only for the wealth of documentation it generated and for the fact that it was deliberately orchestrated by the father of the bewitched girl . At another level it is distinctly unusual : it was investigated by Oxford dons , by a bishop and an archbishop , and even by King James I. It led to the acquittal of the witches and the trial of their accuser in Star Chamber . Earlier historians of witchcraft have briefly touched on the case , but Sharpe is the first to examine it in detail . <p> Anne Gunter grew up in the village of North Moreton , a dozen miles from Oxford . Her family had University connections . Her older sister was married to Thomas Holland , Regius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Gunters were newcomers to North Moreton and did not get on well with the group of yeomen who ran the village . Brian Gunter , Anne 's father , was not one of the vanishing breed of paternalist squires idealised in rural mythology . He was in fact in the business of buying up impropriated tithes : Sharpe describes him as " an interloper who was creaming off wealth from local farmers " ( p. 39 ) , and it is no surprise that he was unpopular in the neighborhood . In 1598 there was a brawl at a local football match . Brian Gunter was a spectator , and in the course of the fight he assaulted two of the participants ( the brothers John and Richard Gregory ) so violently that they both died a few days later . Their relatives tried to get Gunter indicted for manslaughter . They were unsuccessful , but Gunter never forgave them for the attempt . <p> His revenge , a few years later , took the form of a witchcraft accusation against one of the Gregory clan : Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good choice . She was a notorious troublemaker , always at odds with her neighbors ; a scold , in the language of the times . Such women were often accused of witchcraft : the chief fault of witches , the sceptical Reginald Scot observed , " is that they are scolds . " When in 1604 Anne Gunter began to exhibit the familiar signs of demonic possession -- fits and contortions , trances , insensibility to pain -- Elizabeth Gregory was a credible suspect , and Anne duly denounced her and two other , more marginal , village women for bewitching her . Anne 's most impressive symptoms were her ability to spit pins from her mouth , and to have them stuck into her without apparently feeling pain . People came from miles around to watch , and her brother-in-law took her to Oxford to be inspected by such well-known academics as John Prideaux and another Exeter don , Thomas Winniffe , who like Prideaux was to end his career as a bishop . All these great minds were convinced that Anne 's fits were genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuted for witchcraft at Abingdon Assizes . As Sharpe reminds us , less than half of witchcraft accusations led to convictions , but Brian Gunter must have felt that his chances were good . <p> Enter the hero of the story , a Wiltshire gentleman named Thomas Hinton , who was distantly related to the Gunters . Hinton heard about Anne 's fits , and came to join the spectators at North Moreton . Originally open-minded about her symptoms , he then had second thoughts and conducted some surreptitious tests which convinced him that she was a fraud . He also voluntarily attended the trial and used his connections to warn the judges that there were suspicious features of the affair . The result was a much more careful examination of the evidence than was usual at witchcraft trials , or indeed at any other kind of trial , and the three accused women were acquitted . Without Hinton 's intervention they would probably all have been hanged . <p> This , however , was not the end of the story . Brian Gunter did not give up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1605 he somehow managed to present Anne to him . It was a serious mistake . James had written a book on witchcraft , but he was not totally credulous , and he turned the matter over to Archbishop Richard Bancroft , who was distinctly sceptical . And so it all came out . Brian Gunter had induced Anne ( by methods that included abusive bullying ) to accuse the North Moreton women ; he had coached her in spitting pins , and had used drugs to put her into trances and enable her to withstand extreme pain . He was tried before the Star Chamber for subverting the course of justice , and although Sharpe 's sources do not reveal the final verdict , it is clear that he was permanently disgraced . <p> Sharpe is an admirable guide through these historical thickets . His book is aimed primarily at the intelligent general reader , and one can imagine its being extremely useful for advanced undergraduates in history or in English literature . But specialists will also find much to interest them , if only because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possible interpretations . He provides useful explanations of the legal issues , and of the procedures in the Star Chamber and Assize courts in which the case was heard . His descriptions of church court and manorial records will enable people engaging with the early modern period for the first time to understand how historians do this kind of microhistory . Instead of footnotes , there are detailed bibliographical references for each chapter at the end of the text , and these adequately describe the sources , though scholarly readers are likely to wish for more precise annotation . Sharpe has written an earlier , more wide-ranging book on witchcraft ( Instruments of Darkness , 1996 ) , and has an impressive grasp of early modern publications on the subject ; some of these were also sufficiently known to Brian Gunter to enable him to give his daughter the necessary coaching . Sharpe is equally at home in the even more mountainous accumulation of recent secondary works , though for this audience he wisely confines himself to summaries of a few of the best known interpretations -- Keith Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated academic debates that are liable to scare off the non-specialist reader . <p> Inevitably there are places where eyebrows will be raised . Sharpe is sometimes inclined to take court depositions too much at face value , without making allowance for the biases of witnesses chosen by the two sides . He also tends to downplay the assumptions about gender that surely explain why witchcraft accusations were so overwhelmingly targeted at women ; there is no evidence , he says , that Agnes Pepwell , one of the other defendants , was being " victimized by a male-dominated , misogynist clerical or legal establishment " ( p. 89 ) . Well , perhaps not , but the fact remains that when Brian Gunter wanted revenge against the Gregorys he accused one of women of the family , not one of the men . He is right that this time the judicial system was reasonably fair to the accused . But this was largely the result of Hinton 's intervention , and the fact that both the judges and the jury at Abingdon were remarkably conscientious . We should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grisly outcome of Matthew Hopkins 's accusations in East Anglia thirty years later shows . <p> One can easily question parts of a book and yet still recognize its value over all .

As in all the best examples of microhistory , an intrinsically interesting story is successfully used to throw light on wider issues .

Gould ( Department of History , University of New Hampshire ) Published on H-Albion ( July , 2001 ) <p> An Empire Imagined <p> An Empire Imagined <p> Considered as an intellectual construct , the so-called First British Empire possessed an impressive pedigree . Its progenitors included historians from classical antiquity , medieval scholastics , Renaissance humanists , and theologians on both sides of the Reformation 's schism . Cicero , Geoffrey of Monmouth , and Richard Hakluyt the younger each played a part in its conception , as did both Cromwells ( Thomas and Oliver ) and James VI and I. Yet , despite this lineage , the fully articulated concept of the British Empire that Pitt embraced , Hume criticized , and Jefferson repudiated lasted barely half a century . For a brief period during the eighteenth century 's middle decades , it was the normative community with which Britons throughout the Atlantic identified , in London no less than Glasgow , Dublin , Kingston , or Philadelphia . Even at its apogee , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffeted from the 1760s onward by the twin forces of American independence and Britain 's " swing to the East , " the empire shed many ( though hardly all ) of the characteristics that had originally defined it . When most people speak of the British Empire today , it is usually the nineteenth-century successor empire in Asia and Africa that they have in mind . <p> So David Armitage depicts the early modern formation of Britain 's imperial identity in his fascinating new book , The Ideological Origins of the British Empire . Following a path blazed by J.G.A. Pocock , P.J. Marshall , Colin Kidd , Kathleen Wilson , Sir John Elliott , Richard Koebner , Jack P. Greene , Steven Pincus , Nicholas Canny , and many others , Armitage achieves a remarkable synthesis . The British Empire 's ideological origins , Armitage maintains , lay in its self-conception as an extensive polity at once " Protestant , commercial , maritime and free " ( p. 195 ) . In tracing the origins of this concept , Armitage emphasizes three crucially important points : that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as a means to describe " the Three Kingdoms of Britain and Ireland , " that a more extensive definition that included the Caribbean and North America was largely the work of " creole elites and imperial officials " during the later seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries , and that , even after " an integrated concept of the British Empire ... became dominant " during the 1730s , the concept did not go " unchallenged , " either in Britain proper or in Ireland and the colonies ( pp. 7-8 ) . <p> The most impressive feature of the Ideological Origins is its temporal and spatial reach . In addition to considerable archival research , the book draws on scholarship covering nearly two centuries of British and Atlantic history , including all of England , Scotland , and Ireland , as well as North America and the Caribbean . Given Armitage 's propensity for making unexpected connections--an article published several years ago paid simultaneous homage to the high Victorian imperialist J. R. Seeley and Joan Wallach Scott1--this scope is hardly surprising . Still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely dispersed material is striking . <p> Of Armitage 's various intellectual debts , none is more intriguing than the one suggested by his book 's title . Despite its extraordinary influence , Bernard Bailyn 's Ideological Origins of the American Revolution ( 1967 ) has spawned few imitative titles . The most likely explanation for this relative absence is the United States 's peculiar claim to be a nation founded on an ideal ( or set of ideals ) . By arguing that the British Empire also had an ideological origin ( or origins ) , Armitage implicitly opens the possibility that the ideas discussed in his book played the same sort of instrumental role that they do in Bailyn 's account . However , Armitage is careful not to push this analogy too far . In the introduction , he writes that his purpose is " not to claim that the origins of the British Empire can be found only in ideology " ( p. 5 ) . Likewise , the book 's final chapter , which delineates the British Empire 's transformation during the late 1730s from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to making ideas of empire the causal agent but again stops short . As Armitage explains in the introduction , " an origin can be either a beginning or a cause " ( p. 5 ) . Although clearly tempted to attribute the latter meaning to the British Empire 's ideological origins , he ultimately settles for the former , adding as a further qualification that by ideology he simply means " the transferability and the contestability " of Britain 's imperial self-conception ( p. 195 ) . For Bailyn , ideology produced " rebellion , " " transformation , " and an irresistible " contagion of liberty . " 2 By contrast , Armitage concludes that , because Britain 's understanding of itself as an empire was never universally accepted ( either in Britain or in Ireland and the colonies ) , the most one can say is that it is " a classic example of an identity that was originally an ideology " ( p. 198 ) . <p> In the main , Armitage is wise to hedge his conclusions in this manner . For a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Revolution , the imperial ideology ( or identity ) whose origins Armitage so deftly narrates did assume a transformative , programmatic quality in Britain . Although this greater British ideology/identity was entirely consistent with Parliament 's successive attempts to tax the American colonists , its underlying dynamism was not unlike that which Bailyn attributed to American revolutionary ideology in the years before the Declaration of Independence. 3 Perhaps the most striking part of the British Empire 's conceptual ascendancy in Britain , however , was the rapidity with which metropolitan Britons abandoned it . Following France 's recognition of the United States , Parliament enacted a new Declaratory Act ( 1778 ) , renouncing forever its right to tax Britain 's colonies for revenue and effectively ending any possibility that the extra-European territories of the British Empire might become part of an integrated national community in the manner envisioned by Armitage 's projectors . Although the American Revolution lies beyond the scope of Armitage 's book , this transformation ultimately confirms his argument . Even at the height of late Victorian and Edwardian imperialism , the British Empire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , despite its commercial and strategic integration , retained many features of the early modern composite state ( or empire ) from which it had evolved. 4 <p> In places , Armitage 's references to the secondary literature are less extensive than one might wish . No doubt , related considerations of length and cost are partly to blame . Had Armitage cited every source from the enormous literature to which his book relates , the result would have been a volume far too expensive for course adoption or--in some cases--library acquisition . Still , several omissions are surprising . Foremost among these is the absence of any discussion of J.G.A. Pocock 's Machiavellian Moment ( 1975 ) , despite a lengthy section on the English/British reception of Machiavelli 's corpus , especially the Discorsi ( pp. 125-45 , passim , and 155-6 ) . Although not all of Pocock 's admirers ( or critics ) have read--let alone understood--his famously difficult magnum opus , it would have been helpful for Armitage to clarify how his own interpretation differs . <p> All in all , however , The Ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first importance to the ongoing attempt to write the history ( or histories ) of the early modern British Empire and the British Atlantic world . By bridging two centuries , three dynasties , and four geographically distinct subdisciplines , each of which has all too often been studied in isolation from the others , it lays down markers that British historians will henceforth need to address . By its very contentiousness , Armitage 's book is certain to stir debate ; because of its geographical and chronological reach , that discussion is likely to be widespread .

Melish ( Department of History , University of Kentucky ) Published on H-SHEAR ( January , 2000 ) <p> Generations of historians have struggled to explain the sudden emergence and rapid growth of a militant 1830s abolitionist movement in the north within a society of whites who seemed quite removed from slavery but were largely hostile to the free African Americans in their midst . A number of vigorous debates has concerned the relationship between market revolution and reform : What might be the common characteristics of reformers and activists , as distinguished from those who adapted more comfortably to the market economy ? What led a few reformers to adopt antislavery , and specifically immediatism ( as opposed to colonization and other gradualist schemes ) ? How did a small band of promoters of a socially repugnant and putatively dangerous set of ideas succeed in building a sizeable following in a decidedly hostile environment in a mere decade ? <p> The most interesting question ( at least to me ) , concerns motive and meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a racial ideology distinct from the prevailing antebellum assumptions about black inferiority on the one hand and white prejudice on the other , both widely believed to be innate and permanent in their respective hosts .

In short , was the theoretical foundation of immediatism the opposition to slavery or the opposition to racism ? <p> Paul Goodman explores all of these questions in Of One Blood , a book nearly completed at the time of his death in 1995 . He begins with events in the late 1820s that led to the first conversions to immediatism of supporters of gradualist measures to end slavery . One of the strongest elements of his book is the attention Goodman gives to the crucial role of African Americans in the crystallization of the immediatist movement . After the successful achievement of gradual emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century , antislavery activists turned their attention toward southern slavery with the same gradualist measures in mind . After 1816 , virtually all of them , along with new antislavery converts , enthusiastically embraced the American Colonization Society 's program to foster the removal of free blacks to Africa , ostensibly in order to bring slavery to an end . This was based on the notion that white prejudice and black inferiority made the large-scale emancipation of slaves impossible as long as they might be expected to remain in the United States as freedmen . It was the militant , almost universal rejection of colonization by African Americans and their clear-eyed unmasking of the program as a strategy to shore up slavery , not to bring about its demise , that converted Simeon Jocelyn , William Lloyd Garrison , and other antislavery activists from colonization to immediatism . Personal experiences with African American leaders and communities was also an important factor in convincing the early immediatists to reject the very premise of the ACS -- that blacks could not perform capably and morally as free members of American society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon their racial prejudice and support black freedom and equality . <p> For the belief in racial equality constituted the guiding principle of the abolitionist movement , Goodman contends . Abolishing slavery , while it remained the primary goal , was a project whose success hinged on the eradication of whites ' racial prejudice ; hence the advocacy of racial equality , in Goodman 's view , was really the central work of the abolitionists . This is the most passionately argued , and yet , for me , ultimately least convincing , aspect of this book , to which Goodman returns in his last chapter , and to which I will return at the end of this review . <p> How did the abolitionist leadership come to this conviction and this work ?

He concludes that the early white abolitionist leaders were repelled by the emerging market economy and disillusioned with the accommodation made to it by traditional religion . <p> In response , they sought to " sacralize everyday life " and " impose moral order on social order " through their passionate commitment to the abolition of slavery and the eradication of white prejudice . Immediatism also served to mediate anxiety about manhood and effeminacy by " appropriating religiosity and moral leadership as fundamental to true manhood " and not simply " preeminently feminine " ( 101 ) . White women who became early movement leaders responded to the new opportunities and new limitations that constituted " conflicting new conceptions of womanhood " within the emergent industrial order . Goodman 's argument on the motivations of northern reform seems in some ways to be a gendered variation on the " social dislocation " argument first made made just after the turn of the century by Frank T. Carlton and reinvigorated in several different forms periodically thereafter .

He argues that abolitionism attracted a broad range of classes and occupational categories , drawing mass support among wage earners , artisans , mechanics , family farmers , and small proprietors . He credits the agency system and the establishment of a network of local abolition societies with building mass support . Agents also employed a strategy of inviting members of the popular American Colonization Society to engage in debates in order to draw large audiences .

" They never wavered in their belief in equality , " he insists ( 62 ) , and " they grounded their belief in human equality in faith " ( 246 ) . He makes this case most convincingly for Jocelyn and Garrison , much less so for the other individuals he highlights . Of course , Garrison 's later attacks on Frederick Douglass , culminating in his general observation in the December 16 , 1853 , Liberator , that essentially blacks were unable " as a class " to understand abolitionism ( ! ) , suggest that even Garrison had not internalized an abstraction he clearly embraced intellectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodman 's analysis -- Nathan Paul noted , in a speech to the Albany Anti-Slavery Convention in March of that year , that there were " two kinds of abolitionists , " those who hate both slavery and prejudice and those who " as bad as they hate slavery , hate a man who wears a colored skin worse " ( published in Friend of Man , March 14 , 1838 ) . <p> Goodman does not discuss African Americans ' ideas about white abolitionists ' racial attitudes and behavior , and he does not show sustained interaction between black and white abolitionists . It is true that in his ten-year time frame , most African American antislavery activists were willing , at least publicly , to take at face value and even to praise warmly the efforts white abolitionists were making to combat race prejudice . However , the disillusionment many of them expressed in the years that followed must be taken into account , I think , in evaluating the movement 's commitment and ultimate legacy . <p> African Americans appear in this book collectively as a catalyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crucial point ; but thereafter , " abolitionists " are white . Since the subtitle suggests that " abolitionism " and " equality " are the objects of study here , the argument would have been complicated and strengthened if the ongoing efforts of black abolitionists to combat both racism and slavery had remained a vital part of the narrative , and if the involvement in certain quarters and lack of involvement in others between black and white activists in the period were critically addressed . <p> This leads me to an admittedly cranky objection to the book 's subtitle , " The Origins of Racial Equality . " This phrasing implies that there IS a state of being called " racial equality " that began to become a reality in the early abolitionist movement -- a point of view that I do not think is supportable , alas . Of course , Goodman may have meant to suggest merely that the IDEA of racial equality as a social innovation emerged in the context of the movement ; but the text as well as the title phrasing seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milieu . <p> Nonetheless , this book offers a powerful and thought-provoking reinterpretation of the abolitionist movement . Particularly important is the contribution it makes to our understanding of the relationship between reform and capitalism , the mechanics of building the first mass social movement that appealed to Americans across class lines , and the ways in which at least some Americans tried to negotiate a path between racial ideology , moral conviction and republican ideals . <p> A final technical note : The reader might want to be aware that the entry for this book in Books in Print , and the publisher 's own blurb , gives the number of pages as 426 .

Imagine the intensity of the moment , the palpable pangs of spiritual bliss , anguish , and surrender all around as Sister Aimee draws your seatmates into her fanciful world of biblical prophets and priests , heroes and villains . And what must it have been like to stand with thirty thousand others gathered at Los Angeles ' train station on that June day in 1926 , cheering rapturously at the first sight of Sister Aimee after her return from a mysterious disappearance ; or to sit nervously in the court room later that same year as she attempted to answer the mystery and defend herself against charges of conspiracy ? <p> That such sentiments stir frequently when reading Matthew Sutton 's biography of Aimee Semple McPherson is tribute to his rare story-telling abilities . By pricking the emotions as much as intellectual curiosity , Sutton provides us with an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate the cultural opportunities , pitfalls , and blessings of her day . At the same time , he offers room to feel what it would have been like to be part of McPherson 's multitude of followers or cadre of critics . McPherson was , to say the least , a polarizing figure . All who encountered her during her lifetime thus seemed compelled to declare publicly their feelings of loyalty or loathing for the female evangelist . Sutton asks us to suspend such judgment and instead carefully measure the intensity of these responses against the realities of the day--against the constantly expanding range of possibilities that seemed only to encourage Sister Aimee 's exploits , well meaning and successful , poorly conceived , or otherwise . <p> As much as Sutton rouses sympathy for McPherson , he also subjects her to sharp but balanced criticism . His eagerness to analyze Sister Aimee within the political and cultural context of her day is the book 's driving impulse and organizational determinant . Based on an impressive mound of research findings , most of them gleaned from previously un-viewed sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evangelical Protestant denomination McPherson founded ) , Sutton 's narrative moves through nine chapters . In each he effectively connects McPherson to one or more of the touchstone issues of her day . Prominent among these are race relations , interregional migration , urban boosterism , media and broadcasting , federal social policy , and wartime mobilization , all of which animated Southern California between the early 1920s and early 1940s , McPherson 's prime years as a public figure and the focus of Sutton 's book . Drawn together as a whole , these dimensions promote a central claim : that by actively investing herself in these issues , McPherson " brought conservative Protestantism back from the margins to the mainstream of American culture " and ultimately helped reshape the social , cultural , and political destiny of " one of the twentieth century 's most explosive religious **25;1679;TOOLONG " ( pp. 3-4 ) . This thesis is not necessarily pivotal on its own terms , nor is it meant to be , for this is a book meant for a broad readership to enjoy as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , Sutton 's thesis demonstrates significant scholarly weight . Three examples drawn from different sections of the book illustrate this point . <p> Early in his book , Sutton describes McPherson 's use of media to promote the peculiar blend of pentecostalism and fundamentalism that became the cornerstone of her own denomination . Many of McPherson 's contemporaries chastised her for embracing these forms ; many writers since have followed this line of criticism by seeing Sister Aimee as little more than a media hound desperate for mass approval and full acceptance by her Hollywood friends . But Sutton follows a different track by suggesting that McPherson 's motives were authentic and sincere . By blending piety and performance she hoped to embody " faith before her constituency 's very eyes " and , in the process , rivet their attention to classic revivalist themes ( p. 69 ) . By linking faith and the media in this way McPherson ultimately fused the two , making the essence of theology inseparable from the manner of its delivery . The formula became one for other twentieth-century evangelists to follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McPherson and gender , a theme curiously understudied by others . Sutton demonstrates how constructions and prescriptions of gender during the formative 1920s often played out in the religious sphere . In the person of Sister Aimee , people of all ideological stripe found a " malleable symbol , " one onto which they could project their meanings of womanhood ( p. 128 ) . Not surprisingly , the intensely masculine fundamentalist world in which McPherson operated ( or tried to operate ) was outright hostile to her leadership claims . Los Angeles ' own champion of fundamentalism , " Fighting " Bob Shuler , was usually the one to vocalize this hostility by highlighting Sister Aimee 's drift away from accepted standards of female propriety . However , in the pews of Los Angeles ' evangelical churches ( especially pentecostal ones ) , Sister Aimee also found support from parishioners willing to suspend their Victorian Protestant views of limited female authority for the sake of effective evangelism . What Sutton makes clear is that religious priorities sometimes worked at cross-purposes when gender was concerned . The picture becomes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sutton is most effective at highlighting ways McPherson galvanized gender debates among " secular " liberals . For male liberal critics in the media McPherson 's penchant for drama raised doubts about her ability to lead women and the church respectfully into the modern age . For the era 's " new women , " however , McPherson represented the much-needed breakthrough . Although hardly religious or socially conservative like their champion , these young flappers identified with Sister Aimee 's " career success in terrain dominated by males , her defiance of social convention , and her unwavering determination to create her own public persona " ( p. 128 ) . What Sutton shows , then , is that when premised on gender , the sources of McPherson 's support and opposition were usually difficult to predict . <p> Finally , by the book 's end one is left with a more complex understanding of religion and politics in the interwar period . At present , historians tend to assume that conservative evangelical Protestants operated only on the political fringe during this time , either as voices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety , or as an insignificant minority embarrassed into submission by the recent failings of fundamentalist politicos like William Jennings Bryan . Yet McPherson 's career offers correction to such assumptions . Although often sympathetic to demagogues like Winrod and willing to speak as if hers was an embattled minority , McPherson more commonly drew energy from active involvement in mainstream political processes availed her by California 's unique political environment . Whether in opposition to the teaching of evolution in California 's schools or advances made by Upton Sinclair 's EPIC ( End Poverty in California Campaign ) , whether in the promotion of social welfare programs or support of the working class , McPherson demonstrated a political consciousness that was rather sophisticated and respectable for her time . She also wielded considerable political influence through official channels and effective lobbying , making her voice heard in each level of government , all the way from Los Angeles ' City Council to the White House . In short , what Sutton offers through McPherson is a paradigm-altering picture of evangelicalism 's sustained politicization through the 1920s and 1930s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skills at drawing out the dramatic flair of Sister Aimee 's life and using central themes in this story to challenge assumptions about the workings of faith , politics , and culture . At times his eagerness to do both simultaneously gets the better of him . From its beginning , Sutton 's narrative heads steadily toward McPherson 's peak performance in 1926 : her mysterious disappearance . Sutton spends considerable time in the middle chapters of the book describing and offering suggestive explanations of this event . All of this proves quite riveting ; yet the pinnacle comes too soon . Sutton uses his last three chapters to explain McPherson 's social and political activities in the 1930s and early 1940s , all of which are impressive and important but none of which match the intensity of what came prior to the disappearance . And by this time the reader is left with an uncertainty about whether to take McPherson--and her religious , social , and political activism--seriously , or at least as seriously as before . Of course , much of this is out of Sutton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by emphasizing the drama of the disappearance in the mid-1920s , Sutton slightly dampens the impact of McPherson 's more substantive activities in the mid-1930s . <p> The privileging of dramatic effect also leads to a second minor shortcoming . Perhaps in an effort to broaden its marketing appeal , Sutton 's book often makes mention of Sister Aimee 's direct bearing on recent American politics . On the jacket cover and in paragraphs scattered throughout the text readers learn that McPherson 's life is a prologue to the life and times of Pat Robertson , Jerry Falwell , and George W. Bush . Of course there is a connection between McPherson and the latter , but it is misleading to hint that it is any more direct or important than the one linking other pre-1940s evangelicals ( like Fighting Bob Shuler ) with the post-1980s Christian Right . And it is a bit illusory to suggest this connection when little sustained analysis of the forty years in between is forthcoming . So in an effort to make his subject count in the flourishing field of late twentieth-century conservatism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as if this " relevance " can only be defined in relation to present political concerns . <p> But the true worth of McPherson is that her life is incredibly relevant for a fresh understanding of American life prior to World War II . Sutton , in the main , recognizes this , and offers us multiple ways of approaching and applying this new understanding . In the process he also offers us a first-rate scholarly model of substantive historical investigation , intellectual engagement , and stimulating writing .

Jeffrey Wasserstrom echoes this in " The Chinese Revolution and Contemporary Paradoxes " which traces the complex relationship between the various promises of rights during both before , during , and after the Chinese revolution . In this piece Wasserstrom cautions against idealizing the pre-European contact , pointing out that Europeans did not need to instruct the dominant Hans in demonizing other ethno-linguistic groups . He also warns against simple explanations for fluctuating parameters of rights under the protean situation in the PRC . <p> The next section examines the roles of the English , American and Russian revolutions in the further development of human rights .

Michael Zuckert , in " Natural Rights in the American Revolution : The American Amalgam " explores how the American Revolution embraced two theories of rights : that of a Creator or " nature " being the origins of rights , and the belief that these rights are the endowment " of all men " ( p. 67 ) . This led to a situation in which the American commitment to republicanism was critically bound up in the basis of human rights in natural law possessed by all men , a formulation of rights both paradoxical and powerful . Yanni Kotsonis , " A European Experience : Human Rights and Citizenship in Revolutionary Russia , " examines how the influence of the Enlightenment diffusing from the West influenced the debate over human rights in the Czarist and Soviet periods .

The next section of the book examines Asian and African cases . Alexander Woodside , in " An Enlightenment for Outcasts : Some Vietnamese Stories , " argues that Vietnamese conceptualizations of rights must be understood as a complex overlay of pre-colonial conceptions of rights and those imported by European Enlightenment streams of thought , including Marxism . Woodside highlights a positive aspect of the legacy of the revolutionary promise of rights , a sense of hope of improvement of rights--leading away from a " swampland " of rights never promised , let alone delivered ( p. 109 ) . Sumit Ganguly , in " India , Human Rights , and ' Asian Values ' " continues on in this vein by examining the case of India . India , according to Ganguly , is unique in not asserting that there was a separate and distinct " Asian " approach to defining human rights , as argued in the mid to late 1990s by Singapore 's Yew .

This echoes what is now a unifying theme in the chapters of this volume , that civil societies , rather than revolutionary movements or states , offer the best hope of protecting human rights and offering definitions of human rights that can force the state to codify these rights into law . <p> In the final chapter of this section , Timothy McDaniel 's " The Strange Career of Political Islam " the relationship between Islam and revolutionary attempts to transform rights is traced in detail .

" This is unfortunate , because the volume could have been improved by a final chapter that offered a more comprehensive perspective that outlined future directions for researching the vein of inquiry mapped out well by this volume . For Grandin , a key dynamic that intersects with the factors that produced the contemporary status of rights is the legacy of American imperialism and hegemony , principally the promises encoded in the United Nations ' Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which has by the early 21st century left nothing save for a legacy of hope that motivates civil society : the decentralized social , political and economic movements that offer a way to navigate between " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights in Latin America and throughout the world ( p. 210 ) . <p> This volume would be ideal for advanced undergraduate courses or survey graduate courses investigating human rights and/or revolutions or revolutionary violence ( including classes examining state terrorism and violent political movements and " terrorism " ) .

Scholars , beginning with Ollinger Crenshaw in the 1940s , have seen the so-called Texas Troubles as an important step toward secession , particularly helping to create the psychological context for action. 1 The history and character of that panic , however , has never been explored fully prior to this work . Donald E. Reynolds , professor emeritus at Texas A&amp;M at Commerce , explores the events that caused the widespread alarm , the response of local communities , and the extent to which concerns for Texas matters became important to other Southerners . A particularly important part of Reynolds 's study is its evaluation of the reliability of the stories that generated the event , an effort that leads him to his finding that no credible evidence exists of a planned uprising . He goes on to suggest that the plot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the events that summer not only were important but also may have played a decisive role in setting the path of Texans toward secession . <p> Reynolds 's portrait of events surrounding the panic in the summer of 1860 is based on extensive , and impressive , research in contemporary newspapers , bolstered by the use of relevant manuscript materials . He graphically portrays how fear of an insurrection spread following the Dallas fire . Contemporaries initially believed it was caused by the spontaneous combustion of new phosphorous matches , but fires in other nearby locations fed a growing concern that slave arsonists were behind the blaze and that their actions were part of a plan by Northern antislavery men to produce a slave rebellion . In the weeks after the first fires , reports of the destruction or attempted destruction of other Texas towns filled local papers and fueled fear . Subsequent news that caches of arms and large quantities of poisons had been uncovered confirmed in the minds of white Texans that their state was the target of nefarious abolitionist designs . <p> Texans responded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction . Across the state , townspeople created vigilance committees that acted aggressively against suspected rebels . Not surprisingly , given their methods of coercion , they secured from slaves confessions of plans for fires and murder elsewhere . State newspapers published items reporting the punishment and execution of culpable slaves in widespread communities . Whites suspected of being part of the plot were either lynched or ordered out of the South . In the most notorious instance , a posse from Fort Worth pursued an accused Northern Methodist missionary , Anthony Bewley , into southern Missouri , brought him back to Fort Worth , and surrendered him to a lynch mob . <p> Word of events in Texas spread widely , and Reynolds 's thorough examination of Southern newspapers shows that the press gave them significant play through the summer and early autumn . Stridently secessionist and state 's rights publications presented the Texas stories as factual , using them to predict what would happen if Abraham Lincoln were elected president and the South lost all protection of the national government . Even pro-Union newspapers generally accepted the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they downplayed the possibility of a widespread plot . <p> The key to Reynolds 's broader conclusions concerning the purposeful manipulation of public opinion by newspaper editors and the impact on contemporary political events is his discovery of the lack of any real evidence for either the purposeful setting of any of the fires or the existence of a conspiracy to cause a slave rebellion . Recent historians of Texas history have tended to discount contemporary theories of an abolitionist plot , but Reynolds conclusively shows that none existed . No contemporaries initially believed the fires in Dallas and nearby communities were started by incendiaries , nor was any evidence produced to demonstrate otherwise . In the end , only the fact that several fires occurred at roughly the same time led suspicious Texans to think that arsonists might have been at work . The reports of other fires that appeared afterward often were spurious . None of the accounts of the discovery of weapons and poison proved accurate . One of the most widely published pieces of evidence of an insurrection plot , a letter outlining abolitionist plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only evidence supporting a conspiracy theory was the testimony coerced from slaves . <p> The fact that there was no evidence supporting the idea of an abolitionist conspiracy and that newspaper editors published outright lies that fed a white panic leads Reynolds to his hypothesis that the Texas Troubles were created purposefully in an effort to push Texans and other Southerners toward secession . That conclusion follows , however , only by inference . Unquestionably , the sole source of information on the alleged conspiracy was baseless and sometimes creative contemporary newspaper reporting . Reynolds also shows that fire-eating Southern politicians readily used Texas events for their purposes , particularly to promote voter turnout for George Breckenridge and possibly to encourage secession . In the end , however , there is no direct evidence concerning the intentions of the newspaper editors or of the reporters who publicized the plot and went so far as to manufacture false accounts of fires , weapons , and poison . Charles Pryor , editor of the Dallas Herald whose letters to newspapers across the state first warned of a slave threat , left no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither did other lesser-known Texas newsmen . It is possible that their goal was secession , but the evidence will allow little more than speculation . <p> That the Texas Troubles played a decisive role in pushing forward Texas and the South to secession also is a conclusion that is largely speculative , and Reynolds recognizes this . He shows that events in Texas were unquestionably on the minds of Texans in the critical months leading up to secession . At the same time , he acknowledges that many other events , from Bloody Kansas to John Brown , had already poisoned the political process by this time . Which , if any , particular event may have been decisive remains an untested premise . <p> The historian of the South and the American Civil War will find in this book a superb dissection of a slave panic . Reynolds is at his best in describing how a fire in a Texas town was transformed into a regionwide panic that led to violent suppression of anyone suspected of contributing to or even considering rebellion .

He has been the scholar probably most responsible for the emergence of what some critics call a neo-revisionist interpretation of the origins of the Civil War . The historians who write in this vein echo a central theme of the work of revisionist historians Avery Crandall and J. G. Randall : they emphasize the degree to which the Civil War could have and perhaps should have been averted . Vigorously defending this position , Holt has long criticized historians who contend " that sectional conflict over slavery and slavery extension caused the Civil War . " 1 Instead , he has argued in a series of influential books and articles that contingent political factors played the predominant role in stimulating disunion . <p> Holt 's latest book , retracing much the same ground in greatly abbreviated fashion , does not break from the mold . " To locate the most direct causes of the American Civil War , " he contends in the preface , " one must look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that horrific conflict " ( p. xiii ) . His purpose , therefore , in writing The Fate of Their Country was not to " recant " his prior interpretations , but rather to attract new , non-specialist readers ( p. xiii ) . If so , the book already rates as a magnificent success . It comes in at a breezy 127 pages , and also includes a 30-page appendix of 8 valuable primary source political documents ( 7 excerpted ) , ranging from Lewis Cass ' 1847 " Nicholson letter " to William Seward 's " Irrepressible Conflict " speech in October 1858 . In conjunction with the primary source documents , Holt 's brevity makes the book ideal for course adoption , and moreover will be no small relief to those who have read his small-print , 1,248-page magnum opus on the American Whig Party . One can only imagine the gratitude of his editors . <p> The book is structured very simply , with an opening chapter titled " Pandora 's Box , " and three subsequent chapters titled " The Wilmot Proviso , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act . " The book 's structure , length , and subject of study are reminiscent of Don E. Fehrenbacher 's The South and Three Sectional Crises ( 1980 ) , although Holt provides a stronger historical narrative , linking his chapters together and presents an altogether contrasting argument . Whereas Fehrenbacher emphasized the long-standing resistance of Southerners to antislavery politics and hence the core problem of slavery in antebellum politics , including secession , Holt contends that political decisions made from 1846 to 1858 played a critical role in intensifying sectional hostility prior to secession and the Civil War . The " long-accumulated mistrust , fear , and loathing " that led Southerners and Northerners to massive bloodletting sprang neither from " whole cloth , " nor were they " simply products of the undeniable differences between the social systems of the North and the South and the contrasting value systems those different societies spawned . " Rather , Holt maintains , those hatreds " had intensified " in response to politicians ' actions on slavery-related issues ( p. 126 ) . <p> Holt 's argument is notably similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he observes that " attempts to resolve the secession crisis foundered on the question of slavery 's future expansion into southwestern territories , where it did not exist , rather than on its guaranteed perpetuity in the southern states , where it already did " ( p. 4 ) . By this logic , the Civil War was precipitated by an abstraction rather than by a tangible problem . Although he does not explicitly say so , one can not help feeling that he does not consider this largely abstract and apparently " intractable " issue as sufficient justification for a great Civil War ( p. 4 ) . Hence his criticism of politicians who broached the issue of slavery 's extension into the West ; it was they who opened the Pandora 's Box . <p> Holt 's censuring of the reckless politicians who repeatedly brought abstract arguments about slavery 's expansion into public debate is the second way in which his work echoes the revisionists . He perhaps could forgive the politicians had their actions followed from constituent demands , but he believes that all too frequently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , party politicians often made " shortsighted calculations of partisan advantage " rather than considering the broader national interest , a problem that was especially pronounced in regards to slavery extension ( p. 9 ) . Undeniably , the consequences of public debate over slavery were portentous . <p> For this reason , probably the single greatest villain in Holt 's story is President James K. Polk , an unrepentant nationalist and expansionist . According to Holt , Polk unscrupulously circumvented northern Democrats ' opposition to proslavery aspects of the joint resolution that authorized the annexation of Texas in 1845 . Having acquired the votes of northern Democratic senators for the resolution by promising that he would renegotiate the terms of annexation after its passage , he promptly broke his word . To make matters worse , he then unilaterally endorsed Texas 's inflated claims to Mexican territory and sent U.S. troops into the disputed territory in order to provoke Mexico into a war . After Mexican troops attacked the invading Americans , Polk deliberately deceived Congress and the public by claiming that Mexico had precipitated war by shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance from the standpoint of unrestrained national expansion , yielding a bountiful crop of approximately half of Mexico , but Holt is utterly condemnatory . Polk " used his power as commander in chief to deploy troops to pursue his personal agenda , " never seeking " the prior approval of Congress . " In the process he created a " nightmare " for northern Democrats like New York 's Martin Van Buren , beginning a war that northern Whigs " could ' charge with plausibility if not truth ' that Democrats ' waged for the extension of slavery ' " ( p. 18 ) . In the end , the nightmare would be a national one , not merely a northern Democratic one , because there was no easy way for politicians to resolve the slavery extension problem once the United States had acquired vast tracts of Mexican land . Hence , from Holt 's perspective , this was a selfish , mendacious , and breathtakingly foolhardy beginning to what would become a remorseless sectional struggle over slavery 's expansion . <p> In like manner Holt is critical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectional strife over slavery extension . For instance , in his chapter on the Wilmot Proviso , he observes that the 1848 effort of Free Soilers to oppose slavery 's expansion , " regardless of attempts to settle that issue , is one reason why that vexatious and increasingly dangerous question defied permanent settlement " ( p. 44 ) . Meanwhile , in his chapter on the Kansas-Nebraska Act , he criticizes New York 's Hardshell Hunker Democrats for exploiting the slavery extension issue in order to punish intra-party rivals . The Hards demanded that all Democratic Party appointees seeking confirmation by the Senate in 1854 acknowledge that the popular sovereignty provisions of the Compromise of 1850 " applied to all federal territories " and not just to land taken from Mexico . Appointees who did not endorse this novel , proslavery reading of the 1850 compromise measures would be denied confirmation and replaced by trusty Hards ( p. 98 ) . Holt is equally critical of the F Street Mess , a handful of powerful southern senators who refused to support the organization of Nebraska Territory unless Congress explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obduracy doubtless influenced Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas 's fateful decision in 1854 to cooperate in the repeal of the provisions , which enraged antislavery northerners and precipitated the organization of the Republican Party . Yet Douglas also comes in for blame . Holt maintains that Douglas 's desire to rekindle partisan rivalries through the Kansas-Nebraska Act sacrificed the nation 's interest to that of the Democratic Party ( pp. 99-100 ) . Last , but not least , Holt does not spare the freesoil activists who condemned Douglas 's Nebraska bill in the incendiary January 1854 " Appeal of the Independent Democrats . " Holt claims that their ill-conceived assault pre-empted more moderate objections from northern and southern Whigs , the latter of whom especially might have prevented passage of the bill . As he put it , the freesoil protesters , like Douglas , pursued " their own partisan purposes , " which in this case was to " perpetuate their party and their own political careers " in the face of declining northern interest in the slavery issue after the Compromise of 1850 ( p. 107 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have administered to the secessionists had his narrative culminated with the outbreak of war . There is clearly much blame to go around . <p> Yet his central argument is undermined by his frequent acknowledgments that many politicians attempted to resolve the slavery extension problem in order to preserve their party , the Union , or both . In 1848 , for instance , Whigs , worried about the effect of the slavery extension issue on their party 's prospects to win the presidency , proposed letting the federal judiciary decide the legality of slavery in the territories taken from Mexico . This compromise legislation passed the Senate but was tabled in the House of Representatives . Holt explains that congressmen " from both sections were too uncertain about what might happen " if they left the issue for judges to decide ( p. 46 ) . In other words , both sides cared so deeply about a favorable outcome that they refused to take the risk of not getting one . Later that year , Stephen A. Douglas proposed to admit all of the Mexican Cession territory as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery . However , as Holt recounts , southern senators " buried Douglas 's proposal in a hostile committee " because they feared that California would enter the Union as a free state ( p. 53 ) . In 1849 , Southern Whigs introduced a similar bill in the House . Concerned that a failure to resolve the slavery extension issue would destroy their party , they presumed northern Whig colleagues would support the bill . Instead , northern Whigs insisted that slavery be barred from the territory prior to the meeting of a state constitutional convention . " In this amended form , " Holt acknowledges , the " bill failed to receive a single favorable vote " ( p. 56 ) . In 1850 , President Zachary Taylor proposed to admit California and New Mexico as states , skipping the controversial territorial phase . Only northern Whigs strongly supported this initiative , which consequently had no chance of success ( pp. 56-67 ) . Nevertheless , despite this string of failures , compromisers led by Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas ultimately triumphed in 1850 , albeit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were not strong , powerful , and persistent politicians vying for the preservation of the Union . <p> Even more troubling for Holt 's argument is that the line between compromisers and reckless partisans sometimes seems quite blurry . For instance , while Douglas did indeed help push the inflammatory Kansas-Nebraska Act through Congress , he strongly promoted compromises on slavery prior to 1854 and during the secession crisis . Likewise , Georgia Whig Robert Toombs supported the California statehood bill in February 1849 , despite his acknowledgment that it would lead to a free state ; yet " within a year he would vow to lead a secession movement in the South should Congress itself try to bar slavery from California " ( pp. 55 , 64-65 ) . Meanwhile , southern Whigs contributed handsomely to the 1850 compromise , yet in 1854 provided critical votes in the House of Representatives for passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act . These political shifts do not fit neatly into Holt 's argument , especially considering that these politicians probably did not consider themselves to be inconsistent . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country by permanently ending congressional debate over slavery 's expansion . As he repeatedly declared in 1854 , the doctrine of popular sovereignty solved the thorny problem of territorial slavery ; after all , if settlers decided the fate of slavery in national territories , it would forever remove that abstract , intractable problem from Congress . Although the historian may be excused for wondering if Douglas later privately regretted sponsoring the Kansas-Nebraska Act , in 1854 he expected to achieve a political triumph that would benefit his party and the Union . Once popular sovereignty was the nation 's settled policy for territorial slavery , the Democratic Party could continue to promote national expansion without fear of disunion . Had he not believed this , he would neither have sponsored the bill nor have modified it to suit the demands of Southerners , no matter what pressures southern congressmen placed upon him . <p> Hence one question unavoidably arises : if there were at least as many responsible compromisers as there were reckless partisans , and if it is sometimes difficult to discern the difference between them , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior scholarship Holt freely acknowledges and indeed celebrates the competitiveness of the Second Party System . Whigs and Democrats battled fairly evenly for almost a decade in the 1840s , leading to a robust party system throughout the nation . Yet none of this robust competition , a product of rampant partisanship , led to civil war . Sometime Democrats won , and sometimes Whigs , but either way the country managed to hold together . Likewise , after the Civil War , rampant partisanship and the two-party system have produced stability rather than war . So what was different about the 1850s ? <p> A very good explanation peeps through the text repeatedly . In the course of his narrative , if not in his thesis , Holt often recognizes that politicians did in fact respond to public pressure . A major case in point is the Wilmot Proviso . Since the proviso produced a slavery extension controversy par excellence , Holt seeks to explain the behavior of northern Democratic and southern Whig congressmen , whose votes produced a sectional rather than partisan divide . Northern Democrats previously had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while southern Whigs had leagued with northern Whigs to oppose it , yet many northern Democrats strongly and persistently supported the Wilmot Proviso in concert with northern Whigs , while southern Whigs and southern Democrats bitterly opposed it . Holt argues that the northern Democrats " initial support for the proviso " flowed from their anger at Polk 's duplicity over Texas , but that " northern and southern public opinion best explains the continuing sectional polarization over it " ( pp. 22-23 , 26 ) . As he put it , the " longer and more fractious congressional debate over the Wilmot Proviso became , the more intense sectional animosity in the population at large grew , which in turn unquestionably aggravated politicians ' disagreement over that issue " ( p. 26 ) . To be sure , Holt frames " public opinion " adroitly in this instance , locating its origins in congressional debate . Nevertheless , what follows the quote is considerably more significant : eight pages dedicated to explaining why Northerners and Southerners held contrasting opinions on slavery 's expansion . While some scholars may quibble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Holt unhesitatingly acknowledges Northerners ' strong opposition to slavery 's expansion and Southerners ' strong support for it , including the incredible emotional vehemence Southerners invested in the issue . Holt 's thesis notwithstanding , the significance of these bedrock sectional attitudes shows repeatedly in the rest of the text . <p> An excellent illustration of the power of public opinion on antebellum politicians is the consequential proslavery shift of southern Whigs in 1849 . While a number of southern Whigs had supported the prospect of California statehood early in 1849 , they were not remotely as conciliatory after leaving Congress and speaking with their constituents . As Robert Toombs wrote later that year to a colleague , " public feeling in the South is much stronger than many of us supposed " and " passage of the Wilmot Proviso would lead to civil war . " He reported that Southerners would respond to the admission of California as a free state with " bitterness of feeling " ( pp. 64-65 ) . His fear must have been palpable given the triumphs of Southern Democrats in the Mississippi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public declarations by Democratic politicians . In Georgia , for instance , the state legislature passed resolutions instructing the governor " to call a secession convention immediately if the new Congress enacted the proviso , admitted California as a free state , or failed to pass a new , more rigorous fugitive-slave act " ( p. 65 ) . This was strong medicine for southern Whigs , and they can hardly be blamed thereafter for refusing to support President Taylor 's plan to quickly admit New Mexico and California as states . <p> All of this suggests the profound significance of the slavery issue after all . Given the underlying proslavery attitudes in the South , conciliatory southern Whigs faced a difficult challenge : either keep slavery out of public debate or face immolation at the polls . After all , like angry hornets , southern voters swarmed out to defend perceived threats to slavery . Yet Southerners were certain to perceive such threats--which were hardly illusory--given public attitudes in the North . After all , antislavery politicians , not southern Democrats , bore primary responsibility for stirring up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wilmot Proviso . Moreover , as Kenneth Stampp argued years ago , historians can not reasonably consider northern antislavery values as some sort of aberration or the product of misguided agitation . Those values were fundamental to a free society , even if not universally embraced in the North . Hence the southern Whigs ' situation alone suggests that , contra Holt , a crop of selfish and incompetent politicians in 1840s and 1850s was not the critical factor in precipitating civil war . Slavery was the foundation of the southern social system , the basis of its wealth and culture , and threats to it necessarily produced great volatility in American politics . Ironically , given this fact , Holt 's thesis can probably be turned on its head for the period following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act : after 1854 , a political rupture was likely to occur eventually without an unusually skillful conciliation by concerned politicians , which itself was unlikely without an outpouring of conciliatory sentiments from most people in both the North and South . Needless to say , the conciliation never came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to say that they were insignificant--far from it . In fact , Holt 's book underscores a truth that is worth reiterating . " What politicians do in elective office matters , often profoundly , " he contended , " to the lives of ordinary Americans " ( p. xi ) . There can be no doubt about that , nor about the value of studying politicians , whose decisions have indeed done so much to shape the country 's history . For this reason alone I would willingly assign this book to undergraduates . On the significance of politics to the Civil War , historians who are on the other side of the aisle , so to speak , about the origins of the war should be in complete agreement . And this area of agreement suggests that the contemporary rival schools of Civil War causation might not be as far apart as is sometimes thought . Just as Holt acknowledges , to a degree , the powerful interplay between politicians and public attitudes toward slavery , historians who emphasize the slavery issue must explain how contingent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . In the end , the real test of historical explanation is showing through creative reconstruction how a wide variety of relevant political , social , economic , and cultural factors produce change over time . Focusing on high politics , Michael Holt does not attempt a history on that scale . However , he does carefully examine an important historical issue and his argument invites debate over the relative influence of structural and contingent factors in bringing on the Civil War . As for the debate , at the risk of being as shortsighted and reckless as some politicians , I say , " bring it on . " <p> Note <p> 1 . Michael F.

How many of us have thoughtlessly described the Civil War as the first " modern " or even " total " war ? Mark Grimsley will make us revise those old lecture notes . <p> Historians , Civil War buffs , and the public generally hold powerful images of the Civil War 's destructiveness . The two most common examples would be the burning of Atlanta and Sherman 's March to the Sea . Many historians have long realized that the devastation wrought by northern armies has been greatly exaggerated , but Mark Grimsley argues that severity and pleas of military necessity were also tempered by a sense of moral justice . For the first fifteen months of the war or so , federal authorities adopted a conciliatory policy toward southern civilians . Beginning in the summer of 1862 they turned toward what Grimsley has termed a more " pragmatic " approach that included both confiscation and emancipation . By 1864-65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " based on the idea of demoralizing Confederates through the seizure and destruction of civilian property . <p> Grimsley refutes the commonly held assumption that the conciliatory approach grew out of a naive sentimentalism doomed to fail . For sure , Lincoln and his military advisers rather blithely assumed that all the seceding states ( with the exception of South Carolina ) had Unionist majorities , but historical precedent from the American Revolution , the Napoleonic wars , and the Mexican War also pointed toward conservative treatment of belligerent peoples . A policy of restraint toward civilians and their property might prevent the outbreak of a brutal and potentially disastrous guerrilla conflict . That sturdy exemplar of a cautious approach to war , George B. McClellan , favored defeating Confederate armies while protecting civilian property . However sound this was in theory , Confederate guerrillas and , even more important , ordinary soldiers in the federal armies undermined the conciliatory policy . <p> Enlisted men resented the defiance of southern civilians , but Grimsley slights the theatrical aspects of many confrontations . One wonders how many privates were shocked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers may have tired of stock acts of defiance by " secesh females , " they often found them amusing if not charming . Grant and other commanders , however , had to wrestle with the consequences arising from civilian encouragement of guerrilla depredations and with the difficulties of distinguishing between loyal , actively disloyal , and passively disloyal southern whites . The result was a pragmatic policy ( followed even by the notorious Benjamin F. Butler in New Orleans ) designed to keep civilians out of the war while punishing open acts of resistance . <p> To Grimsley 's credit , he examines the evolution of northern policy in all the major theaters and usually notes exceptions to these general patterns of conduct . Early in 1862 when the conciliatory approach still prevailed , for instance , a brigade in Ambrose E. Burnside 's army set fire to the town of Winton , North Carolina . Likewise , Grimsley avoids playing off conservative generals against more radical ones to push his story relentlessly forward toward the inevitable adoption of more destructive practices . Thus , in Kentucky and Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so did William T. Sherman . <p> Calls for the abandonment of such a cautious approach and for the adoption of both confiscation and emancipation intensified as McClellan 's army stalled on the Virginia Peninsula . At this point , Grimsley might have explored an interesting paradox in the Army of the Potomac : a body of soldiers who greatly admired McClellan but had little use for his efforts to safeguard rebel property . He presents considerable evidence showing that McClellan 's troops dismissed posting guards for farms and plantations as nothing but foolishness . That was " all played out , " as they enjoyed telling Confederate women who begged for special protection . Western soldiers in particular , as Grimsley observes , were eager to forage more freely , and in the East , John Pope 's notorious orders seemed to justify a new and harsher kind of war . <p> But here Grimsley masterfully weighs contradictory evidence to draw ingenious conclusions . The northern public appeared satisfied that Pope 's orders had been issued and did not seem to care that they were not carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillaging . The Emancipation Proclamation marked the abandonment of conciliation as a policy even though conservative attitudes hardly disappeared . Officers remained reluctant to encourage unrestricted plundering , but officially sanctioned foraging spread rapidly . As Grimsley notes , the seizure of civilian property often grew out of logistical necessity as federal armies penetrated deeper and deeper into hostile territory . Union commanders also increasingly held Confederate civilians accountable for guerrilla raids . The generals tried to clear out the guerrillas so that conventional war could proceed and throughout 1863 were quite ready to bring the war home to civilians . But even then restraint still often prevailed , though Grimsley stretches this insight to its breaking point by trying to fit Sherman 's burning of Randolph , Tennessee , into this pattern of controlled severity . <p> If historians have often oversimplified the evolution of northern military policy , their analysis of emancipation has been equally slipshod . Most military men regardless of rank tried to avoid the slavery question and generally waited for Lincoln to act . Indeed , pleas of military necessity , Grimsley contends , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained deeply ambivalent , and aside from the eventual use of African-American troops , warring against slavery brought few immediate strategic advantages . <p> During the important campaigns of 1863 , the Lincoln administration encouraged armies to live off the land --especially in the western theater . The Vicksburg campaign marked a transition between more pragmatic policies and " hard war . " Grant and Sherman authorized their soldiers to seize vitally needed supplies and at the same time found it increasingly difficult to prevent wanton destruction . Building on the strategic insights of Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones , Grimsley locates the real and sustained appearance of " hard war " in the " raids " of the 1864-65 period . From Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley to Sherman 's march through Georgia and the Carolinas , the destruction of civilian property became a legitimate military objective quite apart from conventional battles . But even Sherman and Sheridan issued orders against burning private homes , and plantations were much more likely to be ransacked than small farms . Thus a kind of restraint based on a delicately balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that demoralized Confederate civilians . Grimsley argues that the politically sophisticated Union soldiers could distinguish between various class of southern civilians and generally targeted wealthy secessionists , but he also documents in a somewhat contradictory fashion the Federals ' often expressed contempt for poor whites . <p> In examining the evolution of policy toward southern civilians , Grimsley offers a closer reading of the pronouncements made by generals and politicians than any other historian . In nearly every chapter , his careful comparison of words with deeds shatters long cherished myths and assumptions . But his revisionism is fair-minded , sensible , and readable ; nor is it based on the all too common practice of cannibalizing other scholars . Creativity and judiciousness characterize the arguments . Comparative insights from both earlier and later wars provide a broad context ; arguments grounded in " just war " and other philosophical traditions makes the analysis morally sensitive without being preachy . Grimsley intersperses his account of official policy with perceptive and fresh quotations from lower-ranking officers and enlisted men . In fact , the book might have been ( and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier material more frequently . In some theaters of the war and for some periods treated in this book , the perspective from the ranks mysteriously disappears . Grimsley recognizes inconsistencies and exceptions even as he clearly outlines the evolution of northern policy . He sometimes slights the importance of renegade behavior in various regiments ( and even brigades ) and no doubt pushes his arguments for restrained behavior too far . But these flaws are minor ones , and these rather specific criticisms actually highlight the larger achievements of this path-breaking study . Indeed , The Hard Hand of War along with Stephen Ash 's excellent new book , When the Yankees Came : Conflict and Chaos in the Occupied South , 1861-1865 , should change both scholarly and popular conceptions on several contentious issues . After reading Grimsley 's book , modern war theorists , neo-Confederates , and students of the Civil War in general should revise their shopworn notions about " hard war . " 69401 @qwx479401

The author creates a typology of the locations , functions , and forms of clubs over time , clearly demonstrating their ability to adapt to the social and economic needs of their supporters .

As part of this transformation , the club adopted formal membership rules , regulated behavior and broadened activities to include art and literary functions , balls and other festive events . Concurrently , belonging to specific clubs conferred social status on the participants who until the early twentieth century were predominantly male . <p> As city life burgeoned , club-supporting elites escaped to the country for recreation .

First , it fills a considerable gap in the historiography of Mexicans in the United States . Second , Francisco Balderrama and Raymond Rodriguez have chosen a topic that is as relevant in today 's world as it was in the 1930s . In the last several years , repatriation has resurfaced as public discussions examine the whys , wheres , and hows of reverse , frequently involuntary , migratory movements . Despite differences in specific historical circumstances such as motivations , government policies , and public reaction , expatriates returning home , whether Haitian , Afghan , or Mexican , share certain universal dilemmas and challenges . The governments involved , too , face similar difficulties and hurdles in responding to the entry of their repatriates . Decade of Betrayal provides critical insights into the dynamics of the repatriation process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twentieth-century Mexican American history , yet it achieves much more . We must resist the tendency to categorize such works as " simply " ethnic history . Instead it is essential that we recognize the value of such studies in a more global sense . Decade of Betrayal explores issues of identity and citizenship and the resourceful ways in which people caught between two nations and two governments can negotiate their lives . It is a work reflecting the transnational character of Mexican Americans . It is as much a work of U.S. history as a work illuminating Mexican history . <p> Using both Mexican and U.S. archival sources , Rodriguez and Balderrama succeed in painting a complex portrait of an important episode in Chicano/Mexicano history--the repatriation of what they conservatively estimate to be one million Mexicans and Mexican Americans during the 1930s . Increasing public hostility against all Mexicans , both foreign and U.S.-born , in conjunction with insensitive or at best inadequate government policies and programs created difficult , often tragic , circumstances for Mexican communities across the United States . Throughout their " telling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity of Mexicans in the face of an overwhelming crisis . <p> The 1930s represents a fascinating time in Mexican American history--contradictory trends emerged and coalesced into a complicated community identity . On the one hand , Mexican Americans continued to develop an increasing sense of " American-ness " ( a process already underway in the 1920s ) . At the same time , however , Anglo American workers , local , state , and federal governments , welfare programs , and labor unions increasingly viewed and defined them more and more vocally as " foreigners . " Designated outsiders rather than " real " Americans , Mexican American communities found themselves on the defensive against intensifying attack . In response , many Mexicans turned to Mexico as a refuge . <p> Rodriguez and Balderrama place their work within a historiographical tradition well-known to scholars of twentieth-century Mexican American history . Although contemporary observers such as economist Paul Taylor , anthropologist Manuel Gamio , and sociologist Emory Bogardus noted the significance of the Mexican migration to the United States and the ensuing reverse migration more than sixty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s . Among the most significant works produced in the 1970s were Abraham Hoffman 's Unwanted Mexican Americans in the Great Depression ( 1974 ) and Mercedes Carreras de Velasco 's Los Mexicanos Que Devolvio la Crisis ( 1974 ) . Although not devoted exclusively to the study of repatriation , Balderrama 's own 1982 In Defense of La Raza : The Los Angeles Mexican Consulate and the Mexican Community , 1929-1936 added significantly to our understanding of the relationship between the Mexican government and the Mexican community in the United States . After more than a decade of apparent neglect , the 1990s has already seen the appearance of three works probing the complexities of Mexican American history during the depression decade . In addition to the work under review , Camille Guerin-Gonzalez 's Mexican Workers and American Dreams : Immigration , Repatriation , and California Farm labor , 1900-1939 ( 1994 ) focuses on Mexican American experiences in California . A significant aspect of this work is her analysis of the ideology that justified the massive expulsion of Mexicans and Mexican Americans . George J. Sanchez 's Becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , 1900-1945 ( 1993 ) explores the " ambivalent Americanism " created by repatriation . <p> Rodriguez and Balderrama begin their book with a chapter titled " Immigration : Al Norte . " The chapter summarizes information already familiar to historians . Mexicans moved northward in search of employment and higher wages . The policies of the Porfiriato and the violence of the 1910 Revolution and its aftermath ( which lasted through the 1920s ) helped " push " Mexicans out of Mexico . Simultaneously , the economic development of the U.S. Southwest worked together with employer-held attitudes regarding Mexican workers ( Mexicans were not only cheap but also temporary laborers ) to create government policies and programs that stimulated Mexican migration to the United States . Herein lay the roots of the great betrayal . After decades of energetic recruitment by U.S. employers , with the support of the U.S. government , in the 1930s Mexicans suddenly found themselves pushed out of the United States , now considered burdens on the nation they had done so much for . <p> The following three chapters set the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Family , " " Deportation , " and " Welfare " in order to depict the situation for Mexicans just prior to leaving . These chapters reflect two of the great strengths of the work . First , they continually focus on the intricacies of family relations in terms of gender , generation , and nationality . Mexican families are anything but monolithic in this story . Rather , we see women , men , and children emerge as characters with their own needs , desires , and points of view . And we begin to understand the difficulties of maintaining a family under the arduous circumstances created by the Great Depression . A second strength of the work is its wide-angle geographic view of the Mexican community in the United States . Balderrama and Rodriguez point to the diversity of Mexican Americans with illustrations drawn from Detroit and Chicago as well as throughout the Southwest . <p> Balderrama and Rodriguez concentrate much of their narrative on the Mexican family . By their doing so , the erroneous assumptions underlying government policies in the 1930s become glaringly apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican migrant workers and had " successfully exploited this feature in generating maximum profits " ( p. 34 ) . The very presence of family , however , transformed what had been initially a much more transient population into a population seeking permanency and stability . As time went by , the temporary nature of the Mexican population in the United States became more and more of a myth . The assumption that Mexican families comprised only foreigners was also faulty . Governments , both local and federal , assumed that deporting " Mexican " families would save money by cutting down on welfare payments paid to " undeserving " foreigners . <p> In reality , however , many " Mexican " families contained numerous U.S.-born members , eligible for the same benefits as any other American . Furthermore , government policies frequently resulted in the splitting up of families , which in turn meant that increasing numbers of Mexican Americans would then be forced onto relief . The authors point to the " cruel dilemmas " facing Mexicans--barred from employment by laws denying non-citizens the chance to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreasing , Mexicans and Mexican Americans were more and more pushed into asking for relief , which in turn made them more visible candidates for repatriation or deportation . Despite these risks , however , many families chose to remain in the United States at the urging of their U.S.-born children . We have rarely heard the voices of these children , U.S. citizens by birth , but considered foreigners by the dominant society . <p> The chapter on " Repatriation " acts as a transition between the U.S. and Mexican sides of the story , and it turns many of our commonly held notions upside down , much as repatriation must have turned the world of the repatriates upside down as well . Mexicans who had moved to the United States in previous years with the belief that they would be there temporarily returned to Mexico with the belief that they had returned only temporarily . Rather than the image of a Mexican anticipating a short-term absence from la patria , we find Mexicans anticipating short stays in their land of birth .

Families were torn apart by the difficult decisions facing them and by their children 's resistance to the move . Furthermore , immigrants returning to Mexico were returning to a changed nation . They themselves were changed . <p> As in the United States , the issue of repatriation provided substantial fare for nationalistic politicians . Also , as in the United States , the issue elicited a strong emotional reaction . In their chapter on " Revolutionary Mexico , " the two historians report that repatriation " reawakened deeply embedded revolutionary sentiments for social justice , feelings of Mexicanismo , and a strong anti-American sentiment among the general populace " ( p. 133 ) . In their chapter " Colonization : Pan y Tierra , " the authors explore the ways in which the Mexican government sought to both address the needs of the repatriates and assimilate them , seeking to build Mexico through their skills . These visions eventually failed , however , because of too few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " continues the job of turning commonly held notions on their heads . The image of the " recien llegado , " often used to identify a recent Mexican immigrant to the United States , refers instead to Mexicans recently arrived in Mexico , adjusting to life in their old country . The problems of readjustment were great . Years of living in U.S. urban areas , for example , made it difficult for people returning to rural areas with few amenities . Women returning to a more conservative society found that their behavior and appearance were often viewed as scandalous . But perhaps the hardest hit of all were the children " without a country " who were viewed as " agringados " by the Mexicans and as " Mexicans " by Anglo Americans . <p> The conflict arising between the Mexicans who remained in Mexico and those who left only to return during the depression created the second betrayal .

This series reviews books published during the twentieth century which have been deemed to be among the most important contributions to the field of intellectual history . <p> The myth and symbol school is generally regarded as the first theoretical contribution of American Studies to scholarly interpretations of the past . In fact , the most prominent practitioner of the myth and symbol approach , Henry Nash Smith , received the first doctorate in what remains a relatively new field. 1 Virgin Land 's signal contribution was its nuanced analysis of the powerful myths generated by the European encounter with the American West . Smith considered two dimensions of the westward migration : the mental **26;1763;TOOLONG that inspired individuals to cross the frontier and strike into the " new " land ; and the mental constructs that were prevalent once the territory began to be settled. 2 Smith relied heavily on Frederick Jackson Turner 's " frontier thesis , " not as a guiding interpretation of American identity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critique . Turner is ever-present in Virgin Land , the focus of both the book 's beginning and ending . <p> Smith 's method is simply summarized : American culture can be read as a common language comprised of myths and symbols , obtainable , in part , by reading elite and popular American literature . These myths and symbols were " collective representations rather than the work of a single mind " ( p. xi ) . Ambitiously , Smith hoped to isolate the conscious and unconscious thinking underlying westward movement , extracting it from literary sources ( e.g. , Fenimore Cooper , Walt Whitman , and dime novels such as the Erastus Beadle 's series ) and the testimonials of politicians , railroad agents , and writers ( including Frederick Jackson Turner ) . Smith was one of the progenitors of the multidisciplinary approach to the study of culture . Long before the culture wars of the late twentieth century , he chose to include texts outside of the literary canon for determining the " American mind . " <p> In Smith 's analysis , the frontier operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal . Some of the pioneers viewed the West as a passage to India , a route to the rich trade route of the Orient ( pp. 15-48 ) . Travel in the primeval West , so the mythology went , required rugged individuals , the intelligent backwoodsmen , to act as guides . They knew both " wilderness " and " civilization . " Thus there were heroes like Daniel Boone , Kit Carson , and Wild Bill Cody , as well as heroines such as Hurricane Nell , Wild Edna , and Calamity Jane . Smith categorizes these guides , or trailblazers , as " The Sons of Leatherstocking " ( pp. 51-120 ) . Finally , with the influx of European immigrants into conquered territory of the rural West , the yeoman took center stage , establishing the myth of the garden ( pp. 123-260 ) . <p> For many of the younger generation of scholars in the field of American Studies ( or now American Culture Studies ) , Henry Nash Smith is too conservative . While Virgin Land is regarded as a classic , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obsolete methodology . Scholarly critics of the " consensus school " argue that Smith 's narrative of American westward expansion was too tidy . He left out important details , such as the fact that the so-called virgin land was already inhabited . Smith is sensitive to class issues , to be sure ; but as his debunkers have noted , his decision not to criticize literary conventions depicting the land as female shows his failure to address issues of gender . Literary critic Donald E. Pease classified the myth and symbol approach as " official nationalism . " 3 Few of the " New Western Historians " have been more influential than Patricia Nelson Limerick , born a year after the publication of Virgin Land . Her book The Legacy of Conquest : the Unbroken Past of the American West took a more proactive stance on the symbols of the American West , arguing that myths about the West distort our perceptions of its true complexity. 4 <p> Other have criticized the myth and symbol tradition for its lack of methodological rigor . For example , Bruce Kuklick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven , it would not necessarily prove that yesteryear 's texts speak for today . Kuklick countered the notion that myths necessarily maintain a continuous meaning over time and space . Also , while some kinds of myths and symbols might be based on facts of experience , others might simply be a product of fantasy. 5 On the other hand , Alan Trachtenberg has argued that the myth and symbol approach is compatible with Raymond Williams ' concept of " structures of feeling " and Clifford Geertz 's stress on " ideology . " 6 Emphasizing both " myth " and " ideology " in his works , Richard Slotkin builds on Smith 's approach without overlooking important dynamics such as race and class , thus bringing to the forefront many of the omissions of his progenitor. 7 Finally , the notion of American exceptionalism has been equated with the myth and symbol school , including Slotkin. 8 Nevertheless , the myth and symbol scholars provided rich material for future comparative studies . <p> While much of the criticism against it hits the mark , Virgin Land was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical work exposing the destructive legacy of eighteenth-century agrarian and frontier thinking in an industrial era. 9 Smith introduces Virgin Land with the question , " What is an American ? " ( p. 3 ) . Fifty years ago many scholars detected a unity in the American mind that could be grasped and generally understood . For example , Henry S. Commager 's The American Mind was published in the same year as Virgin Land10 . Such a title would not pass muster in today 's intellectual environment--in which a bland melting pot stew has been transformed into an exotic salad bar--but Commager 's book expressed the thinking of his day . The experience of World War II and the Cold War should not be discounted. 11 If the present climate in academia stresses the diversity rather than the unity of American identity , this is a luxury made possible by the absence of an apparent outside threat ( real or imagined ) lurking to destroy the nation . Considering that Virgin Land was hardly a triumphal view of the American past--and considering that appeared during the first stirrings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American Studies were more courageous than some of the contemporary skeptics give them credit . 12 <p> Although not the first to focus critically on the mythology of land , Virgin Land influenced , directly or indirectly , several classics in the field of landscape history. 13 Following Smith 's work were several important American Studies classics with a landscape or environmental focus , including R. W. B. Lewis ' The American Adam , Perry Miller 's Errand into the Wilderness , and Leo Marx 's The Machine in the Garden. 14 If Smith failed to adequately consider gender , the myth and symbol approach was subsequently reoriented around gender issues in Annette Kolodny 's The Lay of the Land and The Land Before Her. 15 If after Smith some continued to doubt that the myths and symbols of the West had little to do with American culture overall , then they were thrice challenged by historian Richard Slotkin. 16 Today the focus on land or the environment is well-represented in critiques of American imperialism . Hence , the " radical " anthology , Cultures of United States Imperialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultural representations of the foreign. 17 <p> Thirty-six years after Virgin Land , Smith graciously noted in a lead essay of the anthology Ideology and American Literature that he had failed to adequately consider the violence of westward expansionism and the fact that the " free land " was actually stolen land . He also confessed that his objectivity was tainted because " my own attitudes were influenced by the basic myth or ideology of America to a greater extent than I had realized . " However , many of his overall observations about the enduring myths and symbols of the frontier remained convincing . As Smith noted in the same essay , Turner 's frontier mythology still holds sway in American culture . Its influence is clear from the celebratory , " look out for number one " individualism , the heroic image of a cowboy in the White House , and the historical role of frontier mythology in justifying a host of abuses of the natural environment. 18 Although it embodied the assumptions of its time , Smith 's Virgin Land influenced a new examination of myths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any analysis comparing and contrasting the growth of American society with that of other societies , then it will be essential to have a degree of understanding about the myths that have been circulating in the cultures under study . The European conquering of the American West , for example , can be compared with Russia 's eastward expansion . Indeed , the United States and Russia met in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska . In a famous passage of Democracy in America , Tocqueville noted that Russia and America " tend toward the same end . " 20 The U.S. Library of Congress , in collaboration with various Russian institutions , is currently showcasing a digital library that offers a comparative history of Russian expansion through Siberia and American expansion through the West ( called " The Meeting of Frontiers " ) . Such scholarly endeavors will certainly call into question any lingering assumptions about American exceptionalism. 21 Although the internationalization of American Studies may be at hand , it does not negate the legacy of Virgin Land nor its heuristic value . <p> Notes <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its program in American Civilization headed by Howard Mumford Jones . <p> 3 .

To be sure , the reissue of this book corresponds to the appearance this year of the follow-up volume , The Unmaking of Adolf Hitler . Still , given the rain forests that have disappeared to feed the Nazi/Hitler book industry , another book on Hitler requires justification either as a " classic " work in the field , a significant new contribution to the research , or an accessible popular account . <p> The book is really about the failure of the Weimar Republic and only very loosely about Hitler . Aspects of Hitler 's life are woven into the broader narrative of German history from Hitler 's birth in 1889 to the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 . Considerable attention is paid to the historical backdrop , and for the casual reader there is a wealth of compelling detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monarchy and the German experience of World War I. The best sections are on the problems faced by the Weimar Republic from the abortive German revolution to the byzantine machinations that culminated in the somewhat unexpected presentation of the chancellorship to Hitler . This provides for an interesting read , but it suffers from the conceptual flaw of depicting Weimar primarily as the story of the rise of Nazism . The idea of Imperial Germany and Weimar as the antechamber of Nazism has , justifiably , come under considerable criticism in the last twenty years as historians have chosen to examine those eras as multi-dimensional periods that were not predestined to self-destruct . Similarly , keying a discussion of German history to Hitler 's life , although intriguing , minimizes the complexity of German history and exaggerates ( a la Goebbels ) Hitler 's role in it . <p> This book is neither a classic nor a significant new contribution to our understanding of Hitler . Presumably it was not intended as such . That it does not carve out a new niche is obvious from the notes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In itself , being a general book is not inherently a liability , but any book on twentieth-century Germany with an extensive discussion of World War I that was published in 1977 should have made mention , either in the text or in the bibliography , of the important work of Eckhart Kehr , Fritz Fischer , and Hans-Ulrich Wehler . Despite subsequent criticism , these historians laid out a powerful case for German complicity and guilt for World War I. Failure to incorporate this element in Chapter Three , " The War and the Corporal , " leads to a painfully glaring tendency to cast the Germans as the beleaguered victims . <p> Davidson appears to take the German point of view--and a conservative one at that . Weimar 's problem , in the author 's view , was heavily predicated on the vindicativeness of the French and the onerous economic terms of the Versailles Treaty . Among the resulting conclusions are that the German army from top to bottom did little or no wrong in World War I , the leaders of Germany were prevented from reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allied refusal to negotiate , the reparations ( and not the bankrupting of the government to finance the prosecution of the war ) were responsible for the economic calamities of the early 1920s , and the French occupation of the Ruhr blocked German economic growth and inclusion in the world 's diplomatic community . Without a doubt , many , if not most , Germans perceived events this way and this had a powerful political effect which merits depiction . Much of this , moreover , has a kernel of truth . It is incumbent on the historian , however , to cut through the question of perception and , with the benefit of hindsight , distinguish between the perception and the reality . <p> This book seems to be a conscious attempt to bring German history and a wider understanding of the context of Adolf Hitler 's rise to power to the reading public and ultimately it is as a popular history that it should be critiqued . Leaving aside the somewhat faux questions of profitability and whether success on the free market automatically legitimizes , there remains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Everyone can probably agree that a popular history should be readable . The problem comes in the discussion of accuracy and interpretation . Is a book inherently unpopular ( or scholarly ) if it reflects the accumulated judgment of historians , or should it play to the expectations of the readers ? To what extent does the author owe readers a balanced , critical , yet readable account ? <p> It is here that this book fails . There is a great deal of accurate detail that is useful to convey to a popular audience , but the weaknesses in interpretation mislead the reader who is not already familiar with the Third Reich . I have already mentioned several problematic issues , so I will just point out one more example--the discussion of antisemitism in the early chapters . Although Davidson is by no means whitewashing the problem of antisemitism and though he brings out some useful information about Habsburg and German antisemitism , Jews are always discussed as if they constituted a homogeneous block . In part this is just a question of voice , echoing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be easy enough to point out the complexity of the Jewish community in Vienna at the turn of the century or the extent of Jewish assimilation in German cities . The characterization of German-Jewish relations is also marred by a failure to examine critically the claims of the contemporary antisemites that small town Jews were " readily identified with the slick , urban exploiters " ( p. 38 ) or that " the Jew " Davidson 's words was always identifiable no matter how strenuously he or she tried to assimilate ( p. 39 ) . When one turns to the bibliography to figure out where this is coming from , there are no works on German or Habsburg Jewry . In the context of the book , this is a small issue ; nevertheless it should be incumbent on the author of a popular history not to perpetuate stereotypes inadvertently . <p> Overall , The Making of Adolf Hitler is a readable , well-illustrated , general survey of German history from the 1890s until 1933 organized around the key issues that affected Hitler 's life .

Lyon ( Department of History , University of Chicago ) Published on H-German ( April , 2009 ) Commissioned by Susan R. Boettcher <p> From Cruel Lords to Knowledgeable Officials <p> As Thomas Bisson explains in his preface , the origins of this book lie in a course he began offering at Harvard in 1988 . Twenty years of teaching and research thus went into this work , and at almost six hundred pages , it clearly demonstrates Bisson 's prolonged and thoughtful engagement with the subjects of power , lordship , and government during the long twelfth century . The use of the word " crisis " in the title of the work is undoubtedly meant to be provocative . Bisson offers here a much darker and more violent vision of the period than many earlier scholars--especially supporters of a twelfth-century renaissance--have put forward . Nevertheless , this work is not a radical reinterpretation of the traditional narrative of the years 1050 to 1250 . Bisson does not completely rewrite the chronology of the growth of royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and King Philip II Augustus of France play familiar roles . What this book provides is a much more nuanced account of the development of medieval government than anyone else has attempted . There is thus an extraordinary subtlety to Bisson 's argument , and I suspect that historians will be engaging with aspects of it for years to come . <p> It should be noted at the outset that this is really a book about England , France , and the Spanish kingdoms , those regions where Bisson has typically focused most of his research in the past . Germany makes numerous appearances , and the sections of the work concerning Bavarian lordship and the Saxon revolts during the Investiture Controversy are quite good . Nevertheless , Bisson 's engagement with the German sources does not match the level of analysis he brings to his evidence from further west . Similarly , while Poland and Italy are occasionally referred to as well , they serve only a supporting function within the broader framework of the book . Bisson 's argument certainly would have been stronger if he had integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably would have made for an even longer work . <p> At the center of this book lies the transition from " lordship " --which Bisson defines broadly as " personal commands over dependent people " ( p. 3 ) --to an experience of power more like our modern understanding of government . According to Bisson , this transition was a much more complex and nonlinear process than earlier generations of political , legal , and administrative historians have acknowledged . Bisson argues that capricious lordship , with its affective , militant , and unstable character , remained an influential force in medieval society long after other scholars have suggested we can begin to see something that looks like rational administration . A key component of this thesis is that " politics , " an essential feature of modern government , did not begin to develop until the thirteenth century . <p> Bisson 's argument unfolds gradually over the course of the book . After a brief introduction ( chapter 1 ) he focuses on the feudal revolution in chapter 2 , " The Age of Lordship ( 875-1150 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know some of his previous work on this subject . The lively debate that Bisson and other prominent historians conducted during the mid-1990s in the pages of Past and Present forms the backdrop to this chapter . Interestingly , Bisson does not significantly alter here the position he took in that debate , insisting that the most typical human experience of power around the year 1000 was violent , castle-based exploitation of peasants by ambitious lords . <p> With chapter 3 , " Lord-Rulership ( 1050-1150 ) : The Experience of Power , " Bisson moves away from this earlier debate and begins to chart the ubiquity of lordship across Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth centuries . He is at his most sweeping in this one-hundred-page chapter , which includes discussions of Spain , Germany , Italy , France , England , and the Low Countries . Though he acknowledges and frequently even emphasizes regional differences here , he is also seeking to describe a pan-European phenomenon of lordship . One of his central arguments is that the kings of this period functioned like other lords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose " ( p. 161 ) because their power was affective ; they and their functionaries had no sense that they held " official " positions . Chapter 4 , " Crisis of Power ( 1060-1150 ) , " continues many of the themes of chapter 3 and has the same geographical and chronological parameters . According to Bisson , the Saxon revolts during the Investiture Controversy , the independence of castellans in France , the murder of Count Charles of Flanders , and the anarchy of King Stephen 's reign in England all demonstrate the instability of lordship in western Europe during the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries . " Bad lordship " was commonplace among both magnates and lesser lords , and for Bisson it is therefore not surprising that so many sources make references to tyrants and tyranny in these years . <p> How the societies of western Europe began to transition away from the most violent and unstable forms of lordship is the story of chapter 5 , " Resolution : Intrusions of Government ( 1150-1215 ) . " Bisson is quick to demonstrate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straightforward progression from lordship to government , and in many places , exploitative lordship persisted well into the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries . Nevertheless , Bisson does see in this period a growing awareness that the most capricious excesses of lordship posed problems for rulers--not because of a concern for the welfare of the people , but because rulers came to realize it was more profitable to manage estates than to exploit them . For this reason , violent local lords started to concern kings and magnates , who increasingly began to expect accountability from their followers . In chapter 6 , " Celebration and Persuasion ( 1160-1225 ) , " Bisson brings this story into the thirteenth century . Here , he argues for the expanding importance of the royal court as a new experience of power , distinct from lordship . In addition , money takes on new significance in this period ; the increased need for money forced rulers of all sorts to look for new revenues beyond traditional lordly prerogatives . The thirteenth century thus sees important developments that fuel the transition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the events surrounding Magna Carta reveals , such change was slow . Though Magna Carta is evidence for new forms of consultative government , sources from the time--still trapped inside older conceptions of power--did not recognize these novelties . Lordship remained central to the worldview of medieval people long after it had begun to fade in significance . <p> This is an expansive work , and summarizing an argument with such a broad scope is difficult . Different readers will undoubtedly take away different themes and lessons from the book . Here , I would like to highlight two arguments of Bisson 's that I think are especially compelling and merit further debate . The first concerns the distinction he draws between lordship and fidelity on the one hand and office and administrative competence on the other . As he explains , past historians have been inclined to see official positions like that of sheriff in England or pr+vot in France as evidence of rational government . Bisson , however , is much more skeptical . He argues that , prior to the later twelfth century , these offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fidelity to the king . As a result , such men were not interested in managing the rights and territories that came with these positions ; they were exploitative lords , similar to the worst castellans . The holders of these and similar offices only started to become accountable for their actions when kings and other rulers began to be concerned about mismanagement . Gradually , competence then replaced fidelity as an important factor in who acquired these positions . <p> The second argument I would like to highlight is Bisson 's cautious use of the word " politics . " He argues throughout that lordship leaves no room for politics . Lords , from kings to castellans , may have taken counsel from their followers , but that does not mean we can speak of consultative forms of government in the eleventh and twelfth centuries . Indeed , sources prior to the thirteenth century provide little evidence for the existence of genuine political discourse . Groups that may look like political factions to modern scholars were routinely labeled conspiracies by medieval writers who had no conception of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point , " How did assemblies as such , as distinct from the doings of assembled people , become instrumental in the exercise of power ? " ( p. 558 ) . This is an important question , and one that Bisson does well to raise here . <p> While anyone who reads this book will undoubtedly find it easy to quibble with some details , the overall arc of the work 's argument is impressive . For me , the most significant complaint is that Bisson is at times lacking in critical detachment . While he acknowledges that " corruption " is an anachronistic term to use for the twelfth century , there is still a tendency here to criticize lords because they exploited and mistreated peasants . This stance is most distracting when Bisson uses words like " inhumane " ( p. 76 ) to describe the experience of power . Rational government is the protagonist in this story ; violent lords , the bad guys dressed all in black . Ultimately , however , this is a minor criticism . Bisson has provided historians with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval lordship , politics , and government .

Women were the main characters of this narrative in such programs as Any Day Now ( 1998-2002 ) and I 'll Fly Away ( 1991-93 ) and in films like Heart of Dixie ( 1989 ) and Long Walk Home ( 1990 ) . None of these efforts , however , do justice to the importance of women within the movement ( surely the heroic struggles of Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash are worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of three Freedom Summer Civil Rights workers in 1964 . NBC 's Murder in Mississippi ( 1990 ) , Rob Reiner 's Ghosts of Mississippi ( 1996 ) and Alan Parker 's Mississippi Burning ( 1988 ) all failed to present a story that includes all participants . The point of view of the three films is that of the white world , not the black community , and Mississippi Burning ignores history altogether by suggesting that the F.B.I were the heroes when in fact they had more in common with the White Citizens Council than the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee . Fuller does provide some praise for the TNT network for its commitment to tell the civil rights story from the point of view of the black community in such productions as Freedom Song ( 2000 ) . <p> What all these productions have in common , however , is a redefinition of progress from that of the original goal of the movement--social equality between two racial groups--to that of racial harmony between individuals of different races . The distinction between these two goals is that the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recognition of class as part of the problem ) while the latter needs an individual commitment ( meetings , personal character , and the recognition that the community is responsible for the problem ) . The latter goal excludes government action . <p> A redefinition of a different sort is examined by David John Marley ( assistant professor of history at Vanguard University ) in his article , " Riding the Back of the Bus : The Christian Right 's Adoption of Civil Rights Movement Rhetoric . " As the past two presidential elections remind us , the cultural wars are alive and well in the United States . The religious Right has become an important base of support for the Republican Party and its political mantra is the claim that , like black citizens living under segregation , its members are victims of prejudice , religious citizens living under secular segregation . Ralph Reed initiated this approach while head of the Christian Coalition . He argued that evangelical Christians should present themselves as an oppressed minority whose rights have been denied them by the liberals who dominate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coalition should emulate the civil rights movement by using the church as a political forum , the media as a vehicle to strike back at their opponents , and a community-based organizing effort to build a political insurgency that would dominate the Republican Party at the state level . <p> That the evangelical community is not a minority and is not oppressed , nor is it prevented from participating in the political process ( not to mention that it has not suffered violence for being religious ) , is irrelevant to both the leaders of the coalition and to the leadership of the Republican Party . But Ralph Reed has not been the only individual to attempt to disguise his political ambitions with the cloak of the civil rights movement . The editors include a short piece by author and National Public Radio commentator Sarah Vowell that provides a humorous critique of those who claim to be the modern-day Rosa Parks , heroic figures demonstrating courage for their beliefs ( Ted Nugent for rifles and deer-hunting as an example ! ) . <p> Taken together , the thirteen essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expressed through popular culture remind readers of the oft-quoted comment of Daniel Moynihan , " Everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but not their own facts .

Public cynicism , according to this charge , can be attributed not merely to what the media are saying about politics , politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are saying it . All sorts of people have an interest in making this charge . Defenders of the current President of the United States , for example , are wont to explain the media 's preoccupation with Monica Lewinsky and the White House sex scandal in terms of their insularity and a pathological need to move a story along with new , more sensational angles and evidence , whatever their merits. 3 <p> Much criticism of the media is impressionistic and polemical . It easily descends into scapegoating , and accordingly can be as easily dismissed . But do the polemics have any foundation ? Do the media purvey cynicism , or do they merely communicate " what is out there " ? Can empirical evidence be mustered to settle the matter ? This is the task to which Joseph N. Cappella and Kathleen Hall Jamieson address themselves in Spiral of Cynicism : The Press and the Public Good . While much of the book is a fairly technical presentation of statistical evidence drawn from controlled experiments , they make their project a matter for concern to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reflect on some big questions : What is politics ? How can we understand the activity of politics ? With what other human activities can it best be compared ? And with what other activities would a comparison yield deleterious consequences for political life ? <p> News coverage , like all communication , operates in metaphors , and the metaphors commonly deployed to communicate political events and issues are those of sports and war . We routinely speak of elections as " horse races , " candidates " coming from behind , " races " going down to the wire . " Party politics is described as a " team sport . " Politicians get " outflanked , " elections are " pitched battles , " political enemies " sling the mud . " So common are these metaphors that their significance escapes us . Their significance does not escape Cappella and Jamieson ; how the news is structured or framed--how a metaphor is deployed to organize and make intelligible otherwise inchoate political information--is central to their purpose . <p> For the authors , sports and war metaphors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Political events , as any reader of Bernard Crick 's In Defence of Politics remembers , can also be framed as a debate among proponents of divergent positions . Here the debaters are not so much competitors or enemies as members of a community holding some things in common and others not . To apply another metaphor , a dinnertime conversation among members of a family could fairly be described as a debate among diverse members of a community . Is it at all accurate or illuminating to describe that conversation as a military campaign or a sudden death playoff ? <p> The discussion of issues is a way to frame news , and this frame , argue Cappella and Jamieson , is more congenial to the democratic concepts of common good and responsible , informed citizenship . The media have a choice , they claim , and they choose the wrong ways to present news to the public . After all , what is important is not merely what is said . It is also crucial to understand how what is said is said . This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the authors and anyone concerned about the political power of the media is how framing affects our views of politics . <p> This critique is commonly made , but again , the difference with this book is that the authors attempt an empirical verification of an otherwise well-worn polemic . Here is the theoretical background . In their cognitive-narrative approach to human understanding , the authors claim that human knowledge is based on the ordering of information into understandable networks of nodes . Stories provide such " associative networks " ; they are the structures on which hang the details of news . Stories make information intelligible . They impose order on chaos . <p> Framing political news in terms of sports and war orders news in a particular way . The authors call this kind of framing " strategic framing . " In sports and war , actors set for themselves a clear , widely known goal : to win . Their efforts are directed to this singular end . Observers are invited to draw obvious conclusions about the motivations of the actors . Everything , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of achieving the ultimate goal . And the actors are duly praised for such strategic thinking . We admire the Olympic swimmer who for years , with gold medal in mind , spends hours daily in the water perfecting his or her stroke . <p> But when the strategic frame is applied to political events , observers are led to conclude that the politicians are single-mindedly bent on winning , whether winning means winning an election or winning a vote in the legislature . Everything they say and do is considered instrumental to this final purpose . Observers are led to conclude that the motivation of the politician is essentially one-dimensional and selfish . Even when they tell the truth , politicians are thought to be subordinating it to the ulterior end of victory . Citizens then become cynical about politicians and the process allowing them to act one-dimensionally . This is because , Cappella and Jamieson argue , people are cognitive misers : people make judgements about people and issues as they absorb information . When a news frame is presented to them in future , not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ; they also recall the judgements they made when they engaged the frame earlier on . <p> So Cappella and Jamieson argue that the strategic news frame stimulates and embeds in the political consciousness of news consumers a particular view of the world , resulting in a world where political leaders are driven wholly by the strategic imperative , the will to win . And while this makes perfect sense in sports , it produces a cynicism in the democratic polity damaging to its long-term health . The strategic frame occludes other ways of seeing politics . The media , long thought the properly skeptical watchdogs keeping politicians honest , have instead stepped from skepticism into a corrosive , debilitating cynicism concerned only with the finding of fault , the impugning of motives , and the trashing of solutions . <p> The authors conducted controlled experiments using two news events . The first was a classic " horse race " political story , the Philadelphia mayoral election of 1991 . The second was a complex public policy debate , the Clinton health care reform initiative of 1993-1994 . News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strategic frame already discussed and the " issues " frame which presents political events not as a contest among combatants but as a debate among divergent perspectives on what best serves the public good . They expected subjects exposed to strategic coverage to understand politics in strategic terms , and to be more cynical in consequence . Those exposed to issue-based coverage would possess a healthier , more sophisticated understanding of politics and political issues . Since the results of different types of news consumption were compared to control groups , differences in reported attitudes could be attributed to the independent variables--that is , the news frames . <p> Their conclusions can be summarized briefly : <p> A ) Framing produces a significant recall effect . After they are exposed to a particular type of frame , respondents later recall information consistent with that frame . <p> C ) The evidence is not so clear for issue frames . Indeed , issue coverage of the health care reform debate also tended to produce higher cynicism . The authors did not expect this result and attempt to explain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that coverage " undermines all available solutions " ( p. 161 ) even issue frames can induce cynicism . Thus " conflict-oriented " issue framing produces the same effects as strategic framing . Their content analysis of the health care coverage indicates that media treatment of this issue was even more negative than the 1992 Presidential election campaign . The data do not wholly support this explanation , but the authors are satisfied that the theory and the data are highly suggestive . <p> D ) Regarding the demographics of cynicism , cynicism does not vary by respondent 's ideological disposition . Nor are the cynics more likely to read strategic coverage . Cynics believe that the media impose strategic frames on political news . Political cynicism also spills over into media cynicism . Cynicism is highest among avid consumers of political news . Respondents considered " uninterpreted " media coverage--that is , coverage coming into the living room over the heads of the **26;1791;TOOLONG be most positive . <p> &gt;From all this Cappella and Jamieson find general support for their theory . The findings point to an unsettling set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians both carry on a cynical discourse because each thinks it is required by the other . Politicians do not get coverage unless they are negative and cynical . Reporters are cynical because this is the picture they are presented with and it happens to be a very simple way to pitch a story . The second is that public cynicism accordingly increases . The third spiral is that reporters think the public wants and will reward cynical , negative coverage ( pp. 237-38 ) . Media perceive that news consumers want a horse race , not political substance . <p> Is there hope ? The authors take some solace in favourable respondent attitudes formed after they viewed an NBC special program called " To Your Health , " which was based on a news frame different from the strategic and issues frames . This program followed the " narrative news frame " and had the following features : " absence of technical discussion of health reform plans ; real people with stories about their own health care concerns ; interaction among experts , leaders , and ordinary citizens ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; little innuendo from reporters about the real , hidden motives of the involved parties ; the search for an acknowledgment of common ground when it existed ; and civility by all parties " ( p. 234 ) . The program was popular , informative , serious , and engaging , and it avoided the cynical , psychologizing spin of so much other programming . <p> This is an engaging , provocative read , even for those not enamoured of significance levels and t-tests . The book gives an imprimatur to common sense understandings of media effects . Yet this serves as a criticism : the book is far more interesting as an exercise in political theory than as a quantitative verification of widely held suspicions . I was left thinking more about different conceptions of politics and how the media seem bent on conveying only certain conceptions . Unfortunately , this is a matter on which the authors only touch in their book . <p> I also wonder if the authors ' surprising finding--that the issues coverage of the health care debate , like the strategic coverage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book . The authors engage those who believe that the media are incapable of being anything other than a shallow , callous , and ultimately destructive player in democratic politics . Cappella and Jamieson suggest that there are alternatives to strategic framing and that these can contribute to a civil , constructive politics . Yet if both issue-based and strategic framing can induce cynicism , we seem left with the conclusion that the media induce cynicism unless the coverage is light , peppy , agreeable , and tame . If this is so , then the media do seem incapable of communicating political information to a democratic populace . <p> Nonetheless , Spiral of Cynicism deserves a place in the literature on recent republican political theory . The authors appeal to a discourse of the common good , to the civility of debate among members of a community . They attempt to demonstrate how a departure from such a discourse can be destructive . And they suggest ways the media can contribute to republican conceptions of democratic citizenship . One can not fail to notice the Arendtian themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics away from sport and war--and the attendant fixation on the motivations of political actors these metaphors provoke--and toward debate , reason , and discourse on the common good . <p> Finally , Cappella and Jamieson contest an older , still venerated notion that the achievement of democratic polities in the twentieth century has been to domesticate , defang , and in some ways " depoliticize " politics . Democratic stability , in this view , is achieved by transforming politics into bloodless sport. 4 No such luck , say the authors . Civic disengagement will exact its price . Politics is politics , not sport . To think otherwise is to imperil democracy 's prospects . <p> 2 .

The author , the Robert and Florence McDonnell Professor of East European Studies and Director of the Center for Russian and East European Studies at Stanford University , also made extensive use of American , British , and West German sources , some memoirs , interviews , and a variety of newspapers . The result is a richly detailed and fascinating account of the four and one half year occupation . <p> The author argues that the Soviets did not occupy Germany with " specific long-range goals " in mind ( 465 ) , let alone a detailed plan of action . Rather , the occupation was shaped largely by a complex mixture of opportunism , principle , " Bolshevik predisposition , " ( 468 ) and conflict with the West . The Soviets wanted to edge out the Americans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all traces of Nazism , guarantee the creation of a " democratic " and " antifascist " German state , and collect reparations . Perhaps most important , Moscow wanted to build popular support among ordinary Germans for its policies and those of the German Communists ( KPD , after April 1946 the Socialist Unity Party , or SED ) . But the behavior of the Red Army , the activities of several powerful Soviet institutions active in Germany , and the unwillingness of the occupiers and their German clients to tolerate spontaneity made this impossible . As a result , the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was born in 1949 with feet of clay ; it was a hollow structure propped up by Moscow 's might and by one of the most sophisticated secret police establishments ever created . When these two supports began to disintegrate in 1989 , the GDR collapsed virtually overnight . <p> Naimark begins with the creation of SVAG in the summer of 1945 . Assuming that Stalin had no elaborate plan for postwar Germany and given the immediate problems facing the Red Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create an apparatus to administer their zone . With the capture of Berlin , the Soviets also brought in several groups ( the Initiativgruppen ) of KPD leaders to begin rebuilding German administrations . From the start , however , Soviet efforts proved far from efficient . In the month before SVAG 's founding , local Red Army commanders , without the benefit of clear lines of authority or special training , ruled the zone more or less arbitrarily . Even after the creation of SVAG , administrative efficiency in the zone was hindered by tensions between Moscow and SVAG headquarters in Karlshorst and between Soviet administrators in Germany . Even as the Soviets turned administrative functions over to their German clients , they tried to maintain control over even minute details of day-to-day administration . This practice improved neither zonal administration nor Soviet-German relations . <p> Of particular importance to these relations was the behavior of Red Army soldiers during the initial period of occupation . Naimark 's research supports the estimate made by German historians Barbara Johr and Helke Sander that Soviet soldiers raped as many as two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory and well past the formal end of hostilities ( see Johr and Sander , eds. , Befreier und Befreite , Krieg , Vergewaltigungen , Kinder , Munich : Verlag Antje Kunstmann , 1992 ) . While Berlin was hardest hit , the problem was endemic in the Soviet zone . Though aware of the mass rapes , SVAG officers in Germany , KPD/SED leaders , and high-level Soviet officials remained unable or unwilling to do much to stop them . The extent to which Stalin was aware of the situation is unclear , but there is evidence he condoned the practice in general . Without question , the implications for Soviet and German Communist rule in the zone ( or SBZ ) were very serious : " ... the Germans resisted rape ... by turning it back against the Soviets . So long as Russians ruled in the Eastern zone , there could be no legitimacy for the Communist Party of Germany , which initially might have been counted on to be one of the most promising in Europe " ( 121 ) . <p> Other depredations plagued German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally altered the economy of eastern Germany by forcibly redistributing land and expropriating factories and production . Meanwhile , soldiers and occupation officials took an enormous quantity of loot -- everything from wristwatches to priceless artwork . After the failure of the Allies to settle the reparations question , the Soviets went ahead with large-scale removals from their zone . No central records appear to have been kept of the often unplanned and haphazard " take " from Germany , but Naimark estimates that the Soviets achieved their goal of ten billion dollars in reparations through removals and ongoing ( or current ) production by 1950 ( 168-9 ) . The costs to the German economy were enormous -- Moscow 's " insatiable " demand for reparations resulted in the loss of perhaps one third of eastern Germany 's industrial base . The SED , increasingly identified by the German public as a tool of the Kremlin , was unable to convince the Soviets to take a more rational approach to securing reparations until a good deal more damage had been done to Soviet-German relations . <p> The author also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German military and atomic technologies . On this issue in particular , the Cold War began in Germany at the onset of the occupation . American , British , and Soviet officials raced to capture scientists and industrial technology , partly to benefit their own economies , but also with an eye to future East-West military competition . Regarding nuclear science , Naimark 's findings comport with those of David Holloway , the historian of the Soviet atomic bomb project . The German contribution here was small but not insignificant : " The Germans ' experience in wartime laboratories , backed by modern chemical , optics , and electric energy industries , proved to be a welcome addition to the Soviets ' theoretical sophistication , espionage success , and ability to muster the vast resources of the country for building the bomb " ( 214 ) . Like rape , plunder , and reparations removals , however , " the Soviet desire to acquire German science , technology , and material , especially uranium , brought the Stalinist terror very close to home for the Germans .... As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern zone of Germany " ( 250 ) . <p> Also critical to the history of the occupation and the GDR was the creation of an extensive secret police apparatus that would become the Staatssicherheitsdienst ( or " Stasi " ) in 1950 . While noting that only part of the East German secret police story can be told without access to KGB archives , Naimark provides us with the fullest account yet of the Stasi 's birth . Beginning in the summer of 1945 , " the Soviets constructed an impressive police system in the zone in a very short time indeed " ( 374 ) . The German Communists were determined , of course , to dominate the new system , and built into it several branches designed " to know everything and to report everything worth knowing ' " ( 366 ) . At the same time , the NKVD/MVD " led an almost completely independent Soviet secret policy operation in the zone " ( 379 ) by rounding up a total of 122,671 suspected Nazis and anti-Soviet elements ( particularly young people , members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depositing them in " special camps " where as many as 43,889 perished ( 376 ) . SVAG and SED officials protested to Moscow about the NKVD/MVD 's activities , but , again , much damage was done to Soviet-German relations before the Kremlin moved to alleviate the problem . <p> Naimark devotes two chapters to the relationship between the Soviets and the German Left and the question of who made policy in the SBZ . The author reveals that a great deal of political " spontaneity " and diversity existed among the German Left immediately after the war . Yet SVAG and German Communist chief Walter Ulbricht , both reflecting the " Stalinist distrust of spontaneous institutions , " ( 271 ) would tolerate neither moderate socialists nor groups of hard-line communists eager to Sovietize Germany . SVAG and the SED 's abandonment of " a German road to socialism " in favor of a " Sovietized " SBZ in 1947 and 1948 , however , was also the direct result of continued economic hardship in the zone , the unpopularity of the Russians and the SED , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new details about Colonel Sergei Tiul'panov , head of SVAG 's Propaganda Administration and the foremost Russian advocate of a Sovietized Germany in the SBZ . By 1946 , Naimark argues , Tiul'panov 's office " was running politics in the Soviet zone " ( 322 ) . Despite deep displeasure with his performance among some members of the CPSU 's Central Committee , the Colonel survived long enough to shape the SED as " a party of a new type " ( 346 ) . Tiul'panov probably survived as long as he did not because Soviet Politburo member Andrei Zhdanov protected him ( Naimark found no evidence to support this claim ) , but because " there were no senior officials who could operate in the German environment with the ease that he did " ( 351 ) . That he was so influential was probably due to his willingness to make hard decisions other SVAG officials wished to avoid . These decisions pointed eastern Germany in the direction of Sovietization . Given Moscow 's intense desire for reparations and a demilitarized , neutral Germany , Naimark seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to replace the hard-line propaganda chief . Perhaps greater " flexibility , " he suggests , would have helped prevent the division of Germany . Given the widespread unpopularity of SVAG and the SED by 1947 , however , it seems " Sovietization " was about the only choice available to Moscow were it not to leave the SED 's fate to the masses . <p> The Soviet occupation of Germany was a failure for the Soviets and a disaster for the Germans . Moscow obtained extensive reparations only at the cost of nearly crippling the East German economy . Heavy-handed Soviet and German Communist tactics in the zone encouraged the Western allies ( and Western Germans ) to accept Germany 's division . Terrorized and often deprived of their livelihoods , Germans in the east came to despise SVAG and the SED . The life and death of the GDR , then , can be understood only with reference to its difficult birth . <p> Despite the book 's scope , the relationship among SVAG , the German Communists , and the Church goes largely unexamined . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few mistaken dates are minor distractions . It is tempting to criticize the author for not providing more extensive speculation as to the Kremlin 's intentions in postwar Germany , but Naimark pointedly avoids such speculation for the sound reason that important Soviet records ( particularly those held in the Presidential and KGB archives ) remain closed . Naimark 's book is most valuable for its analysis of Soviet-German relations " on the ground " in the SBZ , and he provides readers with a necessary companion to recent works by Wilfried Loth , R.C. Raack , and Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshakov , among others . In short , The Russians in Germany will remain the standard source on the Soviet occupation until scholars gain greater access to Soviet archives .

In that book , he focused on the process by which a sizeable minority of the German population came to agree with Adolf Hitler and his early followers that Germany needed a new politics that would bring " the idea of the nation to life , " as the call to arms in 1914 had done. 1 Now Fritzsche provides us with a book in which we see the implementation of that ideology once the party gains power . Process remains critical to his analysis . Though the NSDAP enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence in the early 1930s , Fritzsche argues in Life and Death that much work remained to be done , starting in 1933 , to convince large sections of the population that Germany was on the right course--indeed , the only course . <p> That the regime succeeded in amassing and maintaining broad support even through the darkest days of the war is not a new idea . What is original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to unravel the ways individuals wrestled with becoming ( and I would add remaining ) Nazis--among close friends and family members , and within their own minds and hearts . As the book approaches German military defeat , Fritzsche assesses what Germans knew of the genocide , and here again he traces the emotional struggles of surviving Jews and non-Jewish Germans . While the workings of memory have been central to scholarship on the postwar era for some time now , Fritzsche 's concluding chapter offers insight into the construction of these very memories--the psychological roots of the miscomprehension and willful amnesia regarding the crimes committed by Germans that plagued the first post-war generation . <p> The book is chronologically organized around four long chapters . Surprisingly perhaps in this age of digital reproduction , the text is unaccompanied by photographs . He relies heavily on letters and diaries , which , along with the graceful prose we have come to expect from Fritzsche , provide dramatic evidence and a level of narrative coherence that make the book eminently readable from cover to cover . As he explains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall argument , because they " transcribed the strain of conversion " ( p. 10 ) . <p> The first chapter , " Reviving the Nation , " discusses the early years of the regime and individuals ' attempts to come to grips with the new situation . He centers his chapter around three personal narratives : one whose author welcomed the revolution ; one who resisted it ; and one who reconciled himself to it , even " surrendering himself at times to the embrace of the national community " ( p. 35 ) . While Fritzsche notes that some Germans converted for reasons of fear or because of social pressure , and many continued to distrust , dislike or simply misunderstand individual policies or principles , he chooses to focus on the vast majority of Germans who came to believe that " National Socialism had healed German history " and that it " offered them a new , improved version of national life " ( p. 37 ) . Seeking therefore to understand the attractions of the National Socialist future , Fritzsche turns his discussion to the Volksgemeinschaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1918 , and the failure of the republican era to recapture a sense of unity torn asunder by defeat and the ensuing instability . After 1933 , the party won converts not simply through its rhetoric of national revival or by the force it used to undermine the myriad local class- and confessional-based cultural activities throughout the country , but by involving millions as volunteers in the collective effort . " Coordination , " writes Fritzsche , " was a process of dissolution and affiliation " ( p. 51 ) . He emphasizes affiliation with a glimpse into the audiovisual spaces of the new era--the way film , radio , advertising , and magazines created a common culture ( unter uns ) within Germany that marked the boundaries of the exclusive people 's community . Moreover , Fritzsche argues that the camera-ready staging of major and minor political events , from party rallies to the broadcasting of speeches , reinforced the sense that history was being made , indeed remade , and that the individual too was a participant in this heroic mission . <p> Fritzsche 's insights in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the very discomfort that came with conversion was so common an experience that it actually contributed to the construction of a shared community . On the other hand , the desire of most non-Jewish Germans to accept the Volksgemeinschaft " as a workable ideal " meant that they became eager consumers of the " images of acclamation " ( p. 75 ) that flooded the audio-visual landscape . <p> In " Racial Grooming " we learn how this more general unter uns mentality was cast in racial terms and see the tasks that lay ahead for both ordinary Germans and the movement 's " racial warriors , " who were writing and implementing policy . Turning Germans into " Aryans " was a monumental task , and once again ordinary Germans were enlisted in the project . Fritzsche recounts the process by which members of the people 's community assembled their own " Aryan " passports and visited a variety of reeducation camps . Everyone from young members of the Hitler Youth and their older siblings performing their labor service to professionals and civil servants in their forties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn their new roles . Undoing bonds to other milieus was the aim , and learning to fit in was the assignment . Those not welcome in this new environment , of course , were sorted and shunted off to their own camp system : communists and socialists , " asocials , " and the disabled . In these pages and the last section that follows on the major antisemitic legislation and events of the prewar years , readers do n't receive much in the way of new analysis , but the concise treatment of the timeline and the inclusion of diary excerpts to personalize the narrative make for engaging reading . <p> In " Empire of Destruction , " the author frames the war as an imperialist project . Though the Nazi leadership had no detailed plan or set boundaries in mind , Fritzsche notes that its priorities for the East and " the demands of war forced the Germans to adopt more modest approaches " ( p. 165 ) . In the first years of the war , hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were repatriated into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section to this aspect of Nazi hubris . Of course , this population transfer was made possible by the enslavement and slaughter of Jews and Slavs in these same areas , inspiring the local Baedeker to advertise Cracow and Lublin as " ( now Jew-free ) " ( p. 176 ) and leaving thousands of apartments fully furnished and ready for new tenants . His arguments about the radicalization of policy toward Europe 's Jews and Germans ' enduring loyalty to Nazism work as one : since National Socialist ideology positioned Germany as the victim of history , military setbacks after 1941 reaffirmed the extent of the so-called Jewish menace , necessitating the annihilation of that threat and tying Germans ever more closely to the do-or-die message of the war . This chapter is the most historiographically minded in the book . Students and instructors alike will appreciate Fritzsche 's analysis of key recent and classic scholarship , including work by Elizabeth Harvey , Christopher Browning , and Omer Bartov . Without forgetting that local inhabitants across the continent were often eager participants in the hunting down and killing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazi empire . He includes a lengthy section on the deportation of German Jews , and he reminds the reader that Auschwitz lay within the expanded borders of the Reich , with a direct phone line from Berlin to the rail station 's sorting platform . <p> The absence of Jews from most Germans ' lives ( soldiers and civilians alike ) by the end of 1942 was critical to their understanding of the last years of the conflict and the early postwar period . In his final chapter , Fritzsche depicts how , as civilians began to see themselves as victims of Allied aerial bombardment and flagging military fortunes after Stalingrad , the Jews remained only as an abstraction . Non-Jewish Germans ' stories of bombings , deprivation , and fear of impending catastrophe , which arrived for some in the form of expulsion and rape , were told and retold and faced no competition , no counter-narratives from Jewish neighbors who had by the end of the war been gone for years . The sense of victimhood among Germans on the home front made it easier not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract image of the Jew for the destruction . " When it came to the Jews , " writes Fritzsche , " many Germans let themselves be bombed into a clear conscience " ( p. 260 ) . Moreover , if the bombings were retribution for the brutal treatment of Jews , then , many Germans concluded , further retaliation would follow defeat . So just as the process of becoming Nazis , though difficult for some , had united the nation , in the war 's final years Germans overlooked any pangs of guilt or shame to fight on together , because they feared the non-Nazi future that awaited them . Fritzsche concludes that the regime allowed German civilians and soldiers to witness , participate in , or at the very least know enough about the genocide to produce an " intimacy of complicity " ( p. 286 ) that successfully bonded them to the fate of the regime . <p> So what did Jews and non-Jews in Germany know about the extermination that was proceeding not so far away ? In sum , Fritzsche argues that many Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass shootings of civilians , including women and children , and the participation of the Wehrmacht in this brutality . Without specific details about Auschwitz and other death camps , however , " the Holocaust was largely contained by the knowledge of mass murder on the military front " ( p. 264 . In other words , even the most pessimistic , including Victor Klemperer , could grasp atrocities like Babi Yar but continued to see the rumors of mass death among evacuees , including the use of gas , as " events and episodes " ( p. 264 ) --retaliation by a defeated army rather than part of a well-planned and orchestrated campaign of genocide . Among non-Jews too , the information remained vague , though the belief that the bombing runs were the vengeful actions of international Jewry should be viewed as an admission that unspeakable crimes had been committed . <p> Life and Death in the Third Reich is a subtle , analytic text , rather than a survey of Nazi Germany . No sustained treatment of women or family policy is included , and resistance too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge about the party and state bureaucracies and Adolf Hitler 's role in these structures . Some readers may find that non-Jewish victims of the regime do not receive enough attention . I suspect as well that the complexity of the argumentation will be beyond all but the best undergraduates . However , the strength of chapters 1 and 4 alone should make this book a standard on graduate syllabi and reading lists . In these two chapters , the book convincingly demonstrates how an overwhelming proportion of non-Jewish Germans came to hold the goals of the regime in such high regard , and why they continued to believe in the Third Reich even once defeat was unavoidable , if anything " blaming the Nazis for destroying Nazism " ( p. 272 ) . It shows ordinary Germans as they most likely were : at times conflicted , ebullient , ashamed , disappointed and fearful , and it illustrates how these emotions ( both the good and the bad ) could unite the population behind National Socialism in ways not easily undone by the collapse of the regime or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holocaust at war 's end . No monograph does a better job of dwelling in the complexities of individual experiences in the Third Reich and connecting those lived experiences to the big issues that still fascinate scholars and students : the attractions of community and the extent of complicity , the will to survive and to forget , and the blind spots of reconciliation .

In the 1990s , arguments and theorizing about pluralism encompass a plethora of issues . Some of these debates focus on international phenomena such as the effects of globalization and the collapse of the Soviet Union . A different aspect of theorizing about pluralism , important in the United States , leads some theorists ( both the " Old Left " and the Right ) to focus on an ever more involuted process resulting in a proliferation of identity movements that partly overlap and partly contradict one another and on the role of " political correctness " in the construction of this process . <p> William Connolly suggests that , though this shift toward the " pluralist imagination " has resulted in the incorporation of many more perspectives and social movements into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contested , it has left fundamentally unexamined pluralism 's own essentialist notions of identity . Pluralism , in purporting to oppose fundamentalism , is plagued with two of the very same conservative elements , which resist the formation of new identities seemingly antithetical to those which are currently accepted . The first is an essentialist notion of difference , based on current established identities , which resists the possibilities of new bases for identities . The second is a system of moral standards of judgment that is taken from the results of prior political struggles ( p. xiv ) . In order to reconstruct a pluralism that avoids these problems , Connolly advocates a new pluralism , driven by what he calls an " ethos of critical responsiveness " toward new movements . This new ethos would reject the essentialization of identity or morality in considering the place of new movements . <p> In The Ethos of Pluralization , Connolly considers these problems from a variety of perspectives . The book is a collection of essays , two of which are new publications and four of which have previously appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been woven explicitly through all of these essays ; rather , the introduction lays out the metatheoretical perspective that binds them together . <p> Chapter 1 , " Nothing Is Fundamental , " employs a post-Nietzschean and Foucauldian paradigm to critique the ontological problems inherent in contemporary pluralism . In the next chapter , " The Desire to Punish , " Connolly uses a modified Giraudian framework in a discussion of the competing desires for revenge and punishment involved in the trial of a young black man who has been convicted of shooting several whites . " Democracy , Equality , Normality " uses the theories of C. B. Macpherson as a foil against which Connolly sets forth his own program . The problem for Connolly in this chapter is to construct a pluralism that is not imbued with forces toward normalization and depoliticization . " Fundamentalism in America , " chapter 4 , continues this discussion on the topic of fundamentalism and its relationship to liberalism in the United States . In " Democracy and Territoriality , " Connolly moves his gaze to the international realm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a determinist frame of nation-states . Instead , he wants to examine the possibilities for cross-national movements and non-state centered theories . <p> " Tocqueville , Religiosity and Pluralization , " the last and arguably the best essay in the collection , takes up the question of the enactment of identities and critiques of what is variously lumped together as " multiculturalism , " " post-modernism " and " political correctness . " Connolly argues in opposition to critics who claim that pluralism is becoming pluralized to the point of trivializing very real bases of inequality . He states that diversifying bases of identity does not mean losing the cultural connections through which people can be bound together and moved to action . He claims that " when the cultural conditions of pluralization are reasonably intact , differentiation along some lines opens up multiple possibilities of selective collaboration along others . To pluralize , therefore , is not to fragmentize . To dogmatize is to fragmentize . This finding discloses how self-appointed opponents of fragmentation so often work on its behalf " ( p. 197 ) . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How would the ethos of critical responsiveness be promoted or enacted ? This project is not concretized in this collection , and it is a necessary next step if the evolution of progressive thought is to follow the path that Connolly has indicated . Connolly has produced a strong discussion here of the problems inherent in contemporary ( what he might call conservative ) pluralism , but the work lacks a firm outline for a positive project , for activists or theorists , to overcome these flaws . 69401 @qwx479401

The book centers on the expansion in Ethiopia of ox-plow technology and annual crop regimes over a period of two centuries . The first part of the book describes the physical and demographic landscape and appraises macro-level changes in crop repertoire , land use , and population settlement patterns . The second provides micro-level analyses of three distinct farming areas--Ankober , Gera , and Ada--wherein McCann examines farmers ' decisions concerning land , labor , and capital ( oxen and seeds ) within a framework of changing physical and social environments . The author has exploited an impressive array of sources , ranging from the reminiscences of farmers , expressed in interviews and life histories , to travel narratives , agricultural surveys , photographs and engravings , and modern farming systems research . <p> The conceptual framework of the book was previously formulated in two articles published in the Journal of African History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that African agricultural history has not been treated as an independent field of historical inquiry but rather as a subset of broader themes in political economy and peasant studies . Recent African famines have generated considerable interest in examining the roots of agricultural crises , but the accounts thus far produced have been synchronic , lop-sided , and uninformed by historical evidence on agriculture . Even professional historians have failed to practice the fundamental principle of their trade--that is , the reconstruction of historical events , processes , and patterns from past signs . McCann 's corrective approach to agriculture and its history is simple : agriculture is what the farmer does--the selection of crops , soil management , harvesting , and storage--and its history is the reconstruction of the ecological past that structured and shaped the farmer 's interaction with the physical environment . <p> The book 's greatest value lies in its innovative methodology . Scholars have long sought a sharper theoretical focus on agricultural affairs , greater attention to multidisciplinary approaches , and empirically verifiable sources . They will reap great intellectual reward from McCann 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New World agriculture , the Annales school , and farming systems research . Ethiopianists , who have long called for the integration of Ethiopian history into mainstream African history , will be grateful to McCann for demonstrating that Ethiopian history is more meaningful and historiographically relevant within the framework of a broader African history than in its supposedly unique context . <p> As for substantive contribution , McCann offers refreshing interpretations regarding such issues as the origins of the 1974 revolution and the relationship between politics and agricultural decline , and he puts in perspective assumptions about deforestation , specialized agriculture , and the use of manure as fertilizer . Of particular interest is McCann 's rejection of the long-standing argument that the northern land tenure system , the Amharic language , and the Ethiopian Orthodox church were the primary instruments by which northern hegemony was extended over the southern territories . McCann proposes that these factors were secondary to the social transformation brought on by the spread of ox-plow agriculture and the consequent " ecological revolution " that gradually transformed the physical landscape and the social organization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the accompanying annual crop regime played a crucial role in effectively integrating the southern peoples into the northern mode of production and way of life . <p> This is clearly an intriguing approach to the issue of Abyssinian cultural hegemony . Nevertheless , the argument rests on the assumption that agricultural technology and cultivation were diffused in a north-south direction by a powerful expansionist state . It must be remembered that the Oromo had knowledge of cereal cultivation long before they came into contact with the northerners and that the pre-Oromo Sidama inhabitants of the Gibe region had developed their own plow independently of its northern counterpart . Obviously , the subject of the dispersal of Ethiopia 's characteristic agriculture needs much more research and perhaps reinterpretation of data . <p> In regard to sources , the author 's intentions perhaps outrun his achievements . While McCann admits that travelers ' accounts are necessarily snapshots of conditions prevailing at a particular time , he nevertheless frames his main questions on the basis of commentaries by foreign observers , whose visits are a century or two apart ( Alvarez 1520 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; pp. 3-4 ) . Within Ethiopia 's physical landscape even seasonal fluctuations are dramatic , let alone change over several decades ; so observations about climate that are generations apart may tend to be inaccurate and , ultimately , unreliable . Curiously , McCann has premised the fundamental problem of his book on sources that are essentially biased , idiosyncratic , impressionistic , and , at times , contradictory ( p. 33 ) . <p> For McCann , as for William Cronon , an effective narrative of environmental history is one that " hides discontinuities , ellipses and contradictory experiences " ( p. 19 ) . Doubtless , this is an ingenious methodology for dealing with lacunae ; it also points to difficulties inherent in experimental historiography in which conjecture and speculation sometimes threaten to substitute for empirical evidence . <p> McCann 's account is best when he follows his primary sources closely and is less convincing when he moves beyond his data . His analysis of the relationship between population growth and limited resources relies heavily on circumstantial evidence . For instance , while recognizing the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern Ethiopia , McCann identifies migration as the primary cause of demographic pressure and subsequent land subdivision , fragmentation , and scarcity . <p> The connection between population pressure and population movement , however , seems weak and obscure . In Ankober , the migration of the highland population into the Denki valley does not seem to have eased population pressures in the highlands . In Ada , we observe parallel but contradictory processes of in-migration and widespread eviction . Migration appears to serve no explicit purpose . One gets an overall impression of ubiquitous population movement , but no definitive examples of its prevalence . Perhaps , McCann 's " qualitative " sources have overstated the whole issue of migration . <p> Concerning analytical categories , McCann favors paying more attention to those factors that directly affect agricultural productivity and plays down the roles of state and class ( landowners ) . He contends that the state did not have the desire to intervene in decisions at the farm level , and that farmers therefore concerned themselves less with politics than with such factors as demographic changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inarguable that farmers consider these factors vital , but it is unlikely that they made any decision without considering their obligations to the state or the landlord . In the nineteenth century , the royal court atop a hill in Ankober was a constant reminder for Argobba farmers of their obligations to the state . One hundred years later , the evidence shows that landowners in Ada did intervene in farm-level decisions when , for instance , they forbade the cultivation of the local staple sorghum in favor of more marketable teff . <p> On a theoretical plane , McCann argues that the process of Ethiopia 's ox-plow complex more closely resembles Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie 's " great agrarian cycle " than Boserup 's model of population pressure followed by intensification . He rightly compares the slow evolution of Ethiopia 's historic agricultural technology and cropping system with the sluggish process of technological change characteristic of Europe 's preindustrial agriculture . However , none of McCann 's three case studies exhibits the cyclical relationship between demography and productivity that was central to LeRoy Ladurie 's model . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a break in the cycle of agrarian population growth and consequent subsistence crises and and led to new technology and agronomy . The changes , in turn , ensured the continuous growth that led to the capitalist economy . Ethiopia 's modern agriculture is thus comparable only to preindustrial European agriculture , and its deepening crisis does not seem to portend a European-type transformation . It is not clear to me how this attempt at comparison helps to explain the failure of Ethiopia 's modern agriculture . <p> It is equally unclear whether or not the three case studies provide sufficient material to validate McCann 's main thesis that the story of Ethiopian agriculture is the conversion of horticultural societies , pastoralists , and agrarian systems based on perennial crops to the ox-plow complex dependent on annual crops and integrated livestock management . In the first place , McCann does not quite explain why his chosen regions were selected for analysis . Because all three areas are located on the northwestern highlands lying west of the Rift Valley , they can not be projected as representative of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture in Chercher , McCann does not present the condition of agricultural change in the southeastern highlands . An analysis of the Harerge region , which includes Chercher , not only would have expanded the geographical scope but also the historical dimension of McCann 's study . Furthermore , as a region with a long history of commercial contact with the outside world , study of Harerge would have provided an opportunity to examine the effects of the world economy on Ethiopia 's agriculture , a subject that McCann seems to have entirely neglected in all his case studies . ( I should also point out that the current trend in agricultural practice in Harerge runs contrary to McCann 's thesis . Unlike the three micro-agronomic regions , where the long-term trend is the gradual shift from perennials to annual cereal cultivation , the evidence from Harerge highlands shows the gradual replacement of fruit , vegetable , coffee , and cereal fields by khat orchards . ) <p> It is therefore to be regretted that the geographical scope of a study about Ethiopia 's agricultural history did not include an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a rich , interesting , and imaginative book that will likely fuel debate and set research agendas .

In Empire 's Workshop : Latin America , the United States , and the Rise of the New Imperialism , Professor Greg Grandin attempts to give his readers the inside scoop into U.S.-Latin American relations , with extra attention to the period of the Reagan administration . Grandin here argues that the foreign policy pursued in Latin America since Reagan correlates to the current guiding principles leading U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East . Actually , Grandin explicitly states that the U.S. foreign policy implemented in Latin America during the 1980s became the model for the policy pursued today in the Middle East , especially in Iraq . <p> Although written following the traditional arrangement of an introduction , six chapters , and a conclusion , the book can be broken down into four distinct sections . They are as follows : The first quarter of the book gives a brief overview of U.S.-Latin American relations from the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book details U.S.-controlled activity in Guatemala , Nicaragua , and El Salvador during the 1980s and the events leading up to this activity in the 1960s and 1970s . The third quarter of the book explains how these events in Central America were kept from or legitimized to the U.S. public . The final quarter of the book focuses on economic incentives for U.S. involvement in Latin America . Grandin begins in the 1940s but he once again focuses a great deal on the Reagan administration . Grandin then concludes by re-stating his thesis that much of the foreign policy pursued by the Reagan administration in Latin America is today emulated by the Bush administration in the Middle East . <p> This book may prove a good read for both scholars of Latin American history and those who have little background in Latin American history . For readers who are unfamiliar with Latin American history , the book opens their eyes to a side of U.S. history little known to general audiences , especially its involvement in Latin America in the last twenty-five years . For these readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it describes U.S.-led brutality in Central America and other regions . For readers with a background in Latin American history , the book provides further insight into why the United States selected the foreign policy that it did in Latin America . <p> But , for reasons that are not clear , this book is really targeted more toward readers who already have knowledge of Latin American history . Throughout the book , for example , Grandin constantly cites events that occurred in Latin America without explaining them . Although the book admittedly follows a loose chronological order , Grandin does jump around , both in place and time , more than what I would have preferred . This may prove even more problematic for readers who do not know much about Latin American history . Furthermore , the meaning of the titles of Grandin 's chapters and the titles of the subsections within these chapters are not so obvious . If a reader does not fully understand Grandin 's argument , then she will not appreciate the significance of the titles . <p> While it may prove informative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective of the uninitiated Grandin 's book contains one major flaw : Grandin never proves his thesis . Do not get me wrong . Grandin does fully explain how U.S. imperialism in Latin America , particularly in the 1980s , parallels U.S. imperialism today in the Middle East . But what Grandin fails to show is how the Bush administration directly models its current foreign policy in the Middle East , especially Iraq , after the foreign policy of the Regan administration in Latin America . In fact , Iraq itself is barely mentioned at all in the book . <p> Throughout the book , Grandin in a way disproves his own thesis . He discuses how during the Reagan administration , the United States managed to control Central America without sending a large number of U.S. troops . Indeed , much of Grandin 's book is based on how the United States gained so much control in Central America with little actual occupation . But Iraq currently has a relatively large number of U.S. troops physically there , which does not compare well to the numbers present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandin states that most Americans do not pay much attention to Latin America because they take it for granted . But perhaps most Americans currently ignore Latin America because what is currently occurring in Iraq is very different from what occurred in Latin America during the Reagan administration .

Since 1787 the answer has been yes , but not on the same terms upon which a man holds his citizenship . For most of the 211 years since the Constitution was adopted , the differences between the citizenship of men and of women have been most visible in the political and personal rights that men held and women were denied . In regard to civic obligation as well , the experience of citizenship for women in the United States has differed from that of men . Here women appear to have had the advantage . Traditionally , American law has excused women from important but onerous civic duties that men were compelled to perform , such as the draft and jury service . <p> Yet the obligation to defend the state by force of arms against external enemies is by ancient tradition the quid pro quo for the state 's protection of the individual , and arguably this interdependence constitutes the core of citizenship . The obligation to serve on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury , a civic institution central to the rule of law in the Anglo-American tradition . Has it really been advantageous to women to be excused from these duties ? What is the nature of a citizenship that is exempt from these fundamental responsibilities ? In her compelling new book , No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies , Linda Kerber , the May Brodbeck Professor of History at the University of Iowa , undertakes to answer these questions in an ambitious exploration of the history and meaning of women 's civic obligations . <p> Kerber 's premise is that the defining features of citizenship are found not only in rights but also in the obligations of the individual to the state : " In the liberal tradition , rights are implicitly paired with obligation " ( p. xxi ) . Moreover , obligations also embody opportunities to participate in the exercise of the power of the state . Kerber seeks an explanation for the differences between men 's and women 's citizenship obligations and the persistence of those differences in the common-law doctrine of marital unity or coverture . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first chapter , held that during marriage a woman 's separate legal identity was generally suspended and she was " covert " or covered by the legal personality of her husband . The wife 's person , property , and labor became subject to the ownership and control of her husband and , for the duration of the marriage , she lost the legal capacity to enter into contracts , own and manage property , sue or be sued in her own name , choose her place of residence , designate a guardian for her children , and make testamentary dispositions . She was obligated to obey her husband ; indeed , the concern that she was subject to his physical coercion extended so far that a wife might not be held responsible for her own criminal acts if they were performed in the presence of her husband . In exchange for all this , husbands were required to support and maintain their wives and were presumed to be their protectors . <p> Kerber 's expansive but provocative thesis is that the law and norms of coverture " substituted married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state " and constituted " the central element in the way that Americans have thought about the relation of all women , including unmarried women , to state power " ( p. 11 ) . While starting with a common-law doctrine that is centuries old , Kerber gives us a book that is of necessity a history of contemporary American civic law and institutions . <p> She finds that there never have been any " wages of gender " ( p. 309 ) for women to collect . In her view , whatever advantages that gender-based exemption from civic duties appeared to confer upon women have been illusory . Diminished rights were the more lasting accompaniment of reduced civic obligations . Kerber concludes that women have paid a double price for exemption from the full burdens of citizenship . In addition to second-class rights , exemption from obligation has come at the cost of excluding women from many of the institutions through which citizens participate in public life . The obligations of citizenship are themselves rights--the right to be acknowledged as a necessary part of the state and the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . <p> In detailed studies that range from the 1770s to the 1990s , Kerber examines five different civic duties , testing her thesis about coverture and civic obligation and tracing the changing understandings in American law of the identity and obligation of women as citizens . Kerber starts with a case testing the application to married women of Revolutionary-era loyalty laws and ends with the story of the lawsuits that , in 1979 and 1981 , challenged the role of gender in draft law and contemporary military service . In the intervening three chapters , Kerber looks at the use of coverture and vagrancy laws to regulate the labor of freedwomen during Reconstruction , the suffrage tax protest movement of the 1870s , and the women 's jury service cases of the 1960s and 1970s . <p> This survey thus examines legal features of women 's citizenship both before and after the married women 's separate property law reforms that began to take hold in the 1840s and before and after the attainment of woman suffrage in 1920 . It builds on the work of Norma Basch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years have considerably advanced the legal history scholarship on coverture in American domestic relations law and property law , 1 and on her own work in Women of the Republic ( 1980 ) examining the conscious incorporation of coverture into American law after the American Revolution . But No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies pushes beyond the question of coverture 's impact on private law to focus attention on its influence on some of the most basic features of public law . This redirection of the study of coverture is one of her new book 's central contributions . <p> Each of Kerber 's five chapters is skillfully constructed around a case in which a court confronted the question of whether a woman owed the same duty to the state that a man would have owed in like circumstances . Kerber places each case in its era 's social and political history , with a wealth of detail drawn from archival sources and contemporary literature and ample support from modern secondary sources . Kerber peoples her book with an extensive array of individuals whose brief biographical sketches enliven her case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the most interesting contributions this book makes is in the identification of numerous lawyers who from 1801 ( James Sullivan of Massachusetts ) through the current era ( former Deputy Attorney General for Civil Rights Isabelle Pinzler ) have contributed to the formulation of theories of women 's rights and citizenship in various settings . <p> The cases that Kerber investigates are not landmark cases establishing equal rights for women , but rather cases in which courts articulated legal doctrines that justified treating women and men quite differently . In the judicial rhetoric and analysis presented in support of the status quo , Kerber finds textual evidence of the peculiar persistence and strength of the doctrine and culture of coverture . At one level , the significance of these cases lies in their presentation of a legal ideology that served to restrict the political power of women . Yet they are also a fascinating , if unsystematic , record of developing theories of gender equality and , taken together , represent an interesting methodological approach . <p> The first chapter examines the manner in which the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to married women . Its focus is the Martin case , decided in 1805 . In Martin the conflict between coverture and civic obligation was explicit . During the American Revolution , Massachusetts law made forfeit the property of anyone who fled to the protection of the British . Martin 's mother fled Boston for New York ( and later for England ) with her British soldier husband in 1776 . But the Massachusetts court held for her son when he claimed that she had not forfeited her property and he could therefore inherit it . The court concluded that Mrs. Martin had not treasonously withdrawn herself and her loyalty from the rebellion because she had been withdrawn by her husband whom it was her duty to follow and obey . <p> The court 's decision preserved Mrs. Martin 's property and seemed to confer a benefit on married women in such situations . But Kerber argues that the understanding of woman 's citizenship obligations upon which it was based--that a married woman owed primary allegiance to her husband rather than to the state--made married women vulnerable to the assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to the state of their birth if their husbands chose differently . Kerber points to subsequent case law and legislation questioning the nationality of American women ( and their children ) in those circumstances and the culmination of this trend in the Expatriation Act of 1907 , by which Congress stripped U.S. women of their citizenship upon marriage to an alien even if they remained in the United States . Thus the substitution of loyalty to husband for loyalty to the state and the concomitant exemption from the personal obligation to refrain from treason is linked to the married woman 's diminished claims to national identity. 2 <p> In her second chapter , Kerber explores the idea that one of the obligations of citizenship is visible economic productivity . She identifies vagrancy laws as an earlier legal expression of this obligation and argues that current welfare laws are a more contemporary version . This conceptualization of an obligation to work has resonance with the Papachristou case and Anthony Amsterdam 's successful challenge to the constitutionality of vagrancy laws in the 1960s and early 1970s , and Kerber discusses his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different direction . Her focus is the interaction of vagrancy laws and coverture in regulating the work of women and the role of race in producing diametrically-opposed outcomes for white wives and freedwomen . <p> This chapter focuses on the nearly recordless 1866 case of Harriet Anthony , a pregnant black woman who miscarried while working on the street repair crew in Houston , Texas , under a sentence for vagrancy . Through the files of the Freedmen 's Bureau , Kerber documents the role of coverture in efforts to compel newly-freed African-American women to work in the fields or as domestic servants under family labor contracts entered into by their husbands without their consent . Coverture came into play because it enabled husbands to command the labor of their wives , and vagrancy law provided an enforcement mechanism because runaway wives risked punishment as vagrants . Some freedwomen objected to this form of emancipation . Kerber quotes a Freedmen 's Bureau agent as reporting that " many negro women have failed to perform their part of the contracts , claiming the husband has no power to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. 65 ) . <p> But , Kerber argues , the legal structure that was used to compel black women to work in public was also used to restrict white women to a cloistered domesticity that simulated idleness . For white women , work outside the home was not respectable ; it reflected badly on their husbands . Kerber connects this history with the " dizzying series of contradictions " of ideology and laws today concerning work and welfare , linking the double standards of the past with the confusions of the present about welfare and work for mothers of color . This brief chapter makes extensive use of the burgeoning scholarship in the fields of labor history , slavery , and Reconstruction , citing more than forty works published since 1990 . The subject matter was new to me , and I found this chapter riveting . <p> Paying taxes is one of the most familiar civic obligations . In her third chapter , Kerber examines taxation and the terms upon which women have been required to bear this burden . Her primary focus is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration of the Declaration of Independence , of woman-suffrage advocates to link the obligation of women to pay taxes to the right to vote . The chapter is built around a vivid retelling of the tax resistance of two spinsters , the redoubtable Smith sisters of Glastonbury , Connecticut , in the 1870s and 1880s and builds on the earlier work of tax historian Carolyn Jones . <p> Despite its rhetorical power and popular appeal , the " no taxation without representation " battle cry of the American Revolution did not carry the day for woman suffrage in the 1870s and 1880s . Seeking an explanation for the failure of the woman-suffrage tax protests to establish a legal or constitutional reciprocity between the obligation of women to pay taxes and the right to vote , Kerber turns to the work of nineteenth-century American tax-law and constitutional-law theorists Thomas M. Cooley , Judge John Dillon , and E. R. A. Seligman . In their influential tax treatises ( published in 1876 , 1872 , and 1895 , respectively ) , she notes theories of taxation that emphasize sovereignty and finds them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffragists . <p> Tax is the area of law with which I am most familiar and I learned a lot from this chapter . But I have two quibbles with it . Kerber ends this chapter with an overly compressed sketch of the treatment of women in the federal income tax system . Here Kerber suggests that amendments enacted in 1969 resolved the gender inequities in the convoluted Internal Revenue Code ( p. 122 ) . Most observers would disagree and instead trace the current marriage penalties imposed upon dual earner married couples to those changes . <p> Also , I can not agree with Kerber 's reading of Judge Cooley 's treatise . I think Kerber is correct in identifying Cooley 's 1876 tax treatise3 as an important source of opposition to the theory that there was a **25;1819;TOOLONG reciprocity between taxation and representation that could be enforced by the courts . But I am not sure that he was quite the villain that he appears to be in her reading . Cooley also was a source of support for taxpayer suffrage for women on public-policy grounds and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , I find his responses to the woman suffrage tax protest in his explicit discussion of the limitations on the taxing power , rather than implicitly contained in his definition of taxation ( as Kerber suggests ) . <p> Cooley defined taxation as an incident of sovereignty justified by the exchange of support for the protection of the state ( quoted at pp. 114-15 ) . Although this definition is related to the reciprocity issue , it seems to be targeted more directly at two other problems in nineteenth-century tax theory in which Cooley was deeply interested : 1 ) reasserting the taxing power of the states over private corporations to which legislatures had imprudently or corruptly given tax exemptions and 2 ) delineating local taxing jurisdictions . <p> Cooley was well-known for his explicit views on the question of the reciprocity of taxation and representation . Elsewhere in his 1876 treatise he developed a twofold answer that became the authoritative view on the question . It was adopted even by those who , like the Christian socialist Richard T. Ely , firmly rejected Cooley 's exchange theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalized historical refutation . He maintained that " the maxim that taxation and representation go together is true only in a territorial sense . " 4 Hence he found that the " rallying cry in the contest for independence ... really meant ... that the local legislature must make the local laws . " 5 The assertion that this maxim meant that " no person could be taxed unless in the body which voted the tax he was represented by someone in whose selection he had a voice , " Cooley treated as an argument that proves too much. 6 He noted that there are always persons owning property within a state to whom the vote could not be given but who still receive benefits from government . In this category he listed infants and aliens . His conclusion , quoted extensively in the subsequent tax literature , was that " so long as all persons can not participate in government , the limits of the exclusion and admission must always be determined on considerations of general public policy . " 7 <p> Then as now , Judge Cooley has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His interpretation of the reciprocity question effectively severed the " no taxation without representation " argument from constitutional theory and placed it beyond the reach of the courts into the realm of political theory . Whether he sought to contain the use of the reciprocity argument by business corporations , which were at that time claiming other rights of citizenship , is an interesting question . In any event , he acknowledged that under these theories the property of women who did not have the right to vote was nonetheless subject to taxation , citing Wheeler v. Wall , the 1863 case in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court responded to Sarah Wall 's suffrage tax resistance in just those terms. 8 <p> Yet Cooley also offered support on public policy grounds for taxpayer suffrage for women . He advised that " all those who pay the taxes should be allowed a voice in raising them . " Although he limited this argument with the caveat " so far as can be prudently and safely permitted , " it is unlikely that he was suggesting that prudence would dictate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , partial suffrage had been extended to women property owners in school meetings as early as 1867 and was still in place even after the disastrous defeat of its first woman suffrage referendum in 1874. 10 Moreover , while Cooley offered in his text the rationale that " those taxes that they vote they will more willingly and cheerfully pay , " his supporting footnote gave an impassioned defense of what he called the principles of " self-taxation , " citing Burke and quoting Locke. 11 <p> In Chapter Four , Kerber leaps into the mid-twentieth century , to the history of women 's jury service . This is the longest chapter in the book ( ninety pages ) and the principal support for Kerber 's central arguments . It is also a wonderful piece of contemporary legal and social history scholarship . The " second suffrage campaign , " as it was called by earlier generations of advocates ( p. 136 ) , has yet to find a modern historian , and here Kerber stakes a strong claim to that title . <p> The right to trial by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Anglo-American tradition . But the right of American women to sit as jurors and share in the exercise of the power of the jury is a late twentieth-century attainment . For decades after women were fully enfranchised , the states still were permitted to bar women from jury service if they saw fit . Kerber dates the end of this era to the White v. Crook case , decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1970 . The practice of de facto exclusion of women from juries , which was the result of making women 's jury service voluntary , continued to be permitted until the Court 's decision in Taylor v. Louisiana ( 1975 ) . But , Kerber maintains , equality in jury service was not fully imposed until 1994 , when in J.E.B. v. Alabama the Supreme Court announced that " gender , like race , is not a constitutional proxy for juror competence and impartiality " ( p. 217 ) . <p> From 1920 onward , woman's-rights advocates labored to open jury service to women , recognizing it as both a right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as legislatures . Kerber effectively presents instances of advocacy and resistance through narratives and contemporary cartoons . But her main interest is the litigation campaign . The chapter unfolds around the story of Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U.S. 61 ( 1961 ) , and the Court 's holding in that case that it was constitutionally permissible for states to make jury service voluntary for women even if it meant that female criminal defendants like Mrs. Hoyt would be tried by all-male juries . <p> Kerber insightfully brings the historian 's questions to this subject , focusing as much on the stories of the lawyers and the litigants as on legal theory . Sketches of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her work in her years with the ACLU 's Women 's Rights Project are well-drawn and of compelling interest . Kerber also discusses at length the role of Pauli Murray , a theorist and advocate whose work in the 1960s linked the civil rights movement and the women 's rights movement , as well as the contributions of New York lawyer Dorothy Kenyon . <p> The history of women 's jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , but does it sustain her thesis about the centrality of coverture in defining the civic obligations of women ? Some readers will be skeptical about Kerber 's claim that a long-discredited common-law doctrine is at work in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in the latter part of the twentieth century . But Kerber finds a surprisingly strong level of textual support for her thesis . <p> Whether in 1961--when he wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court in Hoyt--Justice John Marshall Harlan really believed that the common-law doctrine of coverture continued to impose domestic obligations on wives , or whether he merely thought it provided a convenient justification for the Court 's willingness to tolerate the preference of the Florida legislature to maintain a male monopoly on the power of the jury , is not clear . Even in earlier phases of the life of this remarkably pervasive doctrine , it is sometimes hard to see it as anything other than window dressing for gender politics . But Harlan 's reasoning strongly suggests the influence of the culture of coverture , if not its legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to " the enlightened emancipation of women from the restrictions and protections of bygone years " but concluded that nonetheless " woman is still regarded as the center of home and family , " implying that " woman " could therefore reasonably be excused from a vital civic obligation to enable her to fulfill this domestic role ( p. 181 ) . One of the residues of the doctrine of coverture commonly found in domestic-relations law in that period was the requirement that wives maintain the home and care for the children and that husbands provide support and maintenance . Kerber does not discuss this point , but it gives added meaning to Justice Harlan 's further reference to the " special responsibilities " of women . Reading his words in context , it is hard to think that Justice Harlan is referring to nothing more than social mores . <p> Kerber 's fifth chapter explores a number of questions about military service , gender , and citizenship . Her primary focus is the period surrounding President Carter 's unsuccessful 1980 attempt to institute universal draft registration . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is nearly as long as the jury service chapter , its argument is diffused and it does not achieve the clarity of the earlier chapters . Kerber builds her discussion of gender and the obligation to defend the state around two cases : Rostker v. Goldberg ( 1979 ) and Feeney v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts ( 1981 ) . <p> Helen Feeney 's case posed an unsuccessful challenge to veterans ' preferences , and it serves as a reminder that the obligation of military service can carry with it significant economic benefits and opportunities . Goldberg challenged the draft law and briefly stopped the newly authorized draft registration in 1981 when the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that a draft that excluded women denied young men the equal protection of the law . ( The Supreme Court quickly reversed . ) Kerber also records the intense debate over the Carter proposal , which pitted feminists reluctantly supporting it on egalitarian grounds against social conservatives fighting a pitched battle to preserve traditional gender roles , the " constitutional right to be treated like American ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 287 ) . <p> The contributions of No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies are numerous and considerable . Foremost among them is its enrichment of the legal history of American women . In an influential article that appeared in the Law and History Review more than a decade ago , medieval historian Janet Loengard pointed to the need to augment institutional legal history of the status and rights of women with histories of the experiences of women with law. 12 Kerber manages to provide a good deal of both in this new book . Although the book is by no means a systematic doctrinal history , its inquiry into the uses of the doctrine of coverture in the judicial interpretation of the civic obligations of women adds considerably to our understanding of the scope and impact of that doctrine . At the same time , Kerber 's narratives document the experiences of women with coverture in a broad range of settings ; in the process a much clearer picture of the impact of doctrine on the lives of women emerges . <p> No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that tells its complex and persuasive story at many levels . By its focus on the law of civic obligation , it makes an innovative contribution to the study of citizenship as both a legal and a political institution in the United States . By following the " antique legal tradition " of coverture ( p. 11 ) out of the treatises and into the arena of public law , this absorbing book also represents a significant expansion of the legal and social history scholarship of that doctrine in America . Its sweeping survey provides a timeline of the status of women as citizens that is a provocative reminder of how much in the past we still live . Informative and accessible , this study will be useful to legal historians and feminist theorists as well as to more general students of American history . Although some parts of this ambitious work are not as fully realized as others , this takes little away from the value of the book as a whole . Kerber 's book is so full of interesting ideas and thought-provoking questions that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . There seems to be some disagreement about whether the Martin case ( 1805 ) or Shanks v. Dupont , 3 Pet . 242 ( U.S. , 1830 ) ( which Kerber also discusses ) represents the dominant view in early nineteenth-century jurisprudence of the capacity of married women to form and change political allegiance . Nancy Cott argues that the view that married women retained this capacity , as expressed by Justice Story in the later Shanks case , is the norm . Nancy F. Cott , " Marriage and Women 's Citizenship in the United States , 1830-1934 , " American Historical Review 103 ( 1998 ) : 1440 , 1456n44 . Rogers M.

Hasegawa 's title illustrates his argument that each party to the conflict was under time constraints because of real or perceived deadlines to take action . Racing the Enemy is a complicated book with nuanced arguments . I will comment only on what seem to be the study 's two most important concepts : the decisive impact of the Soviet entry into the Pacific War and the American decision to use the atomic weapons . <p> True to Butow 's words , Hasegawa reveals new sources of untapped information by using Soviet , Japanese , and American sources to examine the triangular relations at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work is the most internationalized study of the end of the Pacific War . While many historians have focused on the issue of whether or not the Truman administration dropped the bomb primarily to intimidate the Soviet Union ( and primarily from a Washington perspective ) , Hasegawa moves into broader consideration of the role of the Soviet involvement in the final weeks of the war . In the acknowledgements , Hasegawa recognizes the contributions of his colleagues Sumio Hatano and Boris Nikolaevich Slavinsky ( Slavinksy , a senior researcher at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow , died in 2002 before the project was complete and the book is dedicated to him ) . It is not that Hasegawa has uncovered any genuine " smoking gun " to prove his case but he appears to have recovered a more genuine context from which the events flowed and the decisions were made . The Soviet documents add depth and breadth to the understanding of the final months of the war and provide the evidence for Hasegawa 's argument that Stalin was a much more active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese-occupied territory than previously assumed . Stalin " was engaged in skillful Machiavellian diplomacy to manipulate Japanese desires for negotiated peace to his own ends , " Hasegawa argues , and " ruthlessly pursued diplomacy and military operations to secure the territories to which he felt entitled " ( p. 11 ) . <p> More importantly , Hasegawa argues that the Soviet Union 's entry into the war had a much greater impact on Japan 's surrender than many historians have previously assumed . No longer , Hasegawa argues , should historians believe that it was primarily the shock of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that brought the end of the war . Instead , the Soviet attack played an essential role in bringing the Japanese leadership to that decision . <p> As Hasegawa explains , the central issue almost obsessively occupying Japanese diplomacy in the final months of the war was the effort to keep the Soviet Union neutral in accordance with the 1941 Neutrality Pact and to bring about a negotiated peace through its approaches to the Allies via Moscow . Unrealistic though it may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambit . Hasegawa draws a strong portrayal of Naotake Sato , the Japanese ambassador to Moscow , who for a time seemed to be the only high-level Japanese official who realized talk with the Soviets was likely a futile path . " Soviet entry into the war shocked the Japanese even more than the atomic bombs because it meant the end of any hope of achieving a settlement short of unconditional surrender , " Hasegawa writes ( p. 3 ) . <p> Another area where Hasegawa 's argument is intriguing is in regard to the concept of kokutai , which is the mythical notion that the Japanese emperor , as a living God united with the creator of the imperial system , is the eternal essence of his subjects and imperial land . Hasegawa traces the evolution of this thought to its rather late culmination in a Japanese Ministry of Education publication called The Essence of Kokutai in 1937 , which had appeared after a controversial debate over the matter . Central to this notion was the emperor 's monopolistic power over the military command . All of this emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of the peace party 's work in the final days of the war was to redefine kokutai much more narrowly to include just the preservation of the imperial house . This movement to change the emperor 's status from a semi-mythical figure to a real historical actor gained solid ground with Hirohito 's decision to involve himself in the decision-making process , a process that separated the idea of the national community from the emperor 's own person . An understanding of kokutai helps to explain the difficulty the Japanese had confronting the reality of their impending defeat . Hasegawa suggests that along with the traditionally accepted argument that Hirohito directed the surrender in order to spare Japan more destruction , he also was making a desperate attempt to save himself and the imperial house . <p> This threat to the imperial house , Hasegawa reveals , was made more severe in the emperor 's eyes because of the Soviet invasion . With Japan 's whole diplomatic framework geared in the final weeks and months toward maintaining Soviet neutrality so that Japan could arrange a negotiated peace , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet attack emboldened the peace party in Tokyo , whose members had been diligently , but with inadequate force , working toward a negotiated peace . Still , despite the shock , Japanese army officers insisted on the need to fight on . Elsewhere reality began dawning . <p> The Hiroshima bombing did inspire greater urgency on the part of officials and the emperor to seek the negotiated peace , Hasegawa shows , but did not produce a rush to embrace the Potsdam terms of unconditional surrender . The author maintains that " as long as they still felt they might preserve the kokutai or negotiate with the Allies with Moscow 's help , they would press on " ( p. 185 ) . <p> In an interview on the morning of August 9 ( before the emperor had heard or digested news of the bombing ) , Hirohito had a meeting with Koichi Kido , keeper of the privy seal . During the meeting the emperor said , " The Soviet Union declared war against us , and entered into a state of war as of today . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the termination of the war " ( p. 198 ) . Similarly Ambassador Sato received the Soviet declaration of war from Vladimir Molotov and , while en route back to the embassy , glumly told an aide , " The inevitable has nowarrived " ( p. 191 ) . With Japan 's diplomatic strategy in ruins as Soviet troops attacked , word came of yet another atomic bombing of Nagasaki . Again , Hasegawa contends , the bombing seems to have had little impact on the negotiations between the peace and war parties . <p> There is an explanation , this reader believes , for the apparent lack of impact the atomic bombings may have had on Japanese leaders , especially the military . We should keep in mind that American forces had been bombing Japanese cities with impunity for months . On both the American and Japanese sides , the fact that American bombers were incinerating Japanese cities before Hiroshima lessened the impact of destroying that city . Just as the mounting destruction of Japanese cities reduced American reluctance to destroy civilian targets , it also reduced the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences with the Hiroshima bombing but the line had long been crossed on the destruction of cities . The tens of thousands of civilians killed in the conventional bombings were no less dead because the instruments of their deaths were high-explosive bombs and incendiaries rather than atomic weapons . While there is some mention of the scale of the conventional bombings , Hasegawa could have sharpened his argument by incorporating this destruction and its inevitable affect on both the Japanese and the American decision-making processes . <p> This brings us to a further important contribution of Hasegawa 's study , because his argument adds to the debate over the effectiveness ( and justness ) of the atomic bombings . If the Hiroshima bombing did not induce surrender , and if the Soviet action was so central , and if the decision to surrender was reached before the Nagasaki bombing , as Hasegawa argues , then the case for the usefulness of the bombs is seriously undermined . <p> Hasegawa is critical of the American decision-making process but he goes beyond previous criticisms of Truman 's decision , such as Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop both bombs rather than two separate decisions. 2 Hasegawa cites a cryptic response by Truman to Secretary of War Stimson , " Suggestion approved . Release when ready but not sooner than Aug. 2 " ( p. 175 ) . Hasegawa argues that this document has been misidentified . For example , in Truman ( 1992 ) historian David McCullough contends that this is the presidential order to drop the bomb . Instead , Hasegawa argues , this document is really a response to Stimson 's inquiry whether a statement about the bomb should be prepared and released when necessary . Hasegawa goes on to argue that despite Truman 's later claims " that he issued the order to drop the bomb on his voyage back to the United States somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic , the president never issued such an order . The fact is that the atomic bomb was dropped without Truman 's explicit order " ( p. 176 ) . Instead , the only explicit order to drop the bomb was almost entirely within military channels . According to Hasegawa , General Lesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved it , and General Thomas Handy delivered it to General Carl Spaatz , commander of the Army Strategic Air Forces . Truman " was not involved in this decision but merely let the military proceed without his interference " ( p. 152 ) . <p> This is an intriguing point even though some historians will believe it irrelevant since there was an apparently clear understanding that Truman wished the bombs to be used once they were ready . After all , as George Elsey , a naval intelligence officer recalled , " Truman made no decision because there was not a decision to be made . He could no more have stopped it than a train moving down a track " ( p. 159 ) . Nevertheless , civilian control of the military is an important American principle and separates the United States from the banana republics , and Hasegawa 's observations deserve consideration . <p> Acknowledging that Truman 's objectives were twofold ( to impose unconditional surrender and to save American lives ) , Hasegawa argues that the Soviet entry played an important part in speeding up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . He was aware that the race was on between the atomic bomb and Soviet entry into the war " ( p. 183 ) . Part of this rush resulted in what Hasegawa calls the " concocted " story that Japan had promptly " rejected " the Potsdam Proclamation . Instead , Hasegawa cites Magic decrypts and Swiss sources that the Japanese government believed the Potsdam documents could be used as a basis for surrender . Hasegawa admits that the Japanese appear to have publicly ignored the proclamation but maintains that that is quite different from rejecting the surrender conditions . Of course , Truman probably never saw the Magic decrypts but had he been interested in a way to avoid using the atomic weapons , Hasegawa argues , he would have had each bit of intelligence scrutinized and there would have been a high-level discussion of Japan 's reaction to the Potsdam Proclamation . Hasegawa 's conclusion is that " even in the face of what was known , and should have been known to Truman , Byrnes , and Stimson , one can not escape the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attempt to explore the readiness of some Japanese policymakers to seek peace through the ultimatum " ( p. 173 ) . <p> Of course , it is possible to poke some holes in Hasegawa 's argument . The wartime context and the fact that by early August 1945 destroying Japanese cities had become routine made it unlikely that a policy of patience would have been valued by American policymakers . In addition , Hasegawa has a tendency to see carefully calibrated calculation in much of the American decision making . But as we are seeing in the current Bush administration 's war in Iraq , incompetence and miscalculation are too often essential factors in war and diplomacy . <p> Hasegawa has written a compelling study of the end of the Pacific War that should give historians food for thought and fodder for debate . His argument about the importance of the Soviet declaration of war is this study 's strongest and most convincing contribution and his nuanced arguments about internal Japanese struggles and the American decision to drop the bomb add new and important perspectives to our understanding of the end of the Pacific conflict .

Hayes ( University of New Mexico ) Published on H-Buddhism ( February , 2008 ) <p> Buddhist Controversies on the Nature of Self : A Guide <p> This work consists of a translation and study of the ninth chapter of Vasubandhu 's Abhidharmako ? abh ? ? ya ? . This text , which likely first circulated as a separate work , has come to be known under two titles : Pudgalavini ? caya ( decision on the person ) and ? tmav ? daprati ? edha ? ( refutation of the doctrine of self ) . The text begins with the claim that liberation ( mok ? a ) is impossible apart from an understanding of Buddhist doctrine ; this is because bondage is due to a false belief in a self , and all doctrines other than Buddhism hold that there is a self that is a reality over and above the physical body and consciousness . Vasubandhu 's aim is to show why these doctrines of a separately existing self are untenable . Along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that he attributes to some Buddhists , namely , that there exists a person or individual ( pudgala ) the exact relationship of which to the physical body and consciousness can not be expressed ( avaktavya ) . In Vasubandhu 's opinion , this notion of an indescribable or ineffable personal identity is indistinguishable from non-Buddhist doctrines of a self and must therefore be discarded along with those other doctrines . The proponents of the notion of an ineffable personal identity , in other words , are not truly Buddhist , or at least are not advocating a view that has the capability of informing practices that lead to mok ? a . <p> Duerlinger first published an English translation of Vasubandhu 's ? tmav ? daprati ? edha ? in 1988 in the Journal of Indian Philosophy , and followed that with several installments of his own English commentary. 4 This book brings significantly revised versions of all those earlier publications together and furnishes them with an introductory chapter , an index , and a bibliography that is helpfully divided into sections according to the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bibliography comprise references to primary texts , translations , and summaries ; and to modern discussions . The first division is further divided into several subsections ( representing Sanskrit editions , Chinese editions , Tibetan editions , and English translations and studies ) . <p> In his seventy-page introduction to his translation , Duerlinger discusses the textual history of Vasubandhu 's text , its translations into Tibetan and Chinese , and the various editions , translations , and studies that have been done in modern languages . He then offers a long discussion of Vasubandhu 's characterizations of the theories of persons held by the brahmanical Ny ? ya-Vai ? e ? ikas and by the various Buddhist schools that have collectively come to be known as Pudgalav ? dins ( Personalists ) . The issue of whether Vasubandhu 's characterizations of his opponents fairly represent their actual views is not the main focus of Duerlinger 's discussion ; rather , he seeks to explain their views as Vasubandhu saw them , so that the reader can make better sense of why Vasubandhu said what he said to refute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a textual history of main works associated with the so-called Pudgalav ? dins , and of Buddhists other than Vasubandhu who offered critiques of their position . <p> Subsequent sections of the introduction deal with Indian Buddhist theories of persons ; the causal basis of the conception of persons ; the theory of the five aggregates as the basis of the idea of personal identity ; the problematic character of Vasubandhu 's exchange with the Pudgalav ? dins ; problems within the Pudgalav ? din view ; and objections to Vasubandhu 's view of persons . Finally , Duerlinger offers his own initial reflections on the various arguments used by Vasubandhu . He rightly observes that a study of Vasubandhu is only a first step in a much larger study of how coherent all the various Indian views , both Buddhist and non-Buddhist , of personal identity are , and that it would be premature at this stage of our knowledge to try to assess which presentations are the most compelling . Arriving at conclusions , says Duerlinger , " needs to wait upon an equally careful study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ya-Vai ? e ? ikas , the S ? ? khyas , the Jains , and the various schools of Ved ? nta , along with the critique of Indian theories set out by ? ? ntarak ? ita and Kamala ? ? la " ( p. 56 ) . In addition , says Duerlinger , a critical philosophical assessment of the writings of Vasubandhu should be based on a careful study of the question of personal identity as discussed by a long series of Western philosophers . While no one is likely to arrive at his or own view of personal identity solely on the basis of analyzing rational argumentation , says Duerlinger , and while few modern readers are likely to go the full distance of taking Vasubandhu 's conclusions as their own , the study of a text such as Vasubandhu 's is likely to be helpful to people as they try to sort out this very complex issue for themselves . <p> Taken as a whole , Duerlinger 's introduction offers a very good overview of the issues discussed by Vasubandhu and those who preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the translation that follows . The translation itself is divided into five sections , which of course follow the structure of Vasubandhu 's original text . The first section lays out Vasubandhu 's own view of persons . This is followed by a section on Vasubandhu 's objections to the Pudgalav ? dins ' theory . His critique of their view allows him to anticipate how they would object to his critique and how he would respond to their objections , which is the topic of the third section . The fourth section addresses the views of non-Buddhists , Vasubandhu 's critiques thereof , and his replies to the objections he anticipates would in turn meet his critique . Concluding considerations are brought up in section five . The translation runs about fifty pages . The final hundred and ten pages contain Duerlinger 's commentary on each of the first four of the five sections of the translation . <p> Duerlinger 's translation makes liberal use of added explanatory material enclosed in square brackets . Indeed , in some passages there seems to be more material in square brackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded . Different people will react to this kind of presentation differently . A while back I used Duerlinger 's book as one of the textbooks in a graduate philosophy seminar on the Buddhist doctrine of an ? tman . Students who knew little or no Sanskrit tended to find the translation somewhat cumbersome but nevertheless clear . Other students read the Sanskrit text and then checked their understanding against Duerlinger 's . These latter students found all the material in square brackets distracting . On the basis of this rather small sample of experiences , I would hazard the tentative conclusion that a general philosophical audience may find Duerlinger 's translation quite acceptable , while Sanskritists ( who are usually by temperament obsessive and hypercritical anyway , just because it is difficult to read Sanskrit without being attentive to the smallest details ) might find the translation somewhat less pleasing . Few translators can please all audiences . Duerlinger 's translation strikes me as well suited for the audience he is apparently mostly trying to reach , namely , philosophers who are curious about what important Indian philosophers said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the attempts to provide rational justifications of key Buddhist doctrines . <p> In his own commentary to the sections of the translation , Duerlinger makes a great effort to sort out the different positions and to supply all the implicit premises that would be necessary to make the arguments valid . His practice is to name all the various positions he identifies through his philosophical analysis , then to offer an abbreviation of the name . So , for example , he analyzes an argument that he calls the Ny ? ya-Vai ? e ? ika " theory of the production of minds , " which he then abbreviates as the TPM argument . The explicit and implicit premises of that argument are then referred to as TPM(I) , TPM(II) , TPM(III) , and so on . Duerlinger 's practice is to set the argument out in tabular form and then to offer reflections on the premises by referring back to their number . This style of presentation is quite common in analytic philosophy and linguistics . It requires work on the part of the reader to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original presentation of the argument repeatedly ( or else memorize it ) . If one is willing to do that work , then one is likely to find the presentations quite helpful while working through Duerlinger 's insightful analyses of the cogency of the arguments . <p> Probably everyone who makes the effort to work through this book ( and it does take some effort ) will find points on which they disagree either with Vasubandhu or with Duerlinger 's presentation of Vasubandhu , or with Duerlinger 's assessment of the arguments as he presents them . That is part of what makes this a valuable study . It presents enough material to provide grist for good philosophical discussion and refrains from offering so much material that there is nothing left to discuss . If I may again draw on the experiences of my graduate class in philosophy , we found that Duerlinger 's book gave us a good deal to think about , and some of our liveliest discussions were about passages in his book . ( Because it is a good book to use in the classroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . ) <p> In summary , the book does what it sets out to do . It does not provide the definitive study of the theories of self in Indian philosophy , much less a definitive answer to the philosophical question of just what a self is and why , if selves do not really exist , we can not seem to get through the day without thinking they exist . What it does do is offer a good study of one Buddhist thinker from India , a study that makes intelligent use of the methods of analytic philosophy . One hopes that this study will be followed by others , either by Duerlinger himself or by others who follow his methods . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

One of sports history 's early classics is Robert W. Henderson 's Ball , Bat and Bishop : The Origin of Ball Games first published in 1947 . When Henderson , the chief librarian of the New York Public Library 's main reading room and the librarian of the Racquet and Tennis Club of New York , wrote his book , no serious literature for sports history existed . On the other hand , popular interest in sports history , particularly baseball , existed at a very intense level which has never abated . Although interest was high , existing popular history in 1947 was faulty . The myth that Abner Doubleday invented baseball at Cooperstown , New York in 1839 dominated the embryonic subject of baseball history , even though most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To correct that situation , Henderson used the resources of the New York Public Library and the library of the Racquet and Tennis Club to write a comprehensive history of ball games . That history culminated with the appearance of modern American baseball . Although Ball , Bat and Bishop took several years to achieve the recognition that it deserved , it accomplished three things of lasting scholarly value . First , it provided its readers with an encyclopedic survey of ball games from ancient times through the nineteenth century . Although subsequent research has rendered some of his findings obsolete , many of his conclusions remain useful . Second , it told the story of the Doubleday/Cooperstown myth and destroyed its claims to be historical fact . Third , it provided a respectable start for the serious academic study of baseball and sports history . Now , over fifty years later , the University of Illinois Press has brought this significant and useful classic of sports history back into print for readers and libraries . <p> Ball , Bat and Bishop is organized in a chronological manner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's contention is that all ball games can ultimately trace their origins back to fertility rituals practiced by the ancient Egyptians . These early games reenacted the combat between the gods Horus and Set which in turn served as a metaphor for the shift from fallow winter to spring planting . Fertility rites and early ball games were inextricably connected . Such spring time rituals spread from Egypt throughout the Mediterranean world and among the Romans took the form of the Saturnalia festival . Although the triumph of Christianity in the Roman Empire tended to suppress such ritual ball games , they revived under Islam . The ball games spread along with Islam into Spain and diffused from there into southern France by about 1000 A.D. There the ball game adapted itself to a Christian environment and became part of the rituals and ceremonies associated with Easter , a Christian festival located in the spring . Bishops and the members of their cathedral chapters participated in the ball game as did abbots and monks . Ceremonies of exchanging balls and racquets between bishops and their clergy developed and the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monastic cloisters . <p> Over time these ceremonial games became secularized . Henderson points out that the ancestor of polo developed in Persia about the mid-ninth century , making it the first ball game to become secularized . Meanwhile a ball game called la soule , which used sticks and a ball and resembled modern field hockey , had moved out of the ecclesiastical cloisters and had become popular among the peasantry . La soule formed the common ancestor for a variety of team sports using a ball and sticks . These descendants of la soule included stoolball , football , hurling , cricket , baseball , and even golf and billiards . In all cases Henderson provides a reasonably convincing historical genealogy for the connections between the various games . <p> As befits the interests of a man who served as the librarian for the Racquet and Tennis Club of New York , Henderson shows how the ball games of the ecclesiastical cloisters evolved into court tennis , a secularized game popular among the aristocracy . Any comparison between the architecture of a traditional cloisters and the court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawn tennis and racquet ball are both later offshoots of court tennis . Henderson also clearly demonstrates that the game of racquets did not solely have its origins among the well-to-do prisoners held in Fleet Street Prison during the eighteenth century . <p> Almost a third of Ball , Bat and Bishop deals with the early history of American baseball . Its connections to la soule , stoolball , and various shadowy English versions of baseball are clearly delineated . The amazingly flimsy foundations of the Doubleday/Cooperstown myth of baseball 's origins are also traced . As Henderson points out , Abner Doubleday never claimed to have invented baseball which had long been a flourishing national pastime by his death in 1893 . The claim first surfaced well over a decade later as part of A.G. Spaulding 's dogged search for a totally American pedigree for baseball . <p> Ball , Bat and Bishop is a true classic of the literature of sports history . Henderson is a generally careful and fair-minded historian with a tremendous breadth of knowledge . It is unfortunate that the book does not provide footnotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention that Egyptian religious ceremonies are the common ancestor of all ball games has a somewhat dated diffusionist or even hyper-diffusionist ring to it . The hyper-diffusionist aspect comes in when Henderson suggests that pre-Columbian contacts from Asia across the Pacific Ocean brought the religious ball game to the civilizations of Mesoamerica . Modern anthropologists and ethnohistorians are more likely to explain such similarities as independent inventions attributable to parallel cultural evolution . The scholarly discipline of sports history has gone far beyond the work of Henderson but it should continue to look upon him as one of its founders and pioneers . The reprinting of Ball , Bat and Bishop is a testimony to his contributions .

Winterbotham published his The Ultra Secret in 1974 , it opened the floodgates to a whole new genre of literature on World War II . There is now a massive bibliography of books and journal articles on Allied breaking of German and Japanese codes , and a growing number on what the other side was doing , as well as on Allied codebreaking directed at lesser foes , neutrals and allies . Do we need , then , Battle of Wits , Stephen Budiansky 's new history of Ultra , Magic and the rest ? <p> The answer is yes , for several reasons . First of all , because there is a constant stream of new information on these subjects . The U.S. National Archives has added millions of pages of Army , Navy and intelligence agency documents to its holdings in recent years , and the UK 's Public Record Office has done much the same with British declassified material . These documents range from internal histories and analyses to postwar interrogation of German and Japanese officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals . In addition to the documents , there are the books . A large share of the codebreaking literature is in the form of memoirs , and they cry out for careful reading and comparison with official histories . Several scholarly journals--this reviewer is most familiar with Intelligence &amp; National Security and Cryptologia--add their articles analyzing such arcane subjects as the Vatican 's codes and codebreaking under Vichy . <p> Battle of Wits is an interesting compromise . Budiansky , a correspondent for The Atlantic , has chosen to write an accessible narrative , full of colorful anecdotes , that covers the high points of the code wars . He tells how the U.S. Army and Navy cracked Purple , the Japanese diplomatic code , then dropped the ball at Pearl Harbor , only to break JN-25 and help win at Midway . And he does the most even-handed job this reviewer has read of recounting the breaking of the Nazi 's Enigma machine ciphers : how first the Poles , then the French , and finally the British--with American human and computer help--defeated a system which the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much ground to cover , he does not attempt a continuous narrative of any campaign , but does provide good summaries of how codebreaking affected the Battle of the Atlantic , the fighting in the Mediterranean and North Africa , and the American defeat of the Japanese in the Pacific . <p> Since Budiansky also has a background in applied mathematics , he inserts several long passages ( plus two appendices ) that explain ( or attempt to explain , depending upon the reader ) the math and logic the codebreakers used to crack machine cipher systems thought to be virtually foolproof . These are well illustrated with clever typography and elegant diagrams . Finally , he has worked with classified and newly declassified material for years , and seems familiar with the newest old material , at least in English , available for research . <p> As well as retelling the familiar tales of codebreaking and its impact on the war , Budiansky has gone beyond any previous study of this type in several respects . For one , he tackles the unpleasant issue of Ultra and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill--were aware of what the Germans were doing in Russia from the opening weeks of Barbarossa onwards . The British quickly piled up so many messages dealing with the Einsatzgruppen 's activities that a memo was circulated stating that " The execution of ' Jews ' is so recurrent a feature of these reports that the figures have been omitted from the situation reports and brought under one heading .... " In fact , the British did do something . Churchill spoke out , even though his going public probably did result in the Germans tightening their communications procedures . And they kept voluminous records of these atrocities for future war crimes trials--only to realize in 1945 that far better , and ghastlier , evidence made decoded concentration camp rosters superfluous . <p> A short section near the end of Battle of Wits deals with " the Russian problem , " something that , even by the standards of secrecy surrounding Ultra , was kept very secret . There have been several recent books on the Venona decrypts and the evidence they provide about Alger Hiss , the Rosenbergs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ought to have been unbreakable " one-time pads " were forced to give up some of their secrets , and names the communist insiders , such as Kim Philby , who betrayed this success to the Soviet Union . <p> Budiansky has also added the machines to the people . Most earlier memoir literature and other accounts have emphasized the contributions of such heroes as Alan Turing and Joe Rochefort , but without IBM tabulators and British and American Bombes , these men could never have done nearly as much . The card readers and the Bombes--some of the first " computers " --have been mentioned in previous books , but Budiansky provides descriptions and photographs of the optical comparators and other devices the codebreakers employed . The story of these machines--attempts to harness 1940s technology to do what digital electronics would master a decade later--has never been told in a book aimed at the general reader . <p> Still , Budiansky has plenty of room for people . The memoirs from Bletchley Park and the American codebreaking factories in Virginia and the District of Columbia include some women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American women worked at these locations , and he discusses the trials and pleasures of wartime life for these mostly civilian workers . He also provides some excellent anecdotes illustrating the vast gap in class , education and worldliness that separated British and American codebreakers . <p> For all its strengths , however , Battle of Wits does not live up to its subtitle : it is not " the complete story of codebreaking in World War II . " Budiansky chooses to concentrate on British and American efforts against German and Japanese top-grade cipher systems . He includes some discussion of their similar successes with Italian codes , but there is almost nothing on what the Axis powers did , other than a useful description of the German breaking of the Atlantic convoy codes and their refusal to believe that Enigma could be broken . Budiansky does not read either German or Japanese , so neither original documents nor memoir literature in those languages was accessible to him . This must be one reason why there is not a word in Battle of Wits about the codebreaking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must explain the absence of Ito Risaburo from this book . Ito , we know from Edwin T. Layton 's superb " And I Was There " , was the designer of both the Red and Purple machines , and a codebreaker , too . Battle of Wits tells us why Joe Rochefort ended up commanding a drydock , and why Alan Turing ate an apple laced with cyanide . Perhaps a future work will tell us what became of Captain Ito , and what the B-Dienst 's top cryptanalysts told their British , American or Russian captors .

We Who Are Dark by Harvard philosopher Tommie Shelby explores " blackness " and finds in it the roots of a pragmatic black solidarity that can effect political change . The book , a compelling philosophical investigation of black solidarity 's origins , manifestations , and prospects , emerges from Shelby 's conviction that " the concept of race , as commonly understood , is a problematic foundation for African American identity and black political solidarity " ( p. xi ) . The author attempts to ascertain the basis ( or bases ) on which blacks can unite to combat prejudice , ultimately focusing on a black solidarity that has as its goal the remediation of antiblack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rethink the normative basis of black self-understanding and group unity " ( p. xi ) , Shelby writes both a survey of black philosophy and a work of philosophy in its own right . As such , We Who Are Dark engages with authors familiar to scholars of literature , history , and politics as well as American and African American Studies , though it does not offer critical commentary on these writers as much as it uses them to build its own philosophical argument . <p> Hopeful that his new black solidarity will avoid the problems of classic black nationalism and other race-based movements , Shelby focuses much of his critical attention on devising a solidarity that is neither sexist , gender-biased , classist , nor otherwise limited by intragroup factionalism . In doing so , he rejects three major components of past black solidarity movements . First , he denies the importance of shared African identity ; second , he critiques the Black Power conception of solidarity as impractical , unrealistic , and possibly detrimental ; and third , he argues against the idea of a widely shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African identity ) . Asserting instead that " we should separate the need for an emancipatory black solidarity from the demand for a common black identity , " Shelby insists that black solidarity be " based strictly on the shared experience of racial oppression and a joint commitment to resist it " ( pp. 11-12 ) . In other words , Shelby insists that while shared experience does not thereby create shared identity , it can serve as a basis for political solidarity . He acknowledges the modest hopes for this new black solidarity when he writes that such a " solidarity conceives of black political unity as limited in scope because this is as much as African Americans can reasonably expect from black unity in the post-civil rights era " ( p. 13 ) . Though it frankly addresses this new model 's efficacy , Shelby 's focused and disciplined book may leave readers wanting more than a limited set of possibilities and potentialities ; perhaps readers expect a solidarity that can spur wide-ranging , or even revolutionary , changes . <p> We Who Are Dark begins with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two types . The first , which he labels " classical nationalism , " is a strong nationalist position with the goal of a self-determining black community ; the second , dubbed " pragmatic nationalism " ( with which Shelby aligns himself ) , strives to establish a just society in which the black community can live and flourish as equals . Martin Delany , whose work lies at the center of Shelby 's first chapter , favored both types of nationalism at different points in his life and career , though he embraced pragmatic nationalism after the Civil War . Such a nationalism requires neither emigration nor a shared expressive culture--that is , a set of aesthetic , linguistic , stylistic , or social commonalities--but a shared political culture rooted in the common experience of racially motivated oppression . Moving on from Delany , Shelby examines the writings of Booker T. Washington , W.E.B . DuBois , and Marcus Garvey , each of whom embraced different positions along a continuum of solidarity . Shelby aligns himself most closely with DuBois ( from whose " Criteria of Negro Art " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) because DuBoisian solidarity , according to Shelby , " requires political self-assertion and persistent agitation in support of the group 's ideals " and that the group be defined by external racial characteristics ( p. 77 ) . These two notions are central to Shelby 's arguments , especially the idea that black phenotypic characteristics are , in DuBois 's words , " stigmata of degradation " and thus the only necessary basis for black solidarity . <p> Continuing his examination of historical black nationalisms , Shelby evaluates the Black Power movement and the Nation of Islam along with the primary advocates for those movements : Stokely Carmichael ( Kwame Ture ) , Charles Hamilton , and Malcolm X. Black solidarity was an important common goal for these more recent philosophers . Carmichael and Hamilton especially embraced the idea of group solidarity and independence from the white community as well as the idea of speaking with one voice in the public sphere . Shelby dismisses the foundations of black communal solidarity as " hopelessly utopian " ( p. 115 ) because such an approach would require altruistic sacrifices by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and social advantages to live in all-black communities . Even if the so-called elites were willing to leave whatever arrangements they have and become part of a new , all-black residential community , they might then disproportionately impact the community . This undue influence is problematic for Shelby because it violates his prized tenets of inclusiveness and equality . Similar problems override , for Shelby , the possibility of a single representative black voice speaking for the community . In the end , Shelby claims that blacks " must not rely on racially exclusive strategies for improving the life prospects of black people " ( p. 131 ) . He insists that black nationalism and black power are not worthy ends in themselves , but flawed means to the desired end of racial justice . <p> Having shown how previous attempts at solidarity have failed , or would fail , to meet the needs of contemporary African Americans , Shelby goes on to delineate a new " trans-institutional " program for black solidarity . Dismissing the ideal of institutional autonomy favored by classic nationalists , he endorses a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity with one another regardless of the racial composition of the political organizations in which each one participates " ( p. 138 ) . The benefits of such a method are obvious : Blacks would exert power within a variety of organizations and thereby have a greater influence on larger cultural and political structures . At the same time , such a method relies on individual agency , limits univocal representation , and makes obsolete race-based organizations . Still , Shelby finds this method preferable because it encourages blacks to fight both the problem of antiblack racism as well as the economic , legal , and social injustices that affect all races . Anxious not to conflate an issue such as poverty with racism , Shelby sees his method as a way to de-racialize particular issues , thereby avoiding conflict with political allies who are unsympathetic to explicitly " black " causes . <p> In the final chapters of We Who Are Dark , Shelby addresses what " black " means ( and does not mean ) for his imagined black solidarity . In so doing , he dismisses many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women on both sides of the color line . For example , Shelby denies the efficacy of a " cultural blackness " that posits a distinct , deeply rooted , emancipatory cultural tradition that should be controlled and interpreted by blacks . Though he may be correct in suggesting that cultural blackness is not a precondition for black solidarity , Shelby reveals a troubling willingness to accept the exploitation and co-optation of traditionally " black " modes of cultural expression , arguing that " it is not clear through what mechanisms blacks could gain and maintain control " over them ( p. 195 ) . And , though he correctly points out that traditionally black modes of expression are not enjoyed or produced exclusively by blacks , Shelby seems unwilling to admit that the dissolution of ethnocultural blackness is perhaps a greater problem for blacks in the culture industry than the fact that the black bourgeoisie who control that industry might not be committed to " democratic decision making " ( p. 196 ) . Though just one example of this mode of argument , such a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity espoused in We Who Are Dark : Shelby 's commitment to perfectly democratic intragroup politics despite the predomination of anti-democratic practices in the contemporary United States . <p> Dismissing communitarian , Afrocentric , and ethnocultural " modes of blackness " as possible bases for a democratic black solidarity movement , Shelby argues that the only sufficiently capacious and democratic definition of blackness is " thin blackness , " which depends on phenotypic characteristics and the personal experience of antiblack racism . In other words , if one looks black and contends with racism , that person is black . Thin blackness provides the basis for the Shelby 's new black solidarity , a solidarity that can unite African Americans in spite of economic and class heterogeneity , a solidarity that solves the problems of scope , mission , and membership that plagued past solidarity movements . Though Shelby 's model might well have these salutary effects , it might also replace standards of cultural blackness with standards of another sort . To say nothing of the very real problem of relying upon phenotype as an index of blackness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less racism than a peer would be classed as sufficiently black to enlist in a black solidarity movement . This is not to suggest that " thin blackness " is without merit , or that Shelby 's criticism of other modes of definition is unwarranted , but rather to confirm that almost any method used to define race is potentially flawed . Moreover , Shelby seems to have traded inclusiveness--which is one of his requirements for his black solidarity--for effectiveness . Whatever the limitations of the Black Power movement might have been , it possessed a clear mission and committed members , and We Who Are Dark is vulnerable to several questions along those lines . Might the interests of black Americans be better served by small , dedicated organizations rather than the widespread affiliations that Shelby imagines ? Might the American political arena still have a place for black organizations that agitate for the remediation of social ills that disproportionately affect African-Americans ? Might such organizations be stronger and more committed were they made up of people who share economic , cultural , regional , or religious commonalities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black America , they might do the most for the majority of black Americans . In the end , Shelby 's endorsement of thin blackness as the basis of a new black solidarity does not inspire him to proclaim it a panacea , and he closes his final chapter with a tepid endorsement : " I am not suggesting that pragmatic black solidarity would be sufficient to eliminate racism . Indeed , it might be that nothing blacks do , even with the help of members from other ethnoracial groups , will end antiblack racism " ( p. 242 ) . <p> So , Shelby 's book closes not with a triumphant announcement but a weary admission that is as frustrating as it is apt . This frustration stems from the fact that antiblack racism is not the only problem facing blacks in the twenty-first century United States , just as the problems facing them are not unique to the black community . These problems require attention from multiracial political groups that can combat economic injustice , unfair labor practices , substandard public education , and urban poverty . Shelby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the center of the national debate while insisting that the problem of antiblack racism must also be addressed . Those two goals are worthy ones , but in separating the issue of racism from many of its effects , he may also mask the significant relationships between racial injustice and other forms of injustice . Ultimately , I was impressed by Shelby 's thorough and careful arguments , and I was enlightened by his informative survey of past black solidarity movements , but I remain skeptical that a limited black solidarity rooted in thin blackness is the answer to the issue of antiblack racism or that such a solidarity offers the prospect of political efficacy . Of course , solving such problems is complicated and difficult , and it is an impressive accomplishment to suggest meaningful steps toward a solution . Shelby does just that as he imagines a pragmatic solidarity that will address thorny social issues outside of a purely racial context while insisting that whites and blacks alike work to remedy antiblack racism .

With the publication of memoirs by many of those involved in creating the postwar constitution , and with the release of a substantial number of relevant documents in the 1970s and 1980s , Koseki is not the only scholar who is re-analyzing the continuity/discontinuity interpretive framework of the postwar Constitution of Japan. 5 <p> Secondly , Koseki believes there are as many lines of continuity as discontinuity because conservative Japanese officials were successful at " Japanizing " the American draft of the postwar constitution by revising it in ways that connected it to Japan 's imperial past and to the Meiji Constitution. 6 Contrary to popular belief , the postwar Constitution was not simply imposed upon a war-weakened Japan and rammed down the throats of conservative Japanese political leaders by an omnipotent General MacArthur . Koseki demonstrates that Japanese officials revised and translated the American-written draft in ways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional view of the relationship between the Japanese government and the Japanese people . <p> Koseki also demonstrates that MacArthur and his staff at SCAP did not have carte blanche when it came to constitution-making . The Far Eastern Commission ( FEC ) in Washington , the United States government , and US allies in the Pacific pressured MacArthur at various stages along the way . For example , although Article 9 forbid Japan from making war , some allies just plain did not trust Japan and wanted an additional article to put the clamps on possible future militarization of Japan . Primarily at the insistence of Chinese representatives to the FEC Hsuan-Tsui Lin and V.K. Wellington Koo the statement , " The Prime Minister and other Ministers of State must be civilians " was added to Article 66 . MacArthur and Japanese officials believed such a statement was unnecessary . In hindsight , however , it is clear that this addition to Article 66--along with the more well-known Article 9--has helped keep Japan 's military aspirations in check . <p> Much of the information and analyses in The Birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who study modern Japan and Japan-US relations . Nevertheless , there are enough nuggets of new information and analyses to interest even grizzled veterans of Occupation Era scholarship from the preface to the concluding chapter . To me , the freshest and most interesting part of Koseki 's work is Chapter 10 , " Blooming Brightly in May : Popularizers of the Constitution . " Here Koseki describes and analyzes how the Japanese government at all levels strongly promoted interest in and education about the new Constitution through booklets ( 20 millionone for each household ) , songs , essay contests , and films . <p> Koseki occasionally makes questionable speculations in this study . For example , he speculates that SCAP may have " arranged " the Mainichi newspaper 's scoop of 1 February 1946 : the publication of a very conservative draft constitution by Matsumoto 's Committee to Study Constitutional Problems. ( pp. 78 ) The Japanese media and the Japanese public were outraged that Matsumoto 's Committeethe official Japanese government committee selected to draft a new constitutionwere apparently doing no more than making minor revisions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave SCAP justification for making it 's own draft of a new constitution and then forcing the Japanese government to utilize the American-written draft as the basis for what eventually became the postwar Constitution of Japan . But there is no evidence that the Mainichi reporter ( Nishiyama Ryuzo ) received the scoop from anywhere other that the Matsumoto Committee secretariat . Nor is there any evidence that SCAP knew of the so-called Matsumoto Draft before it was published in the Mainichi newspaper on 1 February 1946 . However fortuitous the Mainichi scoop was for SCAP , all evidence clearly demonstrates that the Mainichi newspaper pulled off this scoop on its own . <p> The final chapter , " Yoshida 's Counterattack , " is also rather questionable because it contains a disdainful , overwhelmingly pessimistic view of the legacy of the postwar Constitution of Japan . Koseki starts this final chapter with the startling assertion that Japan 's new constitution " was only a change on paper . " ( p. 228 ) Prime Minister Yoshida 's failed attempt to have acts of libel or insults against the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that " the Japanese people were similarly attached " to the Emperor. ( p. 232 ) Even more dubiously , Koseki claims that " neither Yoshida nor the Liberal Party nor indeed most of the Japanese people were much changed by the new constitution . " ( p. 239 ) All of these statements are hard to accept at face value . If he really believes that the postwar Constitution of Japan is " only a change on paper " with no independent value or meaning , why would he spend at least a decade of his life researching and writing about it ? If it means so little , why has there always been tremendous public opposition whenever the conservative Liberal Democratic Party raises the possibility of changing the postwar Constitution of Japan ? <p> In fact , the rights , freedoms , and protections guaranteed by the postwar Constitution of Japan are much more expansive that those in the previous Meiji Constitution . And although Japanese courts have sometimes handed down decisions which do not accord with the postwar Constitution of Japan , the overwhelming majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protections in the postwar constitution , but which are absent in the previous Meiji Constitution . Permit me to cite just one example of what Koseki seems to have forgotten in his claim that little has been changed by the postwar Constitution of Japan : Half of the adult Japanese population ( women , that is ) were not allowed to vote under the Meiji Constitution . This change alone is assuredly much more than " a change on paper . " <p> Despite the occasional , questionable speculations , and a final chapter which fails to acknowledge the many substantial benefits that the Japanese people have received as a result of the postwar Constitution of Japan , Koseki Shoichi 's The Birth of Japan 's Postwar Constitution is still well worth reading for scholars and students of modern Japanese history , Japan-US relations , and legal history . It is a well-researched , readable , analytical narrative of the people , ideas , controversies , and compromises that resulted in a new constitution for one of the great nations of the world . <p> Notes <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been initially released . <p> 3 .

Saladino ( Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution , University of Wisconsin , Madison ) Published on H-Law ( October , 1999 ) <p> Synthesizing the Origins of the Bill of Rights <p> Leonard W. Levy , dean of American constitutional historians , has produced another book on the Bill of Rights , a subject on which , for four decades , he has been prolific , instructive , and controversial . By Levy 's own admission , Origins of the Bill of Rights draws " heavily " on his earlier writings , although it represents his " first attempt to be systematic and comprehensive concerning the origins of rights " ( p. ix ) . <p> His attachment to the subject is deep and profound . For him , the Bill of Rights and the Constitution ( also protective of rights ) represent one of history 's noblest themes -- " the triumph of individual liberty against government power " ( p.12 ) . They remind Americans of " their view that the citizen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 194 ) . <p> The first of the book 's twelve chapters -- " Why We Have a Bill of Rights " -- traces its origins from the first Virginia charter ( 1606 ) through the ratification of the U.S. Bill of Rights by the states ( 1791 ) . To retain their English liberties ( embodied in the great liberty documents and the common law ) , colonial Americans resisted imperial encroachments , while they simultaneously created new rights in their frames of government and charters of liberties . For them , " broad libertarian practices were the rule , not the exception " ( p. 3 ) . By 1776 , " the dominant theory " in America " was that the fundamental law limited all branches of the government , " not just the Crown ( p. 24 ) . When Americans broke with England , they drafted new constitutions because the word " constitution " had come to mean " a supreme law creating government , limiting it , unalterable by it , and paramount to it " ( p. 8 ) . Beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several states also drafted declarations of rights as another means of restraining government . The hasty and unsystematic drafting of these declarations bordered on " ineptness . " " Those documents which we uncritically exalt , were imitative , deficient , and irrationally selective " ( p. 186 ) . The rights omitted " were as numerous and important as those included " ( p. 23 ) . Nevertheless , state constitutions and declarations were " the most important , creative , and dynamic constitutional achievements in history " ( p. 167 ) . <p> When the Constitutional Convention ( 1787 ) drafted a new constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation ( 1781 ) , many Americans objected to the Constitution 's lack of a bill of rights -- a fact that made its ratification difficult . Both sides heatedly debated the question , committing dangerously misleading rhetorical excesses . In some states , ratifying conventions recommended scores of amendments , many of them based upon rights protected in state declarations of rights . These conventions recommended every part of what we now know as the Bill of Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1789 James Madison , who had opposed a bill of rights during the Constitution 's drafting and until the very end of the ratification controversy , brilliantly and persistently shepherded through the U.S. House of Representatives , against much opposition and apathy , seventeen amendments that he was largely responsible for drafting . The Senate adopted twelve of them , of which the states ratified ten . In drafting some clauses , Madison -- moved by reasons of " statecraft and political expediency " ( p. 32 ) -- was an innovator ; in others , what he recommended was commonplace . For his efforts , he deserves to be called " father of the Bill of Rights " ( p. 34 ) . <p> Madison outmaneuvered Antifederalists who wanted Congress to recommend sweeping structural amendments to the Constitution ; if Congress did not recommend such changes , Antifederalists desired the calling of a second constitutional convention , which Madison feared might drastically alter the Constitution . His amendments quieted people 's fears raised in the debate on ratifying the Constitution and the opposition to the Constitution disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution itself as a bill of rights , focusing on its provisions protecting the writ of habeas corpus and banning bills of attainder . Levy traces the writ 's development from its beginnings ( predating Magna Carta 1215 ) , analyzing and discussing the great liberty documents , court cases , and parliamentary statutes . In his Commentaries on the Laws of England ( 1765-1769 ) , the English jurist William Blackstone called the writ " the most celebrated in the English law " ; it was issuable at any time to anyone in the king 's dominions , superseding other proceedings . Americans used the writ sparingly since imperial authorities restricted its use by vetoing colonial laws incorporating provisions of the Habeas Corpus Act ( 1679 ) . Moreover , the writ was ineffective against a powerful executive or legislature . Some state constitutions protected it . Although the right is not mentioned in many state constitutions , it is protected through the states ' incorporation of the common law . <p> Bills of attainder ( legislation imposing penalties on named persons without due process of law ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In America , they were rare except during the Revolution , when governments often employed them against Loyalists . Levy discusses Virginia 's " notorious " Josiah Philips case ( 1778 ) and criticizes , for their roles in it , his two favorite whipping boys --Patrick Henry ( a " first-rate demagogue " ) and Thomas Jefferson ( an endorser of outlawry ) . Several state constitutions and the Northwest Ordinance ( 1787 ) prohibited bills of attainder , while the Constitutional Convention ( 1787 ) prohibited them without discussion . <p> Chapters Four and Five cover the First Amendment 's establishment and free press clauses . Levy states that a freedom against an establishment of religion has no " superior " ; such a freedom belongs in the First Amendment because establishments bring up " historical memories associated with religious persecution " ( p. 79 ) . Levy notes that American colonial establishments were different from European ones , which were limited to state support of one church . In America , " an establishment of religion meant government aid and sponsorship of religion , principally by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches " ( p. 101 ) . Therefore , the First Amendment prohibits both state preference for one religion and nonpreferential support for many or all . " Above all the establishment clause functions to protect religion from government , and government from religion " ( p. 102 ) . <p> Levy maintains that , in defining freedom of the press , Americans at first accepted Blackstone 's notion of no prior restraints . They too believed that printers could be punished for publishing false opinions and malicious scandals against government . But before 1789 the press , acting as if the law of seditious libel did not exist , was rarely punished . Seditious libel did exist , states Levy , although " the threshold of public tolerance had significantly widened " ( p. 123 ) -- a fact the free press clause recognizes . <p> In chapter six Levy states that the right to bear arms -- a right connected to freedom -- was treasured in England , where it was both an individual and a collective right . In America , it was the personal right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrusted standing armies . Therefore , gun ownership was common . Another protection against standing armies was a person 's right to serve in a disciplined militia . The Second Amendment 's preamble does not refer only to a collective right of individuals . " The right to bear arms is an individual right ... even if it is a right that must be regulated " ( pp. 134 , 149 ) . The Second Amendment also prohibits the national government from destroying state militias . <p> Chapter Seven treats the Fourth Amendment 's right against unreasonable searches and seizures . This ancient right , based upon Magna Carta and the delightful fiction that a man 's house is his castle , was not secure before 1776 . Colonial opposition to general warrants in the early 1760s , particularly in Massachusetts , was probably the beginning of the American Revolution . At the same time , John Wilkes , the radical English Whig politician and member of the House of Commons , led the fight in the mother country against general warrants . Framers of state constitutions condemned general warrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Madison proposed the Fourth Amendment , he employed the broadest language , some of it borrowed from state constitutions . But he went beyond state constitutions , using the admonitory " shall not " instead of the ineffectual " ought not " and employing the term " probable cause . " <p> Chapters Eight , Nine , and Ten discuss the Fifth and Sixth Amendments , which declare and protect , respectively , rights against self-incrimination and double-jeopardy , and rights to a grand jury indictment and to a jury trial of one 's peers . In England , the right against self-incrimination was " above all ... closely linked to freedom of speech and religious liberty " ( p. 201 ) . It was invented by individuals guilty of religious and political crimes . The right grew slowly in America , but it was well known by the mid-eighteenth century , when Americans associated it with Magna Carta and the law of nature . Once such a connection is made , a right " receives genuflection and praise , not critical analysis ; and it gets exalted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 202 ) . Madison 's clause on the right was broad because , although he was silent about his intent , he sought " to incorporate into the Constitution the entire scope of the common-law right " ( p. 181 ) . This meant that the right applied to criminal and civil cases , to the deposition stage , and to the initial questioning stage in a criminal case . Like other Fifth Amendment rights , it was basic to the survival of other " treasured rights . " <p> The right against double-jeopardy goes back to the era of the Bible and ancient Rome . It was accepted in criminal cases ( felonies only ) by the seventeenth century , both in England and America . Few states , however , inserted the right in their constitutions . By including the right , Madison showed how conscientiously he drafted his amendments . Levy believes the clause was meant to apply to all crimes , not just felonies , but he is uncertain . " The Framers of the Bill of Rights were rarely exact with respect to their intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated or meant what they said " ( p. 208 ) . <p> The double-jury system ( under which individuals are indicted or charged with crimes by a grand jury and tried by a trial or petit jury ) developed from the inquest used in English law in the era of Henry II . Trial by jury developed first in civil cases and then in criminal ones . By the latter half of the fourteenth century , the practice of a unanimous vote of twelve jurors ( in felony cases ) had developed ; such a vote represented the sense of the community . Jurors were often punished by royal officials for not rendering desired verdicts , but that practice ended with Bushell 's case ( 1670 ) . Most public trials were fair . " The grand jury , like the trial jury , evolved into a bastion of popular rights rather than a crown agent " ( p. 219 ) . Grand juries defended individual freedoms , protecting people against unfair and spiteful prosecutions . They stood between the royal prosecutor and the trial jury ; representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , the jury trial was perhaps the most common right -- a particular right of Englishmen . Between 1774 and 1776 , Americans frequently asserted this right and criticized Britain for using jury-less vice-admiralty courts . Every state constitution and the Northwest Ordinance ( 1787 ) secured the right ; the Constitution , itself provided for jury trials in criminal cases . Madison 's amendments also called for guarantees of speedy and public trials and jury trials in civil cases . Grand juries were common in colonial and revolutionary America , where they mimicked their English counterparts . <p> The Eighth Amendment , the focus of chapter elevan , came from the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) . Six state constitutions also copied that liberty document . The relevant provision in the English Bill of Rights was derived from the case of Titus Oates , whose punishment for his involvement in the Popish Plot ( 1678 ) , was deemed excessive and cruel . Madison 's version of the amendment , in which he employed the admonitory " shall not " with respect to punishments , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of non-barbarous punishment as early as the Bible and Magna Carta . The English were proud that their punishments were not as barbarous as European ones ; American punishments were even more lenient . Death was an acceptable punishment in England and America , providing the accused received due process of law and the punishment was proportionate to the crime . <p> Levy declares in chapter twelve that Madison wanted the Ninth Amendment to protect unenumerated rights against endangerment from the enumeration of particular rights . The amendment also avoided the difficult task of a systematic and complete enumeration of rights . The Ninth " is a repository of natural rights , including the right to pursue happiness and the right to equality of treatment before the law " ( p. 254 ) . The commonplace notion of natural rights , of which the pursuit of happiness was one , is crucial to understanding this amendment . The Framers were as committed to this pursuit as they were to liberty and property . The amendment -- intended to have vitality -- also protects positive rights , such as voting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also protected in state constitutions and statutes . Levy even maintains that the Ninth was possibly meant to protect rights not yet known . <p> Has Levy fulfilled his stated purpose ? The book is not as " systematic " and " comprehensive " as he seems to intend it to be , but he succeeds admirably in summarizing in vivid and compelling prose his writings on liberty . More than twenty-five rights are embedded in the Bill of Rights . Excepting the right to keep and bear arms , Levy treats only those rights on which he has previously written . He ignores the First Amendment 's right to assemble and right of petition clauses and the free exercise clause ; the Fifth Amendment 's due process and just compensation clauses ; and the Sixth Amendment 's right to counsel and confrontation clauses . The Third Amendment 's prohibition on the quartering of troops receives no mention , even though it demonstrates concern for the sanctity of homes , the protection of property , and the subordination of the civilian to the military -- all themes of Levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the Constitution -- the prohibition of ex post facto laws and religious tests for office-holding and the narrow definition of treason . Although Origins of the Bill of Rights does not consider all rights , it is a lucid and valuable examination of those it does address , and it surpasses all comparable overview studies in its analysis and presentation of the English background . <p> Levy probably tackled the Second Amendment for the first time in these pages because the amendment and its interpretation concern modern Americans greatly . Neither gun-control advocates nor the National Rifle Association will be happy with his interpretation , while proponents of citizen militias will be outraged . Levy describes the views of militia advocates as " bizarre " and " loony . " He lands smack in the middle of the debate , which is probably where , based upon the available historical evidence , he should land . As a true believer in rights , his stance is understandable ; the amendment gives individuals the right to keep and bear arms . <p> That Levy mostly draws together his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book 's brief bibliography and lack of footnotes . This bibliography , which includes only the work of other historians , has a mere dozen titles , most published before 1980 . Levy refers in his text to still other historians ; he is generous to the fine work of two of his students , Thomas J. Curry ( religion clauses ) and William Cuddihy ( searches and seizures ) . The page facing the title page lists more than thirty of Levy 's publications and as such it constitutes a second , more significant bibliography . Levy 's bibliography of the works of other historians is supplemented by the extensive bibliography found in his Original Intent and the Framers ' Constitution ( New York and London : Macmillan , 1988 ) . Substantial bibliographies also appear in his Origins of the Fifth Amendment : The Right Against Self-Incrimination ( New York : Oxford University Press , 1968 ; rev. ed. , New York : Macmillan , 1988 ) , and his Emergence of a Free Press ( New York and Oxford : Oxford University Press , 1985 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathbreaking 1960 study Legacy of Suprression ( Cambridge , Mass. : Belknap Press of Harvard University Press , 1960 ) . <p> Although Levy scores both Federalists and Antifederalists for their rhetorical excesses , he is overly harsh about the sincerity of Antifederalist leaders , often dismissing them as demagogues . Many Antifederalist leaders unquestionably preferred sweeping structural changes to the Constitution , but the fears of many others were sincere respecting the document 's lack of a bill of rights . The Constitution created a powerful central authority and fear and suspicion of such an authority had deep roots in American history . Revolutionary Americans --influenced by their experience with a powerful central authority ( imperial Britain ) -- insisted on written constitutions and declarations of rights to protect their rights and liberties . Why then should the Constitution not have a bill of rights ? Such thinking was part of the Revolution 's constitutional heritage , so eloquently praised by Levy . <p> Levy seems oblivious to the burgeoning literature that looks favorably on Antifederalist contributions to political and constitutional thought . Antifederalists are being taken more seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demagogic " men of little faith . " Many were intelligent , complicated , and diverse , representing a variety of interests and positions . Moreover , it is important to understand their thought because their arguments did much to shape Federalist arguments . Antifederalists were the primary shapers of the ratification debates on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . Levy also seems to be unaware of ( or has chosen to disregard ) the work of several historians , such as Gordon S. Wood , who have convincingly questioned Richard Henry Lee 's authorship of the Letters from the Federal Farmer . <p> Nonetheless , Origins of the Bill of Rights is an excellent synthesis of a lifetime of scholarship by an unabashed champion of rights and liberties . It is a splendid addition to Professor Levy 's bulging bookshelf of monographs and edited works . It gives historians , lawyers , and the general public considerable insight into a document that defines Americans as a people . 69403 @qwx479403

But not every historian would accord them the kind of attention that Lucy Riall does in this intriguing account of the rise of a Garibaldi personality cult in nineteenth-century Italy . The book is something of a cross between a conventional biography and a study of how the Garibaldi image was formed and propagated . The narrative combines conventional biography with an account of how the public perceived Garibaldi , with the emphasis on the latter . Abundant documentation details how politically interested Garibaldi admirers and fellow travelers " invented " the image to satisfy the public craving for heroes and rally public opinion behind the movement for national unification and the newly founded Italian state . <p> This is one of a growing number of publications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As one might expect , in the current climate of academia much attention is being paid to the driving role of inventions , images , constructions , and myths . These are catchwords of the new cultural history that sees historical events as driven primarily by media manipulations of symbols and rituals . This is not the place to discuss the role of cultural history , except to note that this study reveals its subversive potential . Riall sets out to expose the chinks in the armor of this revered figure , deploying in the process an array of weapons drawn from the social sciences . In the end , it delivers something of a mixed verdict on Garibaldi . On the one hand , she acknowledges that there was real substance behind the image of the national hero . On the other hand , the hero is stripped of much of his glory . The qualities of humility and self-sacrifice are not much in evidence . What stands out is Garibaldi 's gift for self-promotion . He is not denied physical courage and military ability , but Riall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or she discusses them as attributes of the invented character . His private life , particularly the sexual part , elicits some rather harsh comments . Riall argues that the emerging picture of Garibaldi is attuned to our " twenty-first century sensibilities , " which she sees as relishing contradictions and ironies ( p. 206 ) . The judgment may be premature given that there are still ninety-three years left to go in the century , but it must be admitted that it is refreshing to see someone willing to tread so irreverently on sacred ground and invite the ire that will no doubt come her way . <p> Riall is not the first historian who has set out to " deconstruct " or " demythologize " Garibaldi . Giuseppe Garibaldi e il suo mito ( 1984 ) is the title of a volume of papers presented at the fifty-first congress of the Istituto per la Storia del Risorgimento Italiano , held in Genoa in November 1982 , on the centenary of Garibaldi 's death . However , the participants treaded cautiously on this mined ground . The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France that was laudatory in the extreme , all but ignoring the many adverse reactions that Garibaldi 's name elicited in France . Still , the desire to investigate the image rather than the person was already evident in 1982 . Riall mentions Agulhon , along with Benedict Anderson , Fran+ois Furet , and George Mosse , all prominent practitioners of the new cultural history , as guides to her work . <p> Riall 's book relates also to another school of thought that has gained momentum in the last quarter of a century . This school is revisionist in a different way in that it questions the fundamental premise of most historical writing on the Risorgimento , namely , that national unification was a desirable outcome . This school is much more critical of the Risorgimento than the old Gramscian-Marxist critics ever were . They found it wanting as a revolutionary movement , but considered it as a phase in the process of bourgeois modernization and therefore as a preliminary step in the direction of genuine revolution . The new revisionists regard national unification as a step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrie perdute , and see them as capable of improvement and progress . They stress the importance of continuity in history , and point to the wrenching changes wrought by national unification , the abuses of power perpetrated by national leaders , and the nationalist temptations to which they succumbed . <p> Riall is particularly sensitive to the charge that patriots were dangerous nationalists in the making , and this perception reflects on her treatment of Garibaldi . There is therefore more than a whiff of revisionismo antirisorgimentale in this work , also present in two of her earlier studies . In The Italian Risorgimento : State , Society and National Unification ( 1994 ) , Riall provided a critical overview of the scholarly literature on the Risorgimento , and deplored that historians had " not developed an alternative means of conceptualizing political action " ( p. 9 ) . In Sicily and the Unification of Italy : Liberal Policy and Local Power , 1859-1866 ( 1998 ) , she provided a close-up look at the interaction between local interests and state power in Sicily . The book delivered what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national unification did to Sicily . In it , Risorgimento leaders appear as no better , but also as no worse , than those who preceded and followed them . All worked out convenient power-sharing agreements with local elites , to the detriment of the powerless . None were able to bring the rule of law to the island . The book credits Garibaldi with good and generous intentions toward Sicily when he was responsible for the island in 1860 , but sees him as politically inept , not effectively in charge , and easily outmaneuvered by his rivals and opponents in the unification movement . <p> In Garibaldi : Invention of a Hero , Riall sets out to explain how Garibaldi morphed from a largely unknown entity in Italy before 1848 into the national hero that he became in 1859-60 and later . The title is somewhat misleading because , as mentioned earlier , the book does not deal solely with the invented image , but seeks instead to relate invention to reality and to see how politically motivated mystification connects with conventional biography . Her stated intent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend relates to the reality , to compare what Garibaldi actually was with what the legend made him out to be . In pursuit of that goal , Riall strikes off in unconventional directions , looks at unusual sources , and borrows generously from the methodologies of anthropology , sociology , psychology , and communication studies . She looks at political tracts , pamphlets , contemporary biographies , all sorts of ephemera , folk tales , and works of art , music , and fiction . The narrative shifts repeatedly back and forth between biography and image building , setting up an inner tension that begs to be resolved . It is resolved eventually , as Riall allows Garibaldi the performer to trump Garibaldi the doer . <p> How does Riall construct this rather theatrical Garibaldi ? She credits Giuseppe Mazzini with setting the ball in motion in the 1840s , when he was looking for a hero to help him revive the flagging fortunes of his republican movement . Reports received from South America , where Garibaldi was making a name for himself as a freedom fighter , convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and publicized his exploits with publications , correspondence , and public subscriptions . Mazzini made Garibaldi a big name in the small world of radical politics well before 1848 , when Garibaldi returned to Italy to fight against Austria and for Mazzini 's short-lived Roman Republic . For the first time in Italy , we notice that Garibaldi 's reputation bore little relationship to the outcome of the battles he fought . While his operations against the Austrians had little effect on the course of the war and the Roman Republic went down in defeat , Garibaldi 's reputation as a fighter grew , in spite of well-founded criticisms of his military tactics by military experts . Republican publicists saw to it that what was remembered was not the defeats or the questionable tactics , but the heroism and self-sacrifice of the republican freedom fighters , the lukewarm patriotism of the more moderate rivals , the wiles of diplomats , and the dynastic selfishness of monarchs . <p> Riall goes into a lengthy discussion of the technological innovations in publishing that made such propaganda possible . The issue is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , the age of mass culture was late in coming to Italy , where the production and circulation of printed materials was hampered by backward technology , low levels of literacy , and political censorship .

One can not help but admire her resolve , and perhaps commiserate with her for the time and effort spent sifting through mountains of documents of mind-numbing banality . That is the kind of fortitude it takes to carry off a project of this nature , and anyone who pulls it off as well as Riall deserves to be congratulated . The catch is that , as important as such work is , it may leave us somewhat dissatisfied in the end , for the audiences for which it was intended remain elusive and we do not know who actually read or saw this material . There were no public opinion polls in nineteenth-century Italy . <p> Riall 's work traverses the different phases of Garibaldi 's life chapter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanked by chapters that deal with image making . No short summary can do justice to Riall 's nuanced approach , but thanks to her efforts we can now see how and by what means Garibaldi 's reputation grew as the propaganda machine seized on and magnified his exploits and character traits . The South American phase ( 1836-48 ) served to build up his image as a brave , honest , and selfless liberator . Even though few Europeans could have understood just what Garibaldi was fighting for in Brazil and Uruguay , it was enough for Italians that he was fighting , for in so doing he challenged the stereotype that Italians would not fight . That he was fighting for a republican cause was icing on the cake as far as Mazzini was concerned . Mazzini also pointed out that Garibaldi stood alone in refusing material compensation for his services , a testimony to his disinterested idealism . His actions in Italy in 1848 to 1849 provided more fodder for the propaganda machine . Not only was his gallantry now in evidence at home , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Brazilian wife Anita at his side in 1849 attached to both of them the auras of sacrifice and martyrdom . The menial occupations of candle maker and merchant seaman that he pursued during his second exile ( 1849-54 ) served to bring out his humility , forbearance , and attachment to the family that he was forced to leave behind . <p> Riall finds the autobiography badly written , which is surely a matter of opinion , but is surprising nevertheless given her talent for teasing meaning out of sources . Literary grace may not be much in evidence in Garibaldi 's memoirs , but he tells the story of his life rather well and accurately in the parts that he covers ( there are telling omissions that Riall is quick to point out ) . The final version of the autobiography was written late in life , partly because he needed money , but also for other and more compelling reasons . Its explicit language , proclivity for seeing issues in black and white , scathing condemnations of real or imagined opponents , rabid anticlericalism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a work meant to inflame political passions , rescue his legacy , and keep the democratic movement on course . It is a reliable guide to the inner person and to the politics of the democratic movement , and not just an exercise in popularization . <p> The concept of popularity needs to be examined closely in a work of this kind . Riall acknowledges that Garibaldi 's popularity was mostly posthumous , and what she sets out to examine , and examines very well , is the laying of the foundations for this posthumous phenomenon . But in life Garibaldi was more controversial than popular . His name was indeed a powerful magnet for thousands of Italians who responded to his call and were ready to follow him wherever he might lead . He was the only man in his time who could summon a sizable private army on demand . But it was a relative and limited popularity . Garibaldi himself was disappointed that vast strata of the population , particularly the peasantry , remained indifferent or hostile to his summons , and Italy at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks beyond the patriotic minority , Garibaldi was far from being a popular figure . Dare one say it ? The most popular public figure in Italy in Garibaldi 's time was beyond any doubt Pope Pius IX , who was Garibaldi 's staunch enemy . Only the pope had a propaganda machine that reached deep into the country . In every parish where there was a priest there was a propagandist for the pope . Some rulers who had native roots , or had gone native in the course of time , like the Bourbons of Naples , were also popular . Victor Emmanuel II was popular in ways that Garibaldi understood better than Mazzini could appreciate . Was Garibaldi 's loyalty to Victor Emmanuel a kind of peasant awe of authority , as Mazzini alleged , or a sign of political awareness ? <p> Back to image building . Garibaldi 's image building project was conceived in the heat of battle , against opponents who had their own bases of popular support . Realizing that Garibaldi 's popularity was limited to an enterprising but numerically small minority should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not alone in taking Garibaldi to task for not standing his ground more forcefully in 1860 against Victor Emmanuel , Camillo Benso di Cavour , and the moderates , and all who wanted to get him out of the way as quickly as possible . Garibaldi 's actions make more sense if we realize that his antagonist in this case , Victor Emmanuel , had much going for him in the south and elsewhere in the country . Cavour , probably the most influential among the major Risorgimento figures , was also the least popular ( let us see what revisionist historians make of his " image " when his bicentenary comes up in 2010 ) , but as the king 's prime minister Cavour rode on the coattails of Victor Emmanuel 's popularity . Garibaldi had personal charisma , but Victor Emmanuel had a regular army and the support of international diplomacy , and he promised order , reliable administration , and security for people and property . The alliance with his royal partner Napoleon III in 1859 reassured the timid that Italians would not be fighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , is what brought out the crowds in 1859 . Let us consider , then , that Garibaldi 's alleged political indecisiveness in 1860 , when he is said to have surrendered a kingdom to Victor Emmanuel and given up on republicans , may have been due to his awareness of the limits of his own popularity ( and certainly of the republicans ' popularity ) , and of the king 's greater acceptability in the eyes of millions of his countrymen . This is not to diminish the role of republicans , who are even more admirable for sticking to their guns in the face of their minority status , which was their fate and their glory until nearly everyone turned republican after 1946 when Italy became a republic . Garibaldi and garibaldinismo were too radical to exert appeal beyond the ranks of true believers in his time . We need to be aware of the limits of Garibaldi 's appeal not only to make sense of his behavior , but also to understand the radical nature of his message .

Wadsworth ( Department of History , University of Arizona ) Published on H-LatAm ( April , 1999 ) <p> Piracy in Spanish America <p> Kris Lane weaves a tale of pirate activities in the Americas and of Spanish responses to those activities that reveals aspects of pirate life and culture not usually addressed in the standard histories of Latin America . He demythologizes the pirates of popular culture and places them in their broader historical context in which their activities are seen as more pecuniary than nationalistic . Lane presents a concise narrative of the seaborne attackers of Spain 's colonial empire , and , to a much lesser extent , Portugal 's . The book 's claim to originality and to revisionism is that it presents a concise overview of piracy in American waters during the early modern period--including considerable discussion of the often overlooked piracy in the Pacific . <p> Except for some archival research in South American archives , this work is based on , and , as Lane admits , dependent on , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter Bradely , Peter Gerhard , Charles Boxer , and Carla Rahn Phillips--to name a few . In producing this work , Lane has been more interested in producing a companion text on piracy suitable for World History or similar courses than in providing an original text based on primary research ( p. xvii ) . Despite the existence of regional and chronological studies of pirates , until now , no one has attempted an aggregate treatment of pirates in the Americas . This is what Lane has undertaken . <p> In doing so , he had to deal with the often nebulous distinction between corsairs , pirates , privateers , buccaneers , and freebooters . These distinctions are largely a matter of perspective , but they are , nonetheless , important because they represented different kinds of activities . Piracy refers to unsanctioned sea-raiding , while privateering refers to raids authorized by a monarch or other governing body . Corsario was the Spanish term for pirates and privateers alike . The terms buccaneer and freebooter ( filibustier in French ) arose during the seventeenth century to refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish , and Portuguese sailors who formed groups of raiders independent of nationalist ties often operating without even symbolic legal sanction . The actual distinctions were usually unclear and , for the recipients of these violent attacks , the distinction made little difference . To the Spanish inhabitants of the Americas , they were all foreign criminals who deserved no quarter . <p> Lane divides the history of piracy in the Americas into five periods--the French corsairs between 1500 and 1559 , the Elizabethan pirates ( 1558-1603 ) , Dutch pirates and privateers ( 1570-1648 ) , the seventeenth-century buccaneers , and the end of buccaneering with the last of the freebooters around 1730 . He begins with a discussion of anti-Spanish piracy along the Barbary Coast in the sixteenth century as a context for the activities of the French corsairs in the Americas . These corsairs were led by petty nobles and Huguenots of the sixteenth century . The patterns that arose out of Berber and French piracy in the Mediterranean and later French piracy in the Americas set the stage for the patterns that marked the piracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious and political tensions within Europe with Protestant countries tolerating and often supporting piracy against the shipping and colonies of Catholic countries and vice versa . Privateering became a shield for pirate activity and gave pirates the cloak of legitimacy and legality . The practice of hostage-taking also developed during this time , and Spain found itself forced to pay high ransoms and to adopt costly defense measures that it could ill afford . The Spanish settlements in the New World also found that they had to defend themselves against pirate attacks because the empire was simply too large to be defended effectively and defense measures were too costly for the crown to maintain . <p> The Elizabethan piracy of such notables as John Hawkins and Francis Drake can be broken down into three major periods . The Elizabethans engaged in contraband slave trading between 1558 and 1568 as English merchants refused to accept Spain 's monopoly of the slave trade and smuggled slaves into the Americas . This contraband trade led to increased hostility between the Spanish and the English which gave way to open piracy on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of war in 1585 , English piracy turned into privateering which lasted until about 1603 . The privateers of this period carried on much as the pirates of the earlier period--except now they had official backing for their raids . <p> By 1600 , English piracy in the Americas began to give way to the Dutch who resented Spain 's religious orthodoxy and political domination . The Dutch privateers also represented the commercial interests of the fledgling Dutch state . Dutch privateering differed in two significant ways from the French and English pirates . Dutch privateering was a business and the sailors were employees of Dutch companies which meant that they were not loosely organized and that they could not expect equal shares of the proceeds of their work . These seafarers , many of whom became disgruntled and even rioted in Holland , formed the core of the next wave of Caribbean buccaneers . <p> The last half of the seventeenth century was the golden age of piracy in the Americas . Seafarers from all of the major European countries involved in the Americas were represented among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and French shipping in the Caribbean . These buccaneers were a self-governing , more or less egalitarian conglomerate of adventurers seeking freedom from rigid class hierarchies and intent on enjoying the fruits of their labors . They also moved into the Pacific after the political climate in the Caribbean began to turn against piracy . The Pacific pirates were most active between 1680 and 1694 . They spread destruction along the Pacific coast which reduced the level of trade , increased the isolation of towns and cities , exacerbated regionalist animosities , and diverted crucial shipments of bullion away from Spanish coffers to meet local defense needs . <p> The golden age of buccaneering began to decline after 1680 when an increasingly hostile legal and political environment developed as the European countries found that the privateering wolves unleashed among the Spanish sheep did not always distinguish between Spanish and English , French or Dutch sheep . What had been a cost effective mechanism for challenging the Spanish commercially and politically in the Americas had become a threat to their own commercial and political interests in the area . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pirate could be executed simply for being a pirate . The English Act of Piracy of 1699 also allowed colonial courts to try sea-robbers rather than sending them to England . The famous Captain William Kidd was executed in 1701 as a result of this change in the political climate . Even though efforts at pirate repression began in the 1680s , it was not until 1716 that a genuine extermination campaign began . The European states still found pirates to be useful at times . These extermination efforts were largely successful , and , after 1730 , even though piracy continued , it never enjoyed the freedom it had experienced in the seventeenth century . <p> Lane 's presentation is engaging and well constructed . The informational sections included at the end of each chapter are interesting and contribute to the overall presentation of pirate life . There are sections on currency , navigation , shipbuilding , gambling , shipwreck salvage , and seafaring diet . <p> Although Lane includes a brief discussion of French and Dutch activity in Portuguese America , on the whole , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose in studying piracy in aggregate is , at least , partially undermined by this exclusion . Besides the French presence in the sixteenth century , which Lane mentions briefly , the English were very active also in Brazilian waters . Robert Wethrington and Christopher Lister attacked the Reconcavo , the important sugar producing region of the modern day state of Bahia , in 1587 and Thomas Cavendish attacked the village of Sao Vicente and pillaged the port at Santos in 1599 . The English and Irish also spent considerable efforts in colonizing the Amazon River between 1550-1646. 1 Lane relies heavily on Boxer 's The Dutch Seaborne Empire , 1600-1800 for his discussion on the Dutch in Brazil while ignoring Boxer 's earlier work The Dutch in Brazil 1624-1654 . Despite the Dutch interest in Spanish shipping , the Dutch West India Company saw the Portuguese empire in Asia , Africa , and the Americas as the prime target for its military , naval , and commercial expansion. 2 The profitable sugar producing regions of Northern Brazil drew them in the early seventeenth century just as the newly discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early eighteenth century . With the convenient excuse of Portugal 's alliance with England in the Wars of the Spanish Succession , the French attacked Rio de Janeiro , the main artery through which Brazilian gold flowed to Portugal , in 1710 and again in 1711. 3 <p> All of these assaults were costly and devastating and they forced the Portuguese to respond with expensive defense strategies , just as they did the Spanish . A comparison of the effects of pirate predation on Brazil and Spanish America and the Spanish and Portuguese responses to it would have enhanced the book and made it a more truly aggregate view of piracy in the Americas . A more thorough discussion of Spanish and Portuguese piracy as a specific response to piratical predation would have filled out the discussion . <p> Nevertheless , Lane does a good job of showing that piracy in the Caribbean was not separate from piracy in the Pacific , and that the events in one theater effected the events in the other . Likewise , his discussion of Henry Avery and Captain Kidd demonstrates how piracy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is this quality of the book that would make it a useful addition to a world history course . The book presents a broad hemispheric narrative that connects American piracy to broader historical events . Because of the hemispheric nature of the work , however , it would be necessary to contextualize it with a more detailed discussion not only of European piracy in Asia , Africa , and the Indian Ocean , but also of the transformations of the world economy during the early modern period which stimulated European piratical activity . <p> In demythologizing the pirates of the early modern period , Lane argues that they do not need to be romanticized , debunked or accused . He states : <p> Their actions were often irrational , even in the short run , and it was not uncommon for them to miss enormous payoffs due to drunkenness , infighting , or ignorance . In the long run , however , the pirates appear to have followed a generally rational pattern of economic action ; they identified and clustered around choke points , singled out straggling ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . To paraphrase Butch Cassidy 's famous reference to bank robbers affinity for banks in the late nineteenth-century United States , the pirates robbed Spanish ships and ports because that 's where the money was . <p> Specialists of piracy in Latin America will likely find little that is new in Lane 's presentation ( he presented his original research on South America in an article in the Colonial Latin American Historical Review in 1997 ) .

Hawes ( Department of History , University of Memphis ) Published on H-Childhood ( July , 2007 ) <p> Peter Stearns 's Childhood in World History is a worthy member of the Themes in World History series , published by Routledge , taking its place alongside volumes on such topics as disease and medicine , alcohol , sports , food , migration , revolutions , and religion . A front note indicates that the purpose of the series is " to provide serious , if brief , discussions of important topics as additions to textbook coverage and document collections " ( p. ii ) . Thus this work and others in the series are intended primarily for undergraduate students . As Stearns is the series editor and has two other volumes in it , readers will be unsurprised to find that the volume under review meets the standards described for the series almost exactly . What may surprise some readers , however , is that Childhood in World History has a great deal more than a quick survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and the contemporary world , chapters become richer and more detailed . Early chapters are brief , sketchy , and necessarily superficial because of the lack of adequate sources . Much of what can be said about childhood in early agricultural societies is at best broad , general , and even contradictory . Stearns observes , for example that " most agricultural societies emphasized extended families , with strong links among surviving grandparents , adult children , and their spouses ( usually with wives moving to the extended families of husbands ) and children , but more isolated nuclear families could also develop " ( p. 16 ) . <p> When societies became more civilized , historians are blessed with more evidence . Early laws defined childhood and often specified the status they inherited . The appearance of schooling gives some tantalizing evidence of the lives of children in the classical civilizations . In China , Confucianism defined expectations for children , but these fragments most often pertained only to the children of the elites . Such fragmentary sources permit Stearns to make some brief ( and very general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , and Rome . <p> Chapters on the impact of religious change , " Debating Childhood in the Premodern West , " and the emergence of what Stearns calls " the modern model of childhood " follow ( p. 54 ) . Stearns 's articulation of this model is especially useful in thinking about developments affecting children in the recent past . Among the elements in the model are the " conversion of childhood from work to schooling " ( p. 55 ) , the limitation of family size , a reduction in the infant death rate , and a greater separation between childhood and adulthood . A change in assumptions about children 's inner natures accompanied these basic patterns . In the modern model , children were no longer born in sin , but were now blank slates ( as in John Locke 's " Essay Concerning Human Understanding , " 1689 ) and thus capable of being influenced by experience and social factors . As families had fewer children and as individual children became more important , the practice of childrearing , especially mothering , became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood--a concern about sexuality , for example , or the concept of adolescence--emerged as social issues . <p> Even as the modern model of childhood appeared , other patterns persisted . Slavery remained legal in the United States and Brazil until the 1860s and 1870s , and slave children were mostly denied access to the schooling and other aspects of the modern model . In colonial societies , especially Latin America , the rates of illegitimacy rose dramatically and this , in turn , produced a number of children who circulated between orphanages and families who needed children for labor . Some aspects of that colonial pattern have persisted among the lower orders in Latin America . <p> The six concluding chapters all focus on the twentieth century and on the complex developments affecting children late in that century . These latter chapters are much richer in both detail and analysis , and by themselves repay the price of obtaining this short general work . One chapter focuses on Japan 's deliberate efforts to modernize its society in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries . The Japanese committed major resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time significantly lowering the birth rate ( from 2.7 children per woman in 1950 to 1.4 in 1995 ) ( p. 77 ) . Another aspect of childhood in Japan was the development of consumer appeals to Japanese children . As a result Japan became both a major producer and exporter of toys . <p> Another chapter combines analysis of the changes in childhood in the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic of China . In the Soviet Union , as in Japan , there was a strong emphasis on schooling and on efforts to improve health care for children and to reduce infant mortality . But there was also a strong effort to mobilize youth along ideological lines , the Young Pioneers and the Komsomol organizations being examples of that effort . But unlike Japan , the Soviet Union sought to encourage large families as the birthrate there was already quite low . <p> In China , the focus on education took a strange turn in the " Cultural Revolution , " when millions of secondary and college-level students were " sent down " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Red Guards as agents of the " Cultural Revolution " distorted relations between children and adults . The People 's Republic did achieve a much lowered infant mortality rate , but then sought to address the growth of population through the " one child " policy , a pattern that resulted in an over supply of male babies . Orphanages developed in China with their charges being exclusively female . <p> Stearns sums up the twentieth-century in the developed world as follows : " Societies in the United States , Japan , and Western Europe continued more fully to implement what we have described as the characteristics of modern childhood . That is they added commitments to schooling and further reduced at least the more traditional forms of child labor ; they completed the dramatic reductions of child death rates that had begun in the nineteenth century , and with a few zigzags , they made a fuller conversion to lower birth rates . " ( p. 93 ) <p> In addition treating children as consumers became much more common , and mothers began to work outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , childcare became an important issue both for families and for social policy . Divorce also became much more common , especially in the United States , and in the 1980s there was a significant increase in the number children growing up in poverty , especially when they lived in families headed by a single mother . <p> In one of the most compelling chapters , Stearns takes up the impact of war and violence on children . " No single process in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries , " he observes , " killed as many children as the Holocaust did " ( p. 111 ) . But the death rate for children around the world only increased after World War II . Estimates of children killed in civil wars around the globe reach as high as 150 million . Also millions of children were forced to flee as violence touched their homeland and some children became soldiers in the wide-ranging wars . <p> In his conclusion , Stearns notes that the contemporary world is full of complexity and that certain kinds of problems persist . Abuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , and many contemporary children suffer from psychological problems , including depression , eating problems , and suicide . Change , even rapid overwhelming change , is neither new nor likely to stop . An understanding of the history of childhood , Stearns thinks , " provides a roadmap " for the continuing debate and actions involved in the concept of childhood ( p. 140 ) . <p> This slim volume is intended primarily for undergraduates who are ignorant not only of the sweep of the history of childhood since ancient times , but of most social trends as well . Broad in scope and mostly lacking scholarly apparatus ( although the references at the end of each chapter are helpful and include many very recent works ) Childhood in World History serves as an introductory overview to the chronological and geographical complexities of the scope of the history of childhood . As such it can not be both an introduction to so vast a field and an in-depth contribution at the same time . <p> Stearns 's essential arguments are not controversial . First , he argues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient times and that world keeps changing . Next , the development of the " modern model of childhood " has made an enormous difference in the lives of children since the nineteenth century and continues to make a difference in less developed parts of the world . Third , major events such as World War II and the civil wars which have followed have had enormous impacts on children and have led to the deaths of millions of children . <p> Thus , we are left with a paradox : even as the modern model of childhood has extended the lives of many children and improved the quality of life for millions of children , wars and struggles have taken the lives of millions of children and otherwise hampered or harmed the lives of countless other children . Childhood in World History might serve as a supplement to introductory courses in world history or to courses related to children and families , but lacking a historical focus .

In his volume , Slavery and the Founders : Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson , Paul Finkelman provides a fine antidote for a portion of that ignorance . His is a well-reasoned , extensively researched , and eminently readable account of slavery in the 1787 Constitution and its legal status in the new nation 's early years . According to Finkelman , the writing and ratifying of the Constitution were conditioned on slavery 's protection . Agreeing with the Garrisonians , he contends that the Constitution was a " slaveholder 's compact " ( p. ix ) . He also argues that the 1787 Northwest Ordinance and the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act reflected the intellectual and moral environment that produced the proslavery Constitution . Finally , he contends that the proslavery constitutional and legal system faithfully registered Thomas Jefferson 's notions about slavery . <p> Finkelman analyzes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his argument that the Philadelphia conclave accorded it an exalted status . Proslavery delegates won slavery 's protection , in good part , by linking it with representation , through the three-fifths clause of Article I , Section 2 . From the nation 's beginning slavery enjoyed enhanced power in the House of Representatives , which translated into a comparably enlarged power in the Electoral College , without which Jefferson would have lost the election of 1800 . Additional direct protections include the prohibition against ending the international slave trade before 1808 , the fugitive slave clause , the " direct tax " clause , which assured that slaves could be taxed at only three-fifths the rate of whites , and the Article V provision that prohibited slave importation and tax clause amendments before 1808 . Ironically , the new frame of government , designed to replace the virtually unamendable Articles of Confederation , had but one unamendable feature , which went to slavery 's protection . <p> In addition to the Constitution 's direct protections , Finkelman also found thirteen indirect protections , such as requiring three-fourths of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave states a " perpetual veto over any constitutional changes " ( p. 5 ) , and the " full faith and credit " clause , which required free states to recognize and honor slave-state law . He contends that slaveholders won without giving major concessions to anti-slavery delegates , except for the " dirty compromise " ( p. 22 ) , by which southerners agreed to allow commercial acts by a simple majority instead of a two-thirds vote in exchange for clauses protecting the slave trade and prohibiting an export tax . Other than this compromise and sporadic , disjointed verbal attacks on the institution , slavery 's defenders won its protection with relative ease from the Framers . <p> In the same year that the Framers wrote the Constitution , Congress , which continued meeting under the Articles of Confederation , passed the Northwest Ordinance , which prohibited slavery north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi . On first blush the Ordinance was antislavery , but Finkelman argues that it had little negative impact on slavery until the 1830s and 1840s . The Ordinance passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " actually fortified slavery " ( p. 36 ) . The same clause that prohibited slavery included a fugitive slave clause , the first recognition by the national government that masters had a right to recover slaves who absconded to northern free states . In addition , the absence of an enforcement clause in the antislavery provision and Congress 's lack of will to implement the Ordinance made it ineffectual . <p> In careful case studies of the measure 's impact in Indiana and Illinois , Finkelman shows that quasi-slavery persisted in the Northwest into the 1830s and 1840s . Congressional indifference to black servitude , demands for labor to promote economic development , arguments that diffusion of slavery foretold slavery 's eventual demise , and the migration of slaveowners into the Northwest conspired to assure that the Ordinance had no immediate impact . The territorial assemblies of Indiana and Illinois adopted laws , based in part on southern slave codes , that assured slavery 's persistence .

In the only detailed consideration of the act in book form , Finkelman argues that the measure was " one of the first fruits of the proslavery Constitution " ( p. 80 ) . He notes that the act issued from an attempt to protect free blacks from kidnapping . Ironically , however , it probably improved the chances of such kidnappings . The Bill of Rights , with its limitations on federal power and procedural protections , had become part of the Constitution in 1791 , yet the act did not honor the amendments ' requirements for fair trials and due process . Equally ironic , the measure expanded federal power , probably beyond what the Constitution actually sanctioned . The fugitive slave clause did not delegate power to Congress ; it was in the only section of Article IV that did not grant power to the national government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' use of national power on economic issues , effectively used that power to protect and preserve slavery . Most slave owners and slave traders were Jeffersonians , but whatever their constitutional scruples on other matters , they wanted broad national powers to protect slavery . The Constitution was conditioned on protecting slavery ; perhaps it was only logical that the same condition be imposed on its interpretation . Such an interpretation , Finkelman concludes , " made the Constitution even more proslavery than it perhaps was " ( p. 81 ) . <p> In addition to arguing that slavery was central to the nation 's founding , he also asserts that it created a " tension between the professed ideals of America , as stated in the Declaration of Independence , and the reality of early national America " ( p. ix ) . No one reflected that tension better than Thomas Jefferson . In spite of the ideals that he expressed in the Declaration , Jefferson was a slaveholder--simply a slaveholder--with general slaveholder values . Rhetorically , Finkelman notes , Jefferson hated slavery , but that hatred was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcend class and race or to honor the principles of his Declaration . He hated slavery because he despised blacks ; they were , Jefferson believed , of a different order from whites . " Race , more than their status as slaves , doomed blacks to permanent inequality " ( p. 108 ) . He hated slavery because it brought Africans to the nation and made them permanent residents . He hated slavery because of its impact on whites , not because of what it did to blacks . <p> Above all , for one who affirmed independence to be the ultimate political and social value and one who celebrated the yeoman farmer for his independence , Jefferson hated slavery because it made him dependent on his slaves ; dedicating his life to independence , he lived a life of dependency . Finkelman argues that Jefferson could not continue his " extravagant life-style " without slaves ( p. 107 ) . The natural rights of slaves had to be subordinated to his grand style of living , his unrestrained spending habits and his compulsively acquisitive character . He contends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotes about slavery : " We have the wolf by the ear , and we can neither hold him , nor safely let him go . Justice is in one scale , and self-preservation in the other . " The quote , Finkelman argues , did not reflect fears of a slave revolt . The self-preservation to which Jefferson alluded went to his way of life , premised as it was on slavery . The " wolf " he was holding was probably " the wolf of gluttony and greed " ( p. 150 ) . <p> The Declaration and Constitution had powerful antislavery potential and , given his status in the new nation 's history , Jefferson could have energized that potential . Finkelman contends that the test for Jefferson 's views on slavery should not be whether he was better " than the worst of his generation but whether he was the leader of the best , " not whether he embodied the values of southern planters , but whether he transcended his economic and sectional interests . In both cases , Finkelman concludes that " Jefferson fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he argues , Jefferson was behind his time . He sold slaves and broke up families to preserve his high-living style and to pay his debts ; after a shopping spree in France , he sold eighty-five slaves ( p. 150 ) . Morally , Finkelman implies , he was also a laggard . For all the debate about Jefferson 's relationship with Sally Hemings , his half-sister-in-law , scholars have missed a more critical issue than whether Hemings bore him children : " for most of his adult life , Jefferson enslaved a generation of people--Sally Hemings and her siblings--who were his in-laws . " This causes Finkelman to wonder whether it mattered " for the sake of character ... whether Jefferson enslaved his own children or merely his blood relatives and his wife 's blood relatives " ( p. 142 ) . <p> Rhetorically , Jefferson insisted that future generations must end slavery and vindicate the hopes of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution for liberty . Unfortunately , however , instead of nurturing their potential for liberating slaves , Jefferson committed treason to the very cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , but only on the condition of " expatriation " of the slaves ( p. 128 ) . It was not simply slavery that Jefferson found so repugnant , but race . The one , a temporary status created by law , could be ended ; the other , a reflection of a sub-human or nearly sub-human species , could not be . The " all " men in the Declaration meant " only white men ; " in his scale of values blacks had no legitimate place in the nation 's future . If slavery trumped the Constitution , race trumped the future that Jefferson envisioned . Instead of being a prophetic voice for extending benefits of the Revolution to slaves , by word and deed he became " the intellectual godfather of the racist pseudoscience of the American school of anthropology " ( p. 110 ) . <p> Finkelman 's work has a compelling ring of plausibility , even truth , when placed in its larger historical context . Edmund S. Morgan demonstrated that before colonial America moved " toward the republic , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He noted that race-based slavery made it safer to preach equality , because slaves could not become part of a leveling mob . He continued , " This is not to say that a belief in republican equality had to rest on slavery , but only that in Virginia ( and probably in other southern colonies ) it did . " 1 And in its move " toward the republic , " to use Morgan 's phrase , Gordon S. Wood observed that " No political conception was more important to Americans in the entire Revolutionary era than representation . " 2 Strategically , slaveowners probably could not have done better than using the three-fifths clause to link their race-based institution with the key political ideal of the Revolution . Central to the Revolutionary movement against England as early as the 1765 Stamp Act controversy , representation was yoked by slaveowners to protecting and preserving slavery in the Constitution . In the 1760s Americans linked representation to liberty ; twenty years later , they joined it to slavery , an unholy alliance that continued into the Civil War era . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it threatened to trump the Constitution 's " more perfect Union " in 1860-61 . <p> Referring to the concentration of slaves " in the southern part " of the Union in his second inaugural , Abraham Lincoln noted that " these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest . " " Peculiar " implies something unique , distinctive , out of the ordinary or particular . However peculiar slavery became in the last few decades before the Civil War , it had long been a " powerful interest , " to use Lincoln 's phrase , but was far from being peculiar . Echoing the notion of its peculiarity , Kenneth M. Stampp described slavery as The Peculiar Institution in his classic 1956 work . But in spite of the " peculiarity " that developed in the second quarter of the nineteenth century , slavery 's power threatened the Union like nothing before or since . It is very difficult , if not impossible , to explain how a sectional , peculiar institution could have so seriously imperiled the Union without having had a determining , if tragic role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book focuses on slavery 's shaping power--but lack of peculiarity--at the Constitutional Convention . <p> Race-based slavery was a fatal flaw in the 1787 document ; that flaw was so inextricably ingrained in the Constitution that it took the terrible scourge of war and major constitutional amendments to remove it . " All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war , " Lincoln affirmed in his second inaugural . Likewise , all who wanted to remove the war 's cause and the Constitution 's corruption knew that amendments to correct the flaws of 1787 had to become part of the Constitution . If slavery began about 1660 and ended , at least officially , in the 1860s , Finkelman provides a powerful and poignant perspective on slavery 's terrible career at its midpoint in the nation 's experience . In addition , he provides a sharp focus from which to examine slavery 's larger impact in American history and to consider the role of the nation 's most famous revolutionary leader , Thomas Jefferson . <p> In his 1963 volume , Jefferson and Civil Liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion about Jefferson 's legacy to freedom and liberty . Finkelman challenges that legacy at an even deeper level than did Levy . He notes that Jefferson 's admirers " would like him to be one of us--an opponent of slavery , " but he was not ( p. 138 ) . Most of Jefferson 's biographers have tried to shape Jefferson into an antislavery liberal , ignoring or fudging evidence to the contrary . He observes that critics of Levy 's Darker Side work rejected his conclusions because such verdicts did not " bolster their modern political agendas " ( p. 143 ) . Very likely Finkelman 's assessment of Jefferson will also be challenged on grounds of being presentist revisionism . Finkelman , however , rightly rejects that notion in his concluding chapter , a brilliant essay on Jefferson , historians , and myths . He examines Jefferson 's ideas about race and slavery , not by modern notions , but " on his terms " ( p. 145 , emphasis in the original ) . <p> By raising the issue of presentism , Finkelman puts in sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps understandably , he insists that it does . However , he is cautious about how history might be used . He notes that James Parton , Jefferson 's first professional biographer , wrote that " If Jefferson was wrong , America is wrong . If America is right , Jefferson was right , " and observes that " The historian who questions Jefferson , it would seem , implicitly questions America " ( p. 143 ) . Acceptance of this logic presents the nation with a daunting challenge that probably could never be satisfactorily met . At the conclusion of his analysis of the way that revolutionary Virginians linked racism with republican ideology , Edmund Morgan raised a haunting question : " Is America still colonial Virginia writ large ? More than a century after Appomattox the question lingers. " 3 <p> If Parton 's logic controls , it forces one of several conclusions . First , accepting Parton 's presumption that Jefferson was right , it reinforces the inclination of most of Jefferson 's modern biographers to shape Jefferson into a late-twentieth-century , antislavery liberal . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can at best be a gross distortion of the historical record . It would transform Jefferson into a reverse modern doughface . A " doughface " in pre-Civil War America was a northern man whose contours had been shaped by proslavery principles , so a reverse doughface would be a southern man with antislavery sentiments . Bingo ! Jefferson fits the picture and gives a usable past . On another occasion , using the same tactic , he becomes the Revolutionary precursor to the National Association of Manufacturers . But if such is the case , history is little more than using the past , indeed , inventing the past , for present needs . <p> Second , Parton 's logic and presumption that Jefferson was right , if applied to Finkelman 's analysis of Jefferson 's principles , force a troubling , haunting answer to Morgan 's question : there would be no escaping the assertion that America is still colonial Virginia writ large . They carry an even more haunting implication : not only is the nation colonial Virginia writ large , but there is not much anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if Finkelman 's analysis of his attitudes about race and slavery are correct , then Jefferson was not only the intellectual vanguard of the pseudoscientific proslavery argument of the pre-Civil War era , but he was also the prophet for late-twentieth-century racism in the United States . If such is the case , either history must be the new " dismal science " or both Jefferson and America are wrong . <p> But Finkelman insists that a third option exists . Scholars have created " a mythical man--someone who in Merrill Peterson 's words went up to Mount Olympus . " After creating the Jeffersonian myth , they " further burdened him with an image that carries with it our conception of the United States " ( p. 167 ) . But as Levy did in 1963 , Finkelman does in 1996 : he argues that it is time to look at Jefferson as an important Revolutionary leader , a person with virtues and faults . From this perspective , Jefferson 's views on race " are embarrassing , not just by the standards of our age but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . However , though Jefferson failed to join the best of his generation to end slavery and challenge racism , it is possible to see his virtues and the power of his ideas " because we will see them in the context of his own humanity " ( p. 167 ) . <p> Put differently , if history is important , at least one element of that importance has to be the insights that it offers . But if those insights , or perspectives , are to be valid , it is important that scholars give heed to the full weight of historical evidence . Precisely because history seems to offer insights and perspectives on the present , it becomes a battleground--often a heated one--on what we remember and what we forget . History creates a common memory that holds individuals and institutions together and binds them in a common enterprise . " Selective " forgetting can distort the past as much as creative invention . To question Jefferson 's ideas about slavery and racism is not to question America . To question Jefferson is to follow the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of preserving the best ones , reforming others , and rebelling against the rest . <p> Perhaps no better instruction exists for that daunting task than using " Experience , " a notion that figures prominently in Jefferson 's Declaration of Independence . However , if that experience is derived--another good Jeffersonian term from the Declaration--from a contrived past , it would convey misguided perspectives , perhaps as pernicious in their impact as those derived from abstract reasoning . If Jefferson has relevance to modern America on race and slavery , it is not because he stood outside of history by ascending Mt . Olympus , but because he was a major historical figure who continues to inform the present . Our image of Jefferson matters but , in insisting on his humanity , " we can better understand something about ourselves and our country 's past " ( p. 167 ) . <p> Rhetorically , Jefferson looked to slavery 's end at some undefined future . Tragically , it was left to Lincoln 's generation to begin ending slavery and to start " binding up the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " terrible war " that Lincoln memorialized at Gettysburg has passed , but the quest for that " new birth of freedom " and the realization of the Jeffersonian " proposition that all men are created equal , " remain " unfinished work , " to use Lincoln 's memorable phrases . Perhaps that unfinished work is at the heart of any shared memory and common enterprise for late-twentieth-century Americans . If it is , then it seems imperative that a precise definition of that work be carefully limned . History is important to Finkelman--vitally important--so in writing this volume he assumed that it was an imperative to be careful and precise . <p> By some standards , Finkelman 's is a slim volume . The text is only 167 pages , supported by extensive notes and bibliography . More important , his is a compelling account of the history of slavery and racism at the nation 's founding and of Jefferson 's place in that history .

With Nashville , Tennessee , already in Union hands , the South lost not only its largest city and one of it most valuable ports , but an irreplaceable stock of men , ships , and supplies for the defense of the Mississippi River . The loss of New Orleans also continued the hemorrhaging of cities and troops that resulted in the end of Confederate control of the Mississippi Valley by 1863 . In less than six weeks , Memphis , Tennessee , fell , leaving only Vicksburg and Port Hudson under Confederate authority on the river . Fourteen months after the fall of New Orleans , these last two Confederate strongholds fell to the Union army , and the Mississippi River was under Federal domination . <p> Although the strategic importance of New Orleans near the Gulf of Mexico appears obvious to most students of the war , the Rebel high command believed that the major threat to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Navy Stephen R.

Twiggs to take command of the military forces in the state , and Commodore Lawrence Rosseau was sent to build and command the naval force . At that time , the city 's defense consisted of two masonry forts located seventy miles downriver . These works , Forts Jackson and St. Philip , were armed with antiquated smooth-bore cannons , and neither one was in any condition to resist and repel an invasion .

Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles appreciated the strategic importance of the city and the lower Mississippi . Northern intelligence was aware of the numerous fortifications the Confederates were constructing south of Cairo , Illinois , on the Mississipp , and they appreciated the problems they faced in the approach to New Orleans from either upriver or downriver .

While Confederate authorities struggled to build their river defense fleet and refurbish the old forts , Secretary Welles approved a plan that included constructing and outfitting a fleet of specially built mortar-bearing schooners . This innovative idea belonged to Commander Porter , who probably knew the lower Mississippi better than any other Union naval officer . Porter 's plan called for Farragut 's fleet to dash up the river after his mortar fleet had pounded the Confederate forts into submission , and then effect capture of the city . <p> The Union blockade grew stronger as each side worked to bring their forces and plans into action .

A well-organized and directed attack by the Confederates at this time could have wreaked havoc on the Union fleet . Yet the Southern commanders seemed paralyzed , and they failed to make the bold stroke demanded by the crisis they faced .

In this edition Worden analyses events in South Africa up to the election of 1999 . He also includes new material published since 1990 . <p> The reason for the success of the book is easy to explain as it is highly readable , balanced and concise .

In the process it also offers a handy overview of the latest historical scholarship on South Africa . <p> The strength of The making of modern South Africa , and one of the reasons for its success , is that it avoids the pitfalls of so many South African historical surveys of the past , the mind-numbing blow by blow descriptions of the Great Trek , the Boer War , or of white party politics and parliamentary elections .

Another shortcoming of the book is that Worden ignores the works of Afrikaner historians who played such a crucial role mobilising Afrikaner nationalism and bolstering and justifying apartheid . This is a surprising omission as Afrikaner historiography had a powerful influence , determining the content of school textbooks way into the 1990s . <p> These shortcomings , however , do not detract from the overall value of The making of modern South Africa .

Comparable in scale to Nat Turner 's slave rebellion nearly a century earlier , the revolt was responsible for the killings of dozens of white farmers and ranchers in south Texas and stimulated a bloody reaction that claimed the lives of untold Mexicans . According to the Plan , the ultimate goal of the insurrectionists was to return the American Southwest to Mexico by force . The failed revolt was the last armed conflict in the struggle over the U.S.-Mexican border , a struggle that dated back to 1846 and the U.S.-Mexican War . <p> Benjamin Heber Johnson , an assistant professor of history at Southern Methodist University , has written the first book-length treatment of the Plan de San Diego in over a decade . Revolution in Texas began as Johnson 's Yale Ph.D . dissertation , but it has been deeply revised . <p> Johnson 's book is first and foremost a brilliant narrative of the Plan de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hooks readers with the story of the uprising but weaves in historical context and analysis in a way that should satisfy scholars while not alienating general readers . His argument about what the Plan de San Diego meant--both to Mexicans living in South Texas and to the course of American history in general--is fascinating , compelling , and sure to provoke debate and discussion for years to come . <p> Revolution in Texas will be of interest to legal historians primarily for Johnson 's attention to the wave of lynching and vigilantism that swept through South Texas after 1915 . Johnson convincingly demonstrates that this extralegal violence hastened the declining status of Tejanos ( Texas Mexicans ) in south Texas . The number of Mexicans killed in what Walter Prescott Webb called an " orgy of bloodshed " is hard to comprehend . Johnson himself estimates the number in the " low thousands " ( p. 120 ) . Thousands more left Texas for Mexico , some never to return . The explicit goal of some of the vigilantes , and the sure result of their campaign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo hands . Moreover , Anglos in the wake of the Plan de San Diego imposed voting restrictions and systematic segregation in south Texas for the first time . Texas Mexicans , Johnson leaves no doubt , paid a steep price for their failed revolt . This story--how extralegal violence and other forms of intimidation helped strip Mexicans of their lands--has never been told so well or so convincingly . <p> Mob violence against Mexicans gets too little attention from historians , and scholars of the American South and African American history would be well-served by reading Johnson 's book . The bloody lynchings and racial terrorism described in the book will help one see extralegal violence in the American South from a different perspective . In this regard , I wish that Revolution in Texas had made more comparisons to lynching and vigilantism in other parts of the United States . For example , I would have liked to read more about how the vigilantism of South Texas differed from contemporary violence against blacks . The role of the legally sanctioned Texas Rangers in so much of the extralegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel in Georgia or Mississippi . The Texas Rangers did more than wink at , or tolerate , lynchings orchestrated by private citizens . They took an active , persistent leadership role , and at times hanged and shot Mexicans against the wishes of the local Anglo citizenry . Studying mob violence against Mexicans is sure to complicate our understanding of extralegal violence and continue the debate initiated by Christopher Waldrep over how one defines lynching . <p> There are other fascinating issues in this book beyond the vigilantism that followed the Plan de San Diego . The most original and controversial component of Johnson 's argument is his claim that the Plan de San Diego " turned Mexicans into Americans . " This argument will be of interest to those legal scholars interested in issues of immigration and citizenship . Johnson posits that Tejanos emerged in the 1920s identifying themselves as United States citizens and distancing themselves from the nation , if not the culture of , Mexico . Johnson says that this change can be traced to an influential group of progressive Tejanos who reevaluated their commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego . The bloody suppression of the uprising by Texas Rangers and vigilantes combined with the failures of the Mexican government led these leaders to conclude , ironically , that resistance to white racism and prejudice would best be accomplished by pursuing citizenship and equal rights in the United States . These leaders eventually formed the League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ) , a group Johnson compares to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . After restricting its membership to U.S. citizens , LULAC urged Mexicans to embrace their American roots and identity while simultaneously demanding that the United States live up to the racial and ethnic egalitarianism implicit in the Declaration of Independence . <p> I expect that readers will question the central irony of Johnson 's book . Why did n't the brutal killing spree of 1915 and after lead Mexicans to more closely identify with Mexico rather than the United States ? On this point , Johnson is good at showing how the experience of the early twentieth century left Tejanos frustrated and disappointed with both Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexicans distinguished between the soldiers of the United States army , with whom they sometimes sought protection , and the Texas Rangers , who they saw as murderers and derisively called " rinches . " Distinctions between American ideals and practices , combined with a lack of faith in the Mexican government , helped tilt many Tejanos toward LULAC . <p> Critics will question Johnson 's argument that the decision of LULAC leaders and others to embrace U.S. citizenship was inspired by the belief that the United States could be pressured to live up to its egalitarian ideals . Neil Foley has argued just the opposite , that many Tejano leaders embraced the racism in American society . They sought to focus upon their United States citizenship and their " whiteness " in order to distance themselves from African Americans and thereby protect themselves from the worst ravages of Jim Crow .

Sandos 's research was broad , but his monograph focused on the anarchist influence of Ricardo and Enrique Flores Magon on the uprising .

Johnson finds the " fuse " of the Plan de San Diego not in Mexico or California but in south Texas . He notes that the revolt of 1915 was far from the first major act of resistance by Tejanos . Indeed , Johnson says that " there was something about south Texas that seemed to foster mass insurgencies " ( p. 26 ) . Johnson identified three key factors : the fact that Mexicans were the majority population ; the existence of a large number of Tejano landowners , and the ease of escape provided by the nearby Mexican border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in transnational history will be drawn to Johnson 's work because it both embraces and challenges some of the core concepts of transnational scholarship .

Their interest in US citizenship arose out of their realization that a national identity was critical . <p> Johnson 's research is exhaustive . He has surveyed all of the key depositories in South Texas and has traveled to Mexico as well . His work benefits from a wide array of both Spanish-language and English-language sources . Archival materials , institutional records , newspapers , diplomatic correspondence , government investigations , and oral interviews are all brought to bear with great effectiveness . <p> I will conclude by returning to Johnson 's style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , the graceful writing and brevity of the text ( 211 pages not including notes ) is one of its most important features .

" The Treaty " ( as it is generally known ) not only created the independent Irish Free State and partitioned the island , but it also led to the Irish Civil War and laid the framework for domestic politics on both sides of the border for decades to come . Kevin Matthews 's book , Fatal Influence : The Impact of Ireland on British Politics , 1920-1925 , examines the under-appreciated importance that the Treaty had on political life on the other side of the Irish Sea . While Matthews does focus most of the book on British domestic politics , his work is also very informative about what was happening in Dublin and Belfast at the same time . Indeed , the subtitle of this book could easily have been reversed to The Impact of British Politics on Ireland . <p> Matthews begins by looking at the premiership of David Lloyd George ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political fortunes of Lloyd George 's government . As the head of a Liberal-Conservative coalition born during the First World War , Lloyd George was bound to view Ireland as a delicate subject . Before the war , the " Irish Question " was one of the major issues dividing Britain 's two main parties , with the Conservatives as staunch supporters of the Unionists and the Liberal Party pledged to Home Rule . The coalition government survived the end of the Great War , but the reverberations of the Easter Rising , including the rise of Sinn Fein and the outbreak of the Anglo-Irish War , put Ireland front and center in British postwar politics . This placed great strain on one of the natural fissures of the Liberal-Conservative alliance . <p> According to Matthews , Lloyd George had no strong personal feelings about Ireland . His overriding concern was to settle the Irish situation and thus remove it from British politics . The Government of Ireland Act of 1920 was a failed attempt to come to a peaceful agreement in Ireland . Essentially a re-working of the pre-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliaments in Ireland ; one in Dublin for the Nationalist/Catholic majority , and one in Belfast for the Unionist/Protestant dominated northeast . The act called for the creation of a Council of Ireland linking both parliaments to coordinate issues of joint north-south concern , and theoretically lead to re-unification . Ulster 's Unionists accepted the legislation after some debate about the extent of territory they should claim for the new province of Northern Ireland . Abandoning hope of holding onto all nine Ulster counties , the Unionists settled their claim on the six northeastern counties . This partition was fraught with difficulties , as there was a significant Catholic population in the area , with local Catholic majorities in cities like Derry , as well as the two entire counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone . In the south , Dail Eireann simply ignored the act , as it fought to achieve a republic for all of Ireland . <p> With the IRA 's guerilla campaign in full swing throughout Ireland , Lloyd George was pulled in opposite directions by the two elements of his coalition . The Conservatives wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , were upset with the increasingly ruthless , albeit unsuccessful , nature of the " police action " waged by the Black and Tan and Auxiliary units of the Royal Irish Constabulary . In July 1921 , Lloyd George reversed his no-negotiation strategy and called for talks with Dail Eireann 's president , Eamon de Valera . Matthews argues that Lloyd George 's determination to end the Anglo-Irish War arose from the continued strength shown by Sinn Fein in the Irish election of 1921 , the fact that the security forces seemed unable to defeat the IRA , and , perhaps most importantly , from the need to keep his own coalition in one piece . The prime minister hoped that by bringing peace and stability to long-troubled Ireland , he would be able to meld his fractious coalition into a new political entity , the Centre Party , which would cement his hold on power in Great Britain . <p> The basic story of the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty is as Well known as it is controversial . ( De Valera 's refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Collins to lead the Irish delegation ; the intense debates over Dominion status verses an Irish Republic and the issue of partition ; and the reluctant acceptance of the Treaty by the Irish after Lloyd George all threatened to end the truce and launch full-scale war , and ultimately split Sinn Fein . ) Matthews does an admirable job of recounting the narrative , but Fatal Influence breaks new ground by examining the negotiations through the lens of British politics . While Lloyd George was a duplicitous negotiator , it was not Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith who were his chief victims . The author contends that in his desire to get the Irish republicans to accept the Treaty , Lloyd George crafted a document that was meant to force Northern Ireland to seek reunification with the south while still appearing to give the Unionists what they wanted . Although the Treaty allowed Northern Ireland to stay within the United Kingdom by opting out of the Irish Free State , the province would be under serious economic constraints if it chose that option . As a Dominion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to the pre-existing U.K. debt . Northern Ireland , under the terms of the Government of Ireland Act , would not only have to pay its own local expenses from its own local taxes , it would also have to make an " imperial contribution " to Great Britain . Northern Ireland would be further undermined by Article XII of the Treaty , which called for a Boundary Commission to adjust the inter-Irish border by taking account of the wishes of local populations and economic conditions . While Northern Ireland 's prime minister , Sir James Craig , denounced the Treaty , most of his Conservative allies in the coalition supported the agreement . <p> However , Lloyd George 's triumph was short-lived , for , as Matthews makes clear , the Treaty was in fact the political undoing of the coalition . The pro-Unionist " Die-hards " in the Conservative Party would not be reconciled to an agreement that they saw as a sell-out to Sinn Fein and a threat to Northern Ireland . Unfortunately for the pro-Treaty politicians in Britain , the Irish Civil War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem that the Treaty had not created a stable Irish settlement . Andrew Bonar Law renounced his earlier support of the Treaty and led the Conservatives out of the coalition and into a victory in the next general election . Lloyd George would never again be the resident of Number 10 Downing Street . <p> While Bonar Law did not attempt to rescind the Treaty , Matthews shows that he did dramatically change the implementation of the Treaty in order to protect the six-county statelet of Northern Ireland . Bonar Law facilitated James Craig 's attempts to escape from the financial trap laid by the Treaty . Craig had been demanding , with limited success , British funding for the Special Constables of the RUC , a reduction in the imperial contribution , and assistance in paying Northern Ireland 's unemployment claims since before Bonar Law replaced Lloyd George . Matthews concludes that under the new prime minister , " the Treaty 's Ulster clauses , especially those designed to bring about economic pressure on Northern Ireland , had largely been rendered impotent . This change marked a blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might never have taken place but for the return of Bonar Law to politics " ( p.110 ) . <p> Bonar Law resigned in May 1923 due to i 'll health and was succeeded by Stanley Baldwin . As a Conservative member of the Lloyd George coalition , Baldwin had backed the Treaty . Politically , Ireland was an issue that he would have liked to ignore as he attempted to reconcile the pro- and anti-Treaty wings of the party . However , the Free State government of William Cosgrave was putting pressure on London to start the work of the Boundary Commission . Baldwin successfully stalled Cosgrave , and before the Conservatives had to come to grips with Article XII , they lost the general election of 1923 and Labour formed a new government with Liberal Party backing . <p> Matthews demonstrates how this temporary setback turned out to be a serendipitous long-term win for the Conservatives , as Labour tackled the Irish Question for them . As the first Labour Party prime minister , James Ramsay MacDonald had other issues besides Ireland on his agenda , but he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally anti-Irish Catholic MacDonald moved forward not out of sympathy with the Free State , but to demonstrate that the Labour Party could govern in a responsible manner and meet Britain 's legal commitments . The major stumbling block to Article XII was that Craig refused to name Northern Ireland 's member to the three-person commission specified by the Treaty . MacDonald forged ahead by calling for special legislation by Parliament to enable the British government to name Belfast 's commissioner itself , and thus begin the process of assessing the border . <p> Labour 's fortitude in the face of Ulster 's intransigence put the Conservative Party in a dangerous position . The " Die-hard , " pro-Unionist faction of the party wanted to fight the legislation to eliminate the danger of Northern Ireland losing any territory . This prospect frightened Stanley Baldwin , who feared a re-opening of old wounds in his party . He particularly dreaded the prospect that the " Die-hards " would turn to the House of Lords to delay or amend the bill . This would give Labour , which was struggling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a chance to call a general election and run as the party of the common people versus the party of aristocratic privilege . Baldwin pulled off a neat balancing act by getting the majority of Conservatives to support the bill , while announcing that his party would fight any transfer of territory that was unacceptable to Ulster . With Ireland safely removed as a campaign issue , the Conservative Party won a smashing victory in the 1924 general election , the results of which also destroyed the Liberal Party as a major player in British politics . For Ireland , the election results meant that a powerful Conservative government would launch the Boundary Commission . <p> In December 1924 , the Boundary Commission began its work with predictable results . In September 1925 , the British-named chairman , Richard Feetham , informed the hapless Irish delegate , Eoin MacNeill , that he did not believe that Article XII empowered the Commission to make any whole-sale transfer of territory and that the Free State might be called upon to give land to Northern Ireland . When the final report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of the border , was leaked to the press it caused Dublin to ask that the official report be quelled , as it would play into the hands of Cosgrave 's republican opponents . In a rare example of cooperation between the two Irish governments , Craig and Cosgrave suggested that , as a salve to the Free State 's political wound , Article V of the Treaty be negated . This section of the document called for the Free State to pay a share of the United Kingdom 's existing national debt . For Cosgrave , this concession would save his cash-strapped government money and provide it with some badly needed nationalist credentials , by cutting another tie between the Free State and Britain . Craig believed that any action that changed the financial elements of the Treaty could only help his own claims on the British Treasury . In addition , Craig and Cosgrave agreed to replace the Council of Ireland provision of the Treaty with informal meetings between the two Irish cabinets . Baldwin agreed , happy to be rid of the troublesome " Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed up with a note from a trusted civil servant : " S.B. asked me to keep these from his sight--and from everyone else 's " ( p. 240 ) . <p> Despite hopes to the contrary , Matthew 's concludes that " the settlement fashioned between 1920 and 1925 did not resolve the Irish Question so much as sweep it to one side " ( p. 242 ) . The inherently unstable Unionist/Nationalist mixture in Northern Ireland exploded into the modern " Troubles " in 1969 , dragging a new generation of British politicians into the Irish thicket . <p> Matthews 's main focus in the book is British politics , but he also examines the performance of the major Irish leaders , both Unionist and Nationalist . Fatal Influence credits Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith with not only achieving the best deal that could have been had in 1921 , but also with having a real concern for Irish unity . As they understood the Treaty , the financial burden on Ulster and a realistic redrawing of the border would have made Northern Ireland an untenable entity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been credible critics of the readjusting of the spirit of the Treaty after 1922 . Of course both men died in 1922 , although Matthew 's admits that there is no guarantee that their survival would have changed the course of the history of partition . <p> The Free State government of William T. Cosgrave comes in for much more criticism . While Matthews sees Cosgrave as having been on the right side of the Treaty debate in Ireland , he was not an effective advocate for the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland or a real champion of re-unification . More interested in demonstrating that the Free State was a sovereign government than in re-unification , Cosgrave 's concern for the north was mainly sparked by a desire not to be politically outflanked by de Valera and the Sinn Fein . The apparent permanence of partition after 1925 was not a real concern in Dublin as the government could concentrate on creating a Gaelic-Catholic state without the awkward presence of a million Protestants . Cosgrave never even made an attempt to convene the type of north-south cabinet meeting that Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Cosgrave , Matthews lambastes Eamon de Valera . He claims that the republican leader , to a greater extent than his Free State opponents , cynically exploited public concern for northern Nationalists while never having any intention of working for re-unification . De Valera found partition a convenient rhetorical issue to win support for the creation of Fianna Fail and attack Cosgrave , but in practice he too concentrated on forging a fully sovereign , Catholic confessional state in the southern twenty-six counties . <p> The most successful Irish leader in Fatal Influence is Northern Ireland 's premier Sir James Craig . Although Matthew 's points out that the Unionist mini-state that Craig did so much to defend was bound to disintegrate , as it did in 1972 , he achieved all of his short-term goals in the 1920s . Northern Ireland kept all six of its counties and Belfast , with the connivance of the Conservative Party , wriggled out of the financial trap set by the Treaty . <p> On the whole , Fatal Influence provides students of both British and Irish history with a valuable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty . Supported by impressive archival research , Matthews admirably succeeds in proving his main thesis , namely that Irish issues were still of vital importance in domestic British politics even after 1921 . His take on the negotiation of the Treaty is also insightful , in that he clearly shows how Lloyd George 's actions were motivated more by his ultimately doomed plan to create a new political party and less with the nature of Ireland 's relations with Britain . The collapse of the Liberal-Conservative coalition and the subsequent destruction of the Liberal party were not only monumental events in British political history , but also profoundly affected Ireland . The Conservative Party under Bonar Law and Baldwin , anxious to make amends for ever having supported the Treaty , insured that the components of the Treaty meant to promote re-unification were nullified . Partition became the new reality in Ireland : celebrated and grimly defended in Belfast , impotently ( and perhaps disingenuously ) denounced in Dublin , and ignored in London , until the outbreak of the Troubles began to reshape that reality .

The book works on many levels : it is a study of candomble , the Afro-Brazilian religion of Bahia , of the role of women in candomble , and of race relations in Brazil , but it is also much more . The City of Women has much to offer anyone interested in Brazilian history , comparative race and gender relations , the history of anthropology , and the relationships between researcher and subject in anthropology and oral history . Sally Cole 's excellent introduction , " Ruth Landes in Brazil : Writing , Race , and Gender in 1930s American Anthropology , " places Landes and her work in the context of the history of anthropology , outlines Landes 's biography and the responses to her book , and helps to draw out some of Landes 's most important points . <p> According to Cole , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention they deserved . At the time the book was published , influential anthropologists raised questions about Landes 's arguments on gender roles in candomble , on the origins of Afro-Brazilian religions , and about her " methods and personal comportment in the field " ( Cole in Landes , 1992 : xxi ) . Roger Bastide , one of her few supporters , wrote that The City of Women was " one of only two books that give an adequate idea of the dense , teeming , vitality " of candomble , but that Landes presented " a feminine view of the candombles which is in keeping with the aggressive self-affirmation of North American women " ( Bastide , 1978 : 221 ) . It was hardly an overwhelming endorsement . Recent research on candomble largely supports Landes 's findings that women were central to the candomble hierarchy and that men who allowed themselves to be possessed by the spirits were often homosexuals ( Cole in Landes , 1992 : xxii ) . But her ideas met with such opposition during most of her career that she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she received her Ph.D . ( Cole in Landes , 1992 : xxviii ) . <p> Ironically , the same characteristics that made Landes and The City of Women controversial in the past make her work particularly interesting today . The questions that she explored about race and gender , about the relationship between researcher and research subject , and about the role of history in the formation of cultures have emerged as important ones in both history and anthropology . And the same methodology which got her into trouble when the book was published--openly discussing her own experiences in the field--enable us to see why she made the arguments about race and gender that she did and keep the text fresh almost fifty years after it was first published . <p> Landes 's ideas about candomble do not appear controversial now , but they were when she published her book . She argued that candomble was a complex , organized , and structured set of beliefs and practices that provided emotional , cultural , and economic support to impoverished Afro-Brazilians , that Bahia 's traditional candombles were matriarchies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race intersected in complex ways in Brazil ( Landes , 1992:248 ) . Because of the importance of women in traditional candomble , this Afro-Brazilian religion was incompatible with patriarchy ( Landes , 1992:148 ) . Possession by the gods , the central component of the religious practice , was the domain of women : men supported the candomble temples financially , but did not run them ( Landes , 1992:37 ) . Consensual unions were more common than formal marriages and sexual relations were what many Brazilians and Americans would have considered promiscuous ( Landes , 1992:147-48 ) . Landes believed that candomble gave Afro-Brazilian women power and status not granted to their white sisters and that these powerful women were among Brazil 's most important social resources ( Landes , 1992:248 ) . <p> Landes also showed that Brazil 's Afro-Brazilian religions were not seamless , unchanging , cultural legacies of an African past , but dynamic , living expressions of Brazil 's past and its present . To support her arguments she not only discussed the history of candomble and slavery in Brazil , but showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a new group of Afro-Brazilian cults , called " caboclo cults , " was developing . These groups , according to Landes , were radically new because they allowed men , usually homosexuals , to be possessed by spirits--a role traditionally restricted to women . Traditional practitioners of candomble considered these caboclo cults " upstarts . " <p> Landes 's arguments about race relations were less controversial at the time . She argued that notions of race in Brazil were very different from those in the United States and in Germany . She maintained that class not race was the basis of discrimination in Brazil , showing herself to be influenced by Gilberto Freyre and others who believed Brazil to be a racial democracy . Arguments about Brazilian racial democracy have been contested since the 1960s ( da Costa , 1985 ) . But Landes 's work demonstrates clearly why Brazilian and foreign scholars alike could have believed that Brazilians did not discriminate against each other along racial lines , because she contrasts what the Brazilians she met thought with what she thought , with what many Americans thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her research at a time when American society was highly segregated , when lynching was not uncommon , and when studies of race relations in the United States and U.S. /Brazilian studies were in early stages . Gilberto Freyre 's work was new : at Columbia , where Landes had studied , anthropologists were excited by the possibility that there was a place where the " large Negro population lived with ease and freedom among the general population " ( Landes , 1992:1 ) . To prepare her for life and work in Brazil , her supervisors at Columbia sent Landes to Fisk University , a historically black college in Tennessee , to " teach , to study the library collection and to ' get used to Negroes ' " ( Landes , 1992:2 ) . At Fisk she came to know African Americans who , although highly educated and erudite , suffered discrimination because of their race and saw the world divided into blacks and whites ( Landes , 1992:4 ) . Arriving in Brazil she also met Americans from the south who were vocal in their racism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazism . She found Brazilian ideas about race much more fluid , and thus came to believe that Brazilians did not discriminate on the basis of race . <p> The strategy Landes used to present her evidence was one of the controversial elements of her work--but it is also what has kept her work fresh . The study placed the author , her friends , and her contacts squarely in the middle of the research , and brought the reader along through the research process . She shared her experiences with the reader as she traveled from New York to Nashville to Rio de Janeiro to Salvador Bahia , from universities and mansions to the streets and shacks and candombles of Salvador 's poor black neighborhoods in the 1930s . In the process she showed us how the people she studied viewed their world , each other , and the foreigner who was studying them , as well as how others viewed them . But she also showed us how she viewed her research , how she made contact with her subjects , and how the experience changed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the book is very simple , but a look at the way she constructed her argument on comparative race relations shows that it is , rather , very complex . Landes used several kinds of evidence to support her ideas on comparative race relations . She admitted that most anthropologists in the United States at that time knew absolutely nothing about African American populations or Brazil . She discussed the work of the few scholars who were informed , either African Americans teaching at Fisk University or Brazilians like Gilberto Freyre and Edison Carneiro . She introduced conversations with Afro-Brazilians , with African Americans , with members of the American community in Bahia , and with the Nazis whom she meets ( Landes , 1992:13-14 ) . She shows that the practitioners of candomble and the scholars who studied them were persecuted as communists under Getulio Vargas 's Estado Novo . And she used her own experiences as a woman in Brazil to show that " respectable " white women had less freedom than did any other group of people with whom she came in contact . She emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not live alone , did not dine alone , and did not study candombles at all ( Landes , 1992:12-13 ) . She admitted that she needed a man to serve as her escort in Salvador and that it was not until Edison Carneiro began to fulfill that role that she was free to visit the candombles and interview the people involved in them . By the close of the book it is very clear why she came to the conclusions she did , and she is quite persuasive . <p> All of this should not be taken to mean that Landes 's work is without its shortcomings--it is not . While some aspects of the work are refreshingly new , others are disturbingly dated . Her terminology of race is marked by terms prevalent in 1930s America ; consequently she discusses Negroes even though she mentions that Afro-Bahian or African were the terms in most use in Bahia at the time . More importantly , she ignores clear evidence of racial prejudice among Brazilians : in New York , Rio de Janeiro , and Bahia she met Brazilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her descriptions of successful people of African descent , like Edison Carneiro , make it clear that there was a relationship between skin color and social mobility--elites appear to have been of mixed racial background while the poor seemed to be completely African . While notions about race in Brazil were different than they were in the United States at the time , racial prejudice did exist--she largely ignores the evidence of racism and its implications . <p> Despite this criticism The City of Women stands the test of time . And methodologically it is very instructive : for Landes makes it abundantly clear that her scholarly arguments are the result of a combination of training , research , and personal experience . For these reasons The City of Women ought to be on the " must read " list of anyone preparing to do field research , especially in ethnography or oral history , in a culture different from his or her own . <p> CITATIONS <p> Bastide , Roger .

In the introductory chapter , Brown first sets the scene that will later play an important role in Wabi 's life : a Buddhist nunnery ( samnak ) in a small village in the province of Ratburi , seventy-five miles southwest of Bangkok . In the first chapter , Brown further sets the stage by exploring the events that contributed to Maechi Wabi 's decision to become a nun , from her childhood interest in meditation to the events surrounding her father 's decision to become a monk and the oppressive effects that his decision had on Wabi 's lay life . <p> In the second chapter , Brown moves from a more focused examination of Wabi 's life to a more general look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how those prejudices affect contemporary maechi . Here , Brown assesses the status of women renouncers in comparison to their male counterparts by looking at how certain segments of the Thai population regard and understand women who choose to " go forth . " In examining the history of maechi in Thailand , Brown turns to the events surrounding the establishment of the Institute of Thai Maechi which is made up of maechi from all over Thailand . In this chapter , Brown considers the relative inability of the Institute to accord maechi similar rights as monks as well as the degree to which the " maechi " category may be considered a suitable substitute for the order of fully ordained nuns ( bhikkhuni ) . <p> Chapters 3 through 7 examine Maechi Wabi 's early experiences as a renouncer . In chapter 3 , for instance , Brown looks at how Wabi became associated with another maechi who ran her own samnak in rural Thailand , Seni . Of particular interest for Brown is the " crisis of faith " that Wabi undergoes during her early years : from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seni 's samnak to Wabi 's crisis in meditation that occurred when she undertook an intensive retreat . In these chapters , Brown is especially keen in showing how Wabi uses a Buddhist framework ( e.g. , the doctrine of karma , past lives , and impermanence ) to make sense of her experiences as well as the role that meditation plays in allowing her access to her feelings . <p> Chapters 8 through 10 focus on the ways in which Wabi resolved her " crisis . " Examining how Wabi reestablishes her " faith " through her exploration of other ways of living as a maechi , Brown focuses on the events surrounding Wabi 's decision to join the Dhammacarini Samnak , the first Buddhist school for girls in Thailand . Dhammacarini , unlike the previous " meditation-oriented " samnaks that Wabi had joined , functions to serve society by instilling Buddhist mores and by providing education to women and young girls who have had little access to learning . Brown depicts how it is in her new role as a teacher that Wabi is able to reorient her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the last three chapters , Brown explores how Thai maechi , such as Wabi and those associated with the Institute of Thai Maechi and centers such as Dhammacarini , are creating new roles for female renouncers by blending the " ascetic " role usually associated with forest monks with the nurturing/mothering role normally associated with Thai women . By combining the role of renouncer and care-giver , maechi , according to Brown , are able to " cultivate emotional openness and responsiveness in a way denied to other women who are more enmeshed in human relationships " ( p. 116 ) as well offer other women a safe place to deal with their problems . <p> A major strength of The Journey of One Buddhist Nun is the detailed account Brown gives of one Buddhist nun , Maechi Wabi . While providing a very detailed description of Wabi 's life , it is nonetheless difficult to assess , especially to those less familiar with Thai maechi , the degree to which the voice of one maechi relates to the collective experiences of Thai maechi . While Brown claims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maechi Wabi can mean coming to understand maechi in modern Thailand " ( p. 4 ) , the reader may be left asking whether or not Maechi Wabi 's story is truly paradigmatic . For instance , in chapter 4 Brown notes how " Maechi Wabi 's lack of worldly experience and her poverty set her apart from Maechi Seni and Maechi Mina " ( p. 46 ) . If this is indeed the case , then one may nonetheless question whether focusing on the life experiences of Seni and Mina would portray a very different picture of maechi in Thailand . <p> While Brown acknowledges that there is no one entity that is maechi ( p. 143 ) , she nonetheless argues that finding a case and contextualizing it vigorously is the best way to begin to understand maechi . While there are certain benefits of such a narrowly focused study , providing several case studies and contextualizing , even more widely , the lives of Thai maechi would provide the reader with the necessary background to assess whether or not the generalizations that Brown draws from Wabi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other maechi . Perhaps a less narrowly focused study that may even include a brief comparison between Thai maechi and nuns in other Theravada countries ( such as the dasa sil matavas in Sri Lanka ) would further add to Brown 's important contribution to our understandings of women 's roles in Buddhism . <p> Despite some of the problems inherent in Brown 's assumption that the life of one nun speaks much to the lives of other nuns , the rich details that she provides in terms of Maechi Wabi 's experiences is truly commendable .

He persuasively argues that those phenomena usually associated with deteriorating cities--particularly de-industrialization and white flight--were not " responses " to the urban rebellions and social discord of the 1960s . Rather , they were the structural circumstances which " created " anger and frustration among African American residents and ultimately inspired the red hot summers of the 1960s . De-industrialization and white flight , Sugrue demonstrates , changed the contours of Detroit well before 1967 . In fact , these processes began in full force in the 1940s , and by the 1950s they had already affected the city 's geography and reshaped residents ' understandings of race and urban politics . <p> Sugrue is not the first historian to suggest that the structural roots of urban poverty and inequality precede 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion . He demonstrates that plant closings , automation , chronic waves of unemployment , and the movement of industry to suburban , rural and other hard-to-unionize areas in the late 1940s and 1950s detrimentally effected the economies of urban centers in the North . Furthermore , he shows that neighborhood based struggles against residential integration exploded in these decades , arguing that in order to understand national politics in this era , historians need to spend more time focusing on local struggles . " Housing , " Sugrue explains , " became a major arena for organized political activity in the 1940s , where Detroiters , black and white , fought a battle that would define Detroit politics for decades to follow " ( 55 ) . Sugrue thus attacks the notion implicit in social scientists ' accounts of urban decline that race relations in Northern cities were relatively harmonious before the black power movements and urban rebellions of the 1960s , arguing that explosions of racial antagonism were central to Detroit 's culture as early as the Second World War . <p> Sugrue separates his book into three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Fire . " He uses the first section to lay out the economic , racial , and physical geography of the city in the 1940s and to expose its relationship to electoral politics , arguing that white Detroiters lost confidence in liberalism and the New Deal state as a result of their experiences " defending " their neighborhoods against black homebuyers . While Detroit had far more single family houses than any other large city , and while it was comparatively spread out , overcrowding and a rapidly expanding population put enormous pressure on Detroit 's housing stock by the beginning of the Second World War . No areas were more crowded than black neighborhoods , whose boundaries were far better defined--and enforced--than any other part of the city . This strain forced black residents to push on the geographic constraints imposed on them by greedy landlords and a racist culture . <p> Black Detroiters devised numerous strategies to manage their community 's expansion . Sugrue argues that white Detroiters experienced these tactics as threats to their own economic and social stability . Any suggestion of imminent integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their single most important investment--their house--would become worthless . The redlining practices of the Federal Housing Authority reinforced and reflected white homowner 's anxieties , for the FHA refused to insure mortgage loans to improve or purchase houses in black and integrated areas . <p> Sugrue is quick to point out , however , that FHA redlining practices can not fully explain the defensive hysteria , the white violence against black residents , or the lightening-paced abandonment of block-busted areas . These trends can only be understood as part of an emerging political identity based on white homeownership and forged in opposition to liberal politicians and the New Deal state . White homeowners , he suggests , understood the defense of their neighborhoods as a defense of their rights as citizens and their freedom as individuals to make choices about their lives . Thus , white homeowners developed a political language to define themselves as a political interest group whose struggles were antithetical to the rights of African Americans . Sugrue connects these trends to electoral politics , demonstrating that conservative politicians swept into the city 's administration by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the decisive outcome of liberal policies . Sugrue further argues that this was the pre-history to Michigan voters ' overwhelming support for George Wallace 's presidential campaign in 1968 and 1972 , and to the emergence of Reagan Democrats in the 1980s . <p> In the second section of his book , which he calls " Rust , " Sugrue chronicles the disparity between the experiences of Detroit residents and popular images of postwar affluence and harmony , paying particularly close attention to the disproportionate impact of economic restructuring on African Americans . Labor shortages combined with black activists ' work on a local and national level forced employers to hire African Americans into previously segregated sections of factories during the Second World War . However , discrimination from the city 's increasingly conservative unions meant that black workers had many fewer opportunities to achieve upward mobility than their white ethnic counterparts , even when Detroit 's industrial economy was healthy . Thus , while the integration of factories and neighborhoods was not particularly numerically significant--the city remained largely segregated , and black workers continued to be shut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous impact on the attitudes of black and white residents and on their relationships with each other and the city . Black Detroiters , bolstered by civil rights successes and by the anti-fascist rhetoric of the war , successfully organized activist groups and displayed a new sense of entitlement to equality on the streets . White Detroiters took a defensive posture towards these moves by black residents , intent on holding on to whatever privileges they already enjoyed and seeing any gains made by Africans Americans as a threat to their own well-being . <p> Sugrue 's integration of economic and social history helps us better understand the decisions of Detroit residents in the 1940s and 1950s . In fact , his attention to the material conditions within which Detroiters made choices about housing , politics , and race , sheds new light on the complicated relationship between white and black residents . In his third section , " Fire , " he closely examines those white neighborhoods whose residents actively participated in Neighborhood Improvement Associations and which were the sites of violent clashes with black " pioneers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " --those neighborhoods which mobilized the " fiercest resistance " to integration--shared certain demographic similarities . These three neighborhoods were all " bastions of single family homeownership " with " predominantly blue-collar populations " and " lower rates of female labor force participation than the city as a whole . " They shared a " quasi-suburban atmosphere , " were all " within a few miles of large auto plants " and " all but one was ethnically heterogeneous , with sizable Roman Catholic populations " ( 235-7 ) . Furthermore , it was this segment of the white working class which was most actively defending its exclusive domain over the ever shrinking pool of skilled and semi-skilled work in the city 's factories . <p> This demographic portrait of white resistance is central to Sugrue 's argument about the political shape of white homeownership for it supports his claim that the most virulent defenders of white neighborhoods were the relatively stable segments of Detroit 's working class population . These residents , he explains , were on the " front lines " of grassroots struggles against integration . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility as their middle class and less economically stable counterparts ; they could neither afford to buy a new house--especially if the value of their current property were diminishing--nor could they simply pick up and abandon their homes . <p> Sugrue thus concludes that white Detroit residents were increasingly disenchanted by the postwar liberal coalition because of their experiences and frustrations in their own neighborhoods . He argues that it is only after we understand the politics of homeownership in the 1940s and 1950s that we can understand why stable , white , blue collar workers came to equate liberalism and the New Deal state with blind allegiance to the rights of African Americans and with indifference to the plight of white workers . On the front lines of battles against integration , they saw themselves as the foot soldiers in a struggle for individual rights and for freedom from tyrannical and coercive liberal government . <p> Sugrue frequently reminds his reader that deindustrialization , white flight and urban decline were neither " inevitable , " nor " immutable . " Rather , they were products of " political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various institutions , groups , and individuals " ( 11 ) . Thus , part of the reason that Sugrue attempts to integrate structural analysis with social history is because he is trying to understand the relationship between the conditions which shape experiences and human agency . However , his interest in structure often comes at the expense of a more intimate understanding of how people experienced the statistical realities that he highlights and can make his portrait seem like it was the only possible avenue . For example , in the last section of his book , he outlines black residential mobility in the 1940s and 1950s , offering an extraordinarily compelling statistical look at white neighborhood defenders . While each of these three chapters is rich in detail and attentive to the complexity of Detroit 's geography , they all offer a relatively anonymous portrait of the city and of political action . Thus , instead of animating the concerns of individuals Sugrue discusses the actions and anxieties of Detroit residents in the aggregate . Too often , the historical agents in his book are " African American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white church groups , " " civil rights organizations , " members of the " Catholic Interracial Council , " etc . Thus , relatively face-less groups seem to be making decisions and holding opinions . <p> This anonymity also means that the connections Sugrue makes between residents ' experiences in their neighborhoods and their workplaces are based on statistical observations , since he does not follow any individuals from home to work . This makes it difficult to understand how white and black Detroiters understood the complicated connections between their work experiences and their experiences as urban residents . Furthermore , as other historians have noted , the work cultures in each factory were quite distinct , with different policies and practices about race and integration . But , because Sugrue talks about work experiences in the aggregate , he misses how different work cultures may have cultivated different relationships to integration at home . <p> The categories that Sugrue develops and uses , and the groups that he discusses , are extremely useful for understanding the city and for making sense of urban politics and race relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights are fresh , innovative and invaluable . However , it is hard to get a feel for grassroots politicization through the brief anecdotes that he offers which seem secondary to his structural observations . While Sugrue was clearly constrained by his sources , he could have spent more time animating the sources that he did find and building on these observations . While he does explain that " hundreds " of white residents wrote angry letters to politicians about integration , and cites some of these communications , he seems to use these sources only to support his larger observations , rather than finding new paradigms or ideas from the letters themselves . Furthermore , while he does use oral history collections housed in the Labor Archives at Wayne State University , he does not seem to have conducted his own interviews , and while it may have been difficult to find white " defenders " to talk about their experiences , he may have been able to find some contemporaries to discuss their impressions of the impact of these struggles on city politics . ( It is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not include a bibliography ) . <p> Ultimately , the strengths of Sugrue 's book far outweigh its weaknesses . His meticulous structural analysis of Detroit 's transformation from a wartime boomtown to a city struggling with postwar recession combined with his detailed account of white homeowners ' often violent efforts to maintain control over the racial composition of their neighborhoods makes this an invaluable book for scholars interested in the twentieth century city . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

His fourteen chapters run the gamut of the emotional , intellectual and moral issues associated with the Victorian era .

( 394-395 ) <p> The many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pigeonholes created by the above statements , and large sections of The Victorian Frame of Mind are devoted to demonstrating how they fit . <p> Despite over forty years of continuous scholarship since the work first appeared , this overview remains vital and fresh , its scope and detail still providing an excellent introduction to the early to mid-Victorian mind for a graduate student or advanced undergraduate . Even scholars who feel strongly that the idea of " Victorianism " is something of a fallacy would benefit their students by assigning this work , giving them a good opponent to try and sharpen their theoretical arguments against . <p> Houghton perhaps spends more time linking Victorianism to a reaction towards the ages of the French Revolution and Regency than most contemporary specialty scholars ( as opposed to historians writing in a more popular or general mold ) would . In part , this is no doubt due to the twin trends of dismissing the Victorian era as something easily defined as a self-contained intellectual era and of spotting the beginnings of " Victorian " ideals in earlier periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction against the perceived excesses of revolutionary fervor and Regency decadence . <p> From the current perspective , there are three areas where Houghton may be seen as weak , however . The first would be in not setting Victorianism in relationship with periods prior to the French Revolution . That British culture would have strong reactions against the ideals and actions of the Revolution , which the nation had fought against for some quarter of a century , is of course not surprising . However , British culture between the Glorious Revolution and the French Revolution was not a weak , amorphous one . Whatever effects earlier British culture , the Enlightenment ( and other periods ) in general had on the formation of the Victorian mind are left fundamentally unexplored as are the effects of the formation and partial loss of the first British Empire , and the effects of industrialization up through 1817 . Again , Victorianism 's relationship with reaction against the ideals of the French Revolution and Regency decadence is the focus instead . <p> Secondly , this work is on the formation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1860s through the start of its decline is basically ignored . In much the same way , most of the seeds which grew to overcome the Victorian mind are also left at best merely referred to , rather than explored in the context of Victorianism 's creation . <p> The third area , judging from today 's views , is perhaps most profound . As Houghton himself states in his preface : " The working class as such is not here under consideration . " ( xvi ) That admission at least allows him to be acquitted of not recognizing that , by any standards , his portrait of the society is incomplete . Yet the working class is merely the most obvious of the missing pieces of the early Victorian intellectual worldview ; the lack of Scots , Welsh , Irish , and voices from deep in the country -- and the overwhelmingly male-orientation of the sources -- would no doubt strike the current generation of graduate students as being at least a trifle discordant . <p> In short , therefore , Houghton remains an excellent source for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant by " Victorianism " in Britain , and still a very useful reference for anyone working in the field .

This series reviews books published during the twentieth century which have been deemed to be among the most important contributions to the field of intellectual history . <p> Elizabeth Eisenstein 's **26;1846;TOOLONG 1979 book is a study of the first century of printing , particularly the period from 1460 to 1480 , when printing presses went from rare to common , and as a consequence changed the way knowledge was preserved and conveyed . It is primarily a work of synthesis , although Eisenstein displays a masterful knowledge of the relevant primary materials . Her goal is to show how intellectual and social reactions to the new print technology had long-term and frequently unintended consequences , and , as a result , why this period marked a crucial turning point in western history . <p> Eisenstein 's thesis is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulation of information fundamentally changed the mentality of early modern readers , with repercussions that transformed Western society . Ancient and Medieval scribes had faced tremendous difficulties in preserving the knowledge that they already possessed , which , despite their best efforts , inevitably grew more corrupted and fragmented over time . With the establishment of printing presses , accumulation of knowledge was for the first time possible . Rather than spending most of their energies searching for scattered manuscripts and copying them , scholars could now focus their efforts on revision of these texts and the gathering of new data . New observations from a widely scattered readership could be included in subsequent editions . According to Eisenstein , the shift to printing reversed the whole orientation of attitudes towards learning . The passage of time no longer inevitably brought with it a lessening of knowledge . Furthermore , at the new print shops , scholars , artisans and translators from various nations and religions found themselves working together , and cooperating in a new , more cosmopolitan environment which encouraged questioning and individual achievement . <p> The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenstein explains why print culture represented such a fundamental break with the past . In the other two sections , she examines the impact of printing on the Renaissance and its revival of classical literature , the Protestant Reformation , and the Scientific Revolution . Eisenstein stresses the interrelated nature of cultural developments within these three areas of study , which she believes are too often kept separate by modern historians . She also emphasizes her belief that historians have underestimated the role of the printing press , due to their focus on its impact only as it pertained to the dissemination of " new " ideas . <p> In the first century of printing , much of the printers ' output was the same inherited texts that scribal work had produced . But the most important feature was not that the literature was new , but rather than readers for the first time could see multiple texts together and compare them . The body of knowledge preserved by scribes was scattered and incomplete , with authorship of specific texts obscured , magical incantations intermixed with scientific observations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was possible for manuscript readers to imagine that the past minds of antiquity had possessed a much more complete understanding of the world , which had been fragmented and degraded over time . During the first century of printing , the collection and revision of this scattered corpus was the primary goal for most scholars . The assumption , both with regard to biblical writings and to classical treatises on science , was that each revised work that further sorted out the jumbled legacy would help make this wisdom clearer . But revised editions of scripture , which took increasing advantage of the greater linguistic learning available in printed language dictionaries , revealed inconsistencies and ambiguities in the texts which could not be easily resolved . Laying inherited scientific works side by side for the first time also pointed up discrepancies and contradictions . At the same time , the new ability to convey maps , charts , and pictures in a uniform and permanent way meant that older theories in cartography , astronomy , anatomy , and botany could be checked against new observations . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differing reactions to the changes brought about by printing shaped subsequent European society is most clearly seen in Eisenstein 's extended discussion of the role print culture played in shaping religious debates before and after the Protestant Reformation . There had been many earlier heretical movements within the Catholic Church before Luther 's posting of his 95 theses . But the dissemination and greater permanence of print culture allowed his challenge to have a much greater impact . Moreover , the competitive nature of the printing industry , which was driven by a desire for sales , provided a new , more public outlet for controversies , and insured that what began as a scholarly dispute between theologians gained an international audience . Reformation impulses and the printing industry fed off and accelerated one another in an age where religious materials were popular sellers . <p> Differing Catholic and Protestant attitudes towards print culture resulted in two widely divergent historical paths . In Protestant lands , approval of vernacular bibles led to encouragement of greater lay literacy and a closer tying of biblical lore with developing national cultures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant reactions to printing were not due solely to theological differences , or to Protestants being more enlightened or trusting of their congregations . Some individual Protestant leaders were hostile to the changes wrought by printing , particularly the wider dispersal of controversial books to lay audiences . But areas under Protestant control were generally less able to implement censorship of the presses than the more centralized governments of Catholic areas . One of the most important events in the shaping of early print culture was the successful rebellion of the Netherlands . In their small , semi-autonomous provinces , numerous printing presses sprang up that operated relatively free of censorship , and provided an outlet for authors , even within areas held by the Counter-Reformation . Books coming off the clandestine presses proved impossible for the Counter-Reformation to block , with significant impact for both religion and science . <p> While the main focus of The Printing Press is limited to a relatively small group of already-literate elites , Eisenstein believes that the changes which print culture brought to the early modern world eventually transformed Western society at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which came about due to a basic change in communication and collective memory , and the advent of uniform duplication , Eisenstein 's book anticipates many areas of interest in recent intellectual history . Her conception of a cosmopolitan " Republic of Letters " created by the new printing technology that transcended national borders has been carried on by historians of the Enlightenment and eighteenth-century thought such as Dena Goodman. 1 Her emphasis on the need to look at the impact of the clandestine book trade operating on the periphery of the Catholic dynasties has also figured prominently in the works of Robert Darnton and Jack Censor , and in her own more recent work on eighteenth-century France. 2 <p> On the other hand , Eisenstein in 1992 expressed frustration that many of the artificial borders in intellectual history that she had tried to bridge in The Printing Press still dominated discussions of European development . Studies of Renaissance and early European print culture generally remain unrelated to work on the Enlightenment tradition and eighteenth-century thought. 3 Furthermore , while she applauded the recent interest in the production and dissemination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were formerly considered too " low-brow " to merit academic interest , she remained dissatisfied with the continuing split between the history of ideas and the history of book publication . According to Eisenstein , recent work on the printing industry , such as that done by Robert Darnton and Roger Chartier , has greatly expanded practical knowledge of book production , but these studies generally treat books chiefly as a commodity , with little reference to the ideas they contain , or the views held by their propagators. 4 <p> Eisenstein 's approach in The Printing Press still holds potential as a promising approach to some of the more vexing questions of European early modern history . While her interpretation idealizes somewhat the figure of the early printer and his print-shop , looking at the differing reactions to this new mode of knowledge dissemination as well as the individuals engaged in this new business continues to provide a concrete and challenging starting point for discussing the cultural and intellectual transformations of the early modern era . As she noted in her conclusion , " to ask historians to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' modernity ' seems somewhat futile . To consider the effects of a definite communications shift which entered into each of the movements under discussion seems more promising . Among other advantages , this approach offers a chance to uncover relationships which debates over modernity only serve to conceal " ( 684 ) . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

Donning his " historian 's hat , " Reston sets the stage for his drama by providing brief backgrounds on the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and Saladin 's unification of Egypt and Syria. 1 He also describes the Sultan 's conquest of the Christian holdings from 1187 to 1189 , and next follows the preaching , mobilization , and course of the Third Crusade in roughly chronological fashion from 1189 to 1192 . As biographer , Reston also devotes a good deal of text to a presentation of his title characters ' early lives and careers , theorizes how their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and briefly touches on their fates after the campaign . The author is perhaps at his best when wearing an essayist 's hat , as he derives valuable insights on the modern legacy of the crusade movement from his travels in the Middle East and interviews with Muslim scholars . <p> Reston apparently desired to avoid a Western bias in his account , and in this he has certainly succeeded . If anything , he seems to prefer his Muslim subjects , and his treatment of the Christians as a whole is generally pejorative in tone . The Christians are the aggressors in his drama , they are less civilized , less religious , more greedy , and more savage . Reston characterizes Islam as the " native faith " of the Holy Land and states that , " In the first instance the Third Crusade was a Christian Holy War that was met in response and in reaction by the Muslim concept of jihad " ( pp. xvi , xviii ) . Both of these assertions are debatable , and rely , to a large extent , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They typify the author 's style not only in that they privilege the Muslim perspective , but also in that they ignore the subtleties of the issue at hand , by presenting one side of a complex concept or thorny debate as simple fact . Reston 's simplistic , dualist constructions prevent him from addressing some of the most interesting and enlightening aspects of his subject . <p> This is particularly evident in the author 's portraits of Richard and Saladin , with the former doing little right and the latter incapable of doing wrong . In general , Reston 's characterizations are rather thin and one-dimensional , with no hint of competing interpretations or any other complexities that might muddy the waters of his tale . Richard is painted as reckless , brutish , unprincipled , and vacillating , with his only commendable trait being that he was a great warrior ( pp. 115 , 181 , 192 , 226 , 341 ) . Saladin , on the other hand , is noble , devout , wise , and imperturbable ( pp. 23 , 25 , 172 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richard is roundly condemned for the massacre of Muslim prisoners at Acre , after negotiations for their release broke down following repeated delays by Saladin . Yet no censure accompanies the Sultan 's less-numerous executions of Christian prisoners , both before and after Richard 's , including the beheading of women passengers seized by Muslim corsairs and brought before him for interrogation . Richard is a savage , but Saladin is supposed to have been motivated by piety in his executions . Reston blandly states that the Koran sanctioned such " retaliation , " quoting an " eye for eye , tooth for tooth " passage that ( excepting some anatomical detail ) is precisely what might be found in the Old Testament ( p. 277 ) . <p> The author does employ an engaging style , painting vivid scenes with imaginative and descriptive prose . Unfortunately , he appears to be more concerned with telling a good story than with presenting an accurate or responsible history , and he too often ventures into the hyperbolic and fantastic . Thus he has Richard wading ashore to the Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other " like some Hollywood action movie hero , when the chronicles simply note his use of both weapons at different times during a day-long battle ( p. 288 ) . 2 He also uses such anachronistic terms as " seals " and " commandos " to describe medieval combatants , presumably because he thinks they convey the essence of the matter , if not the reality , as well as enhancing readability ( pp. 120 , 159 , 160 , 175 ) . But certainly the best example of Reston 's taste for the titillating version of a story is his insistence that Richard was homosexual , that he and Philip Augustus were lovers , and that their dissolved relationship then impacted not only the course of the crusade but future European politics as well . Reston is certainly not the first to assert Richard 's supposed homosexuality , despite the fact that the evidence for it is extremely thin . But the manner in which he presents the case is notable in its bald confidence , with no hint that a contrary viewpoint might exist : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adulthood , Philip Augustus and Richard the Lionheart had been lovers " ( p. 61 ) . Moreover , Reston goes beyond merely discussing Richard 's sexuality to place it at the very center of his drama . The Third Crusade supposedly dissolved because Philip could not bear to labor on in his ex-lover 's shadow ( pp. 164 , 170-176 ) . The Plantagenet-Capetian wars of the late Twelfth Century were not part of a bitterly complex and long-standing dynastic rivalry , but were merely another lovers ' quarrel : " But behind it all the matter was personal . They Richard and Philip Augutus fought and made peace and fought again , just as lovers fight and make up and fight again " ( p. 339 ) . It may be a juicy story , but it is not good history . <p> Reston employs a wide range of primary and secondary sources--most of the important chronicles are represented in the bibliography--but he too often makes poor use of them . He draws heavily on the medieval sources , but does so neither critically nor faithfully , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as equal in evidentiary value . The author grants a factual voice to legendary or fantastic material . We are told , for example , that King Henry II could trace his lineage back to Noah ( p. 28 ) and that Guy of Lusignan could trace his back to a " serpent woman " ( p. 14 ) . Moreover , prophecies regarding Richard 's birth were delivered " by no less a figure than Merlin the Magician " ( p. 29 ) . Reston 's conception of his subject also appears to have been shaped as much by modern literary and theatrical sources , as he describes for us the intrigues of the Plantagenet and Capetian courts as seen " from the modern play The Lion in Winter " ( p. 61 ) . A very fine play and a memorable film , but hardly a reliable historical source .

" Roger of Hoveden simply states that he " confessed the filthiness of his life " and that " the thorns of lustfulness had departed from his head " ( p. 135 ) . 3 <p> It is possible that Reston simply underestimates the limitations of his medieval sources , as he demonstrates what appears to be an imperfect understanding of the period as a whole . Examples are legion , but among the most striking are the author 's criticisms of Richard 's military judgement at every turn , in particular his eventual refusal to besiege Jerusalem itself in the summer of 1192 . Reston states that no historian has " adequately " explained why Richard pulled back to Jaffa at that point , and he offers up that " suddenly , inexplicably , disgracefully , the Lionheart became fainthearted " ( p. 277 ) . 4 So his apparently adequate explanation is that Richard simply turned coward . In fact , Richard himself explained why he dared not press the attack , and his decision was in full accord with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the host--men of the time who lived or died by their skill at judging these affairs .

Reston dismisses this project as a flight of fancy , despite the fact that every major crusade to the East thereafter aimed at Cairo , and not Jerusalem . These indictments , and many others , reveal more about the author 's lack of understanding regarding medieval military affairs than they do Richard 's strategic acumen . <p> Reston has identified a topic of great potential for a popular history on a strikingly dramatic event that does indeed have important lessons for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Philips ( Department of International Society , Hirosaki University ) Published on H-USA ( November , 1999 ) <p> The American Civil War is arguably the most important episode in American history . It not only changed the lives of all who lived through it , but it had the most profound effects on the country itself , from the Constitution to the grammar of the English language . <p> Two Americans who were not only affected by the war but who had important impacts on the coming and course of the war were Martin Robison Delany and Frederick Douglass . <p> Ironically the more widely accomplished of them , Delany , is probably the most neglected , and undeservedly so . His insistence on the African nature of ancient Egypt and the importance of Pan-Africanism prefigure many of today 's Afrocentric ideas . Although never enshrined as a national hero the way the other has been , his thought has influenced a significant part of the African American community , and his life should be better known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society have developed . <p> Martin R. Delany was not only a major in the Union Army , its highest ranking African American during the war , but he was also a medical doctor , journalist , inventor , novelist , African explorer , political organizer , diplomat , Freemason , judge , lecturer , member of the International Statistical Congress . . . the list seems endless . Most of all he was loudly and proudly " black " without a trace of white ancestry . Despite their many differences of policy and personality Frederick Douglass never hesitated to point out Delany 's accomplishments to those who suggested that Douglass 's own talents were inherited from his white ancestors . No one could ever credit Delany 's accomplishments to any white forbears . He had none . <p> Delany was unusual in other ways . He had never been a slave , and thus it was not only his immense intellectual achievements that alienated him from the experiences , folkways and culture of the masses of African Americans in his day . Those same intellectual achievments , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ill-equipped to understand the peoples of West Africa , despite his experiences there . <p> Such a unique human being as Delany is still difficult to understand today . His advocacy of such popular reform causes of his day as temperance , women 's rights and abolitionism are easy enough to understand , but his insistence on emigration , the voluntary removal of African Americans overseas , especially during the 1850s as sectional conflict over slavery heated up , is still difficult to fathom . <p> Stranger still are Delany 's alliances with whites who , at first glance , should have been anathema to him . After long trying to distinguish his " emigrationism " ( the voluntary removal of free blacks outside of the United States ) from " colonization " ( the forced repatriation of free blacks outside of the United States ) he finally wound up taking support from white colonizationists , if only because his emigration scheme could not attract sufficient support otherwise . By the end of Reconstruction he campaigned for the Democratic Party in South Carolina , and was shot at by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " back to Africa " schemes , foreshadowing Marcus Garvey 's alliance with the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s . His life thus demonstrates an essential dilemma for black nationalists in the U.S. The only whites interested in helping them foster black separation are those whites who have the least interest in the welfare of African Americans . No wonder other African Americans throughout history have seen separatism , and especially emigrationism , as a threat to their interests . <p> Frederick Douglass was never a supporter of the Democratic Party , and never an emigrationist . His was an American dream , one in which people of all races would find a secure place and the right to pursue happiness in freedom and equality . Half-white and half black in ancestry , he spent his life in struggle , first for the abolition of slavery and later for the uplift and betterment of African Americans . As such his integrationism foreshadows the Civil Rights movement and its leaders . Shorn of anger and militance , he is often transformed into a safe icon of African American achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrations every February . <p> Yet Douglass shorn of anger and militance is not Douglass , for he was angry and he was militant , if a very American militant . Douglass had been a slave , and the wide range of his experiences as a slave gave him a deep understanding of the range of African American experiences and feelings of his time . He could connect to the black masses in ways that Delany could not , and the whites he attracted as supporters shared his interest in an integrated America and black uplift . Although both Delany and Douglass were accomplished writers the powerful sound of Douglass 's angry , oft-quoted words , was hammered out on the unyielding anvil of slavery and rings down to this day as an indictment of the slave system and of racism . Perhaps no ex-slave since Terence has made such an impact on literature , or has been so often quoted . <p> Robert S. Levine has given us an excellent , parallel biography of Delany and Douglass , especially as regards their writings and their interactions with another famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a professor of English at the University of Maryland , but historians should not worry . This book is not an example of the fashionable literary criticism that is fictionalizing history , it is an example of the historicization of literature . Levine 's portraits of his two protagonists are more complex than mine here , not least because he has more space at his disposal . Instead of treating these authors ' ideas as unchanging ideal types he shows how their ideas and their writings evolved in interaction with each other and with the events of their times . This makes this book especially useful for American Studies classes , in which history and literature often interact . It can easily be recommended as a textbook not only for such courses but for history , literature , and other courses as well . <p> If I have a criticism of Levine 's book it is in his lack of understanding of the sexual politics of slavery . Levine argues that Douglass 's characteristic use of the term " manly " only signifies an insistence on the humanity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " anachronistic . " ( page 130 ) To me this suggests insensitivity to the problem of the family under slavery , and lack of recognition of the fact that so much of the miscegenation that took place under slavery was a result of rape . Slave men knew that their mothers , sisters and daughters could be and were being legally raped , and that they could do nothing about it . If Levine had understood the implications of this fact better , he might have been able to explain why Delany 's emigrationism was far more successful in attracting women ( page 92 and page 262 note 68 ) despite Douglass 's equal espousal of women 's rights . 69403 @qwx479403

It sheds new , and often , controversial light on the complex relationship between rice cultivation and slave agriculture in the Americas , with a clear emphasis on South Carolina . <p> In Black Rice , Judith Carney operates a conceptual as well as grammatical shift away from the perspectives adopted by Peter Wood in Black Majority , Daniel Littlefield in Rice and Slaves , Ira Berlin and Philip D. Morgan in Cultivation and Culture , and Joyce E. Chaplin in An Anxious Pursuit. 1 <p> Peter Wood evaluated the dialectic between rice and slaves in terms of " parallel " and " temporal " association . Daniel Littlefield analyzed the development of the South Carolina rice economy in the light of the slaves ' " contribution(s) . " Ira Berlin , Philip Morgan , and the contributors to Culture and Cultivation only briefly mentioned the relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tobacco and slaves . Though Joyce Chaplin admitted that " slaves who had experience growing rice in West Africa were probably instrumental in the successful creation of early rice plantations , " white planters remained , all through her book , the true " innovators " and " pioneers " in an era of change and technological modernity. 2 <p> Judith Carney carries the investigation one step further than her predecessors by asserting that rice and slaves were not separate realities but one unique entity . Rice in the Americas was grown thanks to the slaves ' expertise in rice cultivation acquired in West Africa . The role of white planters , and so-called " innovators , " is hardly mentioned , except briefly at the end of the book ( p. 162 ) . Rice becomes " black , " partly as a response to Peter Wood and Alex West 's " white rice , " and partly to suggest the near total agricultural assimilation between the crop and the slaves . In Black Rice , the dichotomy between the color of slave labor and the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice versa . <p> Judith Carney 's argument is founded upon the implicit assertion that the value of rice did not derive from the masters ' technological investments--namely from capital--but from the slaves and their labor . In many ways , Black Rice is a story of re-appropriation , or re-possession ( p. 156 ) , a shift in ownership . <p> As Judith Carney constantly reminds us , the history of rice in the Americas is a complex , and often , vexing question . Part of the reason is its location at the crossroads of several disciplines : agricultural history , anthropology and botany , but also African American cultural studies and biotechnology . The history of rice does not limit itself to botanical genealogy : when and where the first seeds were introduced , how they were exported from the Eastern to the Western Hemispheres in the period of " The Columbian Exchange , " how rice was planted and grown in the various micro-environments of the New World , and how it became , eventually , the backbone of the South Carolina economy. 3 It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' descendants who , in the post slavery period , glorified the ingenuity of their forebears into turning seemingly inhospitable wetlands into some of the most productive rice fields of the Atlantic world ( pp. 79-80 ) . <p> In Black Rice , Judith Carney argues that rice grew in the Western Hemisphere because slaves--the physical continuity of rice--and women in particular , selected the seeds , prepared the land , constructed the canals and trunks necessary for irrigation , planted and tended the fields despite the harsh climatic conditions , harvested and processed rice , whether Oryza Glaberrima , the African variety of domesticated rice , or Oryza Sativa , its Asian counterpart . Judith Carney asserts that the history of rice cultivation in the Americas is the story of a transfer of knowledge and of African agency ; " rice cultivation in the Americas depended upon the diffusion of an entire cultural system , from production to consumption " ( p. 165 ) . In Black Rice , agriculture , culture and technology interplay in one of the most paramount stories of African cultural survivals and retentions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the food preferences of the runaway slave communities of South America ( pp. 115-116 , 155-159 ) . <p> Black Rice takes the reader deep into the Rice region of West Africa , to the primary center of rice domestication , from rain-fed to wetland and tidal ecosystems , along the Niger and Gambia rivers , westward through the mangrove rice fields of Guinea Bissau , over the Atlantic to tidewater South Carolina , and southward to Surinam , Cayenne and Brazil . It ends its course where it started , where it all started , before slaves were bought into slavery and sold in the Americas . African women , then , woke up milling rice with the mortar and pestle ; a fragile ecological equilibrium had been established in the three areas of rice cultivation ; and a complex system of irrigated rice cultivation had been perfected long before the arrival of the first Portuguese ships off the Coast of West Africa . <p> The book progresses in a chrono-thematic and circular way . It starts with the first Portuguese voyages to Africa in the fourteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West African coast and the existence of intricate techniques of rice cultivation among the different African communities they encountered , in particular among the Baga strongly associated with mangrove rice production . The three ecosystems characteristic of rice cultivation in Africa were the tidal floodplain environment , inland swamps and rain-fed uplands . Rice was typically planted along a landscape gradient that included all three eco-systems . From the outset , the social organization of rice culture was founded upon women . The gendered division of rice labor varied from one region to the other , but processing and cooking remained everywhere tasks reserved for women . Milling , winnowing and parboiling , for example , were typical tasks performed by women . The first encounters between Europeans and African rice growers ended in bitter irony . At a time when rice became one of the most profitable export crops in America , rice cultivation in Africa was disrupted and disorganized by the depletion of its labor force . From that point onwards , all notions of African rice expertise were denied . <p> In the second chapter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Africa . For a long time , historians and botanists believed that there was only one Asian origin for rice . Only at the beginning of the twentieth century did a group of French botanists , led by Auguste Chevalier , posit the existence of an independent African center of rice domestication , located in the Inland Delta of the Niger River . After the domestication of rice , political and territorial upheavals resulted in the expansion of rice from its original heartland into the rest of the Rice Region . In the North , which is drought-prone , rice is a wetland crop and its cultivation alternates with cattle herding . Southward , in the Guinean highlands where precipitation exceeds forty inches per year , rice is mainly an upland rain-fed crop . In the North West , along the Atlantic coast , the mangrove system of irrigation dominates . Judith Carney describes in great detail the mangrove ecosystem . It seems to exemplify African agency and it bears striking similarities with the South Carolina rice landscape ( pp. 59 , 63 ) . <p> Chapter three takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much more than rice crossed the Atlantic Ocean . Slaves survived the Middle Passage , not only by retaining their religious practices and family patterns , but also by preserving their indigenous knowledge of rice cultivation . From then on , " the question is whether slaves from West Africa 's Rice Coast were recruited as skilled laborers in a cropping system planters had already ingeniously developed , or whether slaves expert in rice cultivation showed Carolina planters how to adapt a preferred dietary staple to diverse lowland settings " ( pp. 80-81 ) . Joyce Chaplin would likely have favored the first hypothesis . Judith Carney argues , on the contrary , in favor of a dramatic and complete reversal of roles , " the origin of rice cultivation in South Carolina is indeed African ... slaves from West Africa 's rice region tutored planters in growing the crop " ( p. 81 ) . <p> Slaves would have been familiar with the different micro-systems they encountered in South Carolina . Owing to their knowledge of mangrove rice , slaves played a pivotal role in the shift from swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in particular , knew how to mill rice before the advent of mechanization . Yet , in another example of bitter , historical irony , rice , which was originally a means of resistance and negotiation in the " charter period of slavery , " was turned into a symbol of oppression. 4 White , " innovative " planters gradually appropriated rice . <p> The next chapter evaluates the questions of the ( de ) genderization of rice culture in South Carolina . According to Judith Carney , the gender division of labor was more or less replicated in South Carolina except for rice processing . This disruption in the traditional African labor system was caused by the rice calendar and by the momentous increase in rice production over the course of the eighteenth century . Women alone could not tend to the milling of rice , and planters had to rely on newly arrived , inexperienced male slaves . Unfortunately , the question of gender often fades in the background of this fourth chapter . It is often difficult to pair the contents of the chapter--discussion of African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar , and lengthy elaboration on the milling of rice--with the title , " This was ' Woman 's Wuck . ' " <p> Chapter five takes us back into the past and into Africa . Judith Carney investigates the hypothetical introduction of African rice seeds in the New World . If Oryza Glaberrima was found in botanical collections of South America , as in Surinam and Brazil , its presence in North America remains , up to now , only suspected . According to Judith Carney , African rice probably first entered South Carolina via slave ships . The fragility of Oryza Glaberrima was probably one of the reasons why planters adopted , from the start , two varieties of Sativa rice , " Carolina White " in the colonial period , and the high yielding " Carolina Gold " in the antebellum era . Judith Carney concedes , however , that " more archival , botanical , and archaeological research is needed in the Americas . One direction would involve archaeological studies in areas of former rice plantation economies " ( p. 152 ) . Historical archaeology could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slaves , where African rice may have been cultivated in conjunction with other African crops . After all , though Carney does not mention it explicitly , the African origins of rice cultivation in the Americas may well have to be searched in the gardens of slaves , " the botanical gardens of the dispossessed , the marginal " ( p. 156 ) . <p> In a near perfect circular structure , the last chapter of Black Rice takes us back , one last time , in the opposite direction , to West Africa and Sierra Leone . Yet , this time , by emphasizing the movement of repatriation of freed blacks to Sierra Leone under the aegis of abolitionist societies , Carney evaluates , though in a very sketchy way , what we may call the African American origins of rice cultivation in Africa . Indeed , " seeds and agricultural implements formed a crucial component of the goods accompanying black settlers to West Africa " ( p. 172 ) . Among the seeds brought to Africa was the " Carolina Gold " variety of rice . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom . If Black Rice started as a story of expropriation , it truly finishes as a story of re-appropriation . <p> Black Rice deserves praise for its wealth of primary sources--travel narratives , plantation records , slave ships ' logbooks , patent requests , inventors ' accounts , WPA narratives , and drawings for example--and for its careful reading and synthesis of a large body of secondary sources written in multiple languages , French in particular . <p> The argument of Black Rice evolves according to a pattern of calls and responses , echoes and counter-echoes , as though providing the reader with a set of photographs and the set of negatives . It makes Black Rice into a highly dynamic and stimulating reading . <p> It is important , however , to point out several weaknesses . The very structure and genesis of the phrase " black rice " would have needed introductory explanation and legitimization ( see page 141 for one of the very few references to " black rice " ) . How does it relate , for example , to the " Red Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Brazilian Indians ? 5 The adjective " black " does not modify the noun " rice " in a usual way . " Black rice " can be analyzed instead as a compound noun . " Black rice " could be red , white , or gold , depending on the rice variety planted by slaves , but it remained black because it was , from the outset , an extension of the slave body . <p> These reservations aside , Black Rice remains an extremely stimulating , innovative and insightful essay on African and African American agriculture before , during and after the period of the slave trade . It is to be hoped that Judith Carney will indeed further investigate the presence of Oryza Glaberrima in South Carolina and will expand her analysis of the relationship between rice and slavery in South America . <p> In the wake of Gwendolyn Midlo Hall 's Africans in Colonial Louisiana : The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century and Michael Gomez 's Exchanging Our Country Marks : The Transformation of African identities in the Colonial and Antebellum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the very first and most paramount episodes in the re-writing of the history of slavery and slave culture in the Atlantic World. 6 <p> Notes <p> 1 .

We will have better international relations when those reasons for suspicion and resentment have been removed " ( p. 80 ) .

Seeking to find the historical roots of the patterns she sees in the present , Buck tells the story of Kentucky 's development by focusing upon two counties in central Kentucky ; the county in which she lives ( which she disguises by calling " South County " ) and the county in which she works ( labeled as " North County " ) .

Worked to the Bone seeks to explain why people without substantial power participate in their own oppression , willingly upholding the systems that imprison them . <p> Buck 's title , Worked to the Bone , derives from Hoyt Axton and Renee Armand 's 1974 song , " Boney Fingers . " When she moved to Kentucky as part of the " back to the land " movement of the 1970s , Buck writes , she heard the song everywhere . The lyrics captured the sense of frustration she shared with her neighbors , who worked hard but were paid little : " Work your fingers to the bone - whadda ya get ? Boney fingers , boney fingers . " 1 Writing about the life she lived in the mid-1970s , Buck says , " I thought I was desperate.I thought I understood about bony fingers .

" ( p.1 ) The song 's refrain haunted her as she as she worked with her husband on a farm and after they started a plumbing business ( warning : plumbing metaphors abound in Buck 's account ) . Finally , an epiphany brought her to formulate a theory that explained the economic forces at work around her , a theory she labels as " the view from under the sink . " Here , the typical pyramid of class relations has a twist : profits flow up from workers at the base of the pyramid to economic elites at the top . Buck describes this flow as " trickle up " economics , a system through which economic elites at the national and international levels systematically drain profits from the workers they employ . This control has been augmented by their domination of all levels of government , bringing spoils in the form of tax breaks , governmental subsidies , and other forms of " welfare " designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's account , this " drainage system " is not static , but rather an evolving and dynamic force . Beginning with the settlement of the Virginia colonies in the 17th century , Buck describes an adaptive system of capital extraction through which the elites who benefited the most persuaded many of those who were being " drained " that they shared the same interests as the elites . For example , during the 1670s , Bacon 's Rebellion persuaded plantation owners of the need to buy off poor whites by emphasizing the benefits of whiteness , including land ownership and expanded white suffrage , and by creating a system of slavery that was permanent , hereditary , and defined by race . This is hardly a new story , as historians familiar with the evolution of racial slavery and of Southern history will quickly recognize . As explained by historian Edmund S. Morgan almost 30 years ago , the rights of whites were built upon the wrongs done to people of African descent . 2 <p> Buck shows how Virginia 's systems of capitalism and race relations were transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following centuries . Whites who were not elites willingly upheld the system that oppressed them , accepting a " psychological wage " of white supremacy as part of their pay. 3 When presented with " forks in the road , " moments in history that offered oppressed people opportunities to unite over the divisions of race and gender , they proved unable to overcome their differences long enough to make permanent improvements in their status or to prevent elites from re-instituting control . These historical moments did force the system to change , however , as evidenced during the post-World War II years when unionized workers forced employers to offer some concessions , including higher wages . Even then , Buck explains , skilled workers ( most of whom were white ) were deceived into accepting a " sugar-coated pill . " A sweet coating , the long-sought-after family wage , covered the bitterness inside , the loss of " formerly granted white privileges such as a reasonable hope of personal , political , and economic autonomy " ( p 165 ) . As the capitalist system has become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bone-our precarious economic situation disguised by the prevalence of consumer items and middle-class trappings ( often purchased on credit ) . In reality , Buck argues , most of her Kentucky neighbors , like most Americans , and indeed most people throughout the world , have little autonomy , independence , or economic security . <p> This analysis of the forces of capitalism is a major strength of the book , and here , Buck taps into a powerful , yet understudied phenomenon . The shift of power from local and regional elites , to the national and international levels , has brought a loss of power to communities throughout the world . Working people often fail to see their true interests , but they are not alone in this blindness . In the last half century , the increased penetration of national and international capital into local and regional markets of the United States has intensified the loss of power and security by the middle-class managers , small business owners , and local and regional elites who considered themselves full beneficiaries of the American Dream . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shares common elements with other works in the field . As described in Peter Kolchin 's recent essay , " Whiteness Studies : The New History of Race in America , " scholars in the field often focus on the social construction of whiteness , share a subjective involvement with their topics , often lack historical and historiographical context , and heavily emphasize " prescriptive policy goals . " 4 Buck admits her subjectivity ; her presence permeates the account through reflections that pop up in chapter after chapter . She readily reveals her agenda , both in the confessional story of her realization of " trickle up " economics ( discussed above ) and in discussing the purpose of the book : " Quite simply , I do n't like the future that may be coming , and I hope this book will help to circumvent it " ( p. 4 ) . She continues , " I need to provide an alternative history , one which emphasizes what I believe to be the real history of bony fingers , the policies that have created them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategies used by the elite to fool people into agreeing to policies that hurt themselves and many other people . But my real interest is the present , not the past , so I will focus on those moments in the past that were critical in shaping lives in the present " ( p. 6 ) . <p> Buck 's " alternative history , " however , is not always new . More than a generation ago , historians such as Edmund S. Morgan ( mentioned above ) and C. Vann Woodward wrote powerfully of the role of race in Southern life . Like Buck , both of these scholars were seeking not only to describe the past , but also to change the future . When does the " alternative " history of a generation ago become the reigning paradigm of today ? When Buck discusses " dominant " history and anthropology , what she really means is a popular understanding of these topics , as reflected in public memory and myth . Works of deconstruction are often at their best when looking at language and social structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , this is not a problem with this account , and interviews provide real-life commentary from the people Buck studies . Sometimes , the process of deconstructing whiteness leads Buck to some excellent insights , as when she points out the celebration of slavery in Stephen Foster 's " My Old Kentucky Home , " the state song of Kentucky ( p. 11 ) . <p> One of the topics that continually fascinates academics and social commentators is the question , " Why do people fail to recognize where their true interests lie ? " Although Buck rejects the term , " false consciousness , " she is analyzing the lack of consciousness on the part of people who are unable to see their best interests . Buck is particularly effective in articulating the ways that stereotypes have hindered people 's abilities to act or to form alliances outside of their immediate context . In Kentucky , she writes , negative stereotypes ( " Kentucky feuds , drinking , incest , family violence , and general backwardness , barefootedness , improvidence , and rednecked cussedness.outhouses , bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , have frequently served to disguise economic , political , and social exploitation . " These stereotypes , partially produced by the dominant history and anthropology , relieve consciences and explain to the rest of the nation that they need not question the role of the elite and corporate capital in creating Kentucky poverty , or their role in stimulating the attitudes described as ' redneck , ' " Buck writes . " The actions of coal mine owners , of corporate tobacco buyers , or of manufacturing executives are irrelevant in explaining Kentucky 's bony fingers if they can be explained by the problems in Kentucky 's culture instead . These stereotypes have made it relatively easy for many people to dismiss the actions of tobacco farmers or coal miners when they have fought the corporations that controlled their lives " ( p. 7 ) . Although Buck focuses upon Kentucky , the stereotypes she describes are familiar Appalachian stereotypes , and there have served the same function that she ascribes to the stereotypes about Kentucky. 5 <p> The book has several problems . One of the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the primary research in the book is based upon two counties in central Kentucky , but we never learn exactly which counties she is studying . Buck conceals place names as they appear in book and essay titles , newspaper accounts , and local records , and replaces actual names of places with fictionalized substitutes . This makes it difficult for other scholars to follow her research trail or to evaluate her use of sources. 6 Another , lesser , issue concerns the author 's clever use of words , which sometimes distracts from her overall argument . Chapters are sprinkled with references to the " drainage system , " " trickle up " economics , " the view from under the sink , " " bony fingered people , " " little guy/big guy " analysis , " the sugar-coated contract , " and " wannabes , " leaving the reader searching to recall the meaning of the catchy phrases . Buck 's wide scope also invites questions about the evolution of the system of power and privilege . Certainly , the system underwent tremendous change during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the changes with such dizzying speed that it is hard to keep track of them all . The reader is also left wondering about the consciousness of elites who enjoyed the greatest levels of power and privilege . To what extent did they deliberately conspire to preserve their status and privileges ? Why were they always able to come out on top ? More importantly , to what extent does the framework of whiteness explain the continuity of power and privilege ? <p> Neither of the two counties in this study is located within the Appalachian section of Kentucky ; both lie just to the west of the mountains . Even so , Buck integrates a considerable amount of scholarship about the Appalachian region in her analysis . The scope of Buck 's study is ambitious . She situates her study within the context of work on the South , Appalachia , gender , slavery , and labor , as well as race relations . She traces the themes of capitalist development and follows the flow of capital ( at local , state , national , and international levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are few ; development has brought poverty , not wealth , in its wake. 7 Overall , Worked to the Bone is an intriguing exploration of the role that race has played in shaping the economy and society of Kentucky . Where better to study the history of whiteness than in central Kentucky , with its mixture of power and oppression , aristocratic privilege and redneck stereotypes ? <p> 5 . For a recent discussion and repudiation Appalachian stereotypes , see the essays in Dwight B. Billings , Gurney Norman , and Katherine Ledford , eds. , Confronting Appalachian Stereotypes : Back Talk from an American Region ( Lexington : The University Press of Kentucky , 1999 ) . The book 's essays were inspired by success of Robert Schenkkan 's 1992 Pulitzer Prize-winning play , The Kentucky Cycle , which was full of offensive stereotypes that were accepted unquestioningly by critics and enthusiastic audiences . <p> 6 . Buck explains the steps she took to conceal identities of places : " I have given pseudonyms to counties and towns and correspondingly changed names of newspapers and of local histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and date references are correct . I have also ' misplaced ' certain locations in order to preserve confidentiality , and avoided using exact census number that would reveal county identity ; these changes do not affect the argument . Names of local corporations and other institutions are also pseudonyms. " ( p. 229 ) . <p> Copyright 2002 by H-Net , all rights reserved .

Leyva ( Division of Behavioral and Cultural Sciences , The University of Texas at San Antonio ) Published on H-LatAm ( March , 1996 ) <p> Historian David Gutierrez 's provocative study of Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants , Walls and Mirrors , could not have come at a more timely moment . As immigration again comes to the forefront of public debate , as the role of immigrants , both documented and undocumented , again comes under scrutiny , Gutierrez provides us with a well-researched investigation of the issues surrounding immigration , but from a different perspective than most . It is a look at the debate from within the Mexican American community , and it sheds light on a number of significant issues . What are the historic links between immigration , civil rights , and ethnicity ? How have Mexican American organizations and activists strategized politically vis-a-vis immigration and citizenship during this century ? How have Mexican Americans perceived themselves , their role in U.S. society , and their relationship to both long-term Mexican residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walls and Mirrors , Gutierrez explores the often-shifting contours of this intriguing , yet largely neglected subject , through his **25;1901;TOOLONG study of Mexican American activists and organizations in Texas and California . <p> As Gutierrez writes in his introduction , Mexicans and Mexican Americans have always been aware of the differences between them , yet few studies have focused on the nature of this relationship and the forces which have shaped it . Like the larger society , scholars have often treated Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants as if they were all the same , ignoring that the relationship between the two groups has been fraught with ambivalence and contradiction . Although over the years , studies have hinted at the depth of this complex , often contradictory , relationship , there have been few attempts to delve into its intricacies . Gutierrez 's long-needed study sets out to examine both the " differences that divided and the commonalities that bound the two groups together-- the walls and mirrors ... " ( p. 4 ) through a social and political history which examines the ways in which Mexican Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript collections , government documents , newspapers , and organizational records , as well as many of the now-classic community , regional , and immigration studies published in the last two decades , Gutierrez has managed not so much to present totally new information ( particularly in the early chapters ) as to present it within a new context . Herein lies the importance of this work--Gutierrez has gleaned from this collection of primary and secondary material a story of intra-ethnic relations which others have alluded to , but which few have centered in their analysis of Mexican American and Chicano history . And although , as Gutierrez acknowledges , only a small percentage of Mexican Americans participated in the political organizations highlighted in his study , the organizations , their work , their strategies and their rhetoric are still significant . These organizations often provided the only " voice " for the Mexican American community . Gutierrez 's study is indeed a study of politics--it is particularly effective in its analysis of political strategies and rhetoric . As a social history , it tantalized but left the reader wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mexican immigrants dealt with each other in everyday terms , the ways in which individuals resolved the contradictions and ambiguities in their relationship . <p> Accompanying the creation of the " new " ethnic group , Mexican Americans , following the mid-nineteenth century war between the United States and Mexico , there emerged a fundamental contradiction which haunts Mexican Americans still and which helped shaped Mexican American/Mexican immigrant relations . While the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ( 1848 ) gave Mexican Americans " the rights of citizens , " it gave them no way to practice those rights ( p. 38 ) . Facing discrimination , violence and on-going economic , political and social subordination , the diverse Mexican population developed a distinct ethnic identity by the 1850s . Ethnic polarization and ethnic discord , two conditions whose roots lie in the 19th century U.S. conquest of Mexico 's northern frontier--ethnic polarization and discord--not only helped define the relationship between Mexican Americans and Anglo Americans , but as Mexican immigration grew significantly after 1890 , it influenced intra-ethnic relations as well . Whether Mexican Americans perceived the walls between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptions of how best to confront the ethnic conflict which was well entrenched before the beginning of any significant Mexican immigration . <p> Although Gutierrez detects an ambivalence in the relationship between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants during the early period of immigration , 1890-1920 , it is during the 1920s and 1930s that a truly polarized view towards Mexican immigration and immigrants emerges within the Mexican American community . As immigration grows in the 1920s , along with an ever-intensifying anti-Mexican sentiment , Mexican Americans divide into two camps . One group , according to Gutierrez , empathizes with immigrants . This group , characterized by Gutierrez as primarily working class , often made up of long-term Mexican residents of the U.S. , sees the mirrors rather than the walls . They make the shared experience of discrimination primary in shaping their views of Mexican immigration . The other side , perhaps best exemplified by the League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ) , gives primacy to their identity as Americans . As Gutierrez points out , however , even this position is not without its contradictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , places where U.S-born Mexicans and Mexican immigrants could and did live side by side , where the two groups were linked by threads of friendship , kinship and work made the ambivalence , and the contradictions , difficult to escape . <p> The Great Depression of the 1930s , along with the events of the 1940s , including the introduction of the Bracero Program and the attendant increasing undocumented migration , leads to further internal divisions within the Mexican American community vis-a-vis Mexican immigration . Gutierrez 's analysis of these two decades reveals a fascinating interplay of class , ethnicity , nationality and identity . While organizations like the then largely assimilationist-LULAC could call for immigration restriction on the basis that Mexican Texas faced discrimination stemming not from anti-Tejano sentiments , but from anti-immigrant reactions , others like the Confederacion de Uniones Obreras Mexicanas ( CUOM ) could call on both governments to halt the flow of Mexican immigrants while still urging the creation of what Gutierrez calls a " separate , almost autonomous ethnic Mexican community " in the Southwest ( p. 104 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1939 , represented yet a third alternative as it urged all ethnic Mexicans , citizen and immigrant alike , to work together , asserting that there was no difference in the conditions faced by the two groups . Any difference was a matter only of degree . <p> World War II and the subsequent Cold War further influenced Mexican American/ Mexican immigrant relations . Renewed ethnic hostility , as evidenced by California 's Sleepy Lagoon case , and the Zoot Suit riots , along with the creation of the Bracero Program which brought thousands of temporary Mexican workers into the United States , and , finally , the sudden growth of undocumented migration resulted in a paradox . In response to these kinds of events , Mexican American organizations like the American G.I. Forum and the National Agricultural Workers Union renewed their support of more restrictive immigration laws and the end of the Bracero Program . At the same time , however , these events also laid the foundation for " more sympathetic attitudes " toward Mexican immigrants ( p. 178 ) . By the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican Americans as well as long-term Mexican residents became the targets of anti-immigrant attitudes and actions ( p. 163 ) . In addition , government actions such as Operation Wetback , a massive deportation campaign of the early 1950s , led some Mexican American organizations , including LULAC and the American GI Forum , to join with the Community Service Organization ( CSO ) in beginning to talk about immigrant rights . <p> By the Cold War , the connection between the civil rights of Mexican Americans and the rights of immigrants was evident . This fundamental reassessment , as Gutierrez labels it , on the part of Mexican American organizations led to further changes of attitude among Mexican American organizations in the following decade . <p> With the emergence of the Chicano movement in the 1960s , a movement asserting cultural and ethnic pride , organizations began an even more serious reassessment of the connections between Mexican " immigration , Chicano ethnicity , and the status of Mexican Americans in the United States " ( p. 191 ) . Chicano activists no longer accepted the view , so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants represented a threat to Mexican Americans . Leading the way was el Centro de Accion Social Autonoma ( CASA ) , established in 1968 to provide services to undocumented immigrants . CASA , with its philosophy that Mexican Americans and Mexicans were a people " sin fronteras " represented the tremendous change . But even moderate Mexican American organizations began to revise their positions by the 1970s . As Congress , the country and the Mexican American community participated in the often-heated debate surrounding immigration issues in the 1970s , organizations with diverse philosophies and ideologies began to adopt the view that what hurt Mexican immigrants could ( and often did ) hurt Mexican Americans . <p> Gutierrez marks the First National Chicano/ Latino Conference on Immigration and Public Policy , held in San Antonio , Texas in 1977 as " the culmination of nearly a half century of Mexican American debate on Mexican immigration " ( p. 202 ) . Drawing together over 2,000 participants from a wide range of organizations and ideologies , the conference succeeded in showing " unprecedented " unity among Chicano and Mexican American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing diversity of the population , generationally , politically and ideologically . <p> Gutierrez ends his study with a thought-provoking " Epilogue " which brings the debate forward to the present-- the role of ethnic political leaders , the debate over controlling the border , the issues surrounding multiculturalism are brought together in these final pages . The rhetoric of the current immigration debate appears unnervingly similar to that of the 1970s , the 1950s , the 1920s , the 1890s . Gutierrez argues that the paradigm put forth by many U.S. politicians--that undocumented immigrants have created this nation 's problems--is " fundamentally flawed . " Rather than blaming undocumented immigrants , Gutierrez cites the historic and long-time alliance between business and government which has worked to " ensure the flow of immigrant workers ... for the maximum benefit of American businesses and consumers " ( p. 211 ) . Calling on Americans to take responsibility for their own actions , Gutierrez in many ways echoes the views of those organizations which saw the situation of Mexican Americans mirrored in the conditions of Mexican immigrants . In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants . Far from being resolved , Gutierrez argues , Mexican Americans continue to find themselves " compelled ... to make decisions about who they are , how they want to be perceived by others , and who they want to be as citizens of this society " ( p. 216 ) . At a time when the debates over immigration , ethnicity , and multiculturalism fill the airwaves , the television newscasts , and newspaper columns , Gutierrez presents an informative , provocative and extremely well-researched study of intra-ethnic relations in the Mexican American community , a study of the walls and mirrors between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants .

This series reviews books published during the twentieth century which have been deemed to be among the most important contributions to the field of intellectual history . <p> Henry Stuart Hughes ( 1916-1999 ) , a leading scholar in the field of intellectual history , has contributed an important essay about the forces at work in European social thought during the period 1890 to 1930 , when intellectuals shifted their emphasis away from the elaboration of large systems and proposed new thought processes which have come to characterize the twentieth century . Most of the text is devoted to the period 1890-1914 . Hughes began his book with substantial preliminary observations defining the territory of intellectual history while delimiting the main aspects he intended to discuss -- namely the " higher " level of thought using the works of individual thinkers because they refer to " intellectually clear and significant statements " , rather than the " lower " level which he categorized as popular effusions ( p. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entailed interdisciplinary research and purpose , as Hughes ' study did , encompassing sociology , philosophy , psychology , history , political theory , and literature . He defined sociology as " universal social theorizing in the tradition of Montesquieu and Marx " , rather than the " highly specialized and fragmented discipline with which we are currently familiar in the United States " ( p. 22 ) . Some sociologists never forgave him . <p> The 1890s signaled the birth of a new era . One of the major ideas initially enunciated during the last decade of the nineteenth century was a new interest in the problem of consciousness and the role of the unconscious as earlier assurances of rationalistic ideologies - liberal , democratic , or socialist - became inadequate ( p. 63-66 ) . The object of Hughes ' research was thus to develop an initial definition of " ideas that have still to win their way " ( p. 10 ) . In the intellectual turbulence of European fin de sicle , " consciousness seemed to offer the only link between man and the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The questions European intellectuals were attempting to respond to dealt with the object of social thought -- the character of individual and group dominance , the sources of social cohesion , the nature and function of religious sentiment ( p. 24 ) . Their first intellectual statement was to reject positivism because its absolute faith in scientific knowledge and strict materialistic determinism could no longer adequately explain human acts . How could irrational action be explained ? The revolt against positivsm and naturalism introduced other bases of motivation -- intuition and religious sentiment -- as elements and possibilities which had to be included if one was to comprehend human behaviour . More importantly , could irrational motivation be channelled for constructive human purposes ? The greatest thinkers of the era were those " who while fighting every step of the way to salvage as much as possible of the rationalist heritage decisively shifted the axis of that tradition to make room for the new definition of man as something more ( or less ) than a logically calculating animal " ( p. 17 ) . Understanding the issue of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining characteristics of human behaviour instead of , or rather along with , rationality and free will . This small elite group included Sigmund Freud , Max Weber and Benedetto Croce . Theirs was a narrow path indeed , dictated by the " abiding legacy " of the rational and humane principles and accomplishments of the Enlightenment ( p. 28 ) , to which Hughes himself was profoundly attached . <p> To solidly ground his work in reality , Hughes introduced a large number of thinkers , to continually ensure the linkage between ideas and specific cases . He examined the works of diverse intellectuals ranging from Weber , Durkheim , Pareto , Freud , Bergson , Nietzsche , Croce , Meinecke , Troeltsch , Mosca , Michels , Gide , Mann , Proust to Pirandello , and many more . To the wealth of their research and writing , Hughes added additional layers of understanding such as intellectual traditions ( mainly French , German and Italian ) , fields of knowledge ( science or positivism ) , and fields of social behaviour ( religion ) . He expanded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , the values ( socialism and catholicism ) , the social classes , and the collective experience of the First World War . These multiple layers add a formidable complexity , although some of the elements would have benefited from a more substantial analysis , socialism being one example . However , Hughes ' essay introduced the reader to the intellectual torments as well as the possible choices which these generations faced . The interpretive frameworks of positivism and idealism could not encompass the whole of human experience ; transcending both was the difficult task Max Weber pursued . <p> Obviously , such a large subject and corpus required a ruthless selection -- always arbitrary -- of individuals . Furthermore , Hughes chose not to include thinkers from peripheral regions of Europe , giving priority to seminal intellectual traditions which he believed were concentrated in the center of continental Europe . Thus , such great intellectuals as Ibsen or Ortega y Gasset are not a part of his essay . Nevertheless , what has endured is the breadth of this work ; a major contribution to our understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premises of twentieth century ideologies , especially fascism . Hughes , however , did not consider these consequences . Passionately attached to the legacy of enlightened reason , he focused on this aspect in his analysis of the great thinkers , sometimes distorting the overall appreciation of their work . Sigmund Freud being a case in point . <p> By his scientific and medical training , and through his objective of mapping the mind , Freud belonged to the sphere of positivism , the accepted intellectual conceptualization of his formative years . Despite his criticism of positivism Freud maintained a scientific vocabulary , even when he departed from his original goal of understanding the human unconscious and began to construct a coherent explanation of human existence ( p. 131 ) . This intellectual leap was not well received . It would be helpful if Hughes had gone further in assessing the consequences of Freud 's discovery of the unconscious . It completely disturbed the general assumptions about human nature and conduct , it contributed to the collapse of rational certainties about human behaviour and opened an intellectual space where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged the paradox that both intellectual creativity and destruction had emerged from a common source ( p. 185 ) but , remaining faithful to his object , he focused on the former . The experience of the Second World War , during which Hughes served as intelligence officer , had clearly demonstrated the necessity of understanding what had happened , how European philosophy , social thought , and the basis of political discussion had been so profoundly shifted that they threatened to shatter its civilization . It is also this destructive potential which continues to draw us back to the 1890-1930 era searching for answers . Hughes still provides a solid introduction to these crucial questions . <p> Regarding epistemology , H. Stuart Hughes explained that by the mid-twentieth century the historian 's research on human action and thought was confronted with the general assumption by social scientists , all of whom agreed about the narrow limits of conscious choice in human behaviour which follow patterns of repetition induced by material and psychological conditioning . Hughes justified the historian 's traditional interest in both deed and thought by reaffirming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Repetition alone could not explain human behaviour. 1 Not surprisingly , the most hostile review of his book came from the American Sociological Review. 2 But , overall , the book has been well received by historians 3 , and Hughes ' work has been recognized as filling a gap in historical knowledge . The author acknowledged that he followed Franklin L. Baumer who , in 1949 , suggested that intellectual historians should write " detailed studies of the interrelationship of thought in relatively brief periods of time " ( p. 12 ) . 4 Hughes achieved this goal . Research in the field of intellectual history began during the 1920s . The scholarly Journal of the History of Ideas was launched in January 1940 , brain-child of the American historian Arthur O. Lovejoy . Baumer 's admonition , as well as Hughes ' observations delineating the territory of intellectual history must be understood in the context and perspective of a fairly new field of historical scholarship which is still open to original research and model studies . He believed that this conceptual effort , in terms of epistemology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming triumph in the United States ; he believed the work of the historian had to be vindicated . <p> It is now common for intellectual historians to place ideas in their social and political context , which Hughes did not attend to . As an example , though he did connect the reorientation of social thought with the decisive political question of the nineteenth century , namely the source of authority and legitimacy , he remained aloof from political events ; similarly , he did not connect the economic and social upheavals brought about by the Industrial Revolution to the collapse of absolute faith in reason and human progress . Consciousness and Society was reprinted in 1961 , and a revised edition was published in 1977. 5 It has become a classic of historical investigation into the styles of thought which flourished at the beginning of the twentieth century . From a methodological perspective , it demonstrated a comprehensive assessment of a complex central issue by multiplying the angles of investigation to ensure an understanding of vast interpretive frameworks . It still holds its ground in both history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional input from other fields such as science , the arts , or education . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

" In the postbellum period , these same seemingly innocent Appalachians found themselves under siege from the modern world of corporations , railroads , and secularism . <p> In addition to this picture of an isolated and " pure " economic world , past historians also have created a contradictory set of stereotypes about race relations in nineteenth-century Appalachia .

In either view , the role of black residents of the mountain South is often neglected , but , in both views , Appalachian race relations developed in a distinct fashion from the rest of the South . <p> This idea of Appalachian " distinctiveness " has been criticized by a number of scholars of the region , and for good reason. 1 It is high time that historians acknowledge that Appalachia was not a region of isolated simple folk who either resisted progressive change or preserved traditional ideas of community ( depending upon your political perspective ) , while the rest of the nation marched on through history . We need to incorporate a more complex vision of Appalachia into our historical framework of the nineteenth century ; one that takes a more sophisticated approach to the region 's experiences with the central questions of southern history . <p> John Inscoe 's recent collection of essays , Appalachians and Race : The Mountain South From Slavery to Secession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the question of race . It draws from a wide variety of scholarship--some new , some familiar--in order to forge new questions for not only the interdisciplinary scholars working the field of Appalachian studies but also those interested in the history of race relations and the history of the South .

Were Appalachian whites resistant to the idea of slavery ? Did these whites resent their slaveholding brethren in the plantation regions ? Did enslaved African Americans in the region exercise more control over their lives than those in the Piedmont or Tidewater ?

Industrial slavery , moreover , served as an important component of western Virginia 's early salt trade , as John E. Stealey III demonstrates in his essay . The slave system actually was expanding in Appalachia on the eve of the war . Kenneth Noe , in his study of railroads in Virginia , maintains that if the Civil War had not eliminated slavery , " it certainly would have continued its march into the southwest Virginia mountains " ( p. 107 ) . <p> The personal dimension of slavery in Appalachia also forms an important theme in this collection of essays . Inscoe explores Frederick Law Olmsted 's narrative of a visit to the region as an important source for the attitude of mountain whites to slavery-albeit through the lens of a educated northerner . Cecelia Conway 's study of one of the most recognizable artifacts of Appalachian distinctiveness , banjo music , suggests that a blending of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit of interaction between mountain whites and enslaved blacks during the eighteenth and nineteenth century . <p> Charles Dew uses the personal narrative of Sam Williams , an enslaved Virginia ironworker , to view Appalachian blacks as " men and women who lived out human lives despite the confines and cruelties of their enslavement " ( p. 75 ) . One of the most peculiar manifestations of the " peculiar institution " in Appalachia had to be the story of Adam Waterford , an African American who apparently owned slaves in Tazewell County , Virginia . Marie Tedesco 's essay dealing with Waterford brings to light the strangest detail of all : Adam Waterford apparently owned his brother Walter at one point in time . All of these stories suggest that the study of the day-to-day negotiations between slaves and masters reveals much about the larger system of slavery in the mountain South . <p> The complex nature of race relations in the Appalachian South did not become any more straightforward during Reconstruction . Gordon McKinney demonstrates that African-American voters fought hard to win a place within the Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematically marginalized by both political parties during the 1880s . In their study of race and poverty in Clay County , Kentucky , Kathleen Blee and Dwight Billings argue that although impoverished whites who failed to accumulate property in the late nineteenth century could move out of the region , neither the steady accumulation of wealth nor out-migration was a possibility for Clay County 's African Americans . <p> In her essay on African-American education in Lumpkin County , Georgia , Jennifer Lund Smith explores ways in which blacks " used the paternalistic ethos of the white elite to their advantage " ( p. 220 ) . But in the end , the African-American community won only a partial victory when it came to education . Economic and educational hardship seemed as pervasive among Appalachian blacks as it did among their counterparts in the rest of the South . Even in the context of Appalachian history , in which the dual curse of poverty and low levels of education seem endemic , racial identity often served as a dividing line between the haves and have-nots . <p> The question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late nineteenth and early twentieth century . Literary figures and social scientists of the North constructed a vision of an " unspoiled " Appalachia during this time , which Nina Silber argues included a " distance and separation from southern blacks and from poor whites ' racial hysteria " ( p. 254 ) . Silber 's essay on the northern celebration of mountain " whiteness " as a projection of their own racial anxiety is important here . Despite the portrait drawn by northern elites of a racially " pure " Appalachia , blacks continued to contribute to the region 's history . But the presence of black Appalachians did not necessarily translate into racial equality . Joe William Trotter 's essay on the African-American experience in West Virginia coalfields demonstrates that the formation of black communities in Appalachia often occurred as the result of segregation and competition with white labor . Racial harmony was as unlikely as racial purity in the mountain South , and as these essays suggest , there was a marked divergence between the imagined and real Appalachia in regard to race . <p> A closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites were hardly strangers to Jim Crow . Ronald Lewis 's portrait of convict labor in the coal mining regions of Alabama provides the volume with one of its most disturbing , if revealing , commentaries on the New South 's method of developing resources with a form of labor that was , in some ways , worse than slavery . In the words of one southerner , convicts were better laborers than slaves because " we do n't own ' em . One dies , get another " ( p. 263 ) . W. Fitzhugh Brundage provides the final essay in the volume and yet more evidence contradicting claims of Appalachian distinctiveness in the Jim Crow Era . Brundage finds that the frequency and severity of lynching in Appalachia resembled that of the rest of the South , and concludes that the region was " neither blessed by exceptionally benign race relations nor cursed by implacable race hatred " ( p. 302 ) <p> In the end , these essays suggest a new role for Appalachia within the larger history of the South , and of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , and in some ways unique--perhaps in the same way that South Carolina was different from Virginia , or that the cases of New Orleans or Louisville are unique within southern history . But " distinctive " is a tough sell here , as the authors in Appalachians and Race by no means suggest that the mountain South falls in line with the old stereotypes that painted the region with broad strokes of " innocent , " " backward , " or " pure . " These essays suggest that the historical experiences of mountain whites and blacks belong in the larger cultural pastiche of the South . In future studies of the region , we can only hope that the old stereotypes finally are laid to rest and Appalachia 's place within the scope of southern history will be appreciated . " <p> 1 .

In the case of the compact book under review here , the topic proffered to achieve this goal is the until recently often overlooked 1680 revolt ( also known as Pope 's Revolt ) of the Pueblos against the Spanish settlers who had occupied territory in what is now New Mexico . <p> Right off the top the book 's presentation promises a well-crafted work , and the reader is not disappointed . Each section , from the title page through to the final bibliographic essay , has a professional look , with the details--such as endnotes--done in a scholarly manner . In addition , special instructional sections , such as " A Note for Students " ( appearing just before the contents ) , provide insights into the rudiments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being to both enlighten and motivate student readers . <p> The events and principal characters relating to the revolt are presented in a bare-bones , but nonetheless insightful and informative , introduction , the second part of which consists of an historiographical essay in which Weber places the five essays that make up the bulk of the book within their historical context . The introduction itself provides a useful model for those wishing to illustrate to students the way writing can be at once minimal and meaningful . Although just thirteen pages long , the introduction more than adequately summarizes both the " facts " of the revolt and the evolution of the historical writing that has described it . <p> Touched on in the introduction is one of the key points students need to realize when examining native history : that the sources for our understanding of native groups are often limited and one-sided . Although more could be said about this , Weber is careful to lay out the difficulties of reconstructing the native perspective , and how historians now use a variety of sources and methodologies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era . Of course the aim is to achieve a balance , as Weber suggests , for " without careful reconstructions of the past ... we would be vulnerable to mythmakers who demonize all Indians or those who categorically ennoble them , and we would have no argument to offer against those who caricature Spaniards as villains or heroes " ( p. vi ) . <p> In recent years , Weber notes , historical sensibilities have begun to change , so that the Pueblo revolt has now taken its place in textbooks along side other native uprisings , such as the Wampanoag revolt against the English ( 1675-76 ) , led by chief Metacom ( and dubbed King Philip 's War ) . The appearance of the Pueblo revolt in textbooks is fortunate , for it provides users of Weber 's book with a convenient starting point for a discussion of the event . Do textbooks simply present the facts , or do they attempt to explain the reasons behind the revolt ? And if explanations are provided , how do these fit in with the viewpoints expressed by Weber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Passages : A History of the United States ( Fort Worth : Harcourt College Publishers , 2000 ) and The American Journey : A History of the United States ( Upper Saddle River , N.J. : Prentice Hall , 1998 ) , choose to explain the revolt as a combination of factors , all of which are analyzed in greater detail in Weber 's collection . In keeping with the current trend to write more inclusive histories that deal with the experiences of the colonized as well as the colonizers and colonists , students now have the opportunity to discover more varied interpretations of the development of the United States . <p> While the decision as to which essays to include might be challenged , especially by those more intimately involved in the study of the Southwest than myself , the intention in this review is not to critique the choices but , rather , to focus on how beneficial the volume as a whole might be for students in ( North ) American history survey courses . <p> What needs to be kept in mind is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinions so that students can appreciate that issues can be approached in a variety of ways . The essays do provide sufficiently diverse perspectives and/or interpretations of the topic under examination to meet this goal . If other points of view were deemed essential to the understanding of the revolt , instructors could add these to the mix as well . Indeed , finding additional sources might make for an interesting assignment . <p> Befitting a book intended to instruct , each article is preceded by a brief synopsis of the author 's thesis , with a discussion of its importance or significance . Several " Questions for a Closer Reading " are also provided to give students " food for thought " as they approach the essays . For example , in the first article , Henry Warner Bowden 's " Spanish Missions , Cultural Conflict , and the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 , " Weber advises the reader to consider Spanish Catholicism versus Pueblo religious beliefs , and whether Bowden presents a convincing argument that the " Pueblos ' religious beliefs were more important than Apache raids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 ) . <p> The second article , Ramon A. Gutierrez 's " Franciscans and the Pueblo Revolt , " presents a quite different opinion . Unlike the Franciscans in Bowden 's essay , Gutierrez portrays the missionaries " as skillful manipulators of Indians , whose beliefs the priests understood in general if not in particular " ( p. 39 ) . Gutierrez 's piece is beneficial not only for its alternative view , but also for its inclusion and treatment of ( translated ) first-hand reports . Primary sources are useful not only to point out ( in this case ) Eurocentric biases , but also because they illustrate how historians interpret them in the creation of history . If this reviewer were to add anything to the book it would be a sampling of primary sources . Students can benefit from looking at and interpreting the same primary sources as the professional scholars . Primary sources also help the students to " get inside the heads " of people in the past--to try and understand individuals ' motivations and experiences from their perspective . Peeling away the layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story . If our goal as teachers is to make history " real " to the students , then primary sources need to be incorporated into our work . <p> Juxtaposed between the essays best suited for comparison ( i.e. , first vs. second and fourth vs. fifth ) is Van Hastings Garner 's " Seventeenth-Century New Mexico , " which asserts that " drought , famine , and Apache raids of the 1670s " ( p. 55 ) were the essential causes of the revolt . Garner sees these events as adding to an already weakened Spanish-Indian relationship . This relationship forms part of the discussion in the book 's fourth article , Angelio Chavez 's " Pohe-yemo 's Representative and the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 . " Here , however , the author 's Catholic-Hispanic background--he entered a Franciscan seminary in 1924 and served as a priest until his death in 1996--must be taken into account when assessing the Spanish missionaries . More useful is Chavez 's illumination of Pueblo religion and mythology , and his argument that since Pueblos were generally " satisfied with things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took a non-Pueblo to lead the revolt . <p> This position is challenged by the final entry , Andrew L. Knaut 's " Acculturation and Miscegenation : The Changing Face of the Spanish Presence in New Mexico . " Here the author argues that " miscegenation and acculturation did not lead to harmony ... , but rather contributed to the ... revolt " ( p. 115 ) . In contrast to Chavez , Knaut argues that Pueblos had more than enough reason and ample ability to lead the uprising . <p> The book concludes with a brief " Making Connections " section , wherein the major points and contrasts of the articles are examined and where readers are asked to come to their own conclusions . The final part of the book contains a bibliographic essay , wherein Weber offers his " Suggestions for Further Reading . " Like other sections this is a brief , but respectable , overview of the area . For this reviewer 's part , more attention could be paid to similarities outside the Spanish colonial experience , such as the interesting comparison that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jesuits in Ontario . Many members of both orders envisioned suffering and/or martyrdom as the ultimate expression of their faith . <p> In conclusion , What Caused the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 is a very pleasing book that could be used in a variety of ways within the survey course format . For example , the book could be a useful resource for those courses which include a tutorial or seminar component . Debates could be generated by asking students to discuss the revolt under the broad questions posed by Weber . But What Caused the Pueblo Revolt does not have to be confined to the tutorial setting . By gathering a variety of interpretations into one volume , Weber has created a valuable research resource , which would be very helpful for students writing term papers on topics such as native-white relations , Spanish colonialism , or the experiences of the colonized and the colonizers . Indeed , one might wish that other topics would receive the same kind of treatment . But not all historical events have generated the kind of variety of interpretation that the Pueblo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historians at Work series is diversity of opinion . Topics that provoke little controversy would not work in this format . <p> Weber suggests that " As with other moments in time , the Pueblo Revolt is gone . It lives on only in oral traditions , in the written words of those who witnessed it , and in the work of scholars who try to reconstruct it . " Hopefully through his efforts in editing this volume , the Pueblo Revolt will not only not be forgotten , but will generate further investigation by students and instructors alike . 69403 @qwx479403

In the past twenty-five years historians of slavery have largely written books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by these historians when describing American slavery . <p> Whether you connected slavery to European racism , greed , Anglo-American paternalism or patriarchy , focused on the centrality of slave labor , religion , family or community , considered the importance of the slave trade and African contributions to African(-American) life in America , or compared one slave society with another , one or more of these books would serve as a touchstone and point of departure for your work . And for quite some time we 've needed a new perspective that would clarify our thinking on the subject of colonial slavery while taking in the richness of the scholarship written on early American slavery for the past two decades . But putting together a synthesis of a burgeoning field while offering up a new interpretive perspective is a tall order . In his most recent book , Ira Berlin has delivered the synoptic , yet forward-moving , study of colonial slavery that scholars have needed for the past thirty years . <p> Berlin 's structure is one that , at first glance , seems designed more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections , based upon a three-generation framework : charter generations ( the first arrivals and their children ) , plantation generations ( growers of the great staple crops ) , and revolutionary generations ( those alive in the late eighteenth century ) . This tripartite temporal division is then crossed by four geographically distinct regions : the Chesapeake , North , Lowcountry , and Lower Mississippi Valley . Yet each of the twelve segments of this book is interconnected with and dependent upon the others , and in reading it , you hear no jarring discordant note when shifting , for example , from the North , to the Mississippi , and then to the North again ( ch. 7 , 8 , and 9 ) . Indeed , an initial concern that the book will be a twelve-layer cake rather than an integrated whole is unfounded . This is a tribute to Berlin 's fluid writing style , which sweeps up the reader in a strong narrative and moves steadily toward its conclusion , weaving together the strands from each chapter in a masterly fashion . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from the disparate stories with which he began . Shifting his story from general to specific and then back again -- from the creoles of the Atlantic rim with their polyglot abilities to the world of Anthony Johnson , sold into slavery in the 1620s at Jamestown -- Berlin employs small vignettes to illustrate the larger picture he constructs . The book uses statistics and some numbers to give fine detail , but the few tables are saved for an appendix at the end ( covering the slave and free populations of North America and the black population of major cities prior to 1810 ) . The flow of Berlin 's story is never interrupted by a graph or chart , and thus the book will appear more accessible to the lay reader . Small wonder that the book received the OAH Rudwick Prize or the Southern 's Owsley Award . The graceful writing style made this book one of five finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award in nonfiction ; in past years winners of this award have been journalists and memoirists more often than historians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth presentation and the well chosen word that will enchant non-specialist readers . <p> Almost as soon as Berlin introduces the generations concept , he aligns it with another , more subtle , interpretive tool -- one that I believe historians of colonial slavery will still be employing fifty years hence . Borrowing from studies of slavery in antiquity , Berlin appropriates the dual concept of societies with slaves and slave societies . While slavery in a society with slaves might appear superficially milder , because the line between slave and free might seem more easily crossed , slaveholders in such a society could still use extreme brutality towards their slaves because they were not central to their businesses . Other types of labor remained available and were used , such as indentured servants or the laboring poor , in the society with slaves . <p> In a slave society , however , slaves were the center of economic production , and " the master-slave relationship provided the model for all social relations ; " slaveowners sat atop the economic and social pyramid and jealously controlled most other aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have limned the picture by which American communities with slaves became slave societies , which generally coincided with the discovery of some product that could readily be sold for high profits : sugar , rice , tobacco , or , much later , cotton . This would trigger the massive influx of slaves , such that African peoples became the dominant form of labor , while at the same time other types of labor would decline -- and through it all , slaveholders would tighten the laws of slavery such that any escape to freedom ( legally or illegally ) would become much less likely . Meanwhile , slaveholders could gain a stranglehold upon the local political process and use their economic and political muscle to create racial ideologies justifying their slaves ' status . The seizure of power by slaveholders would mark the critical event that could transform the society with slaves into a slave society ( p.9-10 ) . <p> Where Berlin builds upon the society with slaves/slave society dichotomy and makes it his own is when he convincingly suggests that in America , this process was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffably from a society with slaves to a slave society . A slave society could become a society with slaves once again , and indeed , a few places went through this conversion more than once . For instance , the Lower Mississippi Valley might commence as a slave society , then transform into a society with slaves in the second quarter of the eighteenth century , and end as a slave society once more by the end of the colonial period ( ch.4 , 8 , and 12 ) . <p> Each geographic region 's evolution in terms of slavery was driven by the nature of production , and was affected by the democratic revolutions of the late eighteenth century , most notably America 's independence but also the Caribbean freedom revolt of San Domingue/Haiti . The idea of slavery varying between these two states ( society with slavery/slave society ) permits greater flexibility in how we describe colonial slavery , yet also provides a secure structure for including what , until now , had been geographic regions with slavery that seemed to defy typical descriptions . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift from small-scale to large-scale slave populations working in profitable staple crops , then slavery in the North -- which ultimately never grew into large populations and gradually disappeared in the wake of the Revolution -- must always be cast as an exception . But Berlin 's model forces us to consider slavery in the North and in the Lower Mississippi Valley ( another poor fit with the old linear model ) not as exceptions , but as alternative examples of development in which slavery followed nonlinear , or even circular , progressions . Instead of using South Carolina and Virginia as the baselines for comparison against which all other slave societies ( or societies with slaves ) must be measured , Berlin offers us a useful theory that explains the evolution , or in some cases , devolution ( ch.4 ) , of slavery for all parts of North America . <p> One acid test for the vitality and clarity of a book is to take a it into the classroom and try teaching it to others . I did that last year with Many Thousands Gone , teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the semester 's end , they were acquainted with parts of the vast literature of slavery , and in the course of reading for their own research papers , they had tackled many more works on the subject individually .

The words they used in their evaluations defy the conventional wisdom that you ca n't assign long readings and still have students like them : " clear , " " asserts a theory and then proves it , " " detailed without getting swamped in detail , " " a good read , " and probably best of all , " a book I will give my Dad for Christmas . " Perhaps no higher commendation than that may be found in any book review this year , and Ira Berlin 's Many Thousands Gone well deserves it . <p> other permission , please contact H-Net@H-Net.MSU.EDU.

Still stored in countless basement and attic collections , Life has the power to evoke both nostalgic longings for a supposedly " simpler " time in the nation 's past and condescending sneers from more " enlightened " folk who recognize the magazine 's limited perspective . <p> In recent years , Life magazine has become the subject of serious attention by scholars interested in the intent and the impact of what is arguably the most important magazine ever to be published in the United States .

Edited by the art historian , Erika Doss , Looking at Life Magazine is a lively and engaging collection of essays written by a number of leading historians , art historians , and media-studies specialists , including Doss , Peter Bacon Hales , Neil Harris , and Kozol .

While the book delves into some topics that the reader might not expect to see , other entries that one might expect to encounter are absent . For example , there are no essays examining 1950s youth culture , postwar domesticity , or the magazine 's coverage of mainstream American politics . However , there are essays that discuss wartime images of the Chinese , American corporate culture , religion in the United States , racial segregation , and the magazine 's regular feature , " Life Goes to a Party .

Not only does " Life " refer to all of humanity ( as Luce would have it ) , but also it more directly refers to the magazine itself so that , by analyzing the editorial decisions and the audience of Life , the limits of Luce 's vision become magnified . " To See Life " includes Terry Smith 's essay , " Life-Style Modernity : Making Modern America , " which discusses the relationship between a modernist visual aesthetic and the promotion of a particular kind of American Dream in the pages of Life , and James Baughman 's essay , " Who Read Life ? The Circulation of America 's Favorite Magazine , " which is an especially useful study that deflates the notion that Life was read by virtually everyone in the country . Similarly , in Part 4 , " To See Things Thousands of Miles Away , Things Hidden Behind Walls and Within Rooms , Things Dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essays revolve around topics that threaten the white , middle-class , conservative , and heterosexual " norm " that Luce envisioned . These essays include a discussion about masculinity and homoeroticism in the pages of Life by John Ibson , Rickie Solinger 's analysis of " The Smutty Side of Life , " and Erika Doss 's study of the career of Gordon Parks at the magazine , a career that included sympathetic images of Harlem gang leaders and leaders of the Black Panther Party . <p> The book 's organization allows the essays to move simultaneously in two directions : while moving in a rough chronology from the magazine 's founding in 1936 to its folding in 1972 , the essays also move laterally through the various realms of " life " that Luce promised his magazine would reveal . Using Luce 's words to name the five parts also works as a centripetal force that binds what might otherwise seem disparate essays . Ironically , the use of Luce 's prospectus works better in the book than it did in the pages of Life . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present a coherent vision of the world to an imagined unified audience flew in the face of reality . The tensions between unity and diversity , between the tidiness of the magazine and the messiness of the world are what give scholars so much meat to work with in analyzing Life . These tensions , which eventually led to the magazine 's undoing , are what most successfully hold the collection together . <p> There is no concluding essay in Looking at Life Magazine , and--to my mind--that 's too bad . While the final essay talks about the unraveling of the consensus mystique that Life tried mightily to hold on to , and does a nice job explaining the magazine 's demise , no real effort is made in the volume to tie all of the essays together in a fashion that would allow the reader to put the book down and say , " Ah--so that 's what all of these essays mean ; that 's why Life was so important a magazine . " Doss states in the book 's introduction that " single-minded or monolithic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge " ( p. 7 ) . Looking at Life Magazine 's essays certainly make that clear . What remains unclear , however , is how we should combine these multiple interpretations of the magazine with the undeniable appeal that the magazine held for its readers , in order to better know exactly how the magazine achieved its status as cultural icon . How many readers picked up on the homoerotic advertisements published by Life during World War II ? Were they the same readers who were interested in stories about the Chinese during the war or about " babes " after the war ended ? Of course , we can never know the answer to these questions . Pinning down how the magazine influenced its readers is probably impossible . Perhaps the best description of how we should view the magazine comes from the concluding passage of Baughman 's essay : " Life undoubtedly shaped the political and cultural values of many Americans . But they were a minority . Life was not to be found in most homes or apartments . And many non-subscribers occasionally sampling the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut or curled " ( p. 48 ) . <p> I 'd say something similar about Looking at Life Magazine . The essays in this book will likely shape the direction of future studies not only of Life magazine , but also of twentieth-century American culture . Theoretically charged , but written in straightforward prose styles , the essays do n't over-rely on theoretical jargon . Like the magazine it analyzes , Looking at Life Magazine is both important and just plain interesting .

Non-Caribbeanists and Caribbeanists alike will be thankful to have a single source to which to refer for the latest findings on pre-contact Caribbean migration patterns , material culture , and religion of the Carib and Taino , and interesting perspectives on cultural and linguistic survival of indigenous peoples in the region . <p> In his introductory chapter , Wilson concludes that the goal of the work is " to provide an introduction to what is known about the indigenous people of the Caribbean . We know that we have barely touched upon some topics , but hope that the reader can use this study as a starting point in a search for information about Caribbean peoples " ( p. 8 ) . The overall impact of the study easily meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social science jargon , scholars and students alike will readily be able to grasp significant historical and ethnographic debates . Readers should come away from this volume with a well-rounded understanding of societal evolution in the pre-contact indigenous Caribbean and the lingering issues of cultural survival . This is facilitated by the books ' broad cultural and social foci with four chapters alone focusing on material culture and economics , two chapters specifically on religion , and three chapters on language . However , its " strength " may also be its " weakness . " In short , by cramming twenty-two chapters on diverse topics into just over 200 pages , most chapters unsatisfyingly lack depth and leave the reader wanting more--which maybe is the goal of the study after all . <p> The Indigenous People of the Caribbean is divided into six parts . Part One , " Background to the Archaeology and Ethnohistory of the Caribbean , " consists of two useful essays on the types of evidence scholars have used to investigate pre-contact peoples in the region : European first-hand accounts and archaeological evidence . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Encounter , " consisting of three chapters on biological impacts of the encounter , European literary images of Amerindians resulting from contact , and a seemingly out-of-place chapter that focuses on ball courts on St. Croix and has nothing to do with the encounter per se . Richard Cunningham 's " The Biological Impacts of 1492 " is a very useful chapter in this section . Cunningham 's five page chapter lists the reduction in flora and fauna since 1492 with a special reference to Haiti . Cunningham helps us remember that European arrival did not bring , but rather expanded , the process of biological destruction . " When humans arrived in the island about 4500 years ago , their use of the fauna as food accelerated the depletion already caused by climate change , increasing the extinction rate to about one species every 122 years " ( p. 31 ) . <p> Following the opening discussion of the encounter , the book goes back in time to examine " The First Migration of Village Farmers , 500 B.C. to A.D. 800 " ( Part Three ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve of Conquest " ( Part Four ) , and " The Island Carib of the Lesser Antilles " ( Part Five ) . Rather than a chapter-by-chapter examination , I will address some of the more interesting discussions arising from these three sections . In Chapter Nine , " Religious Beliefs of the Saladoid People , " Miguel Rodriguez examines the diversity of sources utilized to determine pre-Taino religious beliefs and practices . Rodriguez concludes the section noting how certain Saladoid religious practices and images like the dog , legends of creation cycles , and " Pre-Tainan and Tainan construction of large plazas and ceremonial centers above ancient Saladoid cemeteries " illustrate the historical continuity in religion between pre-Tainan and Tainan peoples . A possible shortcoming of the chapter that reflects the problem of chapter brevity concerns Rodriguez 's discussion of how these people made wide use of animal symbols in their artifacts . It would have been interesting to draw Cummingham 's discussion of pre-contact biological destruction and species loss into this issue of animal symbolism and whether or not such biological change is reflected in these symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three is David Watters ' " Maritime Trade in the Prehistoric Eastern Caribbean " ( Chapter 10 ) . Adopting what he calls " an archipelagic viewpoint , " Watters helps the reader envision Caribbean migration as more than the popular " forward movement " northward and westward through the islands . By remembering that Caribbean people were primarily sea-going people , Watters effectively illustrates how maritime trade also included trade between the islands and the South American mainland . Thus , there was back and forth migration , leading to strong cultural , economic , and social ties between the Antilles and the mainland . As later contributors note , such contact and migration over time blurs our understanding of the actual origins and relationships between the Carib and the Taino--the region 's two largest populations at the time of European contact . <p> The sections on the Taino and the Carib build from this discussion of early migration issues . The chapters in the Taino section are brilliantly laid out to naturally lead from one chapter to the next . In particular , readers should note chapters fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language survival , and how the combination of the Taino world view and language facilitated the mutual misunderstandings between the Taino and Columbus . Thus , besides the persistence of Taino words in Castilian ( tabaco , hamaca , barbacoa , Cuba , Jamaica , Haiti , to name a handful ) , Taino cosmology actually worked toward creation of a dual misunderstanding : Columbus misinterpreted the Taino as subjects of the Great Khan due to his preconceptions and the Taino misinterpreted Columbus due to their cosmological preconceptions . Henry Petitjean Roget traces this second , lesser-known misunderstanding in " The Taino Vision : A Study in the Exchange of Misunderstanding " ( Chapter 17 ) . According to the author , the Taino interpreted Columbus ' gift giving as " rich with magical , supernatural significance--objects validating the belief that the newcomers were otherworldly " ( p. 170 ) . The Spaniards ' constant quest for gold and women drew the Taino squarely into their own creation myth . Consequently , believing that Columbus ' expedition party had arisen from Coaybay ( the land of the dead ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected them against death and sickness ) , the Taino sent Columbus further south to the " land of the dead , " and then directly sent the unfortunate Spanish occupiers there by killing them after Columbus sailed back to Spain . <p> Two brief chapters make up Part Five on the pre-contact Carib . The origins of the Carib and their language is central to these chapters and the jury is still out on whether or not the Carib in the Caribbean of 1492 were late arrivals from the mainland , an off-shoot of the Taino , or a little of both . Louis Allaire flatly rejects the claim that contact-era Carib " were in reality a group of Taino living under different socioeconomic conditions and mistakenly identified as a different race by the Europeans to justify their raiding them for slaves " ( p. 181 ) . Likewise , Allaire rejects the notion that Taino refugees fleeing the Spanish influenced Carib survivors ( p. 185 ) . However , he does accept that Carib identity was complicated at contact by the late arrival of mainland Carib ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gender illustrates the effects that captured Arawak-speaking women had on raising Carib children and thus on Carib language . These tricky issues of cross-cultural interaction complicate uncovering actual Carib cultural identity at any specific point in time . <p> The bulk of the discussion on the Carib consists of three chapters comprising Part Six , " Indigenous Resistance and Survival . " In his opening to the section , Wilson asserts that " the indigenous people have played an important part in the emergence of distinctively Caribbean cultures " ( p. 197 ) . Following a fascinating chapter in which Nancie Gonzalez recounts how she came to realize that Central American Garifuna think that the real Black Carib culture is in St. Vincent and St. Vincent Black Carib think it is in Belize , Wilson attempts to illustrate " the role the conquered Indian people play in modern constructions of Caribbean identity " ( p. 207 ) . Wilson focuses on how indigenous agricultural forms , linguistic continuities , and the Amerindians as a " symbol of resistance to external domination " have shaped the region 's culture over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of what might be called " political elevation " of Amerindians to a questionable level . Is it really viable to use the Taino or Carib for such pan-Caribbean symbolism ? After all , Caribbean peoples since the conquest have repeatedly rejected various pan-Caribbean initiatives for political and/or economic reasons . Is it really feasible to believe that these same peoples could tap into some " Indian past " for unity , especially when there was similar widespread cultural diversity and lack of pan-Indianism in that past ? <p> Ultimately , both the Carib and the Resistance sections suffer from little historical analysis . While the fifteenth and twentieth centuries are adequately addressed , the centuries in-between are rarely mentioned , let alone analyzed . What happened to the Carib in the intervening centuries ? When Garnette Joseph addresses " Five Hundred Years of Indigenous Resistance " in the book 's concluding chapter , the reader is misled by the title because the chapter only deals with the twentieth century--and that superficially . As one reads , one asks " what is surviving ? " and " what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious Carib traits as including ( though by no means limited to ) cricket , dominos , and Christianity . <p> Scholars looking for an in-depth analysis of the Caribbean 's indigenous history will be disappointed by this book . Likewise , those looking for an analysis of mainland Caribbean coast peoples or indigenous groups like the Ciboney in northwestern Cuba will find little discussion beyond the one chapter on the Central American Garifuna . Still , scholars and students can look to this volume as a jumping-off work to immerse themselves in the basic scholarship and utilize the useful bibliography . Ultimately , this volume should be of great interest to those studying Amerindian and Caribbean history for the simple utility of having a quick reference on central aspects of pre-contact migration , as well as Carib and Taino cultures . While not recommended for classroom use , this can be a useful source for lecture development , especially in Caribbean and Colonial Latin American History courses . <p> Finally , while so much attention is paid to pre-contact civilization areas in Mesoamerica and the Andes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the largest region of the hemisphere where peoples and cultures were virtually eliminated , making any survival that much more incredible and worth knowing . <p> the list .

I asked what group he was from , but he said he did not know , since none of his relatives identified themselves as aboriginal . However , he said he had always felt particularly close to nature , and so concluded he must be Native . As it happens , he could well have been since , starting about a century ago , some Newfoundland Mi'kmaq hid their ethnicity , even from their own children , to avoid discrimination . But what of his idea that being ' close to nature ' is a mark of being of Native descent ? <p> Sheppard Krech III 's book The Ecological Indian sets out to probe the basis and historical validity of the idea that people of native descent are , and always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed by or attributed to them . With a series of empirical case studies he investigates whether their ideas and actions were always those of ecologists and conservationists . He finds that the Ecological Indian proposition is of doubtful validity , concluding that , for example , Indians needlessly killed many buffalo , set fires that got out of control , and over-exploited deer and beaver for their skins . <p> This book is handsomely produced , and well-written by a respected scholar who draws on an enormous quantity of interdisciplinary sources and diverse lines of thought . While , as will become clear below , I am sceptical about its thesis , the work covers many important issues and I , at least , found it instructive to trace the author 's endeavour , despite the shortcomings , on which my review will concentrate . <p> In his Introduction , Krech examines the beginnings and development of the notion that Indians are by nature ' ecological ' . Most of these sources are not aboriginal people , but the likes of Baron de Lahontan , James Fenimore Cooper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savage ' ideal . In fact only two aboriginal people are cited in this section -- the nineteenth century Dakota Sioux author Charles Eastman ( Ohiyesa ) and the Lakota holy man Black Elk ( along with a cursory footnote allusion to Chief Seattle ) . Not until the book 's Epilogue does the author turn his attention to self-attributions of the image by several native authors , most appearing after 1970 , and often in the context of political disputes . <p> The bulk of the book consists of seven self-contained test cases , each of which deals with different groups , three of them involving prehistoric situations , and the other four historical ones . Each of these cases is well known to specialists , having been the subject of much scholarly controversy . Krech provides a detailed and generally even-handed review of these debates , along with additional data and his own conclusions . <p> In the first chapter Krech asks if over-hunting by Paleo-Indians was responsible for the extinctions of various large mammals during the Pleistocene era . He presents the position of Paul Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of his critics . However , both arguments seem to me based on a great deal of unwarranted speculation . While Krech is unconvinced by Martin 's position , he is not sure that Paleo-Indians were entirely free of any responsibility . But , given the very distant lineage that may connect Paleo-Indians with modern aboriginal people , one wonders about the relevance of this case to the issue being addressed in this book . <p> The next case also seems to me to be of questionable relevance . Krech asks if the prehistoric Hohokam 's irrigation practices caused salination of their fields , leading to their disappearance . He offers the contrasting views of two authors , Bernard Powel and Emil Haury . The issue between them is whether the Hohokam should be condemned for the ecological problems arising from their system of irrigation agriculture , or admired for its achievements , which are compared to the negative effects of more recent settlement by non-natives of this region of southern Arizona . Krech delves into the considerable complexities of the case , but does not resolve this unanswerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to the Hohokam . <p> One aspect of The Ecological Indian is based on the notion that North American aboriginal people looked after their environment , so the first Europeans found the continent in an unspoiled condition . Krech 's next chapter questions this . He notes that several authors have revised upward earlier prehistoric population estimates and , as a consequence , have increased their assessment of the post-contact population decline . Krech suggests that , apart from along the East Coast , many initial European reports of a pristine environment came after the aboriginal population had declined , so that the newcomers would have arrived in an environment that was no longer supporting its previous larger population . The land would have thus by then returned to the more natural state that the newcomers described . ( In the next chapter he further discredits the idea of a ' pristine ' proto-contact environment , suggesting that Europeans were predisposed to find the wilderness they described , regardless of evidence to the contrary . ) But in the end his convoluted argument fails to offer any real indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one the newcomers described . <p> In the next chapter , Krech asks whether the Indians were acting with environmental responsibility in their deliberate setting of forest and brush fires . The extensive literature on this topic shows that Indians in all parts of the continent used fire to modify their environment , serving a wide variety of purposes . While in some instances this was done to improve hunting , he shows that fires were also set during wars against trespassing groups , both whites and other Indians , and for communication with other Indians . Many authors believe they did so with sufficient skill that fire generally benefited the environment . But Krech refers to several settlers ' anecdotes about Indian-set fires that got out of control . However , it does not seem to matter to Krech if such mistakes were by Indians in unfamiliar territory , due to post-contact dislocation . <p> In the last three chapters the author examines whether Indians over-hunted , respectively , the buffalo , the white-tailed deer and the beaver . All these species were used aboriginally for subsistence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time as they provided market commodities . Krech thinks the commercialisation of deer and beaver hides lead to their overexploitation , but he also believes Indians were wasting buffalo even when the species was being hunted only for subsistence . <p> For me , this chapter provides the book 's most serious challenge to The Ecological Indian . While Indians had uses for every part of the buffalo , their practice of slaughtering whole herds , at a buffalo jump or in an enclosure , sometimes produced more carcasses than a group could possibly use . As a result , waste occurred . He documents instances of Indians leaving animals to rot , utilising only the cows , or taking only the tongues and the humps . However , the overkilling did not cause the extermination of the species , which only came after non-Indians and Metis hunted them commercially for fresh meat , pemmican and hides . <p> Krech proposes two ' religious ' reasons for the earlier over-killing . It was believed ( by the Piegan and Cree ) that any buffalo that escaped while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would then avoid hunters , so that it was necessary to chase and kill these escapees , whether they were needed or not . Other Indians ( specifically the Cheyenne and Arapaho ) believed that when hunters were unable to find buffalo it was because the animals had retreated to a land underneath a large lake , from which they would eventually reappear in endless numbers . Krech concludes that , given these beliefs , the Indians did not see overhunting as a cause of any shortage of animals or the need to conserve . <p> The next chapter concerns the white-tailed deer . Between about 1670 and 1800 the skins of these animals , previously the major subsistence species for Indians in the Southern and Eastern United States , became their main item of trade with Europeans . Deer were hunted in increasing numbers , in part , according to Krech , to satisfy the Indian 's craving for alcohol . By the end of the period deer were scarce or locally absent , which Krech concludes was due to overhunting by Indians . The population did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledges the trade in deer skins occurred during a period of intense disruption , he does not see that dislocation and warfare resulting from European settlement may have rendered the Indian 's conservationist practices ineffective . Instead , as with the buffalo example , he explains the willingness to overkill deer by reference to the pre-Christian spiritual beliefs of the tribes of the region . He notes , for instance , that the Cherokee believed in the reincarnation of deer , some of them believing this could recur four or seven times . From this he concludes that conservation would have made no sense to them . <p> The final substantive chapter is about the beaver , an important subsistence food source for prehistoric northern Indians , and later a mainstay of the fur trade . Their sedentary existence made the species especially vulnerable to overhunting , particularly with the introduction of steel traps . Beaver eventually did become extinct in some regions such as New England , although generally in areas where they were never particularly numerous . For the subarctic Indian Krech blames overhunting for causing reported declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors Krech does not sufficiently take into account , like incursions by foreign Indians and cutthroat competition , that would have undermined local conservation efforts . Also , since beaver meat was eaten , they were harvested more intensely if other game were at the low end of their cycles of abundance , something neither Indians nor traders could control . Beavers were also subject to epidemic disease . <p> Krech explanation of the overhunting focuses on ideology , saying Northern Algonquians ( i.e. forest Cree , Ojibway and Innu ) only showed interest in " today 's conservation ethics and practices " in the nineteenth century ( p. 206 ) . He notes that in this recent period Indians used family hunting territory to conserve beaver , while traders ' tried to influence their ideas of conservation . However , Krech does not take adequate account of the evidence that Indians made their own strategic decisions . <p> Krech thinks Indian spiritual ideas account for their purported failure at beaver conservation . He says Algonquians believed the bones of animals were set aside to be reincarnated , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " apparently had nothing to do with waste and conservation of animal populations until recently " ( p. 204 ) . I , however , contend that Algonquian religious ideas support conservation strategies , by providing a moral basis for human-animal relations , beyond the pragmatic one . But these strategies also depend on their ability to control their lands . <p> Initially , the target for Krech 's book seems to be the use by Madison Avenue and Hollywood of the Ecological Indian image . But in the Epilogue he sets his sights on modern Indians , both those who attribute to themselves ecological sensitivity , mainly in the context of political fights over resource issues , and those who in his view engage in environmentally questionable activities , despite the image . He sees a disjunction between the Indian 's environmentalist image and their historical practices . " Their actions , while perfectly reasonable in light of their own beliefs and larger goals , were not necessarily rational according to the premises of Western ecological conservation . " ( p. 212 ) . <p> In his analysis Krech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any game shortage is used to challenge the Ecological Indian , as if , for the image to be genuine , they would have had to avoid all environmental uncertainty . Anthropologically , Krech 's view of Indians seems curiously old-fashioned , presenting them as poorly adapted , without practical knowledge of sustainable production , motivated instead by irrational beliefs . By contrast , most ethnographic field studies of non-western peoples by scientifically trained participant-observers conversant in the local language reveal adaptations that involve rigorously empirical knowledge of the environment , however nonrational their other beliefs may appear . <p> There is unintended irony in the author 's evaluation of Indian actions against " the premises of Western ecological conservation " . As Krech himself notes , the modern rhetoric of aboriginal environmentalism involves a critique of North American society over environmental issues . From the start the image of the Ecological Indian entailed a ( sometimes-implicit ) comparison and criticism of non-Indians . From the Noble Savage to the Ecological Indian , these are indictments of non-native society , particularly its treatment of the environment . In the societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paid lip service , the record of successfully following them is less than inspiring . If Indians lacked these ideological principles , it is questionable if they fared any the worse without them . Given the comparative aspect implicit in the Ecological Indian image , I wonder why Krech did not frame the image 's empirical tests by means of comparisons with the equivalent impact on the environment by the activities of the newcomers ? Then he would not have just asked whether Indians were environmentally sensitive , but whether they were more or less environmentally sensitive than non-Indians . <p> Whether or not Indian groups historically acted with environmental responsibility , the contemporary claim that they are , by their nature and heritage , ' ecological ' is also part of their counter-hegemonic political ideology . Another study that has looked for the origins of ' Mother Earth ' , a concept related to that of the Ecological Indian , concludes it first appeared in the context of nineteenth century aboriginal political discourses with whites ( Gill 1987 ) . Krech 's data seem to concur with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whites that they began to explicitly attribute ' closeness to nature ' to themselves . <p> Krech questions the Ecological Indian as a particular interpretation of the past . A more useful approach would show it to entail an essentializing of a socially constructed primordial identity . As such , it is an assertion of the group 's collective self-identity based on a common past , real or imagined ( or both ) , and serves to unite and unify . These are all features characteristic of ethnic group nationalist movements in general , found today in innumerable and multiplying discourses around sub-state ethnic identity ( see , e.g. Wilmsen and McAllister 1996 ) . <p> Krech gives this perspective passing recognition and acknowledges it is an illusion to privilege any one version of history as objective . Yet despite these admissions he thinks it more important to discredit the claim , asserting that " it seems unwise to assume uncritically that the image of the Ecological Indian faithfully reflects North American Indian behaviour at any time in the past . " One of the reasons he gives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups ( p. 26 ) . However , throughout his book he accepts at face value the idea of the homogenised pan-Indian as the subject of the image that he wants to test . Otherwise , he would have limited the results of each of the seven case studies to only the modern descendants of the respective tribal groups . <p> The test cases each draw on prehistoric or historic data from times when North American aboriginal people 's most important identities were diverse among themselves and tribal . However , the image of the Ecological Indian is part of a more recently constructed unified pan-Indian identity . Today pan-Indian unity exists alongside tribal diversity , the one emphasising commonality while the other continues to recognize difference . Krech 's test cases only take account of one side of this complex reality , and ultimately hardly seem relevant to the issue of invalidating a pan-tribal conception . <p> The kinds of claims made about ethnic identity are not appropriately treated as hypotheses put forward as historically verifiable , which is how Krech deals with the Ecological Indian . Whatever their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecological ' , at least if left to their own devices . However , this study missed the chance to contribute to an understanding of the image , for instance , by showing that if the Ecological Indian is a social construction , it was constructed partly by , and by reference to , the colonizers , as part of an ongoing political dialogue . The image of the Ecological Indian also asserts moral superiority , an understandable response of a relatively powerless group in the political context of struggles over land and resources . Unfortunately , Krech 's failure to adequately take account of the political context of Indian environmental discourse means his book may play into the hands of reactionary and racist interests and prejudices opposed to aboriginal rights . <p> References <p> Gill , Sam D. 1987 , Mother Earth .

Every good Muslim must accept and follow the fiqh or " jurisprudence " of one of the " schools of law " in his or her daily life . While the Arabic word " fiqh " is often translated as " jurisprudence , " and we follow that practice here , this is a somewhat inaccurate rendering , especially if one acknowledges that the word " jurisprudence " can have multiple meanings in English as well . The word " fiqh " is derived from the Arabic verb root " faqiha " which means to understand or comprehend . " Fiqh " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " comprehension . " In the technical language of the Islamic law , " fiqh " is the legal scholar 's understanding and explication of the rules or " branches " of the law , as they are derived from the two divine sources or " roots " of Islamic Jurisprudence -- the Holy Qur'an , the divine text , and the Sunnah , or example , of the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) . <p> Dr. Bakhtiar 's adaptation of al Mughniyya 's work offers English language readers a survey of the basic rules of fiqh ( the practical rules of law governing the ritual and non-ritual behavior of Muslims ) as they are derived and applied by the major madhahib or " schools of law " in Islamic jurisprudence . The book assiduously reports these rules to the reader in the same order found in most classical books of fiqh , beginning first with the rules governing worship ( purification , prayer , fasting , and pilgrimage ) , and then treating economic and social issues ( charity , marriage , divorce , capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classify rules governing charitable obligations as part of the law of worship , they are dealt with here as an aspect of economic relations . This is apparently a concession to the convenience of the reader and it does not detract from the organization of the work . It should be noted that Dr. Bakhtiar 's adaptation does not contain any material on the law of sales and other commercial relations , crimes , torts , war , international law and diplomacy , oaths , or judicial proof -- topics commonly encountered in other specialized books of fiqh . <p> On each topic covered in this adaptation , the author describes , in bare-bones language , the rules of conduct for Muslims as they are prescribed by each of the four Sunni Schools of Law ( Maliki , Hanafi , Shafi'i and Hanbali ) and by the Jafari School , a major school followed by many Shi'i Muslims . I use the adjective " bare-bones " with some emphasis because that is essentially all the adaptation offers the reader . It does not purport to be a work of erudite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and the variations in those rules that sometimes manifest themselves between and among the Schools of Law . There are no analytical discussions of the rules , or their variations , and there is a noticeable absence of footnoting to known sources . While there are some useful footnotes , the citation form used is woefully inadequate and the footnotes often raise more questions than they answer . <p> For example , footnote 2 on p. 551 attempts to describe the distinction made by the Hanafi scholars concerning certain mandatory obligations that flow from commands found in the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah . This is a basic point familiar to many scholars in comparative Islamic jurisprudence . While the other Schools of Law make no distinction between obligatory acts commanded by the Qur'an and Sunnah , the Hanafis divide obligatory acts into two classes ( fard and wajib ) . This division gives rise to varying results for those who fail to obey a command , depending on the level of definitiveness found in the language of the text or in its mode of transmission . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform the three-unit witr prayer after the conclusion of the mandatory evening prayer , the authenticity of the Prophet 's command requiring this extra prayer is not free from doubt . Therefore , according to the Hanafis , the Muslim , while still obligated to make the prayer , is not considered an unbeliever if he , in good faith , disputes the authenticity of the command or its applicability in certain situations . <p> Although the subject is somewhat complex and academic , requiring some knowledge of Arabic grammar , the sciences of hadith , and principles of legal interpretation , the footnote does not explain the distinction well and the reader will likely come away from the topic with less understanding of the Hanafi position than if he had never read the footnote . To make matters worse , the reader is not referred to any other sources that might assist in clarifying the issue . The only bibliography in the book is a simple list , in an appendix of " authors consulted " without mention of any titles or other useful bibliographic information . <p> Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misnamed . It is not a true encyclopedia , and it simply can not be compared to other important encyclopedic English language works on Islam and Islamic Law , such as the massive Encyclopedia of Islam , Gibb and Kramers ' Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam , or Fyzee 's Outlines of Muhammadan Law . <p> All that having been said , Dr. Bakhtiar 's work will be of considerable use on a number of levels , in spite of these shortcomings . Its black-letter descriptions of the rules of fiqh on various points appear to be reasonably accurate and , because of that , it certainly can serve as a useful quick reference work for teachers and advisors on Islamic law . Anglo-American lawyers are familiar with and frequently use digests of the law in an effort to quickly ascertain what the law is on any given subject . Because of the nature of the sources in Islamic Jurisprudence and the absence of a code or system of precedents , it is very difficult to find a compendium of Islamic law that will digest the law in the Anglo-American style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the author should have taken more care in referring the reader to sources and in not oversimplifying some of the more complex rules , this book will be appreciated by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as the first attempt , in English , to digest the Sunni and Shi'i fiqh in one coherent effort . <p> The book is also improved by the addition of a fine introduction by Professor Kevin Reinhart of Dartmouth College . Professor Reinhart offers the non-Muslim reader a succinct description of the Islamic legal system and the place of the " Schools of Law , " including the Shi'i schools , in that system . While frankly acknowledging that Dr. Bakhtiar 's adaptation barely " scratches the surface " of the rich intellectual tradition of Islamic law , Professor Reinhart points out that the adaptation can serve as a " Reader 's Digest " of Islamic law that will be of some use to those who have a need to compare and contrast the views of the five major schools on particular practical points of law . For example , if one needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a valid Islamic marriage contract , the book ( at Section 10.2 , p. 400 ) answers this question , quickly , ( generally two witnesses required , except the Jafaris , who do not make the presence of witnesses mandatory ) as well as offering a useful comparison of the views of the Schools of Law concerning the gender of the witnesses and other particular details . <p> Similarly , in the law of worship , the book nicely summarizes the points of consensus and the fine points of difference among the Schools of Law concerning the times of prayer and the obligatory aspects of the prayer , including the recitation of the Qur'an , bending forward , prostration , and the sending of greetings . In many other instances , the book gives pithy and succinct comparative descriptions of the law that will put the reader on the right track in developing a better understanding of the fiqh and the differences among the schools of law . Although poorly documented , Dr. Bakhtiar 's adaptation is a short workmanlike comparative abridgement or " Reader 's Digest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited sphere it is a useful addition to the English language literature on Islamic law . 69404 @qwx479404

Gannon ( Department of History , University of South Carolina ) Published on H-Pol ( May , 2001 ) <p> Revisiting <p> Revisiting " The Problem of South Carolina " 1 <p> During the " secession winter " of 1860-61 , newly-elected president Abraham Lincoln consistently overestimated pro-Union sentiment in the South , asserting that the crisis was " an artificial one . " Lincoln believed that the secession of the deep South states had been provoked by a minority of rabid proslavery planters in a last-ditch effort to save their faltering political power in the face of a rising democratic impulse . Lincoln declared that the leaders of secession desired nothing more than " to play tyrant over all their own citizens , and deny the authority of everything greater than themselves , " and he would repeat similar claims throughout the months before his inaugural and prior to the firing on Fort Sumter . Secessionists , he told Lyman Trumbull , " are now in hot haste to get out of the Union , precisely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain apprehension among the Southern people that their homes , ... and lives , are to be endangered ; " therefore they faced the prospect of having their previously unquestioned political mastery challenged by a restive yeomanry . For Lincoln , secession represented the ultimate expression of a fundamentally anti-democratic movement conspiratorially hatched by a minority of elite planters. 2 <p> In The Counterrevolution of Slavery : Politics and Ideology in Antebellum South Carolina , Manisha Sinha offers a similar assessment of the secession movement in the bellwether state of disunionism . South Carolina 's secession from the Union in December , 1860 was , according to Sinha , the product of the aristocratic " Carolinian slaveholding elite " ( p. 243 ) . Rather than a vindication of all southerners ' rights , she argues , the secession movement in South Carolina was elite-led and possessed a profoundly " proslavery , antidemocratic nature " ( p. 248 ) . Taking issue with the so-called " republican synthesis , " Sinha asserts that the ideology of South Carolinia secessionists loathed rather than praised democratic principles , a trait that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its African-American majority . In this light , Sinha asserts " secession represented the overthrow rather than the fulfillment of Jacksonian democracy and the Second Party System in the Old South " ( pp. 2-3 ) . It was this essentially antidemocratic character of South Carolina 's planter-dominated slave society that produced " a rigorous critique of democracy " within its movement toward secession from the Union . <p> Taking issue with historians such as Lacy Ford and Stephanie McCurry , Sinha denies that the yeomanry played any significant role in fomenting secessionist sentiment . " The nature of southern nationalism , " she argues , " can be understood through the words and actions of those who initiated and defined the secession movement . " Thus , to characterize secession as " a yeomen 's movement , " Sinha claims , " seems both analytically faulty and factually incorrect " ( p. 5 ) . Sinha also discounts the importance of localized issues , such as the economic dislocations of the late 1850s , in facilitating secessionist sentiment . These issues were , for Sinha , " nonstarters " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secession " ( pp. 7-8 ) . Instead , the economic issues of the period were subsumed under the broader rubric of the protection and perpetuation of slavery. 3 <p> Sinha therefore emphasizes what she sees as the four key incidences in the maturation of the sectional conflict : the nullification movement of the early 1830s , the first secession crisis that came on the heels of the Compromise of 1850 , the movement by South Carolinians to reopen the African slave trade by the late 1850s , and the final victory of the secessionists after the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in 1860 . She justifies this exclusively national focus by arguing that " it is perhaps proper to focus on the sectional crises to understand secession and the coming of the Civil War rather than the mundane local politics that had little to do with the growth of southern separatism " ( pp. 2-3 ) . The nullification movement , under the intellectual stewardship of John C. Calhoun , set the foundation for what would evolve into a powerful and virulent " discourse of southern nationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the political leadership of the elite planter class in South Carolina . This discourse reached maturity by 1850 , when " the equation of slavery with regional identity " fostered a commitment to separatist ideals in the black-belt South , especially South Carolina ( p. 95 ) . This commitment was marked by its " undemocratic , top-heavy nature , " as " the average citizen had yet to be converted to the cause of southern nationhood and the democratic credentials of the 1850 movement were suspect " ( p. 97 ) . By the late 1850s , fears concerning slavery 's future ( and thus the future of South Carolina ) in the Union gave rise to a vigorous effort to reopen the slave trade , according to Sinha . Once again , this movement was led by " aristocratic " figures , and it did not adopt the characteristics of democratic politics . What the slave trade movement accomplished , Sinha asserts , was to force an all-important " ideological re-evaluation " of slavery in South Carolina which served to establish slavery in the public mind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This intellectual and political hegemony of the interests of slavery described by Sinha was the driving force in the " overthrow of politics as usual " that occurred with the coming of secession in South Carolina in 1860 ( p. 187 ) . Sinha consciously invokes the writings of George Fitzhugh ( p. 255 ) , in arguing that " secession was an overturning of the Revolution of 1776 and the principles that underlay it " ; the secessionist movement represented , ultimately , a repudiation of democratic politics and egalitarian sentiment in its desire to form a confederacy of slaveholders based upon the ownership of human servitude . <p> Sinha 's work is provocative , but flawed in several significant respects , and ultimately falls short of the claims she makes in her introduction about its novelty and impact . One of the most endemic problems for Sinha is her consistent mischaracterization of the historians ' arguments she seeks to refute . For example , she takes Lacy Ford and other " republican school " historians ( her term ) to task repeatedly for placing slavery in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it served to merely emphasize white egalitarianism ( p. 3 ) . But this is only a thin caricature of the arguments of Ford , McCurry , Thornton , Cooper , et al . Slavery was far from a " benign " reassurance for Carolinians , according to Ford ; it was , rather , the fundamental institution in a society where whites created a libertarian rhetoric ( slave-labor republicanism ) by virtue of their definition of slaves as " the other . " Sinha 's assertions that other historians have created an artificial separation between slavery and concepts like " liberty " and " honor " in South Carolina 's political culture are inaccurate as well . Contrary to her descriptions , the historians she cites have repeatedly acknowledged the fundamental importance of slavery and race in the way southerners framed their understanding of these ideals . Slavery is far from disassociated from southern discourse in the works of these historians , and Sinha 's characterizations repeatedly and consistently ignore essential parts of their arguments. 4 <p> Based upon a misreading of the historiography of antebellum South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinha thus exaggerates the ramifications of her argument . Her chapters on the movement to reopen the slave trade , for instance , argue that the scarcity of this episode in the historiography of the period belies its importance as " an integral phase of the sectional conflict over slavery expansion " ( p. 125 ) . Sinha 's argument that the planter elite of South Carolina won an important victory in forcing a reconsideration of the slave trade is ultimately undermined by the fact that measures sponsoring its renewal were defeated resoundingly in the planter-dominated state legislature -- hardly a sign that the political leadership of the state was unified behind the movement . Sinha 's claim to be writing a work " different from the traditional top-down approach " by emphasizing the " enslavement and political disfranchisement of African Americans " is also problematic ( p. 6 ) . Slavery appears in the book only in its relation to the planter elite . Slaves themselves are not mentioned specifically until the last pages of her epilogue ( pp. 257-258 ) , a puzzling manner of " emphasis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincingly refute the arguments of those historians against whom she contrasts her work . Several instances in her text contradict her flat declarations of the irrelevance of local interpretations of national economic matters , such as her assertion ( p. 14 ) that " it was not just slavery itself but the tariff issue " that made the nullification crisis such a watershed event for Carolinians . It is , however , the main part of her argument concerning the yeomanry of the state that ultimately falls short . If the yeomanry were not active agents in the secession movement , if they meekly followed the planter elite , if they did not subscribe to the same ideological world view of the planters , then why ( to cut to the essence of the matter ) did so many of them fight for the Confederacy ? Why did the racial ideals of slave society , white supremacy , and egalitarianism ( at least rhetorically ) resonate so deeply among all classes of white Carolinians ? Pointing out the undemocratic features of Carolinian politics , as Sinha does , will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina was unique in its inability to develop two-party politics , had far from equal representation in its legislature , and possessed a gentry that was vocally critical of " democracy , " these factors did not place the state completely outside American political culture . <p> The same " anti-democratic " professions of planters that Sinha uses as evidence of " counter-revolution " in South Carolina could have been , and indeed often were , uttered in other regions of the country . The Massachusetts elite , a decidedly non-slaveowning group , was itself hardly a model of political openness and tolerance toward the " lower orders . " Any letter written by Daniel Webster , Harrison Gray Otis , or a myriad of other northern political leaders would give ample evidence of a widely-held suspicion of " democracy " among the elite classes not only in New England , but throughout the country. 5 Therefore , one might ask , how atypical were South Carolina planters in their resistance to the democratic features that were making themselves felt in the American polity ? Although Sinha decries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups ( like slaves ) , her argument is predicated upon a similar unwillingness : she refuses to recognize the agency or significance of any group other than the tiny planter elite in the course of South Carolina 's march to secession . Thus the reader is asked to believe that the whole of South Carolina 's white citizenry swallowed any and all ideological and political claims articulated by the planters and submitted to their leadership in a sort of blind , faithful deference . By arguing that South Carolina 's political culture was shaped exclusively by this tiny elite , and that the state far outstripped the rest of the Union in its resistance to democracy , Sinha paints an exceedingly superficial portrait of her subject . <p> A word about stylistic concerns is also necessary . Sinha 's eagerness to assert her conclusions ' purported originality leads to a distracting habit of sarcastic and often snide references to those historians with whom she disagrees . On many occasions , Sinha refers disparagingly to the work of others in the field , and then fails to provide citations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretations ( see , for example , p. 102 ) . This type of side commentary would be better left out of the text . The overall writing style of the work would also have benefited from more editorial attention . Many passages throughout are confusingly written and repetitive , while the reader 's attention is also diverted by often tortured prose and unwieldy syntax . Also distracting is the idiosyncratic use of short titles in the footnotes ; Sinha uses only the first two words of a title in subsequent notations , leaving the reader to wonder to which source she is referring to when simply citing The Writings or The Works . These editorial issues would be small matters individually , but in their aggregate represent significant problems for the book 's audience . <p> While Sinha boldly sets out to refute recent historiography and establish a new paradigm with which to understand the role of South Carolina in the southern secession movement , the end result falls short of these expectations . Little new ground is broken in her argument ; rather than offer a model different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book moves over the familiar territory of the growing sectional conflict through an exploration of national issues , and posits an exaggerated thesis that ultimately does not answer the important questions it initially addresses . Just as the Civil War would disprove Lincoln 's assumptions about the nature of the secession crisis , the willing and often eager participation of the entire class spectrum of white southern society in that conflict creates significant concerns about Sinha 's assessment of South Carolina 's political culture . <p> Notes <p> 1 .

Peiss challenges current prevailing beliefs that the beauty industry was dominated by men to seduce women into narrowly defined visions of " beauty . " As she effectively demonstrates , the beauty industry , particularly between 1890 and 1920 , was almost completely woman-run : women owned the companies producing cosmetics , women sold cosmetics , female beauty operators used and endorsed the products . In short , cosmetics provided employment in addition to beauty for many women . <p> This book is well-structured . Peiss first discusses what types of cosmetics women wore in the nineteenth century . Many women made their own powders , ointments and salves from recipes . Already , in the pre-mass manufactured age , there was a different aesthetic for black and white women , and advertisements used white as pure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what might be termed the " golden age " : the era between 1890 and 1920 when women produced , advertised , and sold products . Next , Peiss examines the complexities of advertising , promoting and marketing cosmetics during the 1920s . A separate chapter is devoted to a discussion of black women because the tactics of firms marketing to white and black women began to significantly differ . Last , Peiss looks at cosmetics during and after World War II . <p> As Peiss traces the evolution of the production and social acceptability of cosmetics , she pays particular attention to race and different standards of beauty . If pale and creamy was the desired skin , the solution for white women lay in an array of powders , paints , and bleaches . But what were the ramifications for black women ? Peiss examines the hair and skin products sold and marketed to black women . Two of the largest companies within the black community did not sell hair straighteners or bleaches . The argument that black companies represented and created a black beauty aesthetic becomes tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whites tried to " pass " as black-owned . How cosmetics were used and perceived by various ethnic groups also merits attention . Although it might appear as if some firms promoted different " looks " for different ethnicities , even companies espousing " different kinds of beauty " used one basic ( northern European ) face in their advertisements . <p> Few companies from the " golden age " remain today , and that , Peiss asserts , was part of the nature of the cosmetics industry as it shifted and adapted in the post-World War I era . I was not convinced by the argument that women left the industry , or were replaced by men , after World War I. Peiss claims that the growth of cosmetics in the 1920s partly resulted from mass production and distribution networks placing products in drugstores . The implication of this argument is that women were not useful in this new method and were edged out , although I can not see why or how women would be unable to do this . At the same time that women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising firms charged with " selling " the products . <p> It is clear , from census and manufacturing data , that cosmetics sales increased from hundreds of thousands of dollars in the 1910s to hundreds of millions in the 1920s ; what is not clear is why . Peiss offers some new insights into this questions . To her credit , Peiss discusses advertising , magazines , and cinema as critical components , but I think she does not go far enough in exploring the relationship between visibility of cosmetics and the increase in sales . Advertising alone did not create the market for the increase in sales . As Peiss suggests , younger women bought more cosmetics than older women . However , there is no economic breakdown to determine whether the working girl was a better customer , and steadier consumer , than the upper-class woman . <p> In several chapters , time jumps forwards and backwards , and it is often difficult to pinpoint a particular moment in time .

Unfortunately , they were not referred to in the text although they are discussed in detail . <p> This is the first comprehensive book on the history of cosmetics in the United States in fifty years . It provides an interesting look at female entrepreneurship , employment , and decision-making in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries . The balance and attention given to racial definitions of beauty is an added dimension to the complex definition of an American beauty . The clear definitions and defined terminology--cosmetics , make up , beauty culture--were welcomed and useful . <p> This review is copyrighted ( c ) 1999 by H-Net and the Popular Culture and the American Culture Associations .

Ever since article 231 of the Versailles Treaty saddled Germany with sole responsibility for causing the conflict and based the payment of reparations on that premise , the Great War has been the subject of political and passionate debate . The nature of that debate has shifted in focus and intensity over the last three quarters of a century only partly as a result of the availability of documentary evidence . Causality has been assigned in every conceivable direction from individual leaders to Germany and all the Great Powers ; from the international system to nationalism , capitalism , imperialism ; from human biology to psychology , ethology , and anthropology . <p> Not surprisingly , the value of some investigations from a historical , indeed a common-sense perspective is open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of the origins of wars , ponders the value of certain quantitative studies of the origins of the war : " When one finds such elusive imponderables as the respective desire of the Dual Alliance and the Triple Entente to change the status quo not just quantified , but reduced to three decimal points , one hardly knows whether to laugh or cry . " ( T. C. W. Blanning , " The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars " London , 1986 , p. 17 ) . Mercifully , the volume by David Herrmann is not of that genre . <p> " The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War " posits the idea of a European arms race as largely responsible for bringing about the Great War . Of course , an arms race has been suggested before as an explanation of why nations went to war in 1914 , but most of the research has concentrated on German naval expansion and Britain 's attempts to maintain overall superiority . What is most original and successful in this exceptionally well researched work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a linguistic and scholarly feat of seemingly Herculean proportions Herrmann has trawled the British , French , German , Austrian and Italian archives - one can not in all conscience begrudge him not using those in Russia - to gauge not only the quantitative nature of land armaments , but also their perceived effectiveness . <p> On the crucial question of perceptions , this work is at its most penetrating , convincing , and original . It is quite easy to show , as has already been done elsewhere ( see the tables in A. J. P. Taylor 's " Struggle for Mastery in Europe " Oxford , 1971 ( pb ) , pp. xxv-xxxi ) , that there was an increase in defence expenditure , the size of armies , and the quantity of armaments in the years leading up to 1914 . But the fundamental question must be whether statesmen actually took account of military strengths and the likely outcome of wars when they made decisions during this period . Herrmann addresses that point and goes on to ask his supplementaries : If they did take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did they perceive the balance to be , and how did it affect their actions ? Did assessments of the strategic situation influence the decision for war in 1914 ? ( p. 4 ) . The author 's response to that last question is ' yes ' . His conclusion is reached after a careful , logical , chronological , and comparative analysis of the wide-ranging official and unofficial data on everything from national stereotypes of military effectiveness to modern technology and its deployment . He demonstrates that the military strength of the European powers was of increasing interest to the public and policy makers in Germany , Austria-Hungary , France , Russia , Great Britain , and Italy ; and that this interest provoked a sudden surge of army expansion following the Second Moroccan crisis of 1911 , starting with the German army ( p. 3 ) . The principal European armies became engaged in a fierce competition against a background of fear of imminent war and military eclipse . Thus , Herrmann returns to one of the earliest explanations for the conflict : it was a preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also , to a degree , for the Entente powers who feared that if they did not stand together in 1914 , the Entente might be irreparably dislocated . <p> The classic arms race dynamic of these years also gives rise to some unexpected imitation in the political realm . The crucial issue in getting increases in armaments and manpower was to obtain additional legislative appropriations . Herrmann shows how in Germany , then France , not only the Right but the Left was seduced into voting to fund increased army expenditure . The largest ever expansion of the German army was voted through in 1913 by the Centre and Right wing parties ; the separate funding bill won the support of the Centre and Left , including the Social Democrats . Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg garnered the support of the Left by breaking with the sacrosanct principle of protecting the economic interests of the landowning classes and levying a tax on increases in property values . The Social Democrats seized on this opportunity of securing the principle of direct taxation of wealth and voted for the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the Radicals were tempted into voting for the three years military service law because for the first time it was to be financed by a progressive property tax . <p> And so the leap-frogging went on until a perceived window of opportunity was finally seized by the Central Powers in July 1914 . By that time war , unlike in the past , seemed less unthinkable . Germany , without wanting a general European war , believed that the risk of provoking a widespread conflict was an acceptable one . The decision makers of nearly all the Great Powers were , for different reasons , affected by perceived changes in the balance of military power for the future , which meant not backing down in July 1914 . As Herrmann says : " A general war was not the preferred outcome for any of the participants . Diplomatic victory was " ( p. 219 ) . <p> While not denying the importance of other explanations for the origins of the war , Herrmann suggests that because of the transformed strategic environment based on the offensive , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navies , because of the general heightened sensitivity to imminent war , a general conflict was more likely than if the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand had taken place in 1904 or even 1911 . This reviewer was certainly convinced by the subtlety of the arguments and the quality of the scholarship . In a curious example of scholarship imitating the history it is writing about , Herrmann 's work will be in competition with another recently published and important book on arms races and the origins of the First World War by David Stevenson . The academic industry surrounding the origins of the Great War shows no sign of drying up . How different things would have been if the black humour of the alleged prize-winning spoof headline in the " New York Daily News " in 1920 had been true : " Archduke found alive , World War a Mistake " . <p> John F.

Freed blacks were the South 's most urban population , as they congregated in southern cities in search of new employment and community opportunities . The city of Baltimore hosted the nation 's largest black urban community before the Civil War , and therefore Phillips 's study fills an important historiographical hole . <p> Free-born blacks together with newly manumitted , runaway , and autonomous urban slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blacks in all situations , including a young Frederick Douglass , saw Baltimore as " an island of racial tolerance " compared to the rest of Maryland ( p. 235 ) .

Those who had only recently achieved freedom and " term slaves " formed the core of Baltimore 's black community before the 1820s . <p> Term slaves either purchased or negotiated for their freedom after a certain number of years . Because slavery was not crucial to Baltimore+s economy , urban masters found it more advantageous to ultimately free their slaves and hire workers instead . Term slaves exerted some important influence in shaping the terms and conditions of their gradual manumission . While serving their term , these slaves existed in a state of " quasi-freedom " ( p. 31 ) , and began to understand that degrees of freedom existed that could be bargained for like any other commodity .

Indeed , by 1830 free blacks constituted one quarter of Baltimore+s total population . Before 1840 , white Marylanders generally did not view this population of free blacks as a threat to the social order . The free black population was relatively small , had no political power and little economic opportunity , and caused no tension with white workers in terms of job competition . <p> In this relaxed racial atmosphere , free blacks began to build a cohesive community .

The first and most important effort was in the development of autonomous black churches . Reminiscent of the evolution of black churches in Philadelphia , 1 and indeed very much influenced by the progress blacks made there , Baltimore black leaders broke free from white churches that refused to treat their black members equally .

Once the community began to achieve the social and cultural marks of freedom , as opposed to simply the legal status of freedom , white Marylanders became cautious . At just the moment that Baltimore 's black community managed to put some distance between itself and its slave past , white Marylanders created a new intolerant racial ideology that threatened to destroy and re-enslave the free black community . <p> In the most crucial chapter in the study , " ' Cursed with Freedom , ' " Phillips analyzes how and why white society developed this new threatening ideology . Changing economic and demographic circumstances , coupled with in-state rivalries and a sectional proslavery reaction , caused white Marylanders to see their organized free black population as a threat to white supremacy and slavery interests . Beginning in the 1820s , Maryland 's and indeed the country 's economy experienced a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , between 1830 and 1850 , Baltimore experienced a surge of foreign immigration , mostly from Germany and Ireland , that brought close to one quarter million new workers into the city . Free blacks would face the worst consequences of these trends . Unlike slaves , who had their housing , sustenance , and other necessities provided for them , free blacks existed in a more precarious position and had no support during tough economic times . As many free blacks became destitute and asked for public assistance , whites used their misfortune against them , arguing it proved blacks ' inferiority . <p> One of the most significant factors fueling the white re-enslavement movement was news of the 1831 Nat Turner Rebellion in Southampton County , Virginia . White hysteria in the wake of the rebellion resulted in calls for both the abolition of slavery ( to forestall any such event in Maryland ) as well as tighter regulation of slaves and free blacks ( and an increase in slave sales to the Deep South ) . This debate largely pitted the more liberal city population against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , and brought Maryland squarely into the Southern proslavery debate . <p> By the 1850s , these circumstances coalesced into a re-enslavement movement , spearheaded by a democratic proslavery legislator named Curtis Jacobs , and provided the free black community with its greatest and most significant challenge--its very survival . Rallying around church and community leaders , the black community fought for the antislavery movement and against the Jacobs Bill by employing both traditional and more controversial techniques . Free blacks used speeches , petitions , neighborhood patrols , days of fasting and prayer , new political activist organizations , participation in the Black Conventions , and colonization as means of addressing the new threat . The community 's efforts paid off--when the proposals were presented to the public , reaction to the Jacobs Bill was hostile and unsupportive , and the bill was defeated by a margin of three to one . <p> Phillips 's analysis and interpretations are generally persuasive and effective . The writing is clear and readable , and would likely be appropriate for undergraduates if assigned in small sections . Although Phillips relies heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , he uses enough specific examples and personal vignettes to give the story a personal , human quality as well . There are a few minor cause-and-effect relationships within the book that could have been made more clear and precise . For example , while churches served as the community bulwark against increasing white repression between the 1820s and 1860 , it seems that many of the black churches were not established or stable until the mid-1830s and 1840s ( p. 138-39 ) . White and black resistance and hostility to the new churches presented an initial difficulty to gaining members or establishing other effective community organizations . While the structure of the book leaves the reader with the impression that the black community coalesced before the white onslaught began , in fact the black community gained strength and crystallized alongside growing white repression , making it all the more spectacular that blacks played the important role they did in defeating the re-enslavement movement. 3 <p> A final , small but somewhat troublesome issue relates to an aspect of Phillips 's style , specifically with the frequent use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Throughout the work , Phillips refers to members of the free black community as " free Negroes , " without using quotation marks or explaning , for example , that the word is legitimate because it was used during the period he is describing . While this does not interfere with the purpose of the book , it seems very unusual to see the word " Negro " in a book on African American history published after the 1970s . <p> Phillips tells an important story , not just in a historiographical sense , but also in human terms . Freedom 's Port is essentially a story about a community that realizes its potential and strengths , and uses them to ensure its very survival against great odds . Furthermore , Phillips hones the historiography of urban slavery and the antebellum free black experience by focusing in a very detailed and methodical way on one urban community . His work is part of a larger recent movement away from the generalized treatment of these issues over space and time. 3 Instead , the new historiographical trend focuses on case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize that blacks in the Upper South experienced these conditions differently from those in the Lower South. 4 In the Upper South , class and color divisions were not as significant in urban slave and free black communities as they were in the Lower South . Also , many Upper-South cities tended to be societies with slavery , not areas where the institution of slavery was fundamental to the economy and ideology of the white inhabitants. 5 Such distinctions are important to understanding the diversity and complexity of southern and African American history . <p> 2 . T. Stephen Whitman 's well-written study of slavery and freedom in early national Baltimore is more successful at placing Baltimore+s early African American experience in geographical , chronological , and historiographical context . Whitman 's study of Baltimore provides a stronger analysis of the role of slavery and manumission during the period 1780s-1820s , while Phillips 's study is stronger on analyzing and describing the organizational and cultural aspects of Baltimore 's African American community , 1820s-1860 .

Wade , Slavery in the Cities : The South , 1820-1860 ( London , 1964 ) is the traditional and still valuable work on urban slavery .

Hunter carefully highlights the complexity of black women 's lives , emphasizing their ability to construct identities outside of the stereotypes imposed by white employers and city officials . However , she situates this process in the center of public discourses about race and gender in a crucial period of social transformation for southern cities : from Reconstruction to World War I. Central to Hunter 's analysis is the dialectic of domination and resistance as black women developed tactics of survival--from institution building to the frequent quitting of jobs in household labor--in response to southern elites ' attempts to control African Americans ' lives in the workplace and on city streets . This carefully developed relationship allows Hunter to avoid either an over-romanticization of African-American women 's struggles , or an overly pessimistic view of African-American life during the " nadir " of American race relations . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suggested by the title , may be disappointed , as Hunter restricts her narrative almost entirely to conditions in Atlanta . Notwithstanding this , Hunter 's book makes an important contribution to the field of urban history as the first comprehensive analysis of African-American women 's experience of and participation in city life . <p> The first two chapters of Hunter 's book embed a social history of African-American women in a broader narrative of political and economic life in Atlanta . Her first chapter highlights the agency of Civil War era urban slaves who actively resisted the terms of their labor and thus hastened the destruction of slavery . Hunter continues this narrative through Reconstruction as ex-slaves flocked to cities such as Atlanta and shaped the " meanings of freedom " through workplace resistance , the exercise of political rights , and institution building . Although this story is a familiar one , Hunter highlights the role of African-American women , the majority of the black urban population , in contestations over what emancipation would mean for the black community . In particular , Hunter argues that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complete power over the terms of their labor . Hunter carefully situates these individual tactics of resistance in the context of New South capitalist development and attempts by whites to curtail the political and social freedoms of emancipated slaves . <p> Having established the basic framework of domination and resistance during and after the Civil War , Hunter then turns to an exploration of quotidian strategies of survival in the late nineteenth century . In Chapter Three , she outlines the geographical distribution of black communities in Atlanta which paralleled an inequitable distribution of resources by city officials . In response to municipal neglect , black Atlantans founded formal institutions such as churches , schools , and fraternal lodges that provided both a physical space for community organizing and a training ground for political activity . In addition , black neighborhoods were dotted with informal institutions such as barbershops , small restaurants , and juke joints that provided spaces for leisure and further cemented communal bonds . Household workers used these formal and informal institutions to develop strategies to contest wages , hours , and workplace conditions set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most dramatic of these strategies : organized protests by household workers in Richmond , Atlanta and other cities . Although relatively rare , strikes by washerwomen and day workers highlight the organizational ability and political acumen of African-American women who directly challenged both employers and city officials who sought to control their labor . Central to these challenges was the development of informal communal ties in black neighborhoods that effectively linked the private world of household workers and the public world of political activism . <p> The strident political activism of Atlanta 's African-American community in the 1870s and 1880s , however , was quickly followed by a period of disenfranchisement , violence , and segregation culminating in the 1906 race riot . Hunter 's next two chapters explore the impact of this " ascendancy of white rule " on Atlanta 's African-American community . In the late nineteenth century , black Atlantans actively resisted segregation of public transportation , lack of municipal services , and growing police brutality . Following Earl Lewis , in his book In Their Own Interests : Race , Class , and Power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that African Americans used " segregated spaces " of Jim Crow Atlanta to " bolster their autonomy and collective power and to escape exploitation by whites " ( p. 100 ) . Segregated spaces also allowed for African-American entrepreneurship along commercial strips such as Auburn Avenue , and these spaces in turn enabled some African-American women to escape household labor for jobs as seamstresses , clerks , or prostitutes . In Chapter Six , Hunter explores how social welfare institutions developed by African-American women and men supported this resistance to white urban rule . Imbued with the spirit of Progressivism , African-American women founded clinics , schools , reformatories and churches in the wake of the 1906 riot . The most prominent of these institutions , the Neighborhood Union , was a cross-class organization similar in style and purpose to a settlement house . Hunter acknowledges that the leadership of the Neighborhood Union held elitist views regarding working-class women 's leisure activities and domestic arrangements . But overall she views the work of the Union , and other Progressive-era black institutions , as drawing from a long tradition of communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban life is disrupted in Hunter 's next two chapters exploring black women 's leisure . The definition of " wholesome " and " hurtful " amusements came not only from white city officials seeking to curtail and control black women 's labor , but from middle and upper-class African-American reformers who placed working-class black women as the central symbols of a well-ordered and socially mobile black urban community . Hunter argues that although working-class African-American women did not draw such strict lines in their choice of leisure , contests over commercial entertainment and public spaces where interracial mixing took place became central to struggles over Jim Crow . Hunter explores one form of leisure in depth in Chapter Eight : public dancing . She suggests that dance was a particularly significant form of play and self expression for an African-American working class that sought to " recuperate their bodies from exploitation " ( p. 169 ) . Like other forms of commercial entertainment , vernacular dance and its concomitant art form the blues gained critics from the ranks of the black middle class as well as white city officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that undermined the work ethic and marred the urban landscape . <p> In a particularly innovative chapter , Hunter analyzes how tuberculosis became primarily associated with black female domestic workers . White Atlantans , according to Hunter , viewed African-American women as the purveyors of physical as well as moral decay in the early decades of the twentieth century . White hysteria over the " servant 's disease " led to city officials ' attempts to license washerwomen and control the domestic life of household workers who had access to private white homes . The African-American community , particularly black female activists , resisted these efforts and organized their own public health campaigns to address the problems of tuberculosis in black communities . Thus , the second half of To ' Joy My Freedom effectively demonstrates how the dialectic of domination and resistance occurred on a variety of levels outside the workplace : from dance halls to health clinics . Hunter ends her book with a short chapter on the Great Migration , highlighting the increased repression surrounding the war years , in particular the startling efforts to apply " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Migration out of Atlanta and other southern cities , was , for many , a final act of resistance against the New South power structure . <p> This final chapter , in its narrative form and broad implications , ties in nicely with Hunter 's earlier chapters on Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow . However , Hunter 's more innovative and sophisticated analyses of black women 's leisure and the significance of tuberculosis stand apart from the rest of work . Weaving this cultural analysis throughout the book may have been a more effective way of presenting the changing dynamics of domination and resistance . For example , Hunter argues in Chapter Seven , " Women 's behavior became a trope for the race , their public deportment and carriage the basis by which some assumed the entire race would be judged " ( p. 166 ) . Although this point seems central to community dynamics in Atlanta , it is only discussed in the realm of leisure where intra-community debates over deportment and morality are pushed to the fore . <p> Early chapters on the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrast , downplay intracommunity strife . For example , Hunter 's discussion of religious life after emancipation minimizes inter-denominational conflict that centered on black women 's worship styles and leadership roles . In part , this reflects Hunter 's use of two historiographical traditions in African-American urban history . On the one hand , she does a masterful job contextualizing the social history of Atlanta 's African-American women in the political and economic developments of the New South . Indeed , only by exploring the motivations of white city officials and employers can Hunter flesh out the domination experienced by black female workers . In doing so , Hunter 's work reflects the best of the " ghetto school " tradition which embedded African-American history in the political and economic geography of cities . Hunter also draws from the tradition of more recent scholarship in African-American urban history that examines intracommunity struggles and triumphs , rather than the structural constraints faced by black urban dwellers . Such attention to intracommunity dynamics allows her to stretch her analysis away from the workplace and reform institutions to the public dance floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of the city . In the end , however , these two models are not fully integrated in the text . Nevertheless , by incorporating analyses of leisure and emphasizing the central place that African-American women held in public discourses about disease , urban geography , and morality , Hunter effectively combines cultural , social , and political analyses to give us a new perspective on Atlanta and the New South . 69402 @qwx479402

This tendency , she argues , has its origin in the historical processes through which modern conceptions of homosexuality developed in concert with late nineteenth century discourses on race . By tracing the historical interdependence of both scientific and popular theories of race and sexuality , Somerville accomplishes two significant goals . First , she demonstrates the value of queer-studies perspectives for interpreting texts previously analyzed primarily through the lens of race . Similarly , she shows that works previously treated as sources for the history of sexuality are illuminated by critical attention to the way they mobilize contemporary discourses of racialization . Second , she identifies a historical shift from a cultural system that relied on physical traits to differentiate people from one another , to a more modern one which focused on desire as the most meaningful axis of difference . <p> In the opening chapter Somerville spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . She argues that sexological descriptions of the " invert , " a sexually intermediate type halfway between " pure " male and " pure " female , drew upon the methods and conclusions that racial science had mobilized in its descriptions of mulattos and other " half-breeds . " By the 1920s , however , the model of gender inversion had been replaced by a new model of homosexuality . This new model had no room for intermediate types ; instead , it worked through a logic of polarized sexual difference , in which men were men and women were women . The homosexual thus came into being as a person who desired a member of his or her " own " sex . <p> Somerville argues that this new polarization of bodies and focus on desires reflected a similar , simultaneous shift in racial thinking . Over the same time period , the cultural figure of the mulatto gave way to a new vision of the races as natural opposites , and increasing numbers of legal and social mechanisms were put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another . Thus the emergence of new sexual categories mirrored , and was profoundly influenced by , the hardening of the " color line , " the stark division of Americans into strictly segregated categories of " black " and " white . " <p> Chapter Two , " The Queer Career of Jim Crow , " turns from the elite discourses of science and law to the popular cultures of race and sex depicted in silent films . This chapter addresses the 1914 Vitagraph film " A Florida Enchantment , " which previous scholars have interpreted as a witty and lighthearted representation of gender fluidity and lesbian desire . In Somerville 's hands , however , the movie documents the intentional erasure of its legacy of racial violence and economic exploitation . This legacy , she shows , structured not only the plot of the novel from which the screenplay was taken , but also the Florida film industry of which Vitagraph was a part . <p> Debarred from participating in either sexology or the film industry , African-American women often used fiction as a venue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality . Chapter Three explores Pauline E. Hopkins ' novels Contending Forces and Winona , arguing that the barely articulated homoeroticism of both novels " circulates as part of Hopkins ' exploration of the barriers to desire imposed by the color line " ( p. 11 ) . Chapter Four continues this argument in the context of James Weldon Johnson 's famous Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man . Though the Autobiography has often been read as its author described it-the story of " some colored man who had married white " ( p. 111 ) -Somerville demonstrates that it is also a story about the sexual fluidity of a man who lives in motion across the boundaries his culture insists are solid and impermeable . Finally , Chapter Five examines Jean Toomer 's more radical " racial disidentification " ( p. 130 ) , that is , his refusal to take part in the cultural fiction of firmly bounded races . <p> While the first two chapters examine the historical intersection of race and sexuality in the nascent cultural institutions of sexology and cinema , the following three perform close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter contributes to the larger argument , the way Somerville shifts focus between the first and second halves of the book sometimes obscures the relationship of the parts to the whole . This presents a problem for the part of Somerville 's project aimed at persuading readers of the value of merging the conventional strategies and interests of queer historical studies with African-American literary and cultural studies . Certainly each chapter demonstrates the value of sexual interpretation of racialized subjects , and vice versa ; yet the difference between the text-centered analyses and context-driven historical interpretations remains striking . <p> Admittedly this difference is partly stylistic , but it also reflects the fact that Somerville 's historical argument about the shift from bodies to desires fades from the center of analysis after the second chapter . In fact , chapters three through five seem to suggest that both systems of differentiation and classification remained in play for some time . Therefore , the change she describes might best be thought of as an " uneven d evelopment , " to borrow Mary Poovey 's phrase about the changing ideologies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed in this light , the question of causality must arise--why set these developments in racial/sexual discourse in motion , and what sorts of factors governed the pace and extent to which they were adopted or explored by ordinary Americans ? Somerville 's answer to the first question is a brief reference to Gilded Age whites ' perceptions that their political dominance over the nation was in peril . <p> While this seems reasonably accurate as an observation about the political life of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , it is thin as an explanation for dramatic shifts in the organization of both racial and sexual thought . Neither does it speak directly to the question of why her three authors mobilized the culturally-available variants of racialized and sexualized humanity in such fascinatingly different ways . Thus historians are likely to see weaknesses in Queering the Color Line that will probably not bother literary scholars to any significant degree : and that difference suggests that the work has not quite achieved its goal of modeling a satisfyingly interdisciplinary cultural scholarship . <p> In the first chapter , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole , her discussion of the nineteenth-century tendency to think about both race and sex in terms of mixture rests in part on her interpretation of sexual hierarchies as analogues to racial ones . She argues that mulattos and " intermediate " sexual types occupied similar conceptual spaces , in part because emergent theories of sexuality drew on existing theories of race . But some of the quotations she offers as evidence of this borrowing refer to a hierarchy of races that did not , in fact , work according to the logic of mixture ( p. 32 ) . In such hierarchies , white Europeans , red Native Americans , yellow Asians , tawny Polynesians , and black Africans were all understood as " pure " racial types . It is true that the " reds , " " yellows , " and " tawnys " were often represented as " between " whites and blacks in terms of physical beauty and the achievements of their civilizations , yet their " intermediate " status was not understood to derive from any mixture of the extremes between which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as Somerville suggests ( p. 32 ) . This raises the question of whether the " intermediate sex " might not have been constructed as an equally " pure " type . If it was not , the parallelism between the logics of sexual and racial classification was less consistent that Somerville argues . It therefore seems possible that Somerville 's argument about mediation and mixture rests on a simplified understanding of the multiple structures according to which nineteenth-century racial science assigned value to different peoples and cultures . <p> To be fair , Somerville 's focus on " race " is explicitly limited to discussions of the conceptual and social relationships between white and black Americans ( p. 13 ) ; her lack of attention to the " reds " and " yellows " probably stems at least as much from her choice about where to set the boundaries of her study as it does from inattention to the Byzantine convolutions of the history of racialist thought . Yet her occlusion of those not-quite-intermediate races has consequences in the way she reads two of the novels that provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one , Pauline Hopkins ' Winona , the mulatto heroine is introduced in terms that make her sound like a character from Hiawatha : she has brown braids and trails her slim brown hand over the side of her canoe ( p.100-101 ) . Somerville 's very interesting discussion of Winona 's adventures in blackface and male attire focuses on the way that her Blackening makes her homoerotic romance with a white man possible . When Winona puts on the makeup that renders her light skin more visibly mulatto , she also puts on a highly eroticized gender ambiguity , so that she passes for " the prettiest specimen of boyhood " her white friend has even seen ( p. 102 ) . <p> Somerville shows that the love and desire between Winona and her white friend are enabled by the complementary fictions of racial difference and sexual sameness . Yet surely it is important that Hopkins ' narrative of racial and sexual transition and illusion is generated precisely by means of the contrast between the natural purity of the apparently Seneca maiden and the sexuality associated with Blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performs a sensitive reading of a pivotal scene in Jean Toomer 's short story " Withered Skin of Berries . " In this scene , a mulatto man who is passing for white calls himself an " Indian " as part of his effort to convince his homophobic , football-playing white friend that it is safe to give way to the desire between them ( pp. 147-148 ) . Somerville describes this scene as one in which " the black-white dichotomy is displaced onto an Indian/white axis " ( p. 147 ) . But while Somerville is convincing about the way that the desire between these two men is enabled by the perception that they are of different races , her interpretation does not explain the way in which this scene depicts Native American bodies as importantly outside the economy of race and sexuality that governs relationships between whites and blacks . In both of these instances , Somerville 's comparatively thin treatment of races which are neither white nor black limits her analysis ; and the thinness of this treatment ultimately derives not only from the way she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which she reduces nineteenth-century racial hierarchies to the relationships between whites , Blacks , and their " mixed " mulatto offspring . <p> Despite these reservations , in the last chapter Somerville does succeed at modeling a highly fruitful multidisciplinary approach . Here Somerville asks , and answers , challenging theoretical questions about the relationship between racial and sexual discourse for the present as well as for the past . Her chapter on Jean Toomer , " ' Queer to Myself as I Am To You , ' " offers a highly convincing account of Toomer 's fascination with the word " queer . " She demonstrates that he used the term as a sign for both sexual and racial ambiguity ; at the same time , Somerville emphasizes our scholarly stakes in making this case , and asks us to think about the relationship between our contemporary concerns and those of the historical subjects we study . The result is a breathtaking reassessment of Toomer 's refusal to identify himself as African-American-a refusal which Somerville sees not as a repudiation of his " real " race but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though racial and sexual identities were solidly factual , unchanging conditions of human being . In sum , though Queering the Color Line has some of the weaknesses characteristic of ambitious first books , it is a rewarding and valuable addition to the growing literature exploring the relationship between race and sexuality in American culture .

Imitating the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah , who bemoaned Israel 's sins even as he prophesied the coming of God 's Kingdom , American rhetoricians from Jonathan Edwards to Martin Luther King , Jr . have attacked society 's flaws while still retaining hope for the possibility of reform . With a gracefully written new book , Ecology of Fear : Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster , Mike Davis adds another work to this classic American genre . In the first six chapters of the book , Davis grippingly describes the various types of disasters that plague southern California today and traces the historical sins and blindnesses that have created the present hazards . In the final chapter , he outlines his vision of Los Angeles ' future . On the whole , this latest work from the author of the widely-read City of Quartz , is an eye-opening jeremiad in need of somewhat more nuanced historical analysis. 1 <p> Davis ' central claim is that the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and misunderstanding and that the result is a profoundly inegalitarian society that is apocalyptically out of balance with its environment . He begins with a chapter tracing the historically cataclysmic character of the Los Angeles environment and arguing that the city we know today emerged during a fluke period of environmental quiescence . During this span , the region suffered none of the mammoth earthquakes or two-hundred-year droughts that mark the geologic record . Consequently , Angelenos severely underestimate their environment 's potential for violence . But catastrophe in Los Angeles , Davis argues , is ordinary and inevitable . He forecasts " higher body counts and greater distress " ( p. 55 ) in southern California 's future . <p> In Chapter Two , " How Eden Lost Its Garden , " Davis explains how Los Angeles got into this predicament . " Selfish , profit-driven presentism " ( p. 65 ) , he maintains , has historically deafened southern Californians to the admonitions of prophets who have warned of impending environmental crises and suggested ways to avert them . Chapter Three links the environmental crises to social injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full measure of media attention , high-tech fire-fighting , and public financial relief , with urban tenement holocausts that go largely unnoticed and unabated . In Chapter Four , " Our Secret Kansas , " Davis documents Los Angeles ' tornado history , a problem that image-conscious boosters have managed to keep under wraps , despite an incidence of tornadoes twice as high as Oklahoma City 's . Davis explores in Chapter Five the growing paranoia over attacks by mountain lions and other beasts . Here he suggests that the recent spate of clashes with the wild kingdom , which have elicited comparisons to drive-by shootings and mass murders , are logical outgrowths of urban encroachment into wild areas . Davis completes his critique in Chapter Six , " The Literary Destruction of Los Angeles . " In this chapter , he lists , categorizes , and summarizes dozens of books and films that involve disaster in Los Angeles . The Los Angeles disaster genre , with its invading Asian hordes and anthropomorphized extra-terrestrials , he concludes , reflects regional racial anxieties . <p> In the final chapter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visionary . Instead of predicting cataclysmic doom or a world of technology gone berserk , Davis constructs his vision by extrapolating the present . He begins by tweaking Ernest Burgess ' famous Chicago school of sociology model that diagrams urban concentric land use zones . According to Davis ' version of the model , southern California 's future geography will consist of an urban core of homeless people , a violent inner-city , blue-collar crime-watch suburbs , affluent gated communities , and a gulag rim of prisons on the outskirts . He bases this scenario on current anti-democratic tendencies rooted in fear . Among those he cites are comprehensive surveillance of downtown space , private vigilante security forces , prison-like schools , public preference for replacing social spending with prison budgets , white flight from older suburbs into edge cities , and social control districts for abating everything from prostitution to graffiti . Such disturbing trends indicate to Davis the willingness of wealthy white southern Californians to curb civil liberties in order to allay their social fears , a tendency he projects into terrifying future . Unlike other practitioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repentance on the horizon . <p> In addition to revealing horrifying injustice and potential cataclysm that threaten the city 's social and physical environments , this book makes two additional contributions . One is to illustrate the connections between social affairs and environmental change . In recent years , social scientists have documented the ways in which the arrangement of society determines who is most likely to be hit by a disaster and how badly. 2 Not surprisingly , damage from catastrophes is often distributed along race , gender , class , and age lines . In Ecology of Fear , Davis illustrates for a general audience how this works . Enormous public resources , for example , have been spent to preserve Malibu homes from fire while comparatively little goes to protecting urban tenements . Also , after the 1994 Northridge earthquake , Congress began funding disaster relief by making comparable cuts in social spending . As Davis demonstrates , social arrangements may not cause fuel to combust or ground to shake , but they do distribute the costs of those events . <p> A second contribution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles environment . Again , Davis ' success along these lines lies in making accessible a body of technical scholarship . Citing a variety of scientific literature , he illustrates the many instabilities of the Los Angeles environment . In contrast to the humid eastern United States , where nature at least appears orderly and predictable , southern California 's Mediterranean environment is subject to sudden and often violent nonlinear events that stem from complex environmental interactions . Swirling hemispheric weather systems interact with Pacific Ocean temperatures to deliver years of extreme rainfall or searing drought . Scientists now believe earthquake faults in southern California may be " wired " so that slips on one could trigger a chain-reaction turning the entire Los Angeles basin in a giant epicenter . A recent spate of mountain lion attacks ( nine of this century 's ten have occurred since 1986 , including five in 1994 ) may be attributable to habitat changes that induce radical shifts in the lions ' behavioral patterns . Together , such phenomena illustrate how small and remote causes can multiply through feedback loops with calamitous results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nonlinearity . " Davis calls it " Walden Pond on LSD " ( p. 14 ) . <p> This book is also likely to raise controversy . Davis ' intemperate language will turn off some readers , as will his overtly left-leaning politics . Some of his audience will delight in the color and candor of phrases like " architectural Stalinism " ( p. 12 ) and " blood-thirsty Orange County Republicans " ( p. 131 ) and in his borrowed Russian dolls metaphor linking California Governor Pete Wilson to talk show host Rush Limbaugh to terrorist Timothy McVeigh ( p. 410 ) . Other readers , however , will question Davis ' objectivity and protest that much in the book is overstated . Davis himself would likely deny that objectivity is what he is after . No one ever accused Edwards or King of being objective . Objectivity , after all , is not the stuff of which great jeremiads are made . <p> A deeper criticism that many historians are likely to raise concerns Davis ' use of history . To be fair , his purposes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a window of insight into the present . Even on those terms , however , the book feels oddly ahistorical . In Chapter Two , for example , Davis blames selfish development-oriented elites , specifically the owners of the Los Angeles Times and the Southern Pacific Railroad , for " killing " ( p. 68 ) the visions of the city planner Frederick Law Olmsted , Jr. , who sought to preserve human and natural habitat by building public urban greenways . Instead , the villains placed the environment in a " concrete straightjacket " ( p. 69 ) . Davis is factually correct , but there is a richer story here than a mere struggle between saints and sinners . <p> Although elites were perhaps guilty of the greed and shortsightedness that Davis charges them with , their rapaciousness is not the most historically interesting thing about them . A more nuanced treatment of history , I would suggest , would consider the economic , political , social , and environmental conditions that made the elites ' visions make sense at the time . The Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control in 1917 , supported it in 1924 , opposed it again in 1934 , and supported it thereafter . The owners ' greed and shortsightedness presumably remained the same throughout the period , so we need something more to explain such behavior . In fact , the newspaper 's flood-control stance flip-flopped in response to drought , economic conditions , and corruption at the Flood Control District . Elites , then , like Davis ' " ' nonlinear ' mountain lions " ( p. 179 ) , apparently respond to environmental changes with sudden and extreme behavioral shifts . Society just might work as chaotically as nature . The contingency and non-linearity that Davis so deftly explains with regard to the natural environment , however , do not figure as much in his discussions of human activities . <p> These criticisms aside , Davis offers a compelling counterpoint to the widespread assumption that humanity 's environmental challenges are separate from its social problems . Despite much evidence to the contrary , we insist on believing that natural disasters arise from extraordinary behavior of nature and that humans have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune editorial lamented the " dread and destructive fury " of hurricanes . We " can do little , " editors said , " but watch in awe the ' great mischief ' of Mother Nature . " 3 Davis warns us not to blame Mother Nature . His work , in contrast , compels us to see hurricanes as ordinary parts of the environment , to ask why people live in the paths of hurricanes , and to question society 's mechanisms for distributing the costs of the " dread and destructive fury . " The Tribune editorial exemplifies the sort of thinking against which Davis has directed this jeremiad . He is attacking a paradigm whose fall is long overdue . <p> other permission , please contact H-Net@H-Net.MSU.EDU.

It is accepted , clear and established that every preceding Manifestation of God has prophesied the appearance of his successor to the people in accordance with their stations and capabilities.Some employed signs and concealed allusions.As for my predecessor , he strove to counsel and educate the people of the Bayan to an extent that can be neither conceived nor perceived.Nevertheless , there occurred what followed.One word shall be spoken , and we ask the people of the Bayan to be fair.Is there any passage of the scriptures that instructs you to hesitate about his cause when the succeeding Manifestation appears ? Say:Then produce it ! No , by my lord , the all-knowing , the all-perceiving.Leaving this issue aside , is there any place in the Bayan that instructs you to reject someone who appears with revealed verses , or to arise to kill him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the same sort of doubt cast by the dwellers in hellfire during the ministries of past Manifestations.I swear by the sun of meaning that if wondrous revealed verses are rejected , then no one will be able to establish the truth of the previous scriptures . Since the Point ( the Bab ) of the Bayan gazed upon these days , and upon what the servants would perpetrate , virtually the only things his exalted pen wrote were firm counsels , perfect advice , and beautiful sermons in mention of this subsequent dispensation.The Book of Names was revealed.At long last , give some thought to what his purpose was in entitling this work the Book of Names , and in mentioning therein the divine names one after another , as well as interpreting each . Then <p> he commended the manifestations of the names to their creator . <p> Heart of the world , do you have ears to hear what the dove of sorrow is cooing in this time , when the cry of Satan has been raised behind the call of the All-Merciful ? For , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme loss.By his beloved soul , no one has yet realized why the holy books of all sorts , and especially the Book of Names , were revealed.Thus has the omniscient , the all-knowing informed you.Where are pure ears , to hear the summons issuing from the precincts of divine unity at every moment ? Where are sharp eyes , to perceive the divine rays of wisdom in radiant words ? The subsisting one ( Qayym ) has appeared in the recognized beauty.He is the beauty of the year " nine , " who was promised to all.Even so , the foul odors of jealousy and hatred have permeated creation to the extent that it has altogether withdrawn from the breaths of the All-Merciful and the divine fragrance . <p> Say:People , do not follow those who deserve torment and on whose faces is imprinted the wrath of God , the king , the mighty , the knowing , the wise.It is hard to imagine what they would have done if the highest pen had not revealed these counsels and this advice ! No , by the one who allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than what they have done or plotted would not have been possible.It is astonishing that they recite the divine verses.By God , the verses revealer curses them and they are oblivious.Despite his firm and perfect counsels , the beloved of all creation prophesied what they would do , just as it came to pass and will yet become obvious.They showed sincerity and even subservience to anyone who disregarded the dignity of the cause of God , causing it untold harm.Behind the scenes , they call the people to themselves.That action is in secret , and this one is open.A little fairness is necessary.In the end , this youth has no quarrel with anyone.If he shows regard to someone , it will be for the sake of the cause of God , to manifest its sovereignty and honor its word.They treat with subservience , however , anyone who goes to extremes , so that they harm the cause of God and rebel against it.No one among the divine friends has arisen , out of sincerity and for his sake , to forbid the idolaters from committing these perfidious deeds.Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts of his creation ? Have rays of the lamp of divine oneness not illuminated the hearts of creation ? What has happened , such that the bodies of the people have not burst aflame at this fire , and have not been illumined by these rays of light ? <p> Say , caravans that travel between the cities of mystical insight on their way to the beauty of the All-Merciful:Know that the true dawn has broken above the horizon of the heavens of the divine will.Hurry , so that you might be enlisted among the troops of the near ones.Naturally , the lighter you tread , the better.Throw off the dead hand of false allusions and turn toward the precincts of divine unity.The pen of pre-existence says : Do you not hear my wailing and lamentations , or do you hear them but not understand them ? If you are unable to soar in the joyous heavens of meaning , at least take wing in the sky of words.If you do not comprehend the wondrous Arabic verses of this dispensation , then think upon the Persian utterances that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way might you find a path to the truth.I swear by the one , the fire of whose love ignited my heart so that even a downpour of opposition from all the worlds can not extinguish it:The Point ( the Bab ) of the Bayan had no purpose other than this subsequent dispensation.May my spirit be a sacrifice to his soul.He did not fall short in communicating my Cause , but the people have fallen short and transgressed . <p> Anyone who for a single hour sanctifies himself from veils and allusions for the sake of God and contemplates what has been revealed from the kingdom of God in the Arabic and Persian languages will , by God , detach himself from the worlds and lament for this wrongly imprisoned stranger.Impassive stones wail and weep at this divine word , but humankind is sunk in profound negligence.For this reason , the previous scriptures say that rivers will flow from rocks , but that from the hearts of the wicked nothing will appear . Truthfully has spoken God , the exalted , the mighty . <p> You should know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all divine meanings and mysteries are concealed within it.Blessed are they who attain it and extract the pearls hidden within it.Consider the radiance of the divine word to be like the shining of the sun.In the same way that once the sun rises , it shines on all , so once the sun of the word dawns from the will of the lord , it sheds its illumination on all.Indeed , I take refuge in God even from this simile , since the outward sun itself owes its existence to the comprehensive word.Think , so that you might attain knowledge.Still , the outward sun can be perceived with physical eyes , whereas the rays of the sun of the word are seen with inner vision.By the one in whose hand is my soul ! If the hidden aid and power of the divine word were withdrawn from the world and its people for a single instant , all would be lost and annihilated.If souls gaze with divine sight , they will see the radiance of its lights in everything.Likewise , if they listen with pure ears , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call is still being raised but ears are blocked , and the lights of the luminary above the horizon are apparent , but eyes are covered . <p> Wise friend , a physician is required so that perhaps the ashes in their eyes can be removed by the elixir of the greatest name , and so that the brass of existence can be transformed into gold.Would that the number of those who have gained insight into the beloved of the worlds , which some have achieved , could be increased.Thus might he make apparent in detail , from the manifest letters , the word underlying the infinite branches of knowledge.The people have been stricken with an illness , and curing it is extremely difficult , except for those who have been treated with the greatest antidote.This epidemic consists in people believing that they have attained mystical insight , and then supposing that God is like them.Today , most are afflicted with this disease , and for this reason they are deprived of the Eternal Truth and what is with it.Beseech God to render hearts pure and eyes sharp , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and God.Thus might they discern Gods purpose in the revealed verses.If the peoples had understood the divine purpose , they would not have remained veiled at the moment of revelation . <p> Even though they have for years recited the divine book , they never attained to a single letter of the meanings that lie within it , just as they remained altogether veiled from and oblivious of its purpose.Even though all these things are mentioned and delineated in the scriptures , all have remained deprived.It is to the extent that some of those who consider themselves the educated elite are ignorant of matters that even the common folk know.For instance , they assert that the Mahdi resides in a supernatural city , and insist vehemently on this statement.If anyone asserts that the promised one , on the contrary , will come into the world by being born , they sentence him to death.Note how distant and deprived the elite is.Then , in the year 60 , the veil was lifted , and all that had been concealed was made visible , as was the resurrection and everything connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these utterances that were recovered in the divine book.Everyone mistook the mirage for water , as was apparent.Beyond these problems , they also remained veiled from principleof mystical insight into the beloved of the worlds.The dust of misconceptions and the clay of illusions prevented all humankind from attaining the panorama of divine unity , until the greatest purifier arrived and washed the people with the most cleansed of celestial rivers , calling them to the radiant countenance and informing them of the good news . <p> Note that what appeared was virtues , of which all remained ignorant.It would be the indisputable truth to say that all of these virtues were hidden and concealed in the scriptures and that in the dispensation of the Point ( the Bab ) of the Bayan , the veiled faces of meaning came out from behind the curtain in the chambers of the divine verses.And if it were said that what went before was a concise mention , whereas thereafter came one who clarified and spoke in detail , that would be the truth , in which there is not doubt.If it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been apparent in previous dispensations--though all are wondrous and new--this saying is also correct and complete . <p> For if God speaks a word today that comes to be on the lips of all the people , before and after , that word will be new , if you only think about it.Consider the word , " monotheism , " about which all the manifestations of the Eternal Truth have spoken in each dispensation , and which all the adherents of the various religions have asserted.Nevertheless , in each dispensation it is an innovation , and its novel character can never be withdrawn from it.God breathes into each word he speaks a new spirit , and the breezes of life from that word waft upon all things outwardly and inwardly.Again , for how long and until what age and era can the traces remain visible , of the divine verses revealed by the Manifestations of both the inner soul and of the farthest horizons ? <p> For this reason , some of the people speak of illusory matters and take pride and become haughty about them.All of these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystical insight into the Eternal Truth and remaining firm , steadfast and unswerving in the Cause of God.It does not come from outward statements , as my predecessor explained these spiritual levels.Look , so that you might understand.For instance , the souls who have ascended to the peaks of mystical insight and those who remained at the lowest rank have precisely the same station in the eyes of God.For the nobility of knowledge and insight is not dependent on these attributes in themselves.If they lead to the Eternal Truth and acceptance of it , they are approved.Otherwise , they are rejected.On this plane , all words are mentioned on the same level . <p> For instance , what if God were to say , " I was born ? " This assertion would recall his saying , " He was not born , nor gave birth . " ( Q. 112 ) . Although this latter verse on the surface asserts that God is beyond having any likeness , peer or rival , it in fact leads only to the station of insight into humanity.For among the people , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even this distinction is dependent on Gods acceptance and will.In the dispensations of the Quran and the Bayan , the divine will preferred pure transcendence and absolute sanctification.For this reason , the brilliance of these utterances has established itself and become apparent in the hearts of the believers.Otherwise , that Sea of preexistence is sanctified above all these words created in time , and the most holy court is purified above all of these statements . <p> One must look at the basic principle of the cause of God , not at the high or low levels of verbal insight that have been achieved among the people.I wish I were able to make manifest what is hidden.My inability to do so derives from the way souls are veiled.Otherwise , he is the self-sufficient , the all-praised.At one time , he says , " You shall never see me . " ( Q. 7:139 ) At another he says , " Behold and you shall see me . " Yes , today every soul who affirms belief in what was revealed from the heaven of the divine will has ascended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived and non-existent.We ask God to aid us and you to be steadfast in the Cause , at which the realm of names was turned upside down and the inhabitants of the cities of creation were inebriated , save for those who were overtaken by guidance from God , the guardian , the eternal . <p> My supporter:Think aright upon what was revealed from the most high pen , so that the doors of infinite knowledge might be opened before your heart and so that you might witness yourself rendered independent of everything but God , the all-possessing , the self-subsisting.Likewise , do not think that the manifestation of the Eternal Truth is limited to causing outward knowledge to appear or altering some well-established laws among the people.Rather , at the time of revelation all things become bearers of divine emanations and infinite capabilities , and in accordance with the exigencies of the time and earthly circumstances , these become manifest . <p> In this regard , a summary was revealed from the heaven of the divine will in answer to a Christian priest who lives in Istanbul.Here , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the servants might become aware of divine , profound maxims that had been concealed from the eyes of the people . <p> God said : Your letter arrived at the kingdom of your lord , the All-Merciful , and we have grasped it with spirituality and fragrance , and have answered you even before you posed your question.Think , that you might know , for this is a grace from your lord , the mighty , the help in peril.Blessed are you , insofar as you have attained to it , and though it is hidden , it shall be revealed to you should God will and desire.Then will you see what no eye has witnessed.You , who are immersed in the sea of mystical insight and are gazing toward the precincts of your lord , the All-Mercifulyou must know that this cause is great , very great . <p> Consider , and make mention of the one who was named Peter in the kingdom of God.Despite the loftiness of his rank , the splendor of his destiny , and the greatness of his station , his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , grasped him and safeguarded him from stumbling , and bestowed certainty upon him.If you were to recognize this bounty , of which the dove warbles on the twigs of the tree beyond which there is no passing , then you would be certain that what was mentioned formerly has been fulfilled in truth.Behold , in the kingdom of God he partakes of the eternal , everlasting bounty , and drinks from the fountain of realities and the spring of meanings.But the people are behind a thick veil . <p> It would be better for those who heard this call and were heedless of it and hesitated in this cause if they had never been born.But what appeared has appeared , and the matter was decreed by God , the mighty , the glorious , the sovereign.Say:People , the Spirit ( Jesus ) has come again , to fulfill for you what he said aforetime.Thus were you promised in the tablets , if you only knew.In truth , he says now that which he said formerly , and has given his life , just as he did the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens and on earth.Know+ that when the Son surrendered the spirit , all things wept for him.But by giving his life he bestowed a new capacity upon all things , as you witness throughout the creation.Every sage from whom wisdom appeared , every scholar who showed forth knowledge and sciences , every craftsman who produced crafts and industries , every monarch who demonstrated his powerall these persons derived their gifts from the confirmation of his spirit , the exalted , the sovereign , the radiant . <p> We bear witness that when he came into the world he bestowed his radiance on contingent beings.By him the leper was cleansed from the diseases of ignorance and blindness and the afflicted was cured of the maladies of negligence and passion.The eyes of the blind were opened , and all souls were purified by the Almighty , the All-Powerful.In one station , leprosy refers to whatever causes a servant to be veiled from mystical insight into his lord , such that whoever is thus veiled is termed a leper , nor is he worthy of mention in the kingdom of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

that the one who ascended into heaven has now descended in truth.By him , the breezes of grace have wafted over the world , and your lord is a witness to what I say.The world has been perfumed by his return and manifestation.Those who busy themselves with this world and its vanities can not perceive the fragrance of ( Josephs ) coat.We have found them in the grip of a mighty delusion.Say:The bell rings out his name , the trump declares his mention , and his soul bears witness to his soul.Blessed are they who know.But today , the leper has been cleansed even before the words , " Be cleansed ! " are pronounced.For by virtue of his appearance the world and its people have been cured of every malady and illness.Exalted be this grace , which no other grace has surpassed , and this mercy , which has encompassed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom of God , seek empowerment from your lord.Arise , and say:People of the earth , the reviver of the world has come and has ignited a fire in the heart of the world.The caller has cried out in the sacred wildernesswith the name of Ali Muhammad.He prophesied to the people that they would meet God in the most glorious garden , and opened its gate to them by virtue of his grace upon the faces of those who have come forward.What the most high pen wrote in the kingdom of God , the lord of this world and the next , has been completed.Whoever desires may eat of its fruits , for it is wondrous nutrition . <p> Say : The most great bell has appeared and is being rung by the force of Gods will in the garden of divine oneness.Listen attentively , people , and do not be negligent.God willing , a people will appear , who shall grasp the intent of the Eternal Truth as expressed in his discourse ; who shall strive with perfect submission and humility to protect and safeguard the cause of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wills.All souls who are nourished by a sprinkling from the heavenly stream of utterance will perceive that in the dispensation of the Point of the Bayan ( the Bab ) , there appeared that which had remained concealed . This revelation and the revelation before it bear an exact resemblance to the dispensations of ( John ) the son of Zechariah and ( Jesus ) the Spirit.In some of the revealed tablets this has been mentioned.Note well:This was the revelation that appeared in order to prepare the people of the world.It arrived at a time when the world and its inhabitants had perished.That person came , who had remained alive , in order to bestow eternal life and to ensure that it persisted , and to favor others with the water of life . <p> What was revealed in the Bayan has been established.This is that prophesied beauty who , he said , " will come after me even though he is before me . " He is the call that was raised between the earth and heaven , so that youmight make straight and build up the stations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that the son of Zechariah John raised before the Spirit Jesus came . " The voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . " Mt 3:3 . If a woman give birth to a viper , that is better than that a man should be born and become known in the kingdom of God as an enemy.Blessed be the barren in that day and woe unto mothers with babes at the breast . <p> Say , the highest pen writes:O you who are lost in the wilderness of carnal passion , you do not accept me.Yet you have accepted the call of the one who made mention of me.You lie , and are the people of darkness , avoiding the radiant morn.For if you sought to draw near , in the light your selfish and reprobate actions would , naturally , become visible.Woe be unto those souls who ignore these days and their fruits.Soon , they will lament for themselves and will find no one who will commiserate with them.Happy is the estate of the truthful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystics , who have recognized the straight path and turned toward his kingdom.Blessed is the estate of the joyous and sincere , the lamps of whose hearts have been lit and illumined by the oil of mystical insight into the very soul of God himself.By the glass of attachment they were protected from the gales of sorrow and temptation.Pure is the estate of the strong-hearted who did not grow faint before the oppression of tyrants.Pure is the estate of the clear-sighted who know both annihilation and immortality , and who turned toward eternal life so that they are mentioned as deathless in the celestial realm.Naturally , their hearts will not fail because they are among the people of insight . <p> Say : My servants , you shall die and fall sacrifice , either by the sword of illness or by the saber of ill-wishers.Given that this is so , it is preferable and more right that you be killed by the blades of the idolaters in the path of the beloved of the worlds.For the indemnity diyih that is received from a murderer by the family of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit.Pure is the estate of the beneficent from whose good deeds wafts the fragrance of divine approval.Evil is the estate of detractors who wreak corruption and oppress.Even though they might attain honor and wealth among the servants , soon those souls shall be overtaken by sudden abasement and relentless wrath . <p> The former word is shining by virtue of a new spirit at all times in this era , from the horizon of the mouthpiece of the All-Merciful.That word is this:I said to the Son , that is , Jesus the Spirit , " Moses came for the sake of the law and religion.John the Baptist came for the sake of baptism.And I came so as to bestow everlasting life and to deliver souls into the realm of immortality . " cf. Jn 1:17-18 . Say:Friends ! Thieves and traitors wait in ambush.You , who bear the trust of the All-Merciful:Do not grow negligent.Safeguard the pearls of divine love from brigands.I swear by the luminary of the heaven of meaning that all who neglect to rend the veils of illusion today shall be unable to hear the divine call.Pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who listen to the voice of the All-Merciful , and who rise up from among the dead.Upon them may the breath of God waft , for he is the king of names and attributes . <p> People of the earth:The cry of the compassionate God has been raised between the earth and heaven , and upon hearing the divine word the heart of the world has been set aflame by the fire of love.The dispirited , however , have remained entombed in the graves of negligence and stupor.They could not feel its warmth , much less burst into flames.They lie eternally in their graves.People:Arise to aid God.The abiding one has come to you , who was prophesied to you by the one who arose.Because of him , there appeared the unprecedented earthquake and the most frightful terror.At his advent , the sincere rejoice and the idolaters burn in the fire of hatred . <p> Say:I adjure you by God , people of the Bayan , to be fair in coming to a consensus.And , it is this:That your lord , the All-Merciful , has not made this cause dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was revealed in the Bayan.You did with his beloved as you did.If this revelation had been made dependent on anything other than him , you would not have treated him as you did , you tyrants ! Is there any hearing ear that can hear , or sharp eye that can discern ? The eye of God has wept , and you are at play , you at whom the exalted assemblage is bewildered , and at whose deeds they are astonished . <p> My friends , you are the wellsprings of my own discourse.In every spring , a droplet from the heavenly stream of divine meaning wells up.With the hand of certainty , cleanse these springs of the pollution of unfounded judgments and illusions.In this way might you yourselves give convincing and unassailable answers to the sorts of questions that have been posed.In this greatest of dispensations , all must appear with branches of knowledge and sayings of wisdom.For in these unparallelled days , celestial gales have rendered all human beingsindeed , all thingsbearers of the divine emanations to the extent of their capacity.In the impenetrable depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues that were raised , as well as those that remain hidden and concealed.God willing , you will gaze with divine vision into his words , so that you will discover that which you seek . <p> They posed precisely the same question to Jesus , saying that John the son of Zechariah has come.He has called the people to the truth , and baptized them.What was the purpose of his appearance , and what did he say about this subsequent revelation ? He came in order to bear witness to me , and was faithful to what he was commanded , and I have come to set ablaze the people of the world . <p> You , who are gazing toward the most great panorama:Sorrows have reached the point where the tongue of heavenly compassion has been forestalled from speaking.By God , my eye weeps , my lips move , and the one standing before my face records what issues from them.For , the people of the Bayan have been veiled to the extent that were they to witness today with their own eyes that someone had contravened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the chief of liars wrote that the production of verses constituted a proof at the beginning of this dispensation butnow does not.Say , people of the Bayan:Be fair.By God , your lord , the All Merciful ! Aside from this divine youth , and the immortal manifestations who appeared in this dispensation , consider the Bayan in its entirety , and make your own judgment.Even if you are not , in the end , satisfied with the decree of God and what he revealed , God will nevertheless be pleased with your judgment if it is fair , so that perhaps an eye might be opened by justice and gaze toward God . <p> It is perfectly clear that the Bayan in its entirety explicitly , and without any need for figurative interpretation , contradicts this saying of the opponent of God.Nevertheless , he has brazenly and openly contravened the whole of the Bayan , and continues to do so , and then considers himself the champion of the Bayan.By God , the Bayan laments them and curses them.Now , consider in sum and for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive so impudently to violate the purity of the divine book ? It is clear and obvious that the reason is the acquiescence therein of some of the people of the Bayan.Otherwise , by the one who caused me to speak forth with the truth and made me manifest in order to vindicate his cause , if they had not been assured of that support , they would never have dared be so bold.This is among the greatest commands of God , which was revealed in the Bayan , such that it is mentioned in every single line thereof , whether by allusion or explicitly.It says , " Do not hesitate concerning the advent of the next dispensation , and seek only revealed verses . " Even so , they have turned away , and have committed these enormities , and not a soul has protested.Yet they attributed to this Centerby whose will all scriptures speak forththe abrogation of the laws of the Bayan.Do not the imprecations of God fall upon the iniquitous ? <p> All this , even though the text of the Bayan asserts that this dispensation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mention and praise of it , and prophecies its appearance ! What has become manifest from it is what was apparent in the previous dispensation.Whoever makes a distinction between the two is a lying idolater and a mistrustful opponent.Quite apart from verses , most of the adherents of the various religions witnessed the miracle performed by this Seat of sanctity , such as words can not describe.Ask the city Baghdad , and those about it , to make the truth apparent to you.It is not known what that fierce adversary says within himself.No , by the soul of Baha ! His falsehood is grave indeed.Ask God to confirm you with his grace , so that perhaps you might hew to the straight path of the cause.For this cause is great , great indeed.Soon will its greatness become clear and established.Only those shall remain , who are gazing toward the greatest panorama and who are detached from all who are in the heavens and on earth , out of love for God , the powerful , the mighty , the wise . <p> Today is a day for aiding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , with complete uprightness , to the precincts of the divine.God willing , they will mightily exert themselves so that perhaps those lost in the wilderness of passion and desire may turn their faces toward the most glorious horizon of sanctity.The influence of individual souls is and always will be beloved.For the influence of each soul is its fruit , and a soul without influence is considered a tree without fruit in the most great realm.Speak forth for the sake of God , and spread the cause for his sake.Do not look at whether others accept or deny , but rather at the service you are commanded to perform by God.This is the highest grace , eternal beneficence , everlasting fruit , and the loving-kindness of the Eternal Truth at every moment.The succor of his overflowing grace has arrived and will arrive at all times.He is with all those who are for him , and supports them with the truth.He is , in truth , powerful over all things.Glory ( Baha ) be upon you , my friends , for as long as the kingdom of God and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to the H-Bahai participants whose discussion improved my understanding of this Tablet , including Alison Marshall , Christopher Buck , Michael Sours , and especially Dr. Iskandar Hai for his searching philological interrogations of the translation and suggestions for improvement , many of which I have incorporated into this draft .

Baha'u'llah 's declaration of his station to the monarchs and rulers of the world was self-consciously modelled on the similar declaration of Muhammad to the rulers of his own time . It constituted an important part of his self-revelation , coming on the whole after his declaration to the Babis , and before ( or in a few instances contemporaneously with ) his issuance of the Most Holy Book , which comprised the laws and ordinances of the new Baha'i religion . In these epistles he not only declared his station as the promised one of all religions , but for the first time began elaborating on the social principles of his religion , founded in 1863 . From late in 1863 to summer of 1868 , Baha'u'llah was resident in Edirne ( Adrianople ) , to which he was exiled by Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz ( r. 1861-1876 ) . <p> In the Surat al-Muluk , Tablet of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apostrophically addressed the rulers of the world .

He thus implicitly invoked the strategic principle that an attack requires a three to one numerical superiority over the enemy , so that defensive armies can be much smaller than offensive ones . He complained that military budgets were increasing daily , resulting in oppressive taxes on the subjects : " O kings of the earth ! We see you increasing every year your expenditures , and laying the burden thereof on your subjects . This , verily , is wholly and grossly unjust . . . do not rob them to rear palaces for yourselves " ( POB , p. 12 ) . He insisted that it was the state 's responsibility to take care of the poor . <p> To Christian rulers he said that he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvah-i Nazilih khitab bi Muluk , pp. 8 , 9 , 11 ) . He castigated the French ambassador in Istanbul for colluding with the Iranian envoy against Baha'u'llah . He condemned the Ottoman authorities for substituting their own principles for those of God , for hypocrisy , and for unjustly banishing Baha'u'llah from Baghdad and then Istanbul and Edirne ( Muluk , 18-20 ) . He denied opposing the sultan , and urged him to gather around himself upright ministers with whom he should consult . He sternly criticized the great gap between the wealthy and the poor in the empire , and more especially in Istanbul , and urged the sultan to intervene to distribute wealth more equitably ( Muluk , 34 , 36 , 40 ) . He reproached the Iranian ambassador , Mirza Husayn Khan , the Mushiru'd-Dawlih , for intriguing against him . He ended by addressing the Muslim clergy and philosophers of Istanbul , urging them to recognize his authority as God 's spokesman and to be humble before God ( Muluk , 49-51 , 65-70 ) . <p> Baha'u'llah 's next letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France and to Nasiru'd-Din Shah of Iran , and written toward the end of his Edirne exile . The French empire was deeply involved in Middle Eastern affairs because of its North African colonies , and had in the 1860s intervened in what is now Lebanon and Syria to protect the interests of the minority Christian population . Baha'u'llah wrote to Napoleon III , reminding of him of his expressions of concern for the oppressed during the Crimean War of 1854-56 , seeking recognition of the new Baha'i religion and apparently soliciting French diplomatic pressure on the Ottomans to guarantee Baha'is their civil rights . He sent the letter via a French consular official , perhaps not until the party reached Akka . He received no reply ( SAQ , pp. 32-33 ; PDC , pp. 51- 52 ) . <p> In March-April , 1868 , the Ottoman authorities began an investigation of the Babis and Baha'is residing in Edirne , as a result of the complaints made to them by the followers of Azal . Rumors began to fly that the exiles would be further banished , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , Baha'u'llah was sent with his companions to Akka on the coast of Ottoman Syria , but Iranian authorities were permitted to maintain a consular office in the city to keep watch on Baha'i activities . It is possible that the prospect of being returned to Iran or of facing increased Iranian surveillance impelled Baha'u'llah to write his long letter to Iran 's Nasiru'd-Din Shah ( r. 1848-96 ) , in spring or summer of 1868 . He mentions toward the end of it his impending exile to Akka ( Muluk , 195-96 ) . This Tablet made a point of Baha'u'llah 's pacifist policies , which had ended the conflict between the Babis and the Iranian state . He said that in the new Baha'i religion , it was better to be killed than to kill . He argued that a ruler had the responsibility to be just toward all his subjects , with no distinction among them , implying that discrimination on religious grounds is illegitimate ( Muluk , 160-61 , 164 , 166 ) . He pointed out that the Shah ruled over a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered among their number , saying that the entire community should not continue to be punished for the sins of one person ( the Babi assassin who fired on Nasiru'd-Din Shah in 1852 ) ( Muluk , 178-79 ) . This letter was not sent until Baha'u'llah arrived in Akka , and the young courier who delivered it to Nasiru ' -Din Shah , Mirza Badi , was arrested by the government , horribly tortured , and executed . <p> In the Arabic Lawhu'r-Ra'is , written in the summer of 1868 on his way to Gallipoli , Baha'u'llah vows to Ottoman first minister Mehmet Emin Ali Pasha ( 1815-71 ) that his exile will not extinguish the nascent Baha'i faith , condemns him for plotting with the Iranian ambassador against him , and predicts that the Ottoman empire would be engulfed in turmoil and Edirne would pass out of the hands of the sultan ( Muluk , 205-225 ) . In the Lawh-i Fu'ad , written somewhat later concerning Ottoman Foreign Minister Fu'ad Pasha ( d. 1869 ) , he went so far as to predict that God would " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6:231-32 ) . Baha'is felt that these predictions were vindicated in 1876-78 , when Sultan Abdulaziz was overthrown in a constitutional revolution and committed suicide , following which a Russo-Ottoman war broke out that led to the temporary occupation of Edirne by Russian forces . In the Lawhu'r-Ra'is , Baha'u'llah announced as his aim the unification of the peoples of the world . In the Persian Lawh-i Ra'is , written upon his arrival in Akka and also addressed to Ali Pasha , Baha'u'llah compares the ephemeral pomp and circumstance of the Ottoman court to the elaborate puppet shows he saw as a child at court in Tehran , at the end of which the royal puppets in all their finery were unceremoniously packed into a trunk . He asked Ali Pasha to convey his request to Sultan Abdulaziz for an audience of only ten minutes , during which he would be pleased to produce for the sultan any proof of his mission the latter deemed acceptable ( Muluk , 228-67 ) . <p> Of the remaining Tablets to monarchs and leaders , few are dated , but they appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile in Akka . In hisletter to Victoria ( r. 1830-1901 ) , Queen of Great Britain and Queen-Empress of India , Baha'u'llah proclaimed himself the spiritual return of Christ . He commended the Queen for abolishing slavery , saying it had also been forbidden in the Baha'i faith ( it was still practiced in the Middle East , but gradually being ended ) . He congratulated her on having entrusted the reins of counsel ( by which he meant parliamentary governance ) into the hands of the people , and called upon members of parliament in Britain and other countries to undertake the reform of world society so as to cure its ills . He recommended as a solution the unification of the world under a single religion . He repeated his earlier strictures , enunciated in the Tablet of the Kings ( Surat al-Muluk ) , against ruinous arms races and overtaxation of the ordinary folk and the poor . He clearly enunciated for the first time here the need for a system of collective security whereby , should any nation attack another , all the others would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muluk , 131-41 ) . <p> The second letter to Napoleon III was written in 1869 as part of the larger collection of Tablets to the Monarchs called the Tablet of the Temple ( Surat al-Haykal ) . Baha'u'llah began by instructing the emperor to have his priests cease ringing the church bells in anticipation of Christ 's second coming , since Baha'u'llah was himself that advent . In an aside , he addressed the monks of the Roman Catholic church , urging them to abandon their seclusion in monasteries and to take up useful work and to marry and produce offspring who would praise God after their deaths . He also urged holy men to forsake vegetarianism , saying he had allowed the eating of meat . Baha'u'llah complained to Napoleon III that while he claimed to have intervened in the Crimean War in order to save the innocent , he had declined to help the innocent Baha'is , and had haughtily cast Baha'u'llah 's previous letter behind his back . <p> " For what thou has done , " he wrote , " thy kingdom shall be thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , as a punishment for what thou hast wrought . " ( POB , p. 31 ) . He urged the emperor to be just to his subjects and to the poor . In another aside , he urged the Baha'is to spread the new religion , by first acquiring excellent moral qualities , by wisdom and and exposition , and by avoiding arguments . He called upon the rich to be humble before the poor , and to engage in philanthropy . He announced the establishment of four great holy days , commemorating the manifestation of God 's names ( at Ridvan ) , the sending of a messenger to announce Baha'u'llah 's advent , and two others , which he said would be specified in a Book . ( Baha'u'llah discussed the holy days of his religion more extensively later , in the Most Holy Book al-Kitab al-Aqdas of 1873 ) . In concluding , he said that all the people of the world should be seen as one . This letter was smuggled out of the Akka prison and delivered to Cesar Ketaphakou , son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and sent it on to Paris . Ketaphakou later became a Baha'i on seeing the prophecy of Napoleon III 's fall fulfilled when he was defeated at Sedan by the Prussians in 1870 ( SAQ 33 , PDC , 51 ) . <p> Baha'u'llah announced himself to Tsar Alexander II ( d. 1881 ) , as well , warning him not to allow his base desires to veil him from turning toward the countenance of his Lord . He notes that a Russian official helped Baha'u'llah when he was imprisoned in the Siyah-Chal dungeon in Tehran , 1852-53 , saying , " Whilst I lay chained and fettered in the prison , one of thy ministers extended Me his aid . Wherefore hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of none can comprehend except His knowledge . Beware lest thou barter away this sublime station " ( POB , p. 27 ) . He declared himself the fulfillment of biblical messianic expectations mentioned in Isaiah , and in the Old and New Testaments , saying that the Father and the Son were come in the holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter to Pope Pius IX ( r. 1846-1878 ) , Baha'u'llah warned the pontiff not to allow a focus on Jesus 's name to bar him from recognizing the reality of the Lord of the heavens and earth . He criticized the pope for living in palaces while the returned Messiah dwelt in the most desolate of abodes . He reminded Pope Pius that the most learned men of Jesus 's own time rejected him , while a humble fisherman embraced his teachings . He lamented that while generations of pious monks had prayed day and night for the return of Christ , when he came they failed to recognize him . He said to the Pontiff to " Sell all the embellished ornaments thou dost possess , and expend them in the path of God . . . abandon thy kingdom unto the kings , and emerge from thy habitation , with thy face set towards the Kingdom , and , detached from the world , then speak forth the praises of thy Lord " ( POB , p. 85 ) . He thus counselled the Pope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He identified the Bab as the return of John the Baptist for Christians , heralding Baha'u'llah 's own advent who speaks with the tongue of the Son ( Muluk , pp. 73-90 ) . <p> In addition , Baha'u'llah apostrophizes some rulers in his 1873 book of laws , al-Kitab al-Aqdas . He addressed Kaiser Wilhelm I of Prussia ( r. 1871- 88 ) , reminding him of how ephemeral was earthly glory , giving the example of his defeated enemy Napoleon III . Baha'u'llah foresaw that the banks of the Rhine would be " covered with gore " and heard " the lamentations of Berlin " ( Muluk , pp. 250-51 ) . The Prussian monarchy later perished in the defeat inflicted on it in World War I. He rebuked the emperor Franz Joseph of Austria for visiting Jerusalem but neglecting to inquire about Baha'u'llah while in the Holy Land . He collectively addressed the monarchs and rulers presiding over the territories of the Americas , urging them to recognize him , and to " bind ye the broken with the hands of justice , and crush the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Lord " ( Muluk , 258 ; POB , 63 ) . He also collectively addressed the rulers of the earth in the Most Holy Book , calling upon them to accept him as their spiritual sovereign ( Muluk , pp. 262- 65 ) . <p> Baha'u'llah took an increasingly dim view of absolute monarchy during this period . Whereas he began by urging something like cabinet consultation on Sultan Abdulaziz , he ended by predicting that in the future no one would accept the task of ruling as monarch alone , that monarchy would survive , if at all , only as constitutional monarchy . He wrote to Shaykh Salman soon after his exile in Akka , " One of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship . Kingship will remain with none willing to bear alone its weight . Theat day will be the day whereon wisdom or Reason : aql will be manifested among mankind .

Consider the case of the G.I. Bill of Rights . Passed by the emerging conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans only one year after an assault on various New Deal agencies , the bill was signed into law by liberal Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt under the formal title of the Servicemen 's Readjustment Act of 1944 . Often interpreted as a reward from a grateful nation to the only generation of wartime American veterans to receive humane treatment in the postwar years , 1 the GI Bill grew out of a maze of conflicting developments to become one of the most popular and successful pieces of social legislation in U.S. history . Recently Harvard sociologist Theda Skocpol , author of some of the most thoughtful policy histories to grow out of the new interest in political and institutional history , wrote that the " history of the GI Bill suggests that , sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of American public social provision . " 2 In this account , former Boston Herald and Detroit News reporter Michael Bennett seeks to " make scholars realize how significant the GI Bill was ... and to tell a great story for not only those who benefited from the bill but also for their children and grandchildren " ( p. x ) . Disillusioned by the antipoverty efforts of the War on Poverty and the social protests of the 1960s , Bennett interprets the GI Bill as a successful effort by wartime conservatives to recreate the Jeffersonian dream via home ownership paid for with Veterans Administration ( VA ) loans and college degrees financed with GI Bill educational benefits . <p> To buttress his thesis about the GI Bill , Bennett provides ten narrative chapters on the origins , politics , provisions , and impact of the bill , paying particularly close attention to the work of key political actors including Harry Colmery , former national commander of the American Legion ; newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst and his editor Walter Howey ; Senator Joel Bennett " Champ " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcommittee ; Representative John Rankin ( D-MS ) , chair of the House veterans committee ; Edith Nourse Rogers ( R-MA ) , ranking Republican on the House veterans committee ; and a host of Hearst newspapermen and press releases that along with a national letter-writing campaign coordinated by the American Legion led to adoption of the final bill which Colmery had initially written as a " Bill of Rights for GI Joe and GI Jane . " After detailing the political origins of the bill in Chapters 2 through 6 , Bennett includes separate chapters on the 52-20 clubs that provided unemployed veterans with $20 compensation for up to fifty-two weeks ; the influx of veterans onto the nation 's college campuses peaking in 1946 and 1947 that gave the country the best-educated generation of middle class citizens it has ever seen ; the postwar impact of VA housing loans on priming the pump for suburbia , franchising , malls , and the dominant lifestyle of late 20th-century America ; and a conclusion suggesting that Clinton administration proposals for reform of public housing may hint at a new GI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambitious one . For popular readers unfamiliar with the provisions and impact of the GI Bill , the account is well written and centers on colorful personalities . Yet in claiming to be the first full account of this key social policy initiative , the work has serious shortcomings .. Ranging from the eccentric ( scholars should return to Louis Hartz 's classic consensus interpretation over the contentious one of Howard Zinn ) 3 to the downright cantankerous ( had returning veterans not stayed on the sidelines in the postwar strikes of 1946 the country would have turned to class conflict and socialism ) , this work proves to be an unfortunate exercise in futility . In taking scholars to task for ignoring the history of the GI Bill , Bennett ironically has to rely on the two standard scholarly accounts4 for the most reliable details in his own work ! <p> Bennett 's account is based almost exclusively on a very narrow and odd research base . He obtains most of the political details from the standard account by Davis R. B. Ross , Preparing for Ulysses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher education draws from Keith W. Olson 's more succinct , more thoroughly researched The G.I. Bill , the Veterans , and the Colleges ( 1974 ) . The only new sources are from interviews with several Hearst newspaper reporters and the son of Congressman John Gibson ( D-GA ) who provided the key vote in the congressional conference committee , contacts from his own reportorial career , and the unpublished text of a documentary on the GI BIll . Other than drawing a few details from a three-part 1949 series in the American Legion Magazine and a November 1994 article in Smithsonian Magazine , Bennett has done no original research in primary source materials other than a few brief forays into the Congressional Record and Historical Statistics of the United States : Colonial Times to 1970 ( 1975 ) . His use of secondary works to substantiate certain claims leaves considerable doubt in the reader 's mind as to the accuracy and usefulness of this reporter 's " first draft of history . " In the preface , Bennett confesses to his own disillusionment with governmental action during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Zinn 's People 's History of the United States ( 1980 ) , and his nostalgia for the simpler time of postwar American white middle class life . The interpretative focus presented here tells us more about the author than the subject at hand . <p> At numerous points in the narrative , the text diverges from the issue at hand to discuss matters only distantly connected with the current chapter . In the chapter on the origins of the GI bill , for example , the author presents a Cold War-era interpretation of the 1919 strikes and the Red Scare while overlooking the ultra-conservative aims of the newly-founded American Legion. 5 The caricatured view of New Deal planners that appears at points throughout the work belies the origins of the idea of postwar planning for military and home front veterans under the aegis of Frederic Adrian Delano , FDR 's uncle , who chaired the planning board 's committee on postwar benefits that suggested some of the provisions of the 1944 bill in 1942 . Throughout , the narrative presents conflicting arguments that serve to confuse the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , " simultaneously presents the GI Bill as the progenitor , result , and midpoint in the evolution of postwar housing policy , Levittown tracts , shopping malls , interstate highways , and such franchising operations as Korvette 's and Holiday Inn . The author can not seem to decide if this is a book on the GI bill , wartime politics , or the postwar economy of abundance . <p> Throughout the text , factual details contradict interpretive points under discussion . While arguing that the bill 's educational benefits crossed not only class and ethnic lines , but also gender and racial lines , the author rightly notes that " only 2.9 percent , or 64,728 , of the 2,232,000 World War II veterans who attended college were women " ( p. 202 ) and only an estimated " 250,000 blacks were given the opportunity to go to college for the first time under the GI Bill " ( p. 260 ) . As a former reporter in Boston , Bennett gives entirely too much credit to the Hearst organization in pushing the American Legion bill through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player without checking it against any other records . <p> &gt;From a scholarly point of view , there are serious lapses in judgment , methodology , and familiarity with existing literature on the subject . Bennett relies on secondary accounts that are twenty to thirty years old , while he often mistakes correlations for cause and effect . As a journalist rather than a scholar , Bennett is unaware of more recent works on wartime mobilization by John Morton Blum , Allan Winkler , Studs Terkel , William O'Neill , Michael Adams , and Alan Brinkley that might have given him pause in making a raft of odd interpretive claims. 6 Some direct quotations are used in the text that are not acknowledged , cited , or checked either in primary sources or the few secondary accounts cited in the rather brief notes at the end . There is no bibliography of sources , for which the publisher should take blame . <p> Despite these major flaws , When Dreams Came True unintentionally raises a significant point about the policy process that brought together political conservatives , military veterans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities of a new kind of national policymaking that did not remain trapped in the older nineteenth-century distinctions between private/public , voluntarist/statist , Republican/Democrat , conservative/liberal , native born/foreign born , and upper class/lower class . Implementation of the GI Bill proved a postwar success story that has not always been appreciated by scholars or the broader public . When speaking about the history of the GI Bill to a local American Legion Post in a small , Southern town several years ago , I ended by reminding the audience of aging World War II veterans how long this policy had reached by allowing their speaker to finish graduate school on educational benefits due to my own father 's death from a World War II service-related disability . Afterwards one couple proudly noted that they had purchased their first home with a VA loan , while another related that the husband had completed medical school due to educational benefits and that the resulting income helped put their children through college . Between 1945 and 1955 , the federal government underwrote $33 billion in VA housing loans .

While eighty percent of these may have pursued a college education even without the GI Bill , this is still one of the clearest examples of the value of social capital investment in human potential and talent in U.S. history . No wonder that scholar Theda Skocpol , former Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell , former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich , and President Bill Clinton all have issued recent calls for a new GI Bill to build the social infrastructure of tomorrow . <p> For the origins of the bill based on research in primary sources , one should still turn to the works of Davis Ross and Keith Olson .

Most of the newly published material falls into three overlapping categories . The first deals with the administrative apparatuses of the Asante state . Here one should mention the work of Ivor Wilks , whose collection of essays , entitled Forests of Gold ( 1993 ) , picks up many of the themes first addressed in Asante in the Nineteenth Century ( 1975 ) . One would also want to mention Larry Yarak , Asante and the Dutch ( 1990 ) , which deploys an analysis of the diplomacy of trade to critique Wilks 's interpretation of the elaboration of Asante bureaucracy . <p> The second category consists of works which deals with aspects of Asante society and belief . T.C. McCaskie has blazed the trail in this regard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1995 ) . Finally , there is the literature which deals with aspects of the pre-colonial Asante economy . In addition to the authors already mentioned , a recent article by Gareth Austin , " No Elders Were Present : Commoners and Private Ownership in Asante , 1807-96 " in the Journal of African History 37 , 1 ( 1996 ) , promises significantly to revise the conventional wisdom about the weakness of the private sector in nineteenth century Asante . <p> What many of these works have in common is their attempt to write about Asante economy , state and society ' from within . ' This does mean that they eschew models derived from beyond Asante ( or indeed African ) history . Indeed much of the debate has centered on the manner in which particular theoretical approaches have been applied to the Asante past . However , they all seek to explore aspects of the inner workings of the Asante social formation . The book under review was put together at a time when much of this revisionist literature was still in the pipeline . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . <p> It presents a narrative history of the cycles of military conflict between Asante and Britain in the nineteenth century , drawing heavily on the published accounts of British journalists and officials of the period . The style in which The Fall of the Asante Empire is written also reflects an explicit agenda on the part of the author . Unlike those who have tried to get to the heart of Asante structures and ideas , Robert Edgerton is looking at Asante from afar--using British lenses , and nineteenth-century lenses at that . He states that his aim is to render the history of these events accessible " to the general reading public rather than scholars " ( p. ix ) . Hence , while the author clearly wishes his readers to empathize with the Asante ( a point to I return below ) , the book has some of the feel of an older work of imperial history ( a comparison with W. E. F. Ward , A History of Ghana ( 1948 ) is instructive ) . <p> The book does have its strengths . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the frame where it belongs . Edgerton shows how the Asante incorporated European weapons into their own military structure with considerable success . He also demonstrates how the Asante , over the course of the nineteenth century , were disadvantaged by a growing gap in military technology . The discussion of Asante innovations designed to cope with superior British firepower during the Yaa Asantewaa uprising of 1900--notably the construction of stockades ( apparently an idea borrowed from the Mende of Sierra Leone ) --is especially illuminating . It is reminiscent of James Belich 's excellent account of Maori resistance in The New Zealand Wars ( 1986 ) , although the Maori record was arguably even more impressive because they were both outnumbered and out-gunned . <p> The author does not deal with the Maori parallel , but does make some helpful comparisons with Zulu resistance to the British , which he has written about elsewhere ( incidentally , this presumably accounts for the strange fact that the cover of the book actually bears a picture depicting the Zulu Wars ! ) . Edgerton paints a highly sympathetic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in Kumasi . It also has to be said that the book is clearly written and offers a number of memorable vignettes along the way . <p> However , there are features of this book which diminish its overall impact . Firstly , the author is frequently too close to his historical sources . In particular , British stereotypes of the period are replicated throughout the text . The Asante are presented as unusually honourable in their dealings and extremely brave on the battlefield . By contrast , the Fante are depicted as " cowardly " ( p.114 ) , " militarily inept " ( p.47 ) and " notoriously feckless " ( p.47 ) , while the Hausa and Mende are frequently described as blood-thirsty and unreliable . On the British side , brave officers and plucky troops abound . <p> These are nineteenth century British perceptions and prejudices which clearly need to be approached very cautiously by the historian . One has to question whether the Asante really exhibited a greater sense of honour than their neighbours . After the invasion of Eweland in 1867-71 , communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their loyalty ( see Wilks , 1975 : 83-87 ) . It is also difficult to sustain the thesis that other Africans made poor military material . After all , it was Africans who bore the brunt of the fighting against Asante , with the major exception of the Wolseley campaign of 1873-74 . The book sometimes struggles to reconcile the images with the historical record . Hence when the Asante encounter stiff Fante resistance , as they often did , the latter is described as " unexpectedly resolute " ( p. 96 ) . In fact , towards the end of the book Edgerton himself shows that it was the so-called ' Hausa ' troops who secured victory for the British . <p> Secondly , the consideration that is accorded to Asante state and society is fairly limited , drawn mostly from Bowdich 's account of his visit to Kumasi in 1817 . The treatment of the state is heavily inflected by a desire to render Asante institutions intelligible to a non-Ghanaian readership : hence the military position of the Asantehene is likened to that of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' inner council ' is likened to Congress ( p.52 ) . Obviously , this kind of cultural translation is problematic and is as likely to distort impressions as to shed light on the matter in hand . But perhaps more important is the limited treatment of the political structure of the empire . <p> The centripetal tendencies within Asante are important to the purely military dimension because , as Edgerton himself points out , the failure of important chiefs to mobilize troops was crucial on many occasions , including the 1900 uprising . As far as Asante society is concerned , the author does refer frequently to the importance of slavery as well as to the paradox that slave recruits performed most of the fighting for the kingdom . Surprisingly , though , he fails to develop Wilks ' observation that resistance to conscription by the ' ahiafo ' ( the lower orders , of free and not-free origin ) was crucial to the political success of the peace interest . <p> Finally , there are a number of ' bum notes ' that have found their way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geographical extent of the Asante empire in the early nineteenth century ( p. 8 ) which shifts the generally accepted boundaries of Asante much further to the north and east without any explanation ( it can be compared with Wilks 's map in Forests of Gold , p. 203 ) . Equally , the claims that are made about the population of the empire are questionable . The figure of " just under one million " people for metropolitan Asante ( p. 13 ) has already been scaled down considerably by Wilks ( 1975 : p. 88 ) . And the claim that the Asante empire as a whole contained " more than 3 million people " ( p. 1 ) is even more unlikely , given that the 1921 census counted only 2.3 million people for the whole of the Gold Coast following a period of population growth . <p> The medieval empire of Ghana certainly did not flourish for a thousand years and was located to the north-west and not " far to the east of modern Ghana " ( p. 2 ) . Again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 97 ) , but in Ghana as well . Equally , French troops did not take control of Togo and Cameroun during the partition of Africa ( p. 11 ) : in fact , France only gained full control of these areas after the repartition of the German colonies on the conclusion of the First World War . Many of the errors in the text are not fatal , but they are likely to undermine confidence in the book as a whole . <p> In conclusion , this book will probably evoke different kinds of response from the reading public . The general reader with an interest in military history is likely to find much of interest in it , and much to entertain as well . Professional historians of Africa are likely to feel that essential pieces of the the analysis are missing . Finally , historians of Asante will flinch at some of the assertions that are made in the book and wonder whether the debate has not moved beyond it . 69402 @qwx479402

Deeply inspired and shaped by Steven Shapin 's and , to a lesser extent , Simon Schaffer 's work on the history of science , Johns seeks to explode the last area of " whiggery " ( i.e. , linear triumphalism ) within this subject . If modern science has now emerged as a social construction , then no less was that agency so integral to it , the press . Johns 's target is Elizabeth Eisenstein 's The Printing Press as an Agent of Change : Communication and Cultural Transformation in Early-Modern Europe ( 1979 ) . Eisenstein argues that print provided a " fixity " to writing , and in time a new culture that enabled people to compare texts , correct them ( rather than continuously multiply errors ) , that created a common standard for the criterion of truth , and thereby underwrote experimental science and modernity itself . Nothing of the sort , insists Johns . Print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern people knew full and painfully well . " Truth " from the press derived from socially-constructed conventions that did not achieve general acceptance until the mid-eighteenth century Enlightenment , and that would not become axiomatic and instinctive for yet another century . Even so , the cogency of print today continues to derive from analogous conventions that succeed only because they make radical skepticism socially difficult . Nothing is inherent to print , and , bluntly--or , " brutally , " as Johns prefers--there simply is no such thing as Eisenstein 's " print culture . " At issue with Eisenstein , Johns stresses , is therefore not when print became stabilized as a coherent cultural medium , whether in the later sixteenth century or in the middle eighteenth century . Johns disputes what he perceives as her teleology of print . <p> Despite its enormous size , however , this study emerges quickly as rather less than what it claims to be . It focuses overwhelmingly on the years between 1660 and 1710 , that is , between the Restoration and the copyright act . It also focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imply instability a fortiori in any other line of inquiry . Not withstanding the occasional obeisance toward the continent , Johns is all but exclusively concerned with the English ( not British ) experience . Here his debt to Shapin becomes particularly glaring , and , although he does not say so , he seems to believe that England at this juncture comprises the axial moment for both natural philosophy and print . <p> The bulk of the book takes up in great detail the often angry and anguished interaction between stationers ( printers , publishers , compositors , binders ) , booksellers , " mercuries , " peddlers , licensers , patentees--not to mention patronage , coffee house society , as well as such august bodies as the Royal Society and the royal observatory . The point , underscored again and again ( and again ) , is the weakness of authorial control and authorial voice . In the rough and tumble world of constant piracy and plagiarism , of false editions and composite editions , of quick epitomes and cheaply--produced redactions , and of continuously egregious errata , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meaning or of the putative points at issue between authors ? In this world , Johns maintains , censorship carried more meanings than merely the nasty ones of today . Surprisingly , Johns does not consider legal libel , a matter that of necessity would become extremely problematic within this world . The history of printing , its invention and diffusion , entailed foci of contention that shaped the meaning , character , and authority of the medium . Even reading itself in the early modern world necessarily operated with different assumptions and differently configured objectives . Issues of corporate privilege and royal prerogative , of gentlemanly autonomy and the grasping of mere " mechanics , " of " credit " and infamy , of " civility " and rapacity , all informed the dynamics that led to the modern world of print-dynamics , Johns stresses , that could have gone in any of a number of directions . Credibility only arose from newly created forms of sociability , and these structures , neither natural , nor inevitable , owed nothing to technology , but resulted from " hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguises these tortuous ( and tortured ) processes that Johns seeks to excavate . <p> Johns so emphasizes the problems of the press and the reactions of the participants involved with it ( on his telling , typically ranging from dismay to hysteria ) that the reader is left wondering how the protocols of print actually did come together at all . Johns 's methodological preoccupations and his concern to overturn Eisenstein lead him to stress cleavage and fissure at the expense of integration and coherence , even insecure integration and coherence . Johns is at his best when he steps back from the multi-valenced confrontations that fascinate him andconsiders the larger ideological structures through which the press was imagined and made meaningful . His discussion of John Streator 's intellectual world of republicanism , spiritualism , physiology , and print during the English Revolution is genuinely exciting . Johns 's account of Streator 's Restoration volte-face--his alliance with the resolute monarchist Richard Atkyns and their defense of the royal authority--becomes a much more anemic discussion of political cut and thrust . Similarly , readers will likely wish that Johns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that apparently elevated printing from servile trade to learned " scientia . " Freemasonry occasionally surfaces , and again readers will wonder how masonic notions of sociability interfaced with larger concerns about public discourse and the printed word . One might almost think that there existed long-standing , heterodox traditions associated with print . All of which must make us regret that Johns 's lengthy discussion of the Edmond Halley-John Flamsteed confrontation barely notices that a dispute about going into print ( or not ) accompanied a dispute about orthodoxy . Severely circumscribed details , however plentiful , will only prove decontextualizing and thus impoverishing . Big books can also be stunningly narrow ones . <p> And this limited focus leads to a larger and what will be for many a decisive problem with the claims this book makes for itself . Johns speaks of a " piratical culture " ( 146 ) , a " stationers ' culture " ( 159 ) , a " genteel culture " ( 493 ) , a " learned culture " ( 550 ) , yet no culture of print ? Johns 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skewed approach to the sixteenth and earlier seventeenth centuries . Of course print did in fact create a new world , one drastically different from that of script . Of course contemporaries were not only acutely aware of it but also celebrated as well as deplored it--and frequently with vastly less angst than Johns posits . Martin Luther saw it as the positive providential counterpoint at the end of days to the horrors of gunpowder : it is simply perverse of Johns to ignore this and cite a seventeenth-century manual that claimed ( one imagines rhetorically ) that the press had done ten times the harm of gunpowder ( 407 ) . The reformers knew better . John Foxe , perhaps the most influential Anglophone writer in the early modern period , believed that each printing press comprised yet one more blockhouse against St. Angelo , the papal fortress . Sixteenth-century prints showed the reformers knocking down the walls of Babylon with bundles of printed books . For many the press possessed nothing less than an eschatological importance central to the historical redemption . Foxe surfaces but momentarily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realm of thought with which Johns is visibly uncomfortable ( 52 , 190 , 230 , 329 , 335 ) . Yet that is how these people saw their world and the press within it . As might be expected , Johns heavily emphasizes the qualifications and hesitations of thinkers like Francis Bacon and John Milton , but their larger vision becomes lost in the process . <p> To be sure , print from the outset prompted a huge range of responses , not unlike today 's reaction to the internet , as Raymond Waddington has recently noticed . " Meretrix est stampificata : " the press early on could acquire ahostile , gendered image from writers distressed by their experience with it 1 . But by the end of the sixteenth century expectations of universal reform and , integral to it , the imminent publication ( in the fullest sense ) of universally recognizable truth , had become exceedingly wide-spread . If print both required and helped create public space , then the intellectual foundations of that broader politics are all but unavoidable to any textured account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little about the politics of sociability and so much about the subjectivities of largely personalized disputes . This orientation naturally arises from the book 's historiographical and epistemological context . Eisenstein wrote in the late 1970s , just before the main impact of Michel Foucault 's thought--the latter 's outlook being characterized by anti-political preoccupation with everyday struggles , severe subjectivity , critique of the Enlightenment with its universal claims , and firm insistence on the inherently arbitrary character of all " regimes of rationality . " Writing in the late 1990s , Johns occupies the fading Foucauldian moment . For all the wealth of detail , for all the varied information it provides , Johns 's book will likely become marginalized by the larger questions that now increasingly attract both scholarly and popular attention . <p> Yet another aspect of this book will limit its appeal . Johns chose as its epigraph some lines from Robert Herrick that wish " Extreame Scabbe " on those who read through the work and still reject it . The lines set what turns out to be a strikingly consistent tone throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After nearly eight hundred pages informed by such a posture many readers may willingly risk the scab . 69403 @qwx479403

Ward 's Selling Places . Ward is Professor of Planning at Oxford Brookes University , the United Kingdom 's largest planning school . The co-editor of Place Promotion : The Use of Publicity and Marketing to Sell Towns and Regions ( 1994 ) and the author of several books covering planning history ( mainly focused on interwar Britain and garden cities ) , Ward conjoins his previous works and brings his talents to the subject of how places were developed for , and promoted to , targeted audiences ; mainly English-speaking North Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine chapters concerning five places : the frontier , resorts , suburbs , the industrial town ; and the post-industrial city . With the exception of the frontier , two chapters each cover the places sold : one chapter covers the history of the place ; the other chapter explores the themes advertising the place . <p> Readers should enjoy most of the book . Most of Ward 's prose is gracefully straightforward , and he complements his words with seventy-eight advertisements ( unfortunately in black and white ) . More impressive , however , is the sense exuding from almost every paragraph that Ward enjoys his subject . It is easy to believe his first sentence : " Few books can have given their authors more happy hours of innocent enjoyment than this one " ( p. viii ) . Ward clearly loves the ways places have been sold , and this love led him into quite an ambitious project . He states that his purpose is to create the first " coherent and comprehensive story " of place selling . ( p. 3 ) Thus , it appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : his initially stated parameters of exploration are bound by years that stand fifteen decades apart and are not limited to any one country . After Ward defines " place selling " loosely ( as " a broad entrepreneurial ethos or ideology which , at specific times , has permeated the common affairs of particular places " ) , the reader knows a lot of ground will be covered ( p. 3 ) . <p> Because of the adventurous nature of Ward 's project , I shall address its content in some depth . H-Net provides the forum for , and encourages , longer-than-traditional reviews , and I shall take advantage of this . Also , I believe it necessary to cover each chapter in some depth for two other reasons : the length of the book warrants more than a casual review ( each nearly 8x10-inch page contains a lot of prose ) ; also , it should convey whether the disparate subject of the book will be worth perusing . Ward 's book ultimately needs to be considered from two perspectives : that of the microcosmic histories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrocosmic history of place-selling captured by the course of the entire book . The larger history may leave some readers feeling a bit cheated out of what Ward promised -- his focus really is on Britain , and he emphasizes the first half of the twentieth century -- but such a sense is fairly well compensated by the micro-histories contained in each of the five parts . <p> Before tackling the frontier , Part One introduces the book by briefly discussing its methodological contexts and the structure of the larger history to be detailed . Ward casts his net widely to cover a topic with roots in several disciplines and in ten short paragraphs discusses thirty-two books covering an array of approaches to understanding place selling . The array is so disparate , one wonders after reading it how anything more than a piecemeal methodology will be employed in the chapters that follow ; but Ward finishes the discussion promising " a synthetic approach . " Unfortunately , Ward does not use the Introduction to define his methodology precisely , choosing instead to summarize four traditions from which his synthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " the marketing approach , " " cultural studies critics , " and " public policy " ) . " The exact character of the synthesis , " he explains , " will become clearer as it is elaborated throughout the text " ( p. 6 ) . For this reader , it never happened . Nevertheless , Ward finishes the Introduction with a summary of the three-era history covered by his five-part book : a pre-railroad era of " agricultural colonization " followed by an era of " urban functional diversity " followed by our contemporary era attempting " urban regeneration . " <p> The selling of agricultural areas , namely the U.S. " frontier , " Kicks off the first stage of Ward 's book . Four times as long as the Introduction , it comprises the majority of Part One . Except for two sentences noting that Canada adopted equivalents of the United States 's Homestead Act and Pacific Railroad Act and a paragraph on Canadian cities subsidizing railroads , the chapter focuses chiefly on the United States with some attention to Britain . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Wallace Gates and Daniel Boorstin , Ward discusses how " a relatively empty land is settled " through government largess and boosterism ( p. 7 ) . " New West " historians may feel displeased at the oversimplification committed by Ward here , but it fits into one of the two over-arching themes of his book : that government-sponsored ( or condoned ) boosterism leads to successful place selling . And for much of his book , Ward seems amiss that it took Britain so long to figure this out . <p> When Ward turns to Great Britain 's agricultural regions of the mid-nineteenth century , he does so for a juxtaposition that reveals the book 's second theme . Compared to the United States , he concludes , " there were no longer any large and relatively empty areas into which agrarian settlers needed to be attracted " ( p. 25 ) . Containing an already " mature urban system , " compared to the American West , there was no " growth imperative " to try and sell England 's agricultural hinterlands ( pp. 26-27 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ward 's book , and the first chapter establishes that , as far as place selling goes , it did not exist in mid-nineteenth century Britain ; however , it arrives in England in the next chapter , where Ward argues that two groups ( resort communities and railroad officials ) felt a growth imperative to sell England 's resorts and turned to imperfectly imitating the boosterism that marked the selling-history of the U.S. frontier . <p> Part Two 's concern with resorts opens with a chapter in which Ward walks the reader through roughly four centuries of spa history in just eleven paragraphs before introducing the question that lies at the heart of the chapter : how did a place such as Blackpool move from being the forty-third largest resort in England in 1851 to fifth in 1911 ? The answer is advertising in the face of the growth imperative . In 1872 , according to Ward , the railroad raised its rates and thus threatened Blackpool 's economic future . The resort community concluded it needed to make travelers believe the destination was worth the new ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advertising purposes , it assembled an Advertising Committee to sell itself as a prosperouscommunity . No other British resort community successfully boosted itself . <p> Other resorts in Britain and elsewhere grew too , but through private initiative and not local community action . When British railroads felt the growth imperative , they turned to advertising resorts as a way to get rail tickets purchased ; town development was incidental . The non-Blackpool British model reflected that used by the French when the Compagnie de l Ouest railroad boosted its unprofitable lines to the English Channel . But the French added innovations to their advertisements by using costly posters ( the British relied mainly on newspapers and books ) and campaigns directed overseas . The French believed international tourists would help make their resorts successful , and successful resorts in turn would attract domestic travelers on the l'Ouest railroad . Similarly , Belgium advertised abroad but conducted its advertising campaigns through a centralized national-public office : what was good for Belgium resorts was good for Belgium . And in the United States , Ward concludes , private promoters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same boosterism as had railroads in the U.S. West , decades before . <p> The global comparison , Ward concludes , shows that Britain was slow . As a nation , it did not realize quickly the importance of advertising abroad ; using posters ; and , most significantly , using both public taxation and public-private committees to organize promotions . Ward will not give full credit to Britain realizing these place-selling solutions until his last chapters on the post-industrial era ; but he argues in this chapter that Britain did try to correct its ways in the face of global competition ( the growth imperative again ) . The 1921 Health Resorts and Watering Places Act allowed for taxation for limited advertising and the tax was increased over the next two decades . As the restrictions on types of advertisements were lifted , Britain caught up in the history of advertising as it was practiced internationally . When the government started supporting paid holidays for workers , British resorts entered what Ward calls the " golden age " ( p. 48 ) . Unfortunately for the resorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious era . This decline is discussed briefly in the last six paragraphs of the chapter . <p> Chapter Four serves as the visual aid to the previous one and rounds out the history of resorts by addressing the post-war era . It uses splendid advertisements to reveal pre-Cold War British holiday themes but uses no advertisements in its discussion of the demise of British resorts . Noting American and continental European differences from ( and similarities to ) the British advertisements , Ward discusses five transnational marketing themes that travel somewhat in a chronological order through the first four decades of the twentieth century : the resort as a healthy getaway ; the resort as a distinct place of sunshine ; the resort as either a place for , or an escape from , morality ; the resort as a middle-class experience ; and , the resort as a place to exploit the nostalgia of the past . The Cold War era , however , ended such campaign themes as the automobile supplanted the railroads and all British resorts but Blackpool lost their ability to lure tourists . Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both unsightly and poorly planned ; when coupled with poor attempts by some resorts to be " fun " like Blackpool , it doomed British tourism to warmer environs in international communities that had a more entrenched tradition of state-supported marketing techniques aimed at foreign markets . Britain 's antistatism and focus on domestic tourism thus failed resorts in the age of the automobile and warm vacation . <p> The age of the automobile also brings to an end the place and period Ward investigates in Chapters Five and Six : suburbia . Like the resort , this place receives a two-chapter treatment that leaves the illustrations to the end ; also it too has a golden era in the 1930s and again the primary focus is on England . There is a splendid look at the American side of the Atlantic and Ward 's history of suburbia nicely and concisely synthesizes Anne Keating 's study of Chicago with the classic works of suburbanization by Sam Bass Warner and Kenneth Jackson . Linking the United States with England , Ward effectively brings to life for the reader , Samuel Eberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advertising " and " a genuine showman " with awe-inspiring talents ( pp. 88 , 90 ) . Ward importantly links Chicago to England through Gross and shows how the advertiser-developer 's talents first appeared in London in 1889 , were furthered in early twentieth-century England by his business partner , Charles Tyson Yerkes , and were replaced by the advertising efforts of the railroads . Once again , the railroad 's usurpation of locally inspired place selling was driven by the growth imperative faced by " insecure railway companies " ( p. 100 ) . English railroads in the years between the world wars dominate the last quarter of the chapter , once again revealing Ward 's love for this era : again he finds " the outbreak of war in 1939 brought this golden age of British suburban development to an abrupt end " ( p. 108 ) . That the age of suburbanization was about to explode in the United States and elsewhere , is over-looked in this chapter on history , instead left to the chapter on advertisements for suburbia . <p> Ward 's advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercenary " and " an all together more poetic vision of how a widening section of the population thought they wanted to live " ( p. 110 ) . Suburbanites , to borrow the title of Chapter Six , wanted to live in a " realm of romance . " Advertisers sold this romance through several themes explored by Ward : the English countryside of historic manors , the American vision of pioneers recreating an Eden with access to " civilization ; " suburbs as both healthier than cities and offering pride of ownership ; and , a place where womanhood " was firmly circumscribed , limited exclusively to the domestic realm " ( p. 136 ) . These themes , however , only are explored up through the " golden age . " <p> Continuing the pattern established by the section on resorts , this place 's history in the post-war era is both left to the chapter on visual themes and is not supported by any visual aids . Certainly he makes no overstatement when he observes that " things were never quite the same again after Levittown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose its focus when he claims that " the same rural values continued and continue to pervade promoted imagery of the suburban place in the years after World War II , " yet he uses not a single visual aid or corporate logo ( p. 141 ) . Ward does introduce the importance of place names in the post-war era , although this does not seem to fit the focus on visual aids used throughout the book . <p> Thus something seems to go askew in the progress of the book whenever Ward addresses the post-war periods of his places . What does it mean to divorce the post-war era from the chapters on history and leave them to the chapters on advertising ? Are their histories somehow less important or interesting than those of the " golden age " ? And what does it mean to discuss the post-war era in chapters focusing on advertising images but not include even a single image from the last half of the twentieth century ? No doubt the answer lies in that the period is covered in the last section , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-war histories of resorts and suburbs , along with some illustrations , would have been welcomed in the sections thus far discussed . <p> The fourth section turns to the industrial town . Whereas the first three places held in common being promoted against the backdrop of the urban center , their successes resulted in creating a growth imperative for cities turned " anxious to grow , or to replace declining industries " ( p. 144 ) . Ward explores the histories of this place in three areas : Canada , the U.S. South , and Britain . Repeating the core-periphery model that subtly undergirds the frontier chapter , the American places in this section 's two chapters serve as juxtaposition to Britain by being areas " on the edge " ( p. 145 ) . <p> Ward titles the first of the two chapters in this section , " Selling Places or Buying Industries ? " This signals a shift in the book , as it begins to focus less on the people who might respond to place selling ( farmers , tourists , and residents ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or place selling 's counterpart , industry buying ) . Apparently , he disdains the notion of bribing businesses to settle in particular communities ( preferring , I presume , the tricky innuendos of artistic advertisements ) . Notice his language : when Canada &gt;suffered " a desperate scramble for factories , " it turned to paying subsidies " to the tune of millions of local tax dollars . " 144 This seems to echo the " desperation " that led the town folks of fables to hire the pied piper to play his tune . Similarly suggesting disdain , he puts Atlanta on par with drug dealers keeping their cash deals off the record , when offers to move industries to the U.S. South " began to be backed with hard cash and other ' dubious ' inducements " Emphasis added. ( p. 145 ) . Ward does acknowledge , however , that some Canadian towns came to their promotional policies by different routes . Some places , for example , Paris and Hanover in Ontario , were anxious to lay a " proper " social basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first section , Ward never leveled such critiques at the U.S. frontier communities that he examined in the same time frame . Their reliance on government-passed acts that gave away land " legally " apparently excuses the detriment caused to Native Americans ' social basis . <p> If Ward is critical of some of the New World 's practices , he laments nonetheless Britain 's inability to follow suit . Looking at Luton , Cardiff , and West Ham , Ward reveals the hamstrung course industrial town promotion followed because the national government forbade local councils to bribe businesses with direct inducements or use taxes for large-scale advertising . Local communities eventually learned to attract industries with different electric rates , but even then they had to rely on paltry funds for advertising themselves to business . British industrial towns thus shared the same problems faced by British resorts . Small budgets , however , did not characterize the campaigns of the New South . <p> Ward discovers that the New South practiced promotional tactics in common with Canada ( arguably going further by stretching the definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked for education ) . **29;1999;TOOLONG is rightly outraged by extralegal practices , and he argues that Mississippi chose to " introduce some sanity " in its place promotion when it created a state board " comprising three very experienced businessmen , who undertook industrial marketing , carefully targeting and screening likely prospects " ( p. 159 ) . Thus Ward shows the New South becoming more " sane " in its approach to sell itself . <p> In the second chapter concerning the industrial town , Ward leaves behind his **29;2030;TOOLONG and turns again to the advertisements used . They shared some things in common , and Ward claims that no matter which place is examined , one finds being sold " a place of destiny . Local history was plundered to demonstrate the inevitability of success .... Everywhere in the promoted place there was efficiency , modernity and progress " ( p. 163 ) . Ward provides sixteen advertisements to reinforce that places were sold as hubs where " civilization " and production joined . They also incorporated factual information to both assure that the place already was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transcendent to all who built there . Walking hand-in-hand with the promise of success were key " facts " that pointed to industrial success . Ward breaks these into three themes : good labor relations ( " strikes almost unknown " ) ; good facilities for working-class communities ( " happy and contented employees " ) ; and good social attitudes ( " acceptable Anglo-Saxon people " ) . Using few facts but crafting an equally mythical view , Ward argues , were two themes that addressed the place of womanhood : socially as single workers or culturally as industrial towns waiting for her masculine industry . ( Unfortunately , Ward 's choices of posters to reprint do not reveal these gendered themes . ) Ward finishes the chapter by noting that although industrial towns now are promoted for their " heritage , tourism , tertiary and quaternary sector employment " nevertheless " old habits die hard ... and many North American advertisements today are remarkably similar to those of the early twentieth century " ( pp. 180 , 183 ) . Three post-1945 North American ads support this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has been the book so far ) is on the early twentieth-century . The last section of the book corrects this somewhat . <p> The post-industrial city is Ward 's last place . Like the previous parts , this one is divided into two chapters where the latter examines advertisements and their themes . ( Unlike earlier sections , it is the only one to not separate Britain into a distinct geographical subsection . ) Fraught with the growth imperative , " as cities seek to achieve international prominence in the twenty-first century , " the post-industrial place is heralded by Ward for having learned the lessons in proper place selling . Indeed , the post-industrial city seems to be the culmination of all that came before : it is managed by governments that have learned that local cities need advertising funds and government support ( as the US frontier had ) ; it has the freedom to promote themselves ( known in Britain only in Blackpool ) ; and its promotions are kept in the realm of the sane with the use of both professional agencies and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The post-industrial city also is a place that combines all the people of the previous sections : developers , tourists , residents , and businesses . Thus the chapter nicely " ends " the course charted by the previous sections . <p> Nonetheless , the section on the post-industrial city has a striking difference from the rest of the book . Although it serves as an endpoint to the book 's larger chronology , unlike earlier parts it lacks an internal sense of chronological change . The first chapter of the section details those sociological elements that juxtapose the current period to those that preceded it without connoting a sense of how it came to be . Ward simply describes conditions of the post-industrial city ( unemployed ; oriented towards service and tourist economies ; and , especially important for Britain , now encouraged by governments of all levels to market themselves . ) The sense of historical agency has evaporated : the actors ( individuals , their community organizations , and their companies ) who developed railroads , promoted resorts , sold suburbs , and advertised their cities ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time ) are replaced by advertising campaigns with little sense of history . In essence , Ward 's last section ends with a sense of being static . Thus , Michael Kelly 's and John Struthers 's decision to promote a Scottish post-industrial city as Glasgow 's Miles Better is contextualized by one paragraph concerning the place 's decline and nine paragraphs on the slogan 's relationship to the ad , " I heart New York . " Comparisons between places such as London 's Canary Wharf and Boston 's Faneuil Hall dehistoricized the places . None of this seems to fit in a book that noted so much action : the development of the " frontier " ; the evolution of Roman resorts ; the promotion of suburbs ; and even the creative techniques adopted by peripheral places wanting to be at least regional cores . But the post-industrial city just comes across as a transnational " place " suffering from social issues divorced from their historical specificity and not being promoted in any one place with an over-arching sense of purpose . <p> Oddly enough , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , he seems to contradict the earlier portrayal of the post-industrial city as transnationally homogenized and static . Ward discerns that for the first time in the history of place selling , the " dream " being sold is not uniform : " While other types of place , and especially industrial towns , have seemingly projected their sameness , post-industrial city marketeers emphasize their city 's distinctiveness " ( p. 209 ) . The last chapter before the conclusion thus explores how certain post-industrial cities use their specific histories and geographies to promote themselves as : having survived their past and now can celebrate that fact ; having a competitive advantage as a place with enough cultural capital to aesthetically please and offer amusement ; being better than you have been led to believe ; a place successfully rebuilding itself ; populated with people very different from what you have been led to believe live there ( Yuppies you would like in the Docklands , vibrant youth celebrating their fun-loving culture in Manchester , homosexuals " up north " of London ) ; and , full of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-industrial period , but apparently its place-selling does not compare to the inter-war period : a " golden age " ... has not yet appeared . It may never come , of course " ( p. 234 ) . Without a sense of the post-industrial city being anything more that the end-product of a chronology that sketches a macrohistory " rise and fall of the city " ( and portrayed as a period without a distinct sense of having even a microhistory ) , the last section proves interesting , but ultimately disappointing to the history promised at the book 's opening . <p> Ward 's brief conclusion , divided into two subsections , furthers the sense of disappointment concerning the book 's promise to serve as a " complete and comprehensive " history . In its first subsection , Ward concludes that some universal truths concerning place selling include the process being " mainly associated with periods of economic change and with urban systems or parts of urban systems which are experiencing that change . " p. 236 Thus the " growth imperative " rears its head again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been solely or even mainly the prerogative of government , " it " has normally blossomed in settings where a higher government has tolerated local autonomy and encouraged fiscal self-reliance " ( p. 238 ) . Finally Ward notes that successful place selling also requires private industries , companies , and " local factors " such as " key local individuals , ... the particular local relationship of business and political leaders ... and the extent to which the promotional visions of the place sellers could be embraced , or at least tolerated , by the wider population " ( p. 238 ) . <p> The second subsection of Ward 's conclusion turns to the topic of " language and imagery " only to offer seemingly contradictory conclusions . First Ward challenges his work 's relevance to the fields of history and geography : " In an almost timeless and placeless fashion certain messages and images have recurred in the selling of different kinds of places " ( p. 238 ) . He chooses to not review them " chapter and verse " because " each type of place selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 238 ) . Yet within two paragraphs he backtracks to argue that place-selling advertisements *are* " expressions of time , place , society and culture ... and we can read the imagery and texts of place marketing as a mirror , albeit perhaps a distorting mirror , of a varied and changing wider world . " p. 239 Choosing to not summarize the history of that mirror as contained in his book , but to discuss instead the aesthetics of advertisements , Ward finishes by warning the reader to separate images from reality . This conclusion , for all practical purposes , peters out a book that has a lot to offer . <p> There is a great history contained in Ward 's book . I shall describe it below ; however , it is important to note that it is overwhelmed by a sense of constant competition within the book as to what the book 's purpose is supposed to be . The book is supposed to be global , and even the cover illustration is an ad for Atlantic City , yet the book focuses on Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in subsections on foreign places and in the last chapter synthesizing British cities with Boston , New York , and Atlanta advertising campaigns . The non-British places that do appear seem arbitrarily chosen , as there is no methodology to explain their selection ; also they are discussed at strikingly different levels of depth - from a sentence to a paragraph to a subsection . Although the bulk of the book presents first one chapter on a micro-history of a place and then one chapter on the ads that promoted it during that period , the " frontier " chapter has both elements synthesized and both suburbia and industrial towns have their post-1945 " history " in the advertising chapter . Finally , with respect to the three-stage historical narrative promised in the Introduction , the last stage consistently gets shorted throughout the book , ultimately not even having written a micro-history of its key place , the post-industrial city . I mention these not as detractions , however , but merely to suggest that there are distractions from the important history the book does write . <p> Ward 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of American boosterism and continental Europe 's competition with Britain both provide fitting contexts in which to understand the British experience . But the book is not structured on this history . Indeed , if it had been structured around such a history , it might go something like the following : " In the latter half of the nineteenth century , as stockholders in the Illinois Central Railroad and as readers of W.J. Palmer 's advertisements for places in the American West , the British tasted for the first time the boosterism that would come to dominate their history of place selling . By the end of the nineteenth century , British private industry explored the tactics learned in the United States to develop their railroads serving resorts and suburbia . In the early twentieth century and through the outbreak of World War Two , developers and promoters ( such as Gross and Tykes ) furthered British boosterism in the private sector while public initiatives tried to sell places such as resorts and industrial centers in the face of growing international competition . British national policies limited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed success at first . Nonetheless , British advertising flourished and contained both uniquely British themes and themes shared by other nations trying to reach the same goals . As Britain began to embrace paid holidays and local tax relief for advertising , as well as embrace more fully the advertising themes being used internationally , it slowly caught up with the rest of Western Europe and North America with respect to selling resorts , residences , and industrial towns . Unfortunately it was too late with respect to promoting resorts , but both outlaying industrial towns and urban centers had a chance and have survived . Today Britain 's post-industrial cities ( which incorporate the functions once associated with the previously mentioned places ) embrace boosterism fully by hiring private-sector firms and creating public offices to both modify and continue the advertising themes used in the long and rich history of selling British places . This story , replete with its revealing advertisements , is worth the read . <p> All in all , Ward has written a great book that not only is enjoyable to read , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I will raise as an historian from the American side of the Atlantic . Although his analyses of resort ads seem quite thorough , his analyses of other places ' images do not get the same broad treatment and none go as deep as I would have liked -- it seems fair enough to let readers interpret some meanings for themselves , but some analyses seemed too superficial . Had Ward wanted to deepen his analysis , he might have employed the approach used by Roland Marchand in his classic history , Advertising the American Dream . 1 Also , for all his discussion of how advertising mirrors the social tableau of the time , I would have appreciated greater elaboration on the connection between certain images and their histories/meanings such as Robert Rydell discerned in his works on world fair images. 2 ( This especially goes for the image of " Miss Dakota " in the chapter on the " frontier " -- an advertisement that to me makes the whole book worth its purchase price . ) As stated earlier , Ward does not share the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is fine ; although their critiques of the U.S. West 's history could warp some of his conclusions away from celebrating development in the ways that he celebrates them . Indeed , the issue of " conquest " is nowhere to be found , although the ads do provide the reader the chance to contemplate the issue individually . ( The " flip-side " of his argument can be found , for example , in Patricia Limerick 's A Legacy of Conquest or her co-edited Trails. ) 3 Ward 's bibliography does not reflect the works of John Kasson and Kathy Peiss on Coney Island , and I wonder if his history of resort selling might have had more of a class analysis and addressed the culture of consumption as something more than just " fun " had he incorporated their views on the historic changes of resorts. 4 But all this is petty , compared to what Ward does accomplish in his book . <p> Ward 's hard work produces a book that is , to borrow the phrase once used by British resort advertisements , " bracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term that characterized the cool-crisp seaside air : " This was important because air was all pervasive , capable of being enjoyed by everyone .... " p. 58 Ward 's book , too , should be capable of being enjoyed by everyone . Indeed , to describe the delight I received in learning about British boosterism and viewing scores of wonderful advertisements I would merge Ward 's book into the 1951 ad used to promote Skegness : " The tonic air stimulates the visitor so that he soon feels braced up and keen to enjoy wholeheartedly the countless delights which this beautiful resort provides . " Ward 's book , filled with delights , is beautiful , enjoyable and stimulating ; it is bracing . <p> 2 .

" Pound asked " why then do courts persist in the fallacy ? Why do so many of them force upon legislation an academic theory of equality in the face of practical conditions of inequality .

" For some legal historians , most particularly and most importantly Morton Horwitz , Pound 's article other more technical challenges to existing contract doctrines that emerged in that era , represented a watershed point in the history of contract . In this analysis , Pound , anticipating Legal Realism , mounted an " internal critique of late-19th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought . " 1 <p> Amy Dru Stanley tells a different story and a highly persuasive one . In her important new book she finds that the first sustained critique of the foundations of classical laissez-faire conceptions of contract began not with Pound and later the Realists , but instead in the aftermath of the Civil War . As she tells it , abolitionists were able during the war to use free market contract ideology to undermine chattel slavery . After the war a society that had argued over the meaning of slavery and emancipation " drew on contract to describe the changes in their world and to distinguish between the commodity relations of freedom and bondage. " ( ix ) Stanley find that in the postbellum era different groups , most particularly freed slaves , Yankee hirelings , and married women each questioned " the moral boundaries of market relations , " and used the problem of contact as a way to " reconsider the meaning of freedom . " ( xi ) She finds that a free market ideal of contract based on voluntary exchange by individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism in the 1870s and 1880s . This ideal , which " defined commerce in free labor as emancipation " competed with alternative radical ideals advanced by industrial wage-workers that " in selling their labor they were no more self-owning than slaves . " ( xiii ) Stanley has exhaustively mined postbellum debate over contract and shows us that the twentieth century challenge to the professed neutrality and equality of contract doctrine was built upon an important historical tradition . <p> Stanley 's book , however , is significant not only for the way it provides antecedents to the Realists and complicates the periodization of critiques of contract doctrine . In her view , antislavery forces , by connecting ideas of contract with ideas of freedom , set in motion a fundamental debate over the proper role of the market and political economy -- debate that was framed explicitly in contract terms . Stanley looks at the way freedmen and freedwomen , wage laborers , and married women each took up contract ideology and shaped it to quite different and fascinating ends . Once slavery was assaulted on contract grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge the more coercive elements of nineteenth century liberalism . <p> Diverse actors seized upon this weapon after the Civil War to reveal the contradictions of coercion and legal dependence that still existed in the face of professed free labor . Methods and strategies and goals differed from group to group , but taken as a whole , their critiques and analysis forced a fundamental reconsideration of political economy , wage labor , home life and ultimately of the definition of self-ownership and the meaning of freedom . Stanley 's analysis is elegant , ambitious and powerful , and helps provide a new understanding of the ideological consequences of emancipation . From Bondage to Contract is a major contribution to nineteenth century legal history and should become a necessary companion to the work of Eric Foner as an analysis of the central role of labor ideology and the shifting contours of liberalism in the Civil War era . <p> The book is divided into five chapters that proceed thematically rather than chronologically . She begins with a theoretical exploration of the ideal of contract freedom in the postbellum period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from status to contract " is contextualized and Americanized by Stanley . Drawing on the work of William Graham Sumner , James Kent , Theophilus Parson and dozens of their contemporaries , Stanley explores the way American legal theorists took Blackstone and Smith , Hobbes and Locke and applied them in the 1860s and 1870s to America 's labor market and American households . <p> Beginning with extensive discussion of Leviathan , The Second Treatise of Government , The Wealth of Nations , and Blackstone 's Commentaries , we move by chapter 's end from seventeenth and eighteenth century England to post-Civil War America . Methodologically this is a striking and also subtle achievement --the transition from high intellectual history to an on-the-ground application of political theory is seamless and effective . Drawing on Enlightenment thinkers , Stanley shows how contract , in postbellum America , " reconciled human autonomy and obligation , imposing social order through personal volition rather than external force . " ( 2 ) Contract thus was " premised on self-ownership , " and parties " had to be sovereigns of themselves , possessive individuals entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) At the same time the postbellum view of contract as synonymous with personal autonomy was explicitly gendered , and led to an " asymmetry between rules of voluntary exchange that assumed equality in the marketplace and that assured subordination in the household . " ( 17 ) This asymmetry between equality and subordination in the free market at home is the focal point of Stanley 's book and it is this tension that drives her narrative . <p> There are two distinct stages to this narrative , one pre-war and one post-war . The first part is dominated by the abolitionists , who seized upon the debate over emancipation to bring discussion of ideals of contract freedom to the fore . For Stanley " the conflict over slavery infused the principles of self-ownership , consent and exchange with new ideological urgency . " ( 17 ) It was the inability to enter into contract -- to be forced into obligation without consent or exchange -- that best defined slavery for abolitionists . This line of argument led to the conclusion that a voluntary contract obligation to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of view patently at odds with notions of wage slavery and one that would draw fire from hirelings after the war . For antislavery forces , however , " legitimizing wage labor was a central part of the abolitionist project " ( 21 ) and activists had " reshaped the meaning of contract freedom by dissociating wage labor from relations of personal dependency . " ( 18 ) For the abolitionists a right of property in the self , represented by the sale of one 's labor , was the essence of contract freedom , and of freedom generally . <p> The abolitionist embrace of contract was not solely an elaboration of abstract natural rights , but focused also on contracts inside the family , particularly the marriage contract . Abolitionists succeeded in " placing the contract between husband and wife at the forefront of the debate over slavery and freedom . " ( 18 ) The right to self-ownership was quite literally embodied by the capacity to enter into a voluntary marriage contract . Slavery , in taking away control over one 's body , represented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal , legally enforceable marriages . In particular abolitionists focused on the abuse suffered by slave women as evidence that slavery denied this most basic form of self-ownership . Female slaves " served as the symbol of the dispossessed self . " ( 27 ) " Dishonored , stripped bare , the bondswoman literally embodied the denial of property in the self . " ( 27 ) <p> In arguing that slavery denied female self-ownership of their bodies , and in defining freedom " through the negative of the female slave 's subjection , " abolitionists had unwittingly " opened to question the right of women to own themselves . " ( 28 ) This innovation " held the potential to challenge the categories of sex difference embedded in classical liberalism and Victorian scientific theory . " ( 28 ) This challenge to gender catergories was , Stanley reminds us , an unintended outcome for a majority of abolitionists , who for the most part reasserted the validity of distinctions based on sex . For Stanley , " the dominant abolitionist position was that slave emancipation would convert freedmen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women would simply be converted from slaveholders to husbands . " ( 29 ) <p> Stanley finds that the inconsistency of this position was fiercely challenged by black women writers , most particularly by Ellen Watkins Harper . Taking up the logic of the abolitionist position , Harper argued in the late 1850s before the American Antislavery Society and elsewhere that the " husband 's claim to property in his wife violated inalienable rights much as did the slave master 's claim to his chattel property . " ( 31 ) Stanley examines Harper 's arguments , along with those of Harriet Jacobs and Sarah Parker Redmond , and concludes that among abolitionists " it was black women who most unequivocally asserted a women 's right to herself " ( 33 ) and " transformed the meaning of contract freedom " by demanding self-ownership within the marriage contract itself. ( 34 ) <p> In exposing this fissure in the abolitionist movement , Stanley begins the second part of her narrative . After the War the abolitionist faith in free wage labor and the rights of marriage was subject to contestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contract . With the onset of emancipation the abolitionist vision was initially put into action , as " the North began the project of establishing voluntary wage labor on southern soil and guaranteeing the marriage rights of former slaves . " ( 35 ) Stanley vividly describes how agents from the Freedmen 's Bureau sought to put the abolitionist program into place by introducing a system of labor contracts and attempting to bind freed slaves into legally recognized marriages . No sooner was this program undertaken , however , when it met with ideological resistance from those who felt coerced by the new contract regime , not liberated . Simply put , perhaps too simply put , once the contract genie was out of the bottle it could alight on different actors interested in expanding notions of freedom and self after the Civil War . New ideas of contract and freedom were articulated to challenge the connection of freedom with wage labor contracts and marriage . It is the exploration of these alternative visions of contract freedom , and their critique of the coercive elements of the liberal abolitionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . <p> Stanley first turns to critiques of contract articulated by northern hirelings , making provocative and fruitful connections between slavery , emancipation and industrial wage work . Stanley makes the interesting point that " only in the United States did full-scale industrial capitalism develop simultaneously with , and literally alongside , the consolidation and overthrow of chattel slavery . " ( 60 ) In the wake of emancipation , American wage workers framed their situation in terms of slavery and freedom , and argued that the freedom to contract to sell one 's labor on the market did not amount to freedom in any meaningful sense at all . Hirelings rejected the equation of the voluntary sale of labor with freedom , and asked instead " whether the buying and selling of their labor as a market commodity rendered them like or unlike chattel slaves . " ( 62 ) <p> At the heart of the hireling critique was the notion that one 's labor could not be separated from one 's self , and that to sell one 's labor on the market was in essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The market , far from providing contract freedom as a corrective for slavery , instead commodified labor to the point where it sanctioned the creation of a new slave class . For many hirelings " the inequality of power underlying the voluntary rituals of offer and acceptance " belied the professed mutuality of labor and capital and amounted instead to the forced sale of the self for a wage . ( 69 ) Workers decried the " new slavery , " ( 86 ) and raised again " the question of buying , selling and owning human property . " ( 96 ) The link between wage slavery and chattel slavery is expertly drawn by Stanley , and she makes a powerful case that Gilded Age labor issues and emancipation were intimately , perhaps inseparably linked . <p> Stanley makes equally fascinating links between the issues raised by emancipation , wage labor and marriage bonds . After the Civil War feminists , who had long underscored the link between slavery and common law coverture laws , " claimed that marriage belonged at the very center of public debate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on " domestic slavery . " ( 180 ) Marriage , which law writers had been careful to distinguish from other forms of contract relations , was attacked as another form of legal subordination . Feminists more and more " invoked contract as a model for equality in marriage , " ( 184 ) demanding that a relationship based on status be replaced by a contract relationship based on self-ownership and voluntary exchange in which a wife could buy and sell in the market , make contracts herself , and own property . Marriage should thus mirror other contracts at law , a claim quite different from hireling assertions that wage labor was distinct from all other forms of contract . Feminists were of course not wholly successful in dismantling the coverture regime , but instead " brought to light a new set of contradictions " in which a wife was left " without clear title to herself and her labor . " ( 217 ) <p> Hirelings and married women drew a neat distinction between the ability of the free market to either provide freedom or to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to wages as the benchmarks of freedom and self-ownership . Hirelings argued , almost conversely , that the commodification of labor amounted to the sale of the self . In both cases the free market was the foil for competing conceptions of contract freedom . <p> But what about groups that operated totally outside the free market , either by choosing not to contract their labor or by selling something that was not recognized as a saleable commodity ? If the free market provided freedom , should everything be for sale ? Stanley poses and then explores these fascinating questions by looking at the treatment of beggars and prostitutes in postbellum America . <p> In the aftermath of slave emancipation , northern states enacted harsh new vagrancy laws . These penalties against idleness obliged former slaves and others to enter into wage contracts , " forcibly inculcating the habits of free labor " and forming a " conjunction of coercion and contract . " ( 99 ) Ironically a nation recently purged of chattel slavery established a new regime of forcible pauper labor . The justification for forcing beggars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free market economies . ( 121 ) Beggars by refusing to contract their labor upset the social order based on mutually bargained exchange . Vagrancy laws " were represented as the guarantee -- not the nullification -- of voluntary transactions . " ( 121 ) <p> Stanley is quick to point out that even the most devoted supporters of these new laws recognized the contradiction that " a society priding itself on having abolished slavery was forcibly extracting labor from dependent persons . " ( 133 ) The way out of this contradiction was to frame vagrancy laws in terms of contract and exchange -- and so they borrowed idioms from the marketplace to define the treatment of beggars . In exchange for alms the beggar provided labor -- this was the quid pro quo , and became a primary justification for involuntary labor . Charity , formerly the " very essence of a paternal relationship , " was translated into free market exchange . ( 135 ) In this way " the state enforced the sale of labor -- through an involuntary exchange -- whenever beggars contrived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 137 ) Stanley thus uses the case of beggars to show how legal coercion and enforced exchange could be framed and understood as part of the operation of the free market . <p> Stanley also examines the relationship between free market contract ideals and prostitution , observing that " in the eyes of the law the streetwalker was the beggar 's double ; their common crime was roving about and soliciting in public . " ( 219 ) But in a culture that celebrated market exchange , the sale of sex posed a contradiction and was potentially " threatening to the legitimacy of contract as a model of freedom " Prostitution seemed at once to be a form of both voluntary and involuntary exchange and " the streetwalker was so disturbing a presence precisely in her ambiguity -- a figure who conspicuously blurred the difference between free and unfree commodity relations , who could be seen as both the essence of contract freedom and a vestige of slavery . " ( 219 ) <p> This ambiguity was reflected in the controversy over the proposed legalization and licensing of prostitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stanley writes , in almost all of the nation 's cities , including Philadelphia , the District of Columbia , Chicago and San Francisco . The justification for these laws were similar to vagrancy laws , namely to promote public health by keeping roving persons off the street and to impose state control over free market exchange . Despite support from doctors and police , these bills were " defeated by anti-licensing coalitions led by former abolitionists , feminists , and ministers who called themselves ' new abolitionists. ' " ( 251 ) <p> These ' new abolitionists ' took up the language of the old abolitionists , arguing that prostitution amounted to the commodification of the self , and that state could not legitimize this form of commerce any more than it could protect chattel slavery . While wage laborers and married women had sought to make similar arguments about the ways in which the commodification of labor and the laws of coverture were themselves forms of slavery , anti-licensing reformers alone were able to successfully equate prostitution and slavery . Stanley closes the chapter with the trenchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market , it was " not labor but sex that represented the human essence whose sale as a commodity transformed its owners from free persons into slaves . " ( 263 ) <p> Taken individually , Stanley 's treatment of hirelings , married women , freed slaves , beggars and prostitutes are each highly original , surprising and informative . What seems at first blush a mostly doctrinal analytical framing device -- the application and contestation of ideas of contract -- becomes in this book a way of making connections between a remarkable number of historical sub-fields . Stanley 's book is a rare find , a monograph that is at once particular and rich in detail yet also genuinely synthetic . Contract becomes a way of examining not only labor , but also intellectual history , gender , race relations , home life , legal culture , and political theory . This book will allow historians from vastly different fields to talk with one another , and successfully puts ideas of contract at the center of a striking number of different historical questions and debates . <p> Taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that the Gilded Age was an era marked by the embrace of laissez-faire political economy and untrammeled individual freedom in the market . Instead of unfettered acquisitive individuals , Stanley instead traces the widespread use of state power to shape a particular social order . The role and limits of a free market in the postbellum market was , Stanley shows , not only up for grabs but subject to violent debate framed explicitly in terms of slavery and freedom . Stanley has discovered that emancipation set in motion a debate over what constituted the illegitimate sale or commodification of human beings . Chattel slavery ? Wage labor ? Coverture ? Prostitution ? She reminds us that freedom defined as free entry into the marketplace was but one definition of freedom that competed with several others . By book 's end Stanley has made us aware , as historical actors in the 1870s and 1880s were all too aware , of the contradiction of framing emancipation in terms of market exchange . We are left with that contradiction still , or , as Stanley closes her book , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human beings while freedom is imagined as commodity exchange . " ( 268 ) <p> Note <p> 1 .

A reasonable number of Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi were full blown Mullas of various towns in their own right , or were in the process of becoming recognized as a Mulla , or were practicing as religious students Talabih . This particularly holds true for the leadership . This class Ulama were a protected species in the Qajar period - even in modern Iran - and are renowned for their preference for worldly comforts including fine food and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in any forms of conflict or battle prior to Shaykh Tabarsi . They did not even know the basics of one-on-one fights . There is virtually no accounts to suggest that any of them had committed murder or killed any person before coming to the battles . In other words , they were totally and utterly inexperienced and unfamiliar with military operations . There are numerous examples of the transformation of these people after the start of battles . Haji Mirza Jani remarks about a certain Riza Khan who had developed an expertise in chopping-off the heads of the cannon operators hiding behind the cannons. ( 2 ) <p> Another example is sighted of Mulla Husayn who chased after a particular soldier in one battle . The soldier retreated and hid behind a tree and used his rifle as his guard . Mulla Husayn quickly applied his sword and cut the tree , rifle and soldier in to six parts . ( 3 ) <p> In modern militia uprisings , such lack of training and experience will quickly lead to a hasty defeat at the hands of the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Royal Qajar Army for more than nine months despite lack of weaponry and basic necessities . If the purpose of Babi leadership was purely military , the resistance could have continued well beyond nine months . Waves after waves of the best and most competent Qajar officers and soldiers were time and time again mutilated and decimated by these former civilians . <p> Careful strategic planning was a major ingredient of the resistance . The Babi leadership used techniques that horrified regular and experienced troops . It is not known whether these plans were thought out well in advance , or came as a divine inspiration during the heat of the moment . Babis had planned that Mulla Husayn would always lead the pack , covered by a few horsemen a short distance away , followed by the rest of the Babis on bare foot raising their swords and waving their hands in the air . Some had rifles but did not use up more than one bullet . They would generally fire that bullet when they got fairly close the enemy lines , and quickly drop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ya Quddus " and " Ya Sahib-ul-Zaman " . Mulla Husayn would lead by example and advise Babis to begin the battle . Every time one of the Babis was hit , the others would take his place without showing any emotion or hesitation . There was never any urge to flee , everyone wanted to be killed in order to protect his fellow Babis. ( 4 ) <p> The resistance appears particularly interesting when we consider that Bab never permitted Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi to conduct a Holy War Jihad . Mulla Husayn and Quddus constantly reminded Babis to only defend themselves . Every time Babis got the upper hand and appeared to change the balance of the military confrontation and exert a degree of offensiveness , Mulla Husayn would quickly order a retreat . <p> The Babis actually wanted to be killed during the conflict . Chief Commander Abbas-Gholi khan Larijani further explains that to the amazement of everyone , the Babis appeared to view killing and being killed as part of the same coin . They almost competed with one another to be killed and displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles , swords and daggers as an eternal source of salvation . ( 5 ) <p> Their insistence at defensive fighting techniques coupled with a decrease in their food supplies during the final weeks of the resistance , forced the Babis to take some desperate actions . On one occasion the government forces had erected four towers on the four corners of the compound and installed cannons on the top of each tower and were bombarding the compound from above . Babis immediately began to dig underground tunnels to take refuge . The natural water table in Mazandaran is fairly close to the ground , and hence tunnels were often flooded . To add to their misery , heavy rain also impeded their efforts . They found the tunnels unbearable and could not dwell in the compound because of the cannon fires . The ones inside the rooms had to endure constant firing and bombardments. ( 6 ) <p> It quickly became clear to the soldiers that contrary to the propaganda of Ulama and Qajar regime , the Babis never intended to overthrow the King . They wanted eternal happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their distinctive " Ya Quddus " and " Ya Sahib-ul-Zaman " shouts instilled fear in the hearts of the opposition . The Qajar officers instructed their troops to shout " Ya Nasir-al-Din Shah " in response . ( 7 ) <p> The other unique feature of this uprising is the uneven distribution of fatalities . In modern militia uprisings we witness far greater causalities on the part of the militias compared to the regular forces , particularly if the militia are based in a fixed position . The low casualty differential of Babis during the battles of Shaykh Tabarsi coupled with their non-existent military training and experience is quite startling . In one of the battles seventy believers were killed in one night . After dawn it became evident that the government forces had suffered 400 dead and 1000 injured . The dead included 35 colonels . Abbas-Gholi Khan Larijani arranged for the removal of the bodies to nearby town of Amul for burial . As soon as the news got to Bar-Furush , the local Mulla Sayyid-al-Ulama became frightened and assumed that the Babis will soon invade the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his private residence . ( 8 ) <p> The high morale of Babis and their willingness to be martyred contrasted starkly with the behavior of the Ulama who were provoking the public against them . The open fear displayed by the Ulama further erode the confidence of government troops . The Ulama knew well that they could not match Babi arguments during a public debate . Hence they resorted to further fueling the flames of war by encouraging volunteers to join the " Holy War " against the infidels . As the military 's list of causalities and fatalities increased , the public opinion pressure also intensified to find a peaceful settlement . This made the Ulama even more vocal in recruiting volunteers and inciting violence . The public quickly began to question the role of the Ulama . Haji Mirza Jani describes a visit to Mazandaran at the time of the battles . He witnessed local shopkeepers and laborers openly saying that : " the Ulama expect public respect during times of weddings and celebrations . They eat the finest dishes , wear the best fabrics and marry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counter claims and answer logical arguments , they sit at home and send the poor to the killing fields . If they genuinely believe their claims , why do n't they join the battles ? " ( 9 ) <p> Commander Abbas-Gholi khan Larijani repeatedly advised the Ulama to lead by example and participate in the " Holy War " in order to reclaim public confidence . The Ulama then publicly announced that they are moving to the battle front . Quddus learnt of the news and decided to play on their fear . He instructed Babis to place the heads of the slain soldiers on display at the top the trenches. ( 10 ) <p> Presence of Ulama in the battle front produced no tangible results for the government troops . In fact their open display of fear caused havoc in the ranks of volunteers and soldiers . To such an extent that Abbas-Gholi Khan Larijani ordered them to return to their homes - without seeking prior permission from Amir Kabir Prime Minister . Haji Mirza Jani remarks that the Mullas ' quarters in the battle front was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were restless at nights and reluctant to take part in the confrontations . Abbas-Gholi Khan Larijani feared that this might effect the morale of his troops and asked them to return . They happily followed his request. ( 11 ) <p> In stark contrast , the Babi leadership was quite prepared for the worst . Quddus became instantly pleased at the sight of a killed Babi . On one occasion a cannon ball fell on the roof of his room , Mulla Sadigh Khurasani quickly arose and gestured to Quddus to follow suit . Quddus remained still and said " If the Beloved desirest to finish us off with a bullet , why should we refuse ? and if He does not , it will never happen . " ( 12 ) <p> 2 . Number of Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi <p> The uprising provided an opportunity for Babis around the country to gather together and defend the cause under the leadership of Mulla Husayn and Quddus . This was an open invitation and was heeded by many people from various backgrounds . Babis of Shaykh Tabarsi represented the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks : " At present there are about 400 Muslims from all walks of life including the learned , shopkeepers , Haji 's , Siyyid 's and servants , a few each from various regions of Iran and other countries who have declared their faith and have forsaken their lives for Allah . " ( 13 ) <p> Mahjur-Zavarihi estimates the number of Babis who accompanied Mulla Husayn at Savad-Kuh were 313 with the following distribution : ( 14 ) <p> Area Numbers : Isfahan--40 <p> Behnamir--40 <p> Boshruieh--24 <p> Mashhad--22 <p> Myamai--19 <p> Herat--14 <p> Zanjan--13 <p> Ghom--12 <p> Sangesar--10 <p> Qazvin--10 <p> Torsheez--10 <p> Tehran-- 9 <p> Shahmirzad-- 9 <p> Shiraz-- 8 <p> Ardestan-- 7 <p> Kashan-- 6 <p> Hamadan-- 6 <p> Tabriz-- 5 <p> Torbat Heidari-- 5 <p> Karbala-- 5 <p> Ghaen-- 4 <p> India-- 4 <p> Kaquk-- 4 <p> Babol-- 4 <p> Kerman-- 3 <p> Oroomieh-- 3 <p> Kermanshah-- 3 <p> Yazd-- 3 <p> Shahrood-- 3 <p> Chalat-- 3 <p> Kanadi-- 2 <p> Amol-- 2 <p> Tabarsi--2 <p> Note the town with Letters of Living ( Bushruieh , Urumieh , Babul , Qazvin , Tabriz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 14 Afghans and 4 Indians amongst the Babis . This broad representation indicates that at the time of Shaykh Tabarsi , the Babi religion had truly been spread around the country . Which in turn demonstrates the huge success of the Letters of Living and early Babis in spreading the cause of Bab in a short spate of time . <p> Haji Mirza Jani stipulates that 230 people surrendered at the end of the uprising ( 18 ) . Which could mean that the total casualties were less than one hundred . The total number of 313 is also noted in Nabil 's narrative but as we shall see a considerable number of Babis from other towns and regions joined the battles afterwards . Therefore the difference between statistics produced by Mahjur-Zavarihi and Haji Mirza Jani or Nabil can be attributed to the timing . The new comers made up for those who were lost at the battles and hence it could be concluded that the total causalities may have been slightly more than one hundred . <p> It is interesting to point out that some of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaykh Tabarsi due to various reasons . Some arrived simply too late . For example Mulla Ibrahim Shahmirzadi first learned of the Babi cause in Karbala and return to join Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi without success ( 19 ) . Mulla Ali Bajistani only reached Shaykh Tabarsi after the surrender and subsequent slaughter of the Babis ( 20 ) . Mulla Ahmad Muallim-Hissari and his companions set out from Khurassan to join their fellow Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi . Local mobs and mullas became aware of their presence and decided to arrest them . After observing the strict embargo , Mulla Ahmad and his companions returned to Khurassan ( 21 ) . Similarly Mirza Abdullah Isfahani , Aqa Muhammad Ghasem , Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Ali Nahri and Aqa Muhammad Taqi Hana-Saab were prevented from joining the Shaykh Tabarsi due to the embargo around the fortress ( 22 ) . Karablai Muhammad Hamzeh set out from Gilan to join in the battles and was informed by other Babis in the city of Lahijan that the event had been concluded . He was informed of the events in Zanjan and subsequently traveled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soleiman Khan Kulah-duz set out from Karbala to joint the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi and had reached Tehran where he was told that the battles have been concluded . ( 24 ) <p> Perhaps the most famous of this group of Babis is Tahirih who traveled to the vicinity of Shaykh Tabarsi but could not get through the embargo and was subsequently arrested and savagely murdered ( 25 ) . Haji Mulla Muhammad Hamzeh Shariaatmadar was 90 years of age when he set out to join Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi . He was prevented from joining because of the heavy embargo outside the fortress ( 26 ) . Ustad Muhammad Asgari Kafsh-Duz set out from Sangesar but was struck by illness and could not joint other Babis ( 27 ) . Mulla Ali Akbar Pishnamaz , his brother , Mulla Ali-Muhammad Pishnamaz and Mulla Salih together with 200 other Babis traveled to Shaykh Tabarsi , but decided to return after they observed the heavy embargo ( 28 ) . Aqa Aliriza Tajir Shirazi set out from Mashhad , but was arrested , tortured and heavily fined in an area near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded . For example Aqa Mirza Abutulab from Sangesar was a local trader who learnt of the Babi cause in the town of Shaahi , and met up with three Babis who had traveled from far away to joint the Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi . These three were in hiding to avoid the mob and local government agents . Aqa Mirza Abutulab dressed them up as merchants and accompanied them with his servants on ( his ) horses towards Shaykh Tabarsi . Luckily all joined the fortress without any incidents ( 20 ) . Riza Khan Turkaman was a nobleman who was suspected of being a Babi and was driven out of the government armed forces . He yearned to joint the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi and decided to approach the troop commanders and repent in order to be given a position in the battle front . His apology was accepted and he was placed in a column of forces commanded by Prince Mihdi-Gholi Mirza . On the day of the first battle , he ran his horse towards the fortress , joined the Babis and yelled abuse at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix of the Babi Battlers <p> We mentioned that the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi broadly represented the various regions of Iran . A brief examination of their background reveals that they were mullas , farmers , nobles , cooks , merchants , shopkeepers , builders , teachers , blacksmiths , tailors and tradesmen . These people soon began to assist the Shaykh Tabarsi community with their trade skills . Working hours were long , sometimes interrupted by the battles and there were no expectations for wages or payments . Their utmost cooperation and consultation seemed to please Mulla Husayn and Quddus . In stark contrast , such classes of people in the Qajar period had a great deal of friction and tension with one another . For example , in amongst the forces of commander Abbas-Gholi Khan Larijani , the volunteer Ulama were treated differently from other soldiers and maintained their own privileges including guards and private accommodation . Other soldiers and commoners were housed in a make shift camp far closer to the fortress . <p> Haji Mirza Jani reports that Quddus actually determined the boundaries and general layout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin the construction and repair works . He then instructed each person to provide assistance in accordance with his line of trade . Builders Bannaa started to build , tailors began to sew and metal workers started to make swords with the utmost joy ( 32 ) . He further reports the extensive repairs made by the Babis to a run down and dis- used bath inside the compound . This was dedicated to Quddus who practiced and preached cleanliness , and bathed every day . ( 33 ) <p> Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi were not just blue-collar hard working laborers or mullas . Amongst them were wealthy businessmen who utilized their riches and capital to advance the Babi cause . Babis who accompanied Mulla Husayn numbered 230 and possessed about one hundred horses of varying value ( some 100 Toomans , and some 50 Toomans ) . One merchant donated about 5,000 Toomans worth of emeralds and silk ( 34 ) . Aqa Mortiza Zanjani and his brother were notable merchants in Shiraz and were eventually martyred at Shaykh Tabarsi ( 35 ) . Mirza Muhammad Baghir Khurassani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was involved in the organization and planning of the battles . After his execution , the enemies found mince horse meat in his pockets indicating the level of starvation these people were under ( 36 ) . <p> Haji Abdul-Majid Neishaburi was a wealthy merchant . He donated his massive inheritance to the cause . He initially gave a huge sum of money and goods to Khosrow Ghadikalai in order to stop his soldiers from harassing the Babis . He obeyed the instructions from Mullas Husayn , discarded his valuable items and materials and joined the battles of Shaykh Tabarsi ( 37 ) . Haji Mirza Jani reports that Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi had in excess of 200 horses , between 40 to 50 cows and 300-400 lambs which was mainly donated by Babis from Mazandaran region(38) <p> Mirza Muhammad-Taqi Djuani was a renowned government official and teacher in his native town of Sabzivar who joined Shaykh Tabarsi and assumed the role of commander in a number of Babi battles ( 39 ) . Riza Khan , a former Army Officer donated between 4000 and 5000 Toomans , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaykh Tabarsi ( 40 ) . After the enforcement of embargo and running out of supplier , Aqa Sayyid Abutulab smuggled the remaining donkeys in the compound to near by towns for sale . He then used the money to buy clothes and food for the Babis inside . ( 41 ) <p> Mirza Muhammad Baghir Ghaini was a respected scholar , author , politician , poet and artist from Mashhad . After joining Shaykh Tabarsi , he became Mulla Husayn 's right hand man and advised him on battle policy , organization and strategy . He displayed extreme bravery and strength in times of adversity . He designed the walls and buildings in the fortress , all of which represented a complete symmetry ( 42 ) . Haji Muhammad Karadi owned a number of gardens and properties . He was an expert in battle techniques and served in the Egyptian forces in his younger days . He joined Shaykh Tabarsi at the age of 80 , but became paralyzed whilst in the fortress . ( 43 ) <p> In addition , there were other Babis from the outside who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , it would have been impossible to resist against the onslaught of government attacks for nine months . Such assistance came in the form of hard cash , tea , sugar or animals . For example Mirza Aliriza Mustashar-al--Dulih from Mashhad was a well known personality with numerous properties , shops and gardens . He financed the expenses of Mulla Husayn and his party from Mashhad ( 44 ) . <p> This degree of riches , goods and capital movement to the Babis raised the envy of Khosrow Ghadikalai and his soldiers . The main cause of the preliminary clashes between the two sides could be attributed to this fact . However , Quddus and Mulla Husayn went to great pains to stress that Babis must share their possessions with one another and never lose sight of the ultimate purpose which was martyrdom in His cause . Haji Mirza Jani describes the early encounter with Khosrow Ghadikalai : <p> " He came to Mulla Husayn and asked for money . Mulla Husayn instructed the payment of 100 Toomans and some goods . He then asked for Mulla Husayn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular request , these items are a gift from a special person and under no circumstance shall I give them away .. " After the initial clashes , Mulla Husayn instructed Babis to discard all of their possessions and leave . Later he arranged for the possessions to be collected and taken to Shaykh Tabarsi . He then gathered everyone for a meeting and advised that these belongs to all of you . He then nominated a cook and joined the Babis during meal times . ( 45 ) <p> Haji Mirza Jani again describes a scene where the Babis were eating " Choltook " inside Shaykh Tabarsi . Quddus rushed outside his quarters and said " Have you come to this fortress to part take in a feast or to assist the cause of God ? If you came here for a feast , you all had fine foods in your houses in complete security . Why are you here ? If you came here to assist the cause of God what are these preparations ? " He then instructed that they give the food to horses , lambs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depleted . ( 46 ) <p> When food supplies became scarce , Quddus instructed that the sick and weaker horses be sacked from the fortress , and other horses be slaughtered for human consumption . He " halalled " horse meat . For some of the Babis - particularly the wealthier ones - this was quite difficult . They eventually started to eat and were joined by Quddus ( 47 ) . <p> After all the horses were slaughtered and consumed , Babis turned to grass . They cleared inside of the compound from all vegetation including weeds and leaves . They resorted to getting leaves from outside of the compound and risked bullets to obtain a few leaves . For nineteen days their diet consisted of a warm plate of water in dawn and dusk ( 48 ) . After surrender , they appeared weak , hungry and i 'll ( 49 ) . The last days of the battles saw them with no weapons , horses , food or physical stamina . It is interesting to note that given this state of affairs , the government forces could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning way their resorted to Quran to break the deadlock . In other words , the conspiracy of Ulama saved face for the attacking forces at the end of the day . The Babis proved that through divine confirmation and faith one could survive and win despite all the odds . <p> 4 . Resistance of the Babi Families <p> The Shaykh Tabarsi uprising was not solely limited to the battles near the fortress . Families , fellow Babis and sympathizers all over the country played an active role in sustaining the resistance movement and keeping the memories alive . The Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi held out against the combined government and volunteer forces for nine months and most were eventually martyred . But their families and friends in various regions were the target of a organized campaign for years . In addition to bearing the loss of their loved ones , these families had to endure years of verbal abuse , physical hatred , economic sanctions and severe violation of their human rights . <p> The resistance shown by these families was far longer and they were tested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely families in isolated towns who had to ensure hardship on their own including children who had lost their fathers in an early age . In a majority of cases the Ulama provoked the locals to impose an economic embargo on the families . The faith and character of the families was severely tested but they remained defiant despite the difficulties . The families were instrumental in encouraging their loved ones to participate in Shaykh Tabarsi in the first place , and were the ones who paid a dear price after their martyrdom . <p> In Sangesar , upon being informed of the Shaykh Tabarsi uprising , an old couple advised their son Safar Ali to join the forces of Qa'im . Later when the father heard that Safar Ali was killed , he went to the local bath , dyed his beard a traditional practice usually reserved for celebrations and weddings and announced to the town " I have arranged a wedding for my son " . Locals thought that he has turned insane after the tragedy and shunned him ( 50 ) . After the conclusion of Shaykh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . His mother initially thought that the son may have deserted the battle front . She indicated her anger and disappointment in him . When the son convinced her that he was captured and subsequently released by the soldiers and his father - Mirza Muhammad Baghir - was executed instead , she arranged a gathering and distributed sweets and biscuits to celebrate and break the news to other Babis ( 51 ) . <p> Again in Sangesar , a widow made the arrangements for her three sons to travel to Shaykh Tabarsi . Prior to their departure she asked them to do her proud and to be steadfast and lose their lives in assisting the cause of Qa'im . After few weeks , her only remaining son was preparing to join his brothers in Shaykh Tabarsi . She advised him to delay his trip until she receives a reply to her letter from the Bab . When the son asked her about the contents of her letter , she read out the contents : " This old lady understands that you Bab regard all believers in complete equality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is more than my fair share . I will indeed sent my fourth son if it is considered mandatory . However , I am old and require this son to look after me from now on . However if you see fit , I shall send him as well . " The Bab subsequently advised her to keep the fourth son for her service and further pointed out that he is truly considered one of us despite not participating in the battles . ( 52 ) <p> It is fascinating to note that out of the Shaykh Tabarsi community , some survived to tell the tales and even participate in future uprisings . Ustad Jaafar Banaa Isfahani returned to Isfahan and lived a long life and later disclosed many of the memories , whilst Abolhassan Chit-Saz went on to join the Zanjan resistance and martyred there. ( 53 ) <p> The cruelty of the locals in Sangesar and Shahmirzad was particularly pointed . It is reported that the families of Babi martyrs in these towns celebrated the martyrdom of their loved ones , congratulated one another , dyed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this behavior and refused to sell them any goods or services . Many children and elderly suffered from malnutrition due to the lack of milk and bread . A particular Babi Mirza Ahmad escaped with his old mother from Sangesar to Shahmirzad where his sister was staying for some peace and quite . The Muslim women in the town attacked the mother and sister in the streets , pulled their hair and accused them of betraying their religion for the benefit of infidels and foreigners . This particular family suffered alone , and wept together from the persecutions . Mirza Ahmad was the guardian of his brothers " children as they had been martyred in Shaykh Tabarsi . He reports severe financial and emotional hardships . The locals had enforced a food embargo on the family to such an extent that they resorted to cooking and consuming weeds . Mirza Ahmad even attempted to sell the family properties and gardens in order to obtain food , but the local refused to deal with him saying he is an infidel and a foreign agent . The family even suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life difficult for them . On one occasion he instigated a complaint to the local governor advising that they must be punished and killed . Mirza Ahmad reports that he maintained his dignity and respect for the rogue uncle at all times . ( 54 ) <p> The mother and sister of Mulla Husayn were ecstatic on the news of the martyrdom of their two sons . Their house became a focal point for the local Babi community where they gathered to teach the faith and communicate information to one another ( 55 ) . They actually commissioned one of the survivors of Shaykh Tabarsi , Muhammad Husayn Zavarihi to write a detailed account of his memories of Mulla Husayn 's martyrdom . <p> The families were easy prey for the Ulama , and were persecuted every time the government forces were dealt a heavy blow in the battle front . Despite lack of media in those days , the influx of dead and injured in to local towns of Mazandaran gave the people a barometer of the proceedings . Ulama sought revenge from easy targets to consolidate their position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaykh Tabarsi were constantly coached by Quddus and Mulla Husayn in times of need , whereas the poor families had no console and had to endure hardships on their own . On a number of occasions , the authorities tried to persuade Babis to leave the fortress by resorting to their close relatives and family members : <p> Once during the course of the battles , Prince Mihdi-Gholi Mirza arranged for the father , step mother and sister of Quddus to come to the battle front . Prince asked the father " What are the intentions of your son from causing such havoc ? " He replied that I am ignorant of the reasons behind his activities . The Prince sent him near the fortress to talk to Quddus . It is reported that once he saw Quddus , he was shocked and temporarily lost his speech . After regaining his composure , he talked about their captivity and the Prince 's scheme . Quddus replied that captivity and suffering in the path of God are quite valuable . But be aware that your former son has now been transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of Christ . Go back and inform the Prince of the facts . The father did so and was released after a few days . ( 56 ) <p> Quddus had a step brother named Heidar and referred to him as ' brother ' . Up on his departure for Shaykh Tabarsi , Quddus arranged for Heidar to reside in the house of Haji Shariaatmadar a sympathetic local mulla . Heidar became restless and constantly wept for his half brother and begged to be allowed to return to his home . After Prince Mihdi-Gholi Mirza learnt of his whereabouts , he ordered his soldiers to bring Heidar in to his quarters . As soon as Heidar arrived , he ordered executioners to slay him . He was still on the horse back when he was brutally slaughtered . His grief-stricken mother took his body to town for burial , but the locals refused burial . He was later buried in a remote location outside the town ( 57 ) . Quddus had an uncle named Aqa Muhammad Sadeq who came to assist the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lived a long life and told of the heroics he witnessed at the fortress . ( 58 ) <p> During the height of the battles one of the Royal couriers came to see Prince Mihdi-Gholi Mirza and suggested that since he knew Mulla Mahdi Kandi one of the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi personally , he may be able to persuade him to abandon the fortress and return to his family . Prince allowed him to proceed to the fortress . Up on being informed , Mulla Mahdi came to see the his old acquaintance . He appeared wearing an Arabic style white garment with a white band wrapped around his head and carrying a sword . He hurriedly requested his friend to convey the message as he was anxious to return and obey instructions from Quddus . The courier reports that he was dumb founded by what he observed and temporarily forgot everything . The only thing he remembered was Mulla Mahdi 's young son - Rahman . He said " I have brought you a message from your young Rahman : My kind father , What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us without support in a dreadful state of affairs ? " Mulla Mahdi replied " Tell him that the true Rahman has come and filled my heart with his love , making no room for the love of physical Rahman " . The courier then jokingly told Mulla Mahdi " What will you do to me of I enter this fortress ? " He answered : " If you have come to seek the truth , I will guide you . If you come because of our old friendship , I will serve you the best I can and share with you all that I have including boiled weeds and burnt bones . But if you come with the purpose of violence and murder , I will defend by displacing your head with one movement of this very sword and throw your body from the heights of the walls . " The courier then said " The Prince has just announced a decree that whoever abandons the fortress will be safe and they will pay for his expenses to return to his family . " Mulla Mahdi replied " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go now , please leave if you have nothing more to add . " ( 59 ) <p> 5 . United and Determined Leadership <p> Often militia movements suffer from multiple splits due to differences in opinions of their leaders . The hunger for power coupled with greed and control of instruments of destruction , will gradually generate personality clashes , arrogance and envy amongst the top echelon . This will in turn reduce their movement to a marginal force . In the Shaykh Tabarsi movement , this was not the case . Mulla Husayn and Quddus were the leaders , but their love and affection towards one another seems surreal . Mulla Husayn assumed the role of the military leader whilst Quddus was their spiritual leader . All decisions taken was through consultation and prior agreement and had the total support of the hierarchy . There were no disputes and no one was held in Shaykh Tabarsi against their will . <p> Quddus referred to Mulla Husayn as " Sultan Mansur " the victorious king and Mulla Husayn called Quddus " Habib " the beloved . This alone served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is further evident in the period leading to the martyrdom of Mulla Husayn . According to eye witness accounts , Mulla Husayn first requested the permission of Quddus to be martyred . Quddus initially refused and then reluctantly agreed . Mulla Husayn 's seemingly dead body suddenly starts to talk to Quddus . And Quddus with an injured mouth starts to reply back . Such events are beyond the understanding of physical realm and further demonstrate that this movement was spiritual in essence . Muhammad Husayn Ibn Muhamad Hadi Tabatabai Zavarihi , one of the Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi at the time writes : <p> Mulla Husayn used to preach all believers for three consecutive days prior to his martyrdom to respect and obey the instructions from Quddus ( 60 ) . One day Mulla Husayn addressed all believers and said whom amongst you is prepared to accompany me to the battle .

Quddus was not happy to lose his close companion and after vigorous persistence from Mulla Husayn , he reluctantly agreed . They hugged one another for the last time . Many Babis were standing near the doorway . Some were happy to be martyred and some were saddened by the impending separation and others were completely overwhelmed by emotion . ( 62 ) <p> When Mulla Husayn finally left the fortress , he observed that nearly all of the Babis have also come out with him , leaving only a handful in the compound . He advised that his beloved is alone and requested that people return to the fortress to serve Quddus . Babis again lamented at the sorrow of losing Mulla Husayn , but he clearly ordered them to return and assist Quddus.

They took the body to Quddus and placed it above his bed .

As soon as his eyes saw the body , he sighed and sobbed .

He wrote .. what you just experienced and heard is correct and one of the miracles performed by Mulla Husayn. ( 65 ) <p> Conclusion <p> This paper briefly considered a number of features of the Shaykh Tabarsi uprising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It differs starkly with other militia movements of past and present times in that : <p> 1 . The participants had no prior military or battle experience . They were normal civilians in their own region . The clever techniques , organization and planning demonstrated by Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi despite the lack of weaponry and supplies is quite startling . In fact their ultimate surrender came as a result of a cunning trick from Ulama to use Quran . They were never defeated militarily . The Bab only instructed them to defend . What could have been the consequence , had He ordered " Jihad " ? <p> 2 . The participants represented all social classes of their time . Amongst them were cooks , builders , tailors , mullas , merchants , tradesmen etc . Shaykh Tabarsi gave Babis from all regions an opportunity to come together and serve the leadership at once . The unity amongst the participants was in stark contrast to the social classes in the Qajar period . Thus unity and love can be attributed to their spiritual upbringing , and a competent leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one common purpose . <p> 3 . The Shaykh Tabarsi resistance had the full supports of the Babi community at the time . Outside assistance in the forms of cash , goods and services enabled the Babis to keep defending for nine months . The families and friends of the martyrs were the target of a viscous physical abuse in their towns and regions . Their resistance carried on for a life time and caused enormous hardships within families . The Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi had been transformed to such an extent that family ties were no longer important for them . Numerous attempts by the enemies to utilize family members to ask them to quite failed . <p> 4 . A statistical analysis of the number of Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi shows that many joined the fortress during the course of battles . Numbers were variable . Some could not reach the fortress due to the embargo or illness whilst others were simply too late . Many used innovative tactics in order to join their fellow Babis . <p> 5 . A united and determined leadership was instrumental in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Quddus and Mulla Husayn can only be described as " Meta-physical " . Two Letters of Living : One the first , the other the last . They competed in praising and obeying one another . There was no arrogance , greed or hunger for power . <p> It must be stressed that - unlike claims made by some Iranian and Russian historians - the Shaykh Tabarsi movement was not a battle between " social classes of the time " or " the masses and the regime " . Simply because it lacks all of the features of a modern militia or uprising . The length , level of resistance and social analysis of this movement proves that Babis were only guided through the spiritual teachings and awakening emanating from the new Revelation . Otherwise no other " conflicts " could endure such a threat to the stability of the establishment for nine months during the reign of the infamous Prime Minister - Amir Kabir . <p> All of the references quoted are taken from H-Bahai page on the World Wide Web on : http : **25;2061;TOOLONG

Giglio ( Southwest Missouri State University ) Published on H-Diplo ( March , 1998 ) <p> The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 has been a veritable cottage industry for scholars. 1 Moreover , considerable primary materials continue to become available , most recently State and Defense department documents published in The Foreign Relations of the United States , which appeared about one year prior to the publication of the study under consideration , and The Kennedy Tapes edited by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow , which came out too late for One Hell of a Gamble . With the publication of the May-Zelikow study , one now has access to all of the taped deliberations of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council ( ExComm ) , increasing our understanding of how Kennedy and his associates grappled with Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba . With the release of the Kennedy tapes , the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library has opened about ninty-nine percent of its material on the missile crisis . All that remains closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as some intelligence-related documents . <p> Of the recent works , none is more significant than One Hell of a Gamble because it represents the first to incorporate sources from the Russian archives , including the Presidium materials on Cuba , the KGB 's records of its Washington , D.C. and Havana bureaus , and the military intelligence files . Whether this represents full disclosure remains unclear . The study also incorporates personal interviews of former Soviet officials . This collaborative effort involves Timothy Naftali , a teacher of history at Yale University where he is a fellow at International Security Studies , and Aleksandr Fursenko , chairman of the History Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences . Billed as an international study , it also includes materials from the archives of France and the Czech Republic . What is notably missing are sources from Cuban repositories , which most likely will remain closed . <p> The book title comes from a response President Kennedy made to the congressional leadership in the heat of the crisis following a recommendation to invade Cuba . With Soviet nuclear medium- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would indeed have been " one hell of a gamble " to knock them out--one that Kennedy privately did not wish to take . But this work does not limit itself to the crisis ; it begins with the emergence of Fidel Castro as the leader of the Cuban revolutionary government , and it concludes with Khrushchev 's ouster from power . It covers Soviet-U.S. relations through the late Eisenhower-Kennedy presidencies , paying particular attention to the Bay of Pigs and the Kennedys ' obsession with Cuba afterward . Since the greatest revelations come from Soviet sources , it tilts in that direction . Those who are accustomed to associating certain events and names with the missile crisis will be surprised by the omissions : There is no mention of Dean Acheson , Adlai Stevenson 's confrontation with the Soviets at the UN , Andrew Cordier , AM/LASH , or the dramatic events relating to the blockade . Obviously , this is not a definitive study of the crisis . <p> One Hell of a Gamble does show the extent to which Khrushchev directed Soviet foreign policy from the inception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Castro regime by supplying it with arms and then negotiating a secret treaty pledging to defend Cuba . Because of Castro 's fears of a U.S. invasion--there were four separate invasion scares in 1960-1961--Khrushchev advised an ambivalent Castro to accept Soviet ground-to-ground missiles as a deterrent . Soviet sources suggest that Khrushchev may have been even more concerned by the discrepancy between Soviet and U.S. ICBM capabilities . Placing Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba would enable him to close the gap . Those same missiles might force the United States to reconsider its Jupiter missiles in Turkey . Moreover , Kennedy 's decision to resume nuclear testing also became a consideration as was Castro 's suspected drift away from Moscow as the result of internal considerations . Khrushchev made the missile deployment decision , and the Presidium unanimously approved it . <p> Khrushchev 's strategy included a proposed visit to the United States following the congressional elections of 1962 to inform Kennedy personally of the missiles . Of course , his plan could succeed only if the missiles remained undetected prior to being made operational and if Kennedy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in Turkey . From the beginning the Russian military leaders were skeptical that the missiles could be concealed from American U-2 reconnaissance flights , and even Khrushchev soon had his doubts . Kennedy 's tough September statement against possible Soviet military presence in Cuba suggested that the American president would find the missiles difficult to ingest . <p> The United States detection of the missiles and the ExComm secret deliberations of how to respond is a familiar story that One Hell of a Gamble retells . It emphasizes the fluidity of the positions taken , with Defense Secretary Robert McNamara favoring a limited air strike by the morning of October 26 after initially opposing it , and it reveals that JFK , despite supporting an air strike until October 20 , became the greatest proponent of a trade involving the Jupiter missiles in Turkey . Less well-known is the extent to which both sides engaged in back-channel negotiations largely involving Robert Kennedy , the president 's brother , and Georgi Bolshakov , the Soviet military intelligence officer . In such encounters Soviet sources confirm the misperceptions that both had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy faced pressure from the military for an air strike , they exaggerated the possibility of a U.S. invasion of Cuba . U.S. policymakers , meanwhile , had it wrong that Soviet hard-liners were pressuring Khrushchev . The study also discloses the weakness of Soviet intelligence during the crisis . While ignoring more credible sources , the Russians instead accepted questionable information from a New York Herald Tribune correspondent that the U.S. planned an invasion , convincing Khrushchev that he could not keep ballistic missiles in Cuba without going to war . <p> One Hell of a Gamble suggests that Khrushchev 's October 26 letter , proposing a U.S. promise not to attack Cuba for a Soviet one to remove the missiles , was circulated among Presidium members before being sent to Kennedy . His letter the following day represented a reconsideration influenced not by hard-liners but by feelers emanating from meetings between Bolshakov and close Kennedy friend Charles Bartlett , a Washington-based correspondent ; and journalist Frank Holeman , who had ties with Robert Kennedy . That second letter of October 27 , proposing a missile trade , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , it became a crucial part of the settlement in which Robert Kennedy secretly promised Bolshakov that the missiles in Turkey would be removed in four or five months . Khrushchev apparently did not betray Kennedy 's confidence either to Castro or to his own bureaucracy even after coming under heavy criticism for failing to extract any concession other than the U.S. promise not to attack Cuba . <p> Perhaps the most controversial issue of the missile crisis remains the deployment of tactical nuclear missiles in Cuba . Did the Soviet military commander , Issa Pliyev , have authorization to use them in the event of an invasion ? Apparently , even though Pliyev had not received final instructions from Khrushchev , enough ambiguity existed where they could have been used against invading forces . It was not until the 27th that he received an order that " you are forbidden to apply nuclear warheads ... without authorization from Moscow " ( p. 276 ) Also on the 27th , a Soviet commander disobeyed instructions by firing a SA-2 rocket , thereby destroying a U-2 plane piloted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning out of control . Fortunately , cooler heads on both sides prevailed . None proved cooler than the American president who rejected military retaliation . He not only persistently pressed for the Soviet withdrawal of the ground-to-ground missiles , but he also pushed for the removal of all offensive weapons , including the Il-28 bombers . <p> Khrushchev 's capitulation invited Castro 's wrath . The Soviet records reveal the extent to which antagonisms developed between the two allies . Angry at not being consulted , Castro opposed UN inspection of the removal of the missiles and the withdrawal of the bombers . His **25;2088;TOOLONG " Che " Guevara--mocked Soviet power ; one attempted to toast Joseph Stalin at a dinner attended by Anastas Mikoyan , Khrushchev 's personal envoy to Havana . At the same time Khrushchev became livid at Castro for threatening to shoot down American U-2s and for earlier suggesting that the Soviets unleash their nuclear arsenal against the United States . He called Castro unreasonable and undisciplined and momentarily questioned his commitment to him . And after the Cubans began to covet the tactical nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets decided to remove them too . <p> Soviet files revealed how concerned Khrushchev was about Kennedy 's assassination . Since the Soviet leadership had only Kennedy 's word about not invading Cuba , rather than a written agreement , his demise threatened to overturn the arrangement and the emerging detente between the two countries . Viewing Kennedy 's assassination as a right-wing conspiracy , the Soviets became immediately suspicious of President Johnson who was repeatedly denigrated by Kennedy loyalists . In the end , as Soviet sources suggest , Cuba contributed to Khrushchev 's collapse . He fell victim to a bloodless coup in October 1964 following an attack in the Presidium for his Cuban adventurism , which his detractors argued brought the world to the brink and led to Soviet humiliation . The authors conclude that Cuba had contributed to the vulnerability of both protagonists , leading to their destruction . <p> One Hell of a Gamble is a well-structured book that commands attention .

Looking for a book on the south and slavery , I came across a small paperback with the right price of $2.95 , which seemed to fit the bill . Little did I know that I would be in for a frustrating experience . Here was a book which contrasted with my notions of the South , slavery , and the contours of southern society . It could not be as clear and consistent as Eugene D. Genovese argued ; slavery could not have been like this , agricultural reform was a positive force , one which was clearly compatible with slavery , and white Southerners could not be as consistent in their commitment to the ' peculiar institution ' as Genovese portrayed them . After all , slavery was an evil institution , with no redeeming characteristics , and the slaveowners were as greedy and rapacious as any American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar ( or several thousands of dollars ) , having no humane or fellow feeling for their bondsmen , who lived in abject poverty . Yet , here was a text which , maddeningly , one could not argue with , and which portrayed a different South . Every part seemed to be logically and consistently constructed , making any attempt to pick it apart a difficult task at best . It was only at this point that I began to recognize that I was dealing with an important work . <p> Since that time I have come to see The Political Economy of Slavery for the influential book that it is . It is a wide ranging study . Chapters dealing with the mundane issue of livestock in the southern slave economy , mix with broadly comparative chapters on soil exhaustion and the productivity of African labor , and politically sophisticated arguments for expansion and restrictions of southern industrial leaders . Agricultural reform , the decision on using free , white labor or slaves in southern factories , and the role of economics and economic theory in studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays a firm command of the traditional historiography of slavery and the slave south . &gt;From the Dunning school and U.B . Philips , to the Revisionist arguments about a ' blundering generation ' , through Stampp 's work on the ' reality ' of slave-ownership and slave life , Genovese navigates his way through the maze of works on slavery , economics , development theory , economic history and southern history , as matters stood in the early 1960 's . Many of the topics raised in this book have since been dealt with by other historians . To name one , there is now a wealth of information on labor , slavery and society in Africa . Recent books by Joseph C. Miller , Richard L. Roberts and Patrick Manning illustrate the new directions of research and thinking on the issues of labor and labor productivity touched on by Genovese in Chapter 3 of Political Economy . <p> Yet , all the chapters are window-dressing in light of the central essay and theme of the book . Chapter 1 , " The Slave South : An Interpretation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Genovese 's interpretation of the slave south provides a holistic approach to the history of southern slave society . The crucial aspects of slave society are bared , in both their best and worst light , and the nature of southern society illuminated . Genovese accomplishes two tasks in this chapter , which still , whether one agrees with the conclusions or not , influence the way historians have seen southern history in the last 30 years . On one hand , Genovese takes the south seriously , as a thoughtful society filled with thoughtful men and women , concerned about the direction their social and political development is taking . Slavery , to them , is not something they can easily throw away , anymore than modern Americans can discard industrial capitalism at the drop of a hat . It was the society they were born into , the institution that shaped their lives , and , even when critical of it , unconsciously adapted their ideas and visions to its structure and rhythms . Slavery engendered certain cultural and social outlooks that worked to preserve the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would do equally as well to take them seriously . <p> On the other hand , Genovese presents us with an argument that links social , cultural , political and economic elements in a seamless web . The different parts of southern culture worked together , both to preserve slavery , and lead the south to its ultimate doom in 1861 . The " uniqueness of the antebellum South " ( pg 1 ) was manifested in its social beliefs , political ideology and public policy . The demands of slave society , or more precisely the slaveowners , limited the development of industry , retarded the growth of a home market , and undermined the drive for technological progress . Slavery made it impossible for the plantation to reform itself , or introduce new methods of restoring soil fertility , eroding the possibilities for economic advancement . The planters developed an " aristocratic , antibourgeois spirit with values and mores emphasizing family and status , a strong code of honor , and aspirations to luxury , ease , and accomplishment " that weakened the Northern work ethic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core , southern society rested on the master-slave relationship , with all of its inconstancies , fears , and hidden meanings , a relationship that permeated southern life . In the long run , the southern system , with its peculiar set of values and ideals , and unique social relations and political ideology , could not stand the strain of co-existence in a state dominated by industrial capitalists , employing free labor ideology and the doctrines of the Declaration of Independence . The seamless web of southern society , in the end , turned into the hangman 's noose . <p> The various chapters that follow " The Slave South : An Interpretation " illustrate certain facets of Genovese 's general argument , demonstrating in more detail the linkage of society , economy and ideology . For example , the discussion of soil exhaustion , reform , and plantation agriculture is closely related to the overall discussion of southern society . Genovese places soil exhaustion into a larger , comparative framework , drawing on work dealing with ancient Rome and Medieval Britain , as well as the American south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion " lies in the reaction of social institutions " , and the reaction of southerners to soil exhaustion was , inevitably , shaped by the existence of slavery . ( Pg . 88 ) He was not the first to argue this , as Genovese himself notes . But Genovese places the responsibility for soil exhaustion at the feet of the master-slave relationship . A sound agricultural system would have recognized the dangers to prosperity and social structure , and adjusted accordingly . Indeed , many in the south sounded the warning . John Taylor of Caroline , Edmund Ruffin , J.D.B. DeBow and others promoted agricultural reform as a means of restoring fertility to the soil and renewing the advance of prosperity for the future . But , all their efforts at rousing the south proved fruitless . <p> The reason was that " Slavery and the plantation system led to agricultural methods that depleted the soil " . ( Pg 99 ) The plantation was a legacy of the frontier , an effective means , with slavery , of mobilizing the large amounts of labor necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farmers adjusted their methods of agriculture to compensate for soil exhaustion , in response to the growing market for cereals and meat in an industrializing region . But slavery " forced the South into continued dependence on exploitative methods after the frontier had passed " . The precocious commercial production of Southern planters had , in the end , caught up with them . The commitment to single-crop , staple agriculture- the mode of production most compatible with slavery- limited Southerners ability to change crops , alter their style of farming or introduce new methods and organization , that would counteract the effects of soil exhaustion . <p> For reform to be successful , slavery would have to be curtailed or ended . The capital locked up in slaves would have to be freed for machinery and fertilizers . For their effectiveness , reform efforts needed a smaller labor force and a new form of farm organization . Reform could succeed in the Upper South , only because the Lower South absorbed the excess slave population . But , the cost was a decline in the importance of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Maryland and the whole of Delaware . The option available to Virginia and Maryland would , without territorial expansion , be closed to the Lower South , who then faced a future of bleak prospects and increased concentration of landholding , as planters scratched to make ends meet on exhausted soils . As Genovese puts it " The South faced a dilemma of which the problem of soil exhaustion formed only a part . On the one hand , it needed to develop its economy to keep pace with that of the free states , or the proud slaveholding class could no longer expect to retain its hegemony . On the other hand , successful reform meant the end of slavery and of the basis for the very power the planters were trying to preserve " . ( Pg 99 ) Soil exhaustion may have been only part of the Southern dilemma , but Genovese 's use of the problem exposed the tensions that lay at the heart of the planters social ideology and culture . Without slavery they would not exist . With slavery , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With the spotlight provided in " The Slave South : An Interpretation " , Genovese proceeds to illuminate a number of other aspects of Southern society and economy . The lack of a home market , the dependence of industry on the planters , the low productivity of labor led to economic stagnation . The slaveowners pretensions and pride blinded them to the real problem , that of slavery and slave society . They willingly adopted political panaceas for economic and social problems , because it was the last bastion of their power and authority . If their social structure was slowly , if irreversibly , crumbling under the weight of soil exhaustion , low productivity and lack of economic diversification , they could always use their political power to reverse the trends . Hence , the weight placed on access to the territories and further expansion in Mexico and the Caribbean . Finally , in 1860 , it was clear that the planters were going to be unable to pursue their plans within the structure of the union . Independence , as slave-holding republic , seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Genovese implies , would have disappointed the planter elite . The problems of their society were structural . Political intervention might have slowed the pace of decline and decay , but only for a time . <p> Since the publication of the book , critics of Genovese 's argument have often appeared . Criticism tends to fall into two main categories . Economic historians , using econometrics and theory have worked on the structure of slavery as an economic system . Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman , in Time on the Cross , argue that slavery was an adaptable system , with high enough levels of labor productivity and adequate profit rates , to preserve the institution , even within the structure of the union . From an economic viewpoint there was no inevitability to slavery 's collapse . Other historians have criticized Genovese 's argument from the perspective of social history . James Oakes , in The Ruling Race , takes exception with Genovese 's focus on the planter elite as a hegemonic elite . ( Although Oakes , in his latest book Slavery and Freedom , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great planters tended to be a small , isolated group , particularly concentrated in the southeast , who were unrepresentative of the mass of slaveowners . Laurence Shore and Frederick Siegel argue that Genovese underestimates the independence and effect of industrial capitalism on southern society . Both economic and social historians stress the ' bourgeois ' nature of southern slaveowners . The planters , particularly the nouveau riche of the old southwest , were motivated by the emerging norms of antebellum American society ; individualism , pursuit of self-interest , and wealth-seeking . Slavery was merely the means of realizing their ambitions . The Civil War was an in-house conflict between different interests , not a struggle between world-views and incompatible social structures . David Potter contended that the argument based on essential cultural differences " exaggerates the points of diversity between the North and South , minimizes the similarities , and leaves out of the account all the commonalties and shared values of the two sections " . ( Potter , Impending Crisis , pg 32 ) Thus the South represents one regional variant of a general American commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take into account is the unusual nature of capitalism in a slave economy . The crucial question is this : Can a slave be treated in the same manner as a wage-worker ? Can they be fired or laid-off in an economic downturn ? Does a capitalism based on the ownership of labor , rather than the hiring of labor power , present a challenge to the values of self-interest , individualism and wealth-seeking ? Genovese , focusing on the master-slave relationship , feels that the values inherent in a slave system are fundamentally different from , and incompatible with , the values of an industrial capitalist society . Only when the critics can answer the above questions , can their case be proven . <p> This brings me to a second , more personal , criticism of The Political Economy of Slavery . An interest in agricultural reform in the South originally led me to the book . It is possible that slave society was more flexible than Genovese argues . John Taylor of Caroline felt that expansion , not slavery , was the barrier to the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that free land was an essential resource for an agrarian society , Taylor also noted that free land , by encouraging emigration and dispersed settlement , dissolved the fundamental tie binding farmers to the land and community . With the easy availability of land " the best informed agriculturalists are driven ... or seduced by the temptations of wealth ... to sell their lands , which require labour , for the purchase of a better profit " . ( Arator , pg 29 ) The effect was to short-circuit the necessity of adopting better modes of agriculture . Only where planters were forced by necessity to improve their farming , would agricultural reform and proper agricultural practices take root . There was no doubt that the frontier mentality was the evil Taylor and other reformers fought . But , it was rooted in habits of behavior that could be changed , given proper information and constraints on migration and expansionism . <p> Taylor 's program of agricultural reform was , in his view , compatible with slavery . Genovese makes a distinction between the ' Virginia ' and the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Virginia , a process of diffusion was underway by the early 1800 's . Slaveholding was becoming both widespread among the farming population , and evolving into smaller units . Taylor , far from advocating the end of slavery , was , in reality , violently opposed to overseers and other managers on a plantation who came between the master and slave , and introduced inefficiencies into the plantations organization . The owner , in order to make the plantation run properly and to further agricultural reform , had to take a hand in the day-to-day operations of the estate . Closer supervision by the master could make the entire plantation run more efficiently , raise labor productivity , promote diversification and raise the quality of livestock , all problems that Genovese ascribes to the slave system . In the old Southwest , the solution to the problem of soil exhaustion and decline was consolidation of estates in to larger units , capable of effectively overcoming the burdens of soil infertility and low productivity . I am not entirely sure whether the Virginia solution depended on a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , helped distribute slaves among the farming population . Certain counties in eastern Virginia approached slave ownership rates of 90% or more in the antebellum period . Increasingly , for antebellum Virginians , the real competition was between slavery and machines , and it is possible that slaves were a more flexible instrument for agricultural reform and increased production , on smaller units , than a machine or capital input would be . In any case , I would argue that these are two distinct solutions to the problem of soil exhaustion and reform . The question is which would have been more advantageous for the long-term preservation of slavery ? <p> Even my criticism can not really ' refute ' Genovese 's conception of southern society . Taylor , as a member of Southern society had to assume that there were real possibilities for reform inherent in the slave society of early national Virginia . The real achievement of The Political Economy of Slavery is in the realm of paradigms . Eugene Genovese has given us a fully-functioning , logically constructed model of southern slavery and society that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain in greater detail . Like Bentham 's system of utilitarian morality , when an historian tries to refute Genovese 's model , " it is with reasons drawn , without his being aware of it , from that very principle itself ... Is it possible for a man to move the earth ? Yes : but he must first find out another earth to stand on " . The Political Economy of Slavery has done what all great history books do ; asked the questions , and raised the issues , that alter and shape our understanding of the past and the research we undertake in the future . <p> other permission , please contact reviews@h-net.msu.edu.

Americans ' traditional fear of a standing army resulted in the young republic depending heavily upon militia , rather than regulars . Still , in the years after the Revolutionary War and the ratification of the Constitution , many states allowed their militia system to decay . Training was woefully inadequate , and a chronic shortage of weapons and other military equipment existed . With painstaking detail , Skeen chronicles Congress ' repeated attempts to strengthen and standardize state forces during these years , but to no avail . As a result , many states had to recreate their militia from scratch once war was declared in June 1812 . <p> Skeen identifies a myriad of problems which plagued the militia . He ultimately places the blame for many of these on the Constitution , which divided authority over the militia between the state and national governments . Although the federal government tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of political and constitutional reasons . Federalist governors , who tended to oppose the war , resisted mobilization by narrowly interpreting the Constitution and adopting states rights arguments . They claimed that the current situation did not meet the constitutional provisions necessary to nationalize their forces , and , therefore they remained under state control . They also interfered with federal recruiting efforts and supported habeas corpus suits to obtain the release of apprentices and minors who enlisted without their guardians ' consent . Skeen asserts that such controversies helped precipitate the Hartford Convention in 1814 . <p> Disputes with federal officials quickly arose even in states which supported the war . These included adapting the militia 's command and organization structure to federal standards , and , more importantly , who would pay and provision the troops . Most states argued that the national government was responsible for this because it had called out the militia . Federal officials , however , frequently lacked the resources to provision the troops and disputed whether they had authorized particular call ups , thus making the states liable for supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1815 , ten of eighteen states contemplated or had created their own armies for local defense . They also considered withholding part of their federal taxation to support these forces . <p> Skeen properly devotes much of the middle portion of the book to the militia 's performance in each of the major theaters of the war . He recounts a litany of problems and failures , such as state troops mobilizing slowly , lacking even the most rudimentary provisions , and refusing to cross national borders . These culminated in a series of American disasters , such as Detroit , Queenston Heights , and most notably , Bladensburg , " probably the worst example of militia performance in the war . It illustrated in microcosm all the things wrong with the militia in the War of 1812 " ( p. 138 ) .

As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Niagara Frontier and Andrew Jackson 's victory at New Orleans .

The ensuing years witnessed growing professionalism in the regular army and continued deterioration of the militia system . <p> Citizen Soldier not only provides insights into the War of 1812 , but also into the broader American militia tradition . Skeen 's descriptions of regular-militia controversies over command and troops leaving when their enlistments expired , regardless of the military situation , corroborates the finding of others who have examined earlier periods of American history . Both the British and Continental Armies confronted similar difficulties when using American militia in the colonial and Revolutionary wars , respectively. 2 Skeen 's book demonstrates the persistence of such trends and the inherent tensions between regular and short-term soldiers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such topics as " Congress and Military Mobilization , " " The Militia and the War in the West , " and " Federal-State Relations .

The book contains four detailed maps and a solid bibliographic essay .

Its publication in 1938 marked a turning point in his extraordinary six-decade writing career , thrusting him into the international spotlight and onto the cover of Time . So sweeping and insightful was Mumford 's analysis that thereafter he was acknowledged as an authority on urbanism in its multitudinous aspects : historical , formal , social , economic , and political . He even parlayed his expertise into a brief stint as a planning consultant for the city of Honolulu . Mumford later revised and greatly expanded the Culture of Cities as the better-known City in History ( 1961 ) , a winner of the National Book Award for non-fiction in 1962 . The latter book , however , lacks the freshness and optimism of the former , which still has the power to move the present-day reader to dream of a better urban environment , integrated with surrounding region and attuned to the essential rhythms of daily life . <p> As a journalist and writer , Mumford rose steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His articles and criticism appeared in a variety of architectural and general-interest periodicals , and he proved himself an authority on a staggering array of subjects . Mumford 's first book , the Story of Utopias ( 1922 ) , introduced an idea that was to become the overarching theme of his career : the goal of " eutopia " , the good--as opposed to the perfect--place , a goal that was indeed possible with sound , organic planning . Other pithy books followed on American culture , in which he surveyed and reevaluated key historical figures in American literature , art , and architecture whose example might still guide creative activity in the twentieth century . <p> By the early 1930s , having blazed a major path in a well-defined terrain , Mumford was ready to embark in a new direction : the writing of a multi-volume work on Western civilization . The first volume of what became known as the Renewal of Life series , Technics and Civilization ( 1934 ) , examined the historical basis for technology 's dominance of twentieth-century life , a trend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precise human control . The two subsequent volumes in the series , the Condition of Man ( 1944 ) and the Conduct of Life ( 1951 ) , surveyed human beliefs and values and prescribed organic remedies for the rebuilding of society in light of his previous forays into the fields of technology and urbanism . <p> Thus , the Culture of Cities , while independently a book of great importance in the historical discourse on cities , must be viewed as part of a larger synthetic series that sought to address the ills of modern life in total by uncovering their root causes in the past and identifying potential courses for their treatment in the present . The framework for the entire series was greatly indebted to Patrick Geddes , the Scottish polymath who acted as a mentor to the young Mumford , and who advocated a method of direct observation known as regional survey . Mumford , who had trod the sidewalks of most of America 's major east-coast cities as well as many in the Midwest , spent part of 1932 in Europe , observing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial quarters in preparation for his ambitious series . The new housing , much of it inspired by the British Garden City movement , pleased him enormously , just as he had expected , but he was especially surprised and delighted by the human scale of medieval towns such as Lbeck , in which town and country remained in healthy proximity . Although Mumford encountered an emergent Nazism on this journey , he had yet to realize its full implications on the urban and social order . <p> What distinguishes the Culture of Cities from the other works in the series is Mumford 's ability to weave facts and figures , prose and illustrations into an elaborate and evocative carpet that transports the reader to the time and place under examination . His observations are both broadly cast and narrowly focused . The impact of ever-more expensive military fortifications to urban life is discussed as is the replacement of curtains by doors within the domestic household . Spatial relationships , moreover , are his special purview . <p> Mumford borrows a Geddesian framework and even some Geddesian vocabulary to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concludes just before the outbreak of World War II . In the first chapter , Mumford reveals himself to be a champion of the medieval town for its compact size , plan , and population and its organic irregularity . In one particularly stirring passage , he describes the changing appearance of the townscape as one processes through it on foot : " Here is no static architecture . The masses suddenly expand and vanish , as one approaches them or draws away : a dozen paces may alter the relation of the foreground and background , or the lower and upper range of the line of vision . The silhouettes of the buildings , with their steep gables , their sharp roof lines , their pinnacles , their towers , ripple and flow , break and solidify , rise and fall , with no less vitality than the structures themselves . As in a fine piece of sculpture , the silhouettes are often inexhaustible in their variety : the outlines vary no less constantly than the relations of the planes ( p. 62 ) . " <p> He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second chapter , no doubt because many of its most obvious forms-- the symmetrical plan , the straight avenue , and the neoclassical architecture--had yet to wither completely even in the 1930s . In fact , the militaristic impulse behind such forms was at that very moment giving them new meaning in capitals as far afield as Berlin , Rome , and Washington ( p. 273 ) . In chapters three and four , respectively , Mumford examined the squalor of the nineteenth-century factory town , with its " minimum of life " ( p. 179 ) , and the burgeoning , early twentieth-century Megalopolis , in whose sheer scale lay the seeds of its own collapse into " Nekropolis " ( pp. 291-292 ) . <p> Yet , from his vantage point in the mid-to-late 1930s , Mumford could imagine a different outcome , so long as the distant rumblings of war could be silenced . The book 's remaining three chapters are devoted to Mumford 's vision of urban , and by extension , cultural renewal . Technological inventions powered by clean , electric energy would render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in regional cities garden cities integrated fully with their surrounding regions that would reduce the pressures on existing megalopolitan centers . Modern housing , based on progressive experiments in Germany and the Netherlands , would shelter the working classes in comfort and without false ostentation . Most important , the spirit of community that pervaded the medieval town under the protective arm of the Church would live again , only now beneath the protective umbrella of modern culture . " The culture of cities is ultimately the culture of life in its highest manifestations , " Mumford concludes in the book 's final pages ( p. 492 ) . <p> Mumford 's optimism crumbled over the next several years . In the United States , the dismantling of the New Deal dashed his hope for comprehensive coordinated planning . Europe again erupted in war , and by its conclusion his son was among those killed in battle . The atomic bomb was invented and detonated . Mumford continued to survey and write about cities in these years , but he became increasingly concerned about the damage inflicted on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in History , although it provides fascinating new material , particularly on prehistoric and ancient sites , is the work of an embittered , older man who believed that his ideas were being ignored by his contemporaries .

Accordingly , the Culture of Cities will remain a relevant text for the present-day and future reader who will necessarily place a higher value on such contact as cyberspace renders it less frequent .

" Using himself as an example , Lincoln responded , " When one starts poor , as most do in the race of life , free society is such that he knows he can better his condition ; he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor for his whole life .

" For Lincoln , like most of his audience , this was " the true system " ( pp. 131-32 ) . Long before 1860 , Americans had , according to Oklahoma State University historian James Huston , come to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth . In his intelligent and ( gratefully ) intelligible study of American economic thought , academic and public , Securing the Fruits of Labor : The American Concept of Wealth Distribution , 1765-1900 , Huston comprehensively surveys the formation , evolution , and disintegration of republican principles of wealth distribution . <p> Even before the eighteenth century drew to a close , Americans had reached a consensus over what constituted a natural , equitable distribution of wealth . Huston identifies four key elements that he believes framed this consensus : the labor theory of property/value , the political economy of aristocracy , the abolition of primogeniture and entail , and the population-to-land ratio . <p> For the American revolutionaries , the preservation of individual liberty required " equitability , " that is , the nearly equal distribution of wealth . Americans remained convinced through most of the next century that this would be possible only if each person could reasonably expect to receive the fruits of his own labor . More an ethical standard than an economic principle , what Huston terms the labor theory of value/property bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to exist , injustice occurred when a privileged few manipulated government to their own benefit . <p> Revolutionary leaders censured the political system of aristocracy as an enemy of the republican distribution of wealth . In Europe , through policies such as an onerous tax system that funded a bloated and corrupt government bureaucracy , an established church , government-bestowed special privileges , and paper money , the aristocracy appropriated the fruits of others ' labor . In removing these props of aristocracy , Americans had created a naturally equitable distribution . <p> The aristocracy of the Old World derived its strength from its near monopoly of the land . Hereditary aristocracy secured their monopoly through primogeniture and entail , which meant that they obtained great wealth without labor as a result of birth . The fourth axiom identified by Huston , the ratio of land to population , had nothing to do with human choice . The vast frontier afforded Americans an opportunity to own land that was not possible in the Old World . Over the century following the Revolution , the basic principles of the republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Huston , without change or significant challenge . <p> Huston posits a direct correspondence between the commercial agrarian base of the United States economy before the 1880s and the superstructure of political economic ideas about wealth distribution that were held by Americans . During this " Age of the American Revolution , " the nation remained overwhelmingly agrarian . Manufacturing , according to Huston , did not undergo any drastic change . Taking advantage of available western lands , Americans experienced horizontal growth and the creation of a national market but not vertical growth , as enterprise remained small scale . Not until the last two decades of the nineteenth century would the unitary economy of the republican era be undone with the coming of large-scale industry and corporate enterprise . <p> An appreciation of the transatlantic context of American political economic ideas is among Securing the Fruits of Labor 's many strengths . Huston briefly but expertly dissects David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus 's market-driven theories of wealth distribution . Whatever their differences , both Malthus and Ricardo posited a grim future for laborers based upon the proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . The American counterparts of these English classical political economists divided along free trade and protectionist lines . American political economists of each school believed that the United States could escape the classical economist 's " iron law of wages . " Less certain that republicanism shaped economic relationships , the free traders nonetheless condemned excessive taxation and monopoly privilege as aristocratic . The equitability standard was even more critical for the protectionists , who insisted that the material well-being of the laborer would be elevated through productivity increases of land and the human creativity . <p> For Huston , the political parties in nineteenth-century America fractured along either a Hamiltonian or Jeffersonian axis . In the strongest chapter in the book , Huston concentrates on the political battles that arose over tariff policy and currency and banking . As believers in an activist government , or the positive state , Hamiltonians endorsed establishment of the National Bank , financing internal improvements , and high tariffs . Jeffersonians , on the other hand , favored the laissez-faire policies of a negative state : free banking , low tariffs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jeffersonian parties framed their political appeals according to the republican consensus on the distribution of wealth . However , Hamiltonians found themselves in the weaker position on banks , Jeffersonians on free trade . Americans responded favorably to Jeffersonian attacks on banks as agencies of special privilege , but they endorsed the Hamiltonian position on protection because they favored government actions that promoted economic opportunity . <p> Having established the essential parameters of the prevailing American concept of wealth distribution , Huston then attempts , in the book 's two most problematic chapters , to contain dissent and slavery within this republican consensus . For Huston , when antebellum workers and labor radicals railed against " wages slavery " they were not so much rejecting working for others as desirous of receiving their " just fruits . " Only utopian communitarians , like John Humphrey Noyes at Oneida or Horace Greeley in his **25;2115;TOOLONG phase , according to Huston , went beyond republican concepts of wealth distribution to advocate socialistic withdrawal from the marketplace . Still , it is their marginality that Huston ultimately finds meaningful about these movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide hearing as most Americans continued to believe that working people received the just fruits of their labor . <p> Slavery was the American institution most at odds with the republican legacy of the American Revolution . Slaves , as Huston himself notes , obviously did not receive the fruits of their labor . Neither is it possible to view the Southern plantation economy as compatible with the basic axioms of republicanism outlined by Huston . Unable to contain slavery within republican consensus , Huston concentrates instead on the Northern opponents , who condemned the institution for failing to provide slaves with any incentive to labor and attacked slaveholders as aristocrats . By 1860 , most northerners had come to view the " Slave Power " as a threat to the republican order . <p> Huston finds that the republican consensus remained largely intact through the Civil War and Reconstruction . Unwilling to go beyond republicanism , radicals in and out of Congress put their faith in political change , extending to the former slaves suffrage rights yet rejecting fundamental economic reconstruction--the plan for confiscation of planter estates and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not fail in the postbellum South ; it was never tried . <p> By the dawning of the new millennium , republicanism is dead , done in by the large-scale corporation . The coming into power of the " New Aristocrats " --Andrew Carnegie , J. P. Morgan , John D. Rockefeller , Henry Ford , and their like--rendered anachronistic the politics of aristocracy and other axioms of the republican concept of wealth distribution . A new economics defined value , which had been understood as a product of the " fruits of labor " and was now seen as consequence of the consumer 's preferences or tastes in the marketplace ( marginal utility and marginal productivity theory ) . Along with this new understanding of the distribution of wealth came a faith that only government could regulate leviathan . Thus , with the passing of republicanism in the early twentieth century came the birth of modern liberalism . <p> Huston 's conclusion that the economic values Americans had formed during the Revolution endured virtually unchanged and unchallenged well into the 1880s will likely leave more than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur to me . First , Huston 's bifurcated model of American economic development ( small-scale commercial/agrarian before 1890 , large-scale industrial/corporate after ) understates the impact that industrialization had in the United States before the 1880s . The issue here is less a matter of the size and scale of manufacturing than of the changes in the mode of production and the growing permanency of the wage system . Early in the process of industrialization , certainly before 1860 , division and specialization of labor , standardization of product , and the discipline of labor characterized what was already referred to as the " American system of manufactures . " Further , even though the American economy remained primarily agricultural in the decade following the end of the war , most productively engaged Americans , including farmers , could be classified as either wage earners or salaried employees . In the industrial Northeast , the odds against self-employment--the entrepreneurial ideal of antebellum free labor society--were even greater . In Pennsylvania , between 65 and 75 percent of the laboring population worked for someone else ; in Massachusetts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I find Huston 's model too narrowly deterministic . He presumes that a direct correspondence existed in each era between the economic base and the superstructure of ideas and values held by Americans . Hence the unity of the American economy during what he calls the Age of the American Revolution produced a uniform set of ideas . In the end , what is significant for Huston about the political wrangling between the Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians is the absence of fundamental conflict . The objectives of either party appear to have gained legitimacy only to the degree that they were in accord with the revolutionary concepts of wealth distribution . <p> But the real problem for me with Huston 's approach in Securing the Fruits of Labor is his tendency to reify the principal ideas of republicanism . Republicanism is better understood as a common language that different individuals or groups drew on to serve frequently divergent purposes. 2 Rather than their adhering to the common values of an accepted republican consensus , Americans were engaged in a critical debate over the kind of society that they were building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protagonists in this debate understood themselves to be expressing conflicting economic , political , and social values . <p> Huston characterizes the labor theory of property/value essentially in terms of workers ' hopes for equitability rather than equal distribution . Yet even when nineteenth-century workers expressed a common perception of the problems they faced in a changing economic world they were reacting to industrialization in markedly different ways . One example will suffice . As Paul Faler has shown , Lynn shoe workers in the 1830s did express their right to a fair share to the wealth that their labor produced . However , they could also , by claiming that " the worker is entitled to the full fruit of his toil , " take these sentiments in a more radical or egalitarian direction . In this second formulation , they articulated an emerging wage consciousness that wanted " no hire at all . " As an alternative to the existing system , shoe workers in Lynn endorsed producers ' cooperatives owned and operated by the men who worked in them. 3 <p> The idea of producer cooperation appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have found , to a broad cross section of Americans concerned about rapid industrial expansion and the emergence of a permanent wage-dependent class . In the 1860s and 1870s , Americans as different in their backgrounds and ideologies as the labor leader William Sylvis , the abolitionist Wendell Phillips , and the journalists Horace Greeley and Edwin Lawrence Godkin supported producer cooperation as a means of resolving the " Labor Crisis . " Nevertheless , they fundamentally disagreed in both how they defined this crisis and how they understood cooperation as a solution . Essentially , Godkin and Greeley viewed cooperation as a safe remedy to the imperfections of the wage system , one that would restore the harmony natural to the relations of production within a free labor order . For their part , both Sylvis and Phillips believed that only through cooperative production would laboring people be able to secure the economic and social rights due them as productive citizens . Theirs was a collective vision , one that identified cooperative production as the basis for building a new order , a cooperative commonwealth , within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues I have raised are not meant to detract from an appreciation of what Huston has achieved in Securing the Fruits of Labor .

I recommend this book to anyone who cares , as Huston obviously does , about the distribution of wealth in American society . <p> 2 . The literature on republicanism is vast .

The " second industrial revolution " surpassed the textile factories of England in bringing consumers large quantities of useful commodities at affordable prices , and producers had either to adapt to the new economy of mass production or sell to larger producers . In many cases , single figures all but eradicated the competition and exerted what some considered an undue influence over the market of a particular commodity . <p> One figure who thrived in this atmosphere was John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , who outwitted his competitors in the oil refining business and obtained close to 90 percent of the American market , becoming the world 's first billionaire in the process . Ron Chernow 's thoughtful biography Titan : The Life of John D. Rockefeller , Sr. ( New York , 1998 ) , gives us an opportunity to discuss the issue of why monopolies are such a feared economic development , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other businesses . <p> Monopoly presents the economic theorist with a dilemma . In theory , the only way for a firm to become a monopoly , outside government sponsorship , is to win the loyalty of consumers by lowering prices and creating a more useful product than competitors . Would-be monopolists are a positive force in capitalistic systems because they have an incentive to bestow such benefits on consumers , in hope of later charging high , monopolistic prices . Paradoxically , if firms have a real chance at becoming a monopoly , the economy is in danger from monopolies that charge higher prices . The ideal economic system for the consumer , then , would cajole producers into thinking that they have a chance at obtaining a monopoly without actually giving them the chance . This is , of course , unworkable , but the apologist for monopolies contends that a system with a real chance of monopoly is the best we can achieve in a less-than-ideal world . The danger of prospective competitors and substitute products would keep prices down , they claim , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher prices that set in after the monopoly is achieved . Does history justify this economic theory ? From the evidence given in Titan , what situation really existed in the paradigm case of Standard Oil ? Did this situation warrant the antitrust case against it ? <p> One way in which a business can confer benefits on consumers is to provide a superior product . Did Standard Oil fulfill the free market economist 's promise of monopoly in this manner ? Here , we must digress from Standard Oil to illustrate the role oil played in the economy of Standard Oil 's time . Oil provided an affordable way to light people 's homes in the evening . When refined into kerosene , it was the only " cheap illuminant that burned in a bright , clean , safe manner , " by far better than blubber and lard ( p. 73 ) . Oil was also available in much larger quantities than earlier products , and therefore cheaper . Prior to kerosene lamps , most lamps consisted of whale blubber . The whaling industry had already hunted sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing them in icy waters . By the mid 1860s , whale-oil was unaffordable to most people , and to the extent that it could light homes , was an unsustainable source of light . The amount of oil one well could produce in a day exceeded the amount of whale oil collected from two to three years of whaling in the depleted oceans of the 1860s. 1 <p> Oil was also a far better lubricant than lard , which greased the gears of most engines and factories before the 1860s . Within five years of the development of the oil industry , oil replaced lard. 2 By the 1880s , oil refiners developed varieties of oil suited to different lubricating jobs , whereas the lubricant made from animal fat had been one and all-purpose . <p> Standard Oil , however , can not receive the credit for this technological progress . John D. Rockefeller was mostly in the business of refining oil , rather than gathering crude oil from oil wells . Before the 1860s , kerosene was refined from coal , and the process by which kerosene was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Standard Oil was founded . Even the technology for the transportation of oil--pipelines and single iron tank cars--was established before Rockefeller 's entry . <p> Rockefeller was unquestionably an able , hands-on businessperson . He oversaw every step of the production process in the early years . Chernow writes that " he was often seen at Kingsbury Run at 6:30 A.M. , going into the cooper shop to roll out barrels , stack hoops , or cart out shavings , reflecting the thrift inculcated by his mother and his puritanical religious upbringing " ( p. 79 ) . He made small improvements to cut waste . For example , he hired chemists to increase the kerosene yield per barrel of oil . He also tried to make use of the by-products of oil , selling benzine , paraffin , and petroleum jelly , and at one point drawing up plans to convert sulfuric acid into fertilizer ( p. 100 ) . Rockefeller found that he could obtain better barrels , and at lower prices , by having Standard Oil produce them . Standard Oil could then make them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from external barrel suppliers ( p. 100 ) . <p> Nevertheless , Rockefeller 's main advantage over other oil refiners was , at first , his ability to obtain loans , and later , his ability to obtain low rates from railroads . The confidence of bankers in Rockefeller enabled him to secure loans , develop a deep war chest , and buy out other Cleveland refineries . Local bankers trusted Rockefeller because of his strict adherence to Baptist morality , honest presentations of his business predicament , and outstanding credit history ( p. 105 ) . In addition , his brother William proved to be adept at securing loans from banks in New York City , where credit was more loose . By 1868 , John D. Rockefeller 's refining capacity was larger than the next three largest refineries combined . <p> He could then secure concessions from railroads by promising large , steady volumes of oil . He managed to promise sixty carloads daily , partly by arranging for shipments from other refiners . Railroads could load oil from warehouses ( that Rockefeller provided ) straight onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train composed of different types of freight cars stopping at random points to load oil from smaller refiners . Rockefeller also appeased his railroad customers by constructing the facilities for loading oil near the train stations , building and renting his own oil-tank cars , and assuming responsibility for accidents on railroad property ( p. 113 ) . Rockefeller 's Cleveland-based victory over Pittsburgh refiners was fortuitous , as Pittsburgh refiners could not persuade obtuse railroad owners to grant discounts . The Pennsylvania Railroad charged high rates for Pittsburgh refiners to ship their oil to New York and Philadelphia , not realizing that over time , they were allowing competition in Cleveland to wipe out their Pittsburgh customers . <p> To some extent , Rockefeller 's management resulted in lower prices for consumers , but a quantitative study of Standard Oil 's impact on consumers is problematic due to its secret discounts p. ( 259 ) . The cost of processing a gallon of crude oil dropped from 2.5 to 1.5 cents between 1880 and 1885 , while between 1870 and 1890 , the market price of Standard Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallon . Rockefeller 's critics attribute this drop to a fall in crude oil prices , though Rockefeller claimed that this only accounted for half the drop ( p. 258 ) . <p> On top of this long-term drop , consumers indulged themselves in the occasional periods in which prices were cut to the bone to drive competitors out of business . Chernow estimates that Standard Oil charged unprofitably low prices in 9,000 out 37,000 towns where tank wagons distributed the oil ( p. 259 ) . According to economic theory , firms in a capitalist economy will not cut prices below cost for long time periods , for the price cuts will cut into profits . But this was just what Rockefeller did , because profits were not his only concern ( p. 265 ) . Rockefeller had an emotional need for stability , and he eliminated all significant competitors at a cost to his profits . <p> If the benefits to foreign consumers count , Standard Oil usually kept foreign prices depressed--subsidized by higher prices to American consumers--to maintain a market in Asian and European countries , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Standard Oil . In the 1870s , Standard Oil was providing free kerosene lamps to remote parts of the world , and teaching foreigners to use them , in order to build a global consumer base ( p. 244 ) . <p> The domestic price of oil declined during the long reign of John D. Rockefeller , but who knows whether prices would have become even lower if Rockefeller had not acquired such a large percentage of the oil market . By the time Standard Oil was founded in 1870 , transient oil refiners overcrowded the oil refining business to the point where many refiners sold at a loss . Chernow writes that " With sky-high profits and ridiculously low start up costs , the field had soon grown overcrowded .... Rampant speculation had so overbuilt the industry that total refining capacity in 1870 was triple the amount of crude oil being pumped " ( p. 130 ) . <p> Contrary to neoclassical economic theory , these conditions did not discourage people from entering or remaining in the field . Chernow explains that " the oil market did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fixed costs , and they discovered that , by operating at a loss , they could still service some debt " ( p. 149 ) . All oil refiners , including Rockefeller , risked bankruptcy while competing with firms selling below cost . Certainly , Rockefeller was able to lower his prices due to economies of scale , but had his competitors continued to sell at a loss , he may have been forced to reduce prices even more than he historically did . The virtual monopoly of Standard Oil was not in the interest of the lowest possible prices , unless the plethora of unprofitable oil operations would have driven it out of business before it could utilize economies of scale . <p> The whole point of Rockefeller 's efforts to consolidate the oil-refining industry under his thumb was to sell at profitable prices and avoid the unprofitably low prices of the early oil industry . In the early oil industry , oil refiners obtained more investments when oil was more scarce and the price was high ; French and German investors would not lend William Rockefeller money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 103 ) . Rockefeller 's greatest nightmare was to " drown in a sea of cheap oil that would drag prices below their overhead costs " ( p. 283 ) . <p> Rockefeller 's contemporaries resented him because he acquired a fortune by what it thought to be unfair , ruthless dealings with competitors and other businesses , some of which may have violated common law . The earliest episode that provoked a public outcry was the South Improvement Company ( SIC ) , a " grand scale collusion such as American industry had never witnessed " ( p. 136 ) . Tom Scott , the overlord of the Pennsylvania Railroad , first proposed the secret cartel among Standard Oil and three major railroads ( the Pennsylvania , New York Central , and Erie railroads ) , in which the railroads would not only give rebates to Standard Oil and a few other large refiners , but also raise rates for all other oil refiners . Additionally , the SIC oil refiners would receive " drawbacks , " which were rebates on oil shipped by other refiners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would allow Rockefeller to underprice them . Chernow exclaims " On shipments from Pennsylvania to Cleveland , for instance , Standard Oil would receive a forty-cent rebate on every barrel it shipped , plus another forty cents for every barrel shipped to Cleveland by competitors ! " ( p. 136 ) Rockefeller could obtain this bargain by agreeing not to ship oil on other railroads or waterways , and use their railroads consistently . The lure of a large , predictable customer was irresistible . <p> While rumors of this conspiracy circulated in the oil industry , Rockefeller acquired 22 out of 26 of his Cleveland competitors ( p. 143 ) . Rockefeller did not directly allude to the SIC in his negotiations , but these acquisitions would not have taken place so quickly without the rumors . Chernow writes that " The threat of the SIC , critics alleged , was the invisible club that he had waved over Cleveland refiners , forcing them to submit to his domination " ( p. 143 ) . Rockefeller 's most significant competitor , James Clark , later told critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell to Rockefeller ( p. 144 ) . With the exception of Clark , Rockefeller bought these competitors at prices equivalent to only a quarter of their original construction costs . <p> Had the plan succeeded , the rebates may have enabled Rockefeller to sell oil at lower prices . Historians have no way of knowing , since the public retaliated against the SIC as the news soon leaked out . In nonviolent protest , many oil drillers signed a pledge not to sell oil to Standard Oil and other conspirators printed on blacklists . Thousands of people held public demonstrations , and vandals attacked Standard oil barrels and oil cars . So great was the public opinion against Standard Oil that people would not ( or could not , due to fear for their safety ) purchase it , and Rockefeller laid off 90% of his workers in 1872 ( pp. 139-141 ) . <p> After the SIC led to the " Cleveland Massacre , " Rockefeller started a similar cartel called the National Refiner 's Association , which differed by being open to all interested parties . Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the SIC aroused so much protest ( pp. 158-59 ) . Competition thwarted this cartel when members reneged on the deal , exceeding their quotas . Moreover , " free riders " outside the cartel benefitted from higher prices without restraining their own output . The National Refiner 's Association was soon dissolved . Though Standard Oil later recovered and prospered , these events surely revealed to future entrepreneurs that they could not join cartels and trusts at no risk . Competitors and consumers checked outrageous price agreements while the law turned its head the other way . <p> Having tried other paths to restricting overproduction , Rockefeller started what Chernow calls an " unrelenting campaign of national consolidation , " buying out competitors nationally as he had done in Cleveland ( p. 161 ) . When industries refused to sell , Rockefeller engaged in predatory pricing in the local areas subject to competition . He required that grocers and hardware merchants sell only Standard Oil , or else he would drive them out of business with his own retail tank wagons ( p. 253 ) . Rockefeller could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay shipment of the lubricating grease they needed to run their trains . He had the railroads thwart his competitors by cutting off transportation for non-customers , agreeing not to ship products by or to businesses that did not buy Standard Oil , or raising rates for problem customers ( pp. 164 , 170 ) . <p> Rockefeller 's effort to eliminate intermediaries and market Standard Oil directly to retailers by tank wagons won resentment from thousands of small retailers . Rockefeller forced these people to sell only Standard Oil . If they did not comply , Standard Oil would either sell oil door-to-door or open its own general store to drive them out of business . His station managers had to command at least 85% of the local oil trade , and it was understood that they were to spy on other distributors to make sure they were not selling competitors ' oil . Incidentally , the direct control over retail probably benefitted consumers , as intermediaries had increased the price of each gallon by three to five cents for their own profit , and often mixed inferior kerosene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller succeeded in his campaign of consolidation by 1877 , when he controlled the oil markets of Cleveland , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , West Virginia , and Baltimore , forming a total of 90% of the market . By the time Standard Oil was broken up in 1911 , it faced competition from various companies in Texas and Russia , but these competitors would not have existed if political reasons did not preclude Rockefeller from eliminating them . In Texas , state antitrust laws and popular animosity toward Rockefeller made the making or selling of Standard Oil difficult , making room for new companies like Texaco . Foreign governments were simply beyond the reach of Rockefeller to obtain protection . <p> Chernow notes some of the disincentives that unregulated capitalism offered against Rockefeller 's techniques , calling them " expensive extravagances that accompanied the creation of the monopoly " ( p. 162 ) . Some of the competitors Rockefeller bought out started up new oil firms , and many refiners entered the business just so that Rockefeller would buy them out . Rockefeller started hiring the original competitors as managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to produce . Expensive skeleton crews were maintained on plants that were producing little or no oil . Rockefeller also bought shares in newspapers to disseminate Standard Oil 's version of current events , and hired critics to work for Standard Oil to silence them ( pp. 208 , 212 ) . <p> The market was inadequate to prevent Standard Oil from acquiring 90 percent of the oil refining industry . Costs such as the skeleton crews , selling below cost , and buying out competitors did not prevent Rockefeller from obtaining monopoly ; although they did cost him money , he still had reduced the oil refining market to token competition by 1877 . Sometimes , as with Oil Creek refineries in Pennsylvania , firms that Rockefeller bought would take on a name other than Standard Oil , so that they did not arouse hatred of Rockefeller among the workers or consumers of this oil . Consumers who thought they were buying a different brand of oil in protest were often buying Standard Oil ( pp. 166-167 ) . <p> Part of the reason critics saw need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Standard Oil 's favor . Rockefeller resorted using government to weed out competitors , in the late 1870 's . His many attempts to bribe legislators to root out competition are too numerous to be labeled as exceptions . In 1879 , Standard Oil had a near monopoly in the new method of oil transport - pipelines . A serious competitor emerged in Pennsylvania with the Tidewater Pipe Line Company . When the usual tactics failed , Standard Oil bought exclusive charters , or rights to build pipelines , in states where Tidewater planned to develop a pipeline . Not only did Standard Oil take advantage of exclusive charters , but it also lobbied and bribed legislators to continue the practice of them . Chernow writes " During the Tidewater battle , Standard lobbied hard to perpetuate the system that allowed state legislatures to grant exclusive pipeline charters ... to foster the impression of a popular groundswell against the bill , he hired lawyers to pose as incensed farmers and landowners in favor of the status quo .... " ( p. 209 ) <p> The combination of predatory pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Standard Oil , restricting its activities to 11.5 percent of the pipeline business and leaving the rest of the market to Standard Oil . In mixed economies , people may fear a monopolist because a person with so much control over the market has the opportunity to use the regulatory power of the state for his or her own benefit . <p> Even if Standard Oil were clearly , on balance , good for society , the reaction of politicians would be that its business practices were " still wrong . " In 1890 , during the debate over the Sherman Act , Representative William Mason argued that " trusts have made products cheaper , have reduced prices ; but if the price of oil , for instance , were reduced to one cent a barrel , it would not right the wrong done to people of this country by the ' trusts ' which have destroyed honest men from legitimate business enterprise " ( Congressional Record , 51st Congress , 1st session , House , June 20 , 1890 , p. 4100 ) . Later in the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil trust has reduced the price of oil immensely , that does not alter the wrong of the principle of any trust " ( Ibid. , p. 2558 ) . <p> The popular sentiment against Standard Oil that made the antitrust case politically fruitful was produced by sensational news stories that presented business history as a tale of " good-guys " versus " bad-guys . " Ida Tarbell 's reports in McClure 's Magazine and Henry Demarest Lloyd 's Wealth Against Commonwealth mobilized public opinion against Rockefeller , who was unofficially retired by the twentieth century . Historians still cite these works as evidence of Standard Oil 's depravity . <p> Apart from the aforementioned stories of unfair business practices , the most noticed parts of both works were the ad hominem attacks on Rockefeller and other high officials of Standard Oil . Lloyd 's work was so vitriolic that he did not refer to Rockefeller or Standard Oil by name to avoid libel prosecution . Wealth Against Commonwealth pronounced blatant falsehoods , accusing Standard Oil of routinely keeping prices high and making secret arrangements with European competitors . Chernow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . a cruel , selfish , carnivorous , short-sighted herd " and " ennobled any businessman , however greedy or inept , who opposed Rockefeller " ( pp. 340-341 , 437 ) . The book 's inflammatory character made its influence all the more seminal among politicians , becoming " the bible of Washington trustbusters , " and the final straw that motivated Ida Tarbell to launch her attacks on Standard Oil ( pp. 340-341 , 437 ) . <p> Ida Tarbell had watched Rockefeller put her father and other independent oil refiners out of business in her hometown of Titusville . Her motive was not to indict Rockefeller for his impact on consumers at large , then , but on other oil refiners . Chernow writes that " It revolted Ida that the trust could turn proud , independent entrepreneurs into beaten men taking orders from distant bosses " ( p. 436 ) . Contrary to the stories of " Miss Tarbarrel , " as Rockefeller referred to her , the independent refiners engaged in anti-competitive agreements when they could , and many small oil producers--who Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than competition , destroying pumps and wells . Chernow writes " The producers terrorized each other , meting out nocturnal punishment ... by setting their wells ablaze or smashing their pumping engines with sledgehammers . The producing end of the industry was populated by thousands of free booting , high-spirited speculators who were far harder to organize than the more sober refiners .... " ( p. 159 ) . <p> Tarbell revived an inaccurate story that Rockefeller had defrauded Mrs. Fred M. Backus , an elderly widow who sold her Cleveland lubricating plant in 1878 . Backus ' factory was highly inefficient and headed toward bankruptcy , but Rockefeller had offered $79,000 for it ( out of goodwill toward an old acquaintance ) , which was at least twice the cost of constructing a better factory ( 447 ) . Backus estimated the factory 's price at $150,000 , and was furious at Rockefeller during the whole episode . Far from being an impoverished victim of capitalism , she was worth $300,000 at her death ( p. 447 ) . Chernow writes that the story 's " Dickensian ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McClure 's readership of 375,000--including President Roosevelt ( pp. 447 , 449 ) . <p> Tarbell issued memorable diatribes against Rockefeller 's personality and presence . She described him as a " living mummy " and a citizen whose churchgoing habits were only a " hypocritical facade brilliantly created by the predatory businessman " ( p. 453 ) . She completed her portrait with his physical appearance as an elderly man : " The disease which in the last three or four years has swept Mr. Rockefeller 's head bare of hair , stripped away even eyelashes and eyebrows , has revealed all the strength of his great head .... The big cheeks are puffy , bulging unpleasantly under the eyes , and the skin which covers them has a curiously unhealthy pallor . It is this puffiness , this unclean flesh , which repels , as the thin slit of a mouth terrifies ... " ( p. 453 ) . <p> Tarbell had also included " dirt " on Rockefeller 's family , including his bitter and paranoid brother Frank , who called John a " monster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance his prodigal spending habits ( p. 455 ) . Most devastating to Rockefeller himself was the publication of the activities of his utterly depraved father , " Doc " William Avery Rockefeller , a lifelong con artist who employed the name Dr. William Levingston ever since he left his first wife for an unsuspecting younger woman . <p> The public was aggravated by Rockefeller 's refusal to answer to the writers ' charges . Standard Oil had no public relations department , and Rockefeller thought that he should not dignify the charges with a response , believing the public furor would subside . He greatly underestimated the growing influence of the press during the Progressive Era . <p> President Roosevelt initiated the campaign to break up Standard Oil . Roosevelt was not against trusts per se , but trusts " which gouged consumers . " He favored maintaining trusts " which offered fair prices and good service " ( p. 433 ) . The price of Standard Oil fell during the nineteenth century , but the new boss , John Archbold , had increased prices during Roosevelt 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters that Rockefeller used his connections in Congress to fight the Elkins Act ( which strengthened penalties against railroad rebates ) --he zeroed in on the prey . <p> The breakup of Standard Oil may have been in the interest of lower oil prices . John Archbold raised the price of Standard Oil to increase average dividends to larger figures than Rockefeller would have permitted , keeping the twenty five-year average at 13.86% , whereas Rockefeller 's average had been 8% . It was under Archbold 's leadership that Standard Oil was broken up in 1911 . Presidents Roosevelt and Taft claimed that they were not against trusts in and of themselves , but trusts that used their competitive advantages to raise prices . Would the antitrust case discourage future " titans " from doing their best work in industry ? Rockefeller himself was imbued with missionary zeal , and would have been likely to expand his business as far as possible , even with constant pressure from antitrust laws . <p> Ron Chernow 's Titan : The Life of John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , shows that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious monopoly , the benefits conferred on consumers in pursuit of monopoly were ambiguous . However , net economic benefits to consumers were far from the minds of journalists and politicians , who used inappropriate criteria to excite popular agitation against Standard Oil . At best , politicians and intellectuals measured the plight of businesses displaced or harassed by Standard Oil against the success of Standard Oil , rather than measuring the plight against the advantages of a non-antitrust policy to the public . Standard Oil was and is judged not on the basis of whether it was , on balance , good for society , but whether it adhered to a moral obligation to refrain from eliminating competition . <p> Copyright ( permission , please contact the EH.NET administrator ( administrator@eh.net ; Telephone : 513-529-2850 ; Fax : 513-529-3308 ) .

In this letter the uncle of the Bab tells his son , the celebrated Vakilu'd-Dawlih , of the news of his visit with Baha'u'llah -- and by extension , the revelation of the Kitab-i Iqan ( Baha'u'llah 's Book of Certitude ) . <p> For the text of this letter I was relying on the version printed in the Khanidan-i Afnan . However since occasionally this book contains minor errors and I wanted to be certain about such an important date , I wrote the World Centre of the Baha'i Faith ( in Haifa , Israel ) and asked if the original of this letter of the uncle was on file with them . <p> Through the kindness of the Research Department of the World Center , I received a facsimile of the original letter which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land of Refuge : Two Narratives of Mirza Habib Afnan ( Oneworld Press ) . <p> The original of this letter clearly indicates its date , 5 Rajab . Therefore we can now be certain that the Kitab-i Iqan was revealed prior to mid January 1861 . <p> In my letter to the World Centre I had asked of both " 1280 " and " 18 years " business mentioned in the Iqan . They have replied that the " 1280 years since the manifestation of the Point of Furqan " is not meant as an exact date and is simply a large number giving approximate time-frame . Also about " 18 years , " one should count 1260 as year 1 , then 1277 would be year 18 . Therefore the internal evidence of the Iqan also indicates that it was revealed in 1277 A.H , probably in Jamadiyu'th-Thani of that year , or late Dec/early Jan of 1861 . <p> Moreover and thankfully , the Research Dept clarified another point that I had been confused about . I had noted that the Text of Baha'u'llah 's Tablet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visit of the uncle and the revelation of the Iqan is discussed was very different than the text of the same Tablet in Nuri'd-Din 's collection of Tablets . <p> They noted that my confusion stemmed from the fact the the author of the Khanidan Afnan had misidentified the Tablet that he quotes . The correct recipient of this Tablet should be Ibn Asdaq . The one I had discovered in the Nuri'd-Din 's collection is indeed addressed to Mirza Abdu'l-Hamid . Research Dept notes to their knowledge only these two Tablets of Baha'u'llah discuss the the revelation of the Book of Certitude.
