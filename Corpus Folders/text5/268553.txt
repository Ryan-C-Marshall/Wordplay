But the associated rules and regulations around drone operations can be difficult to interpret . So for drone pilots wishing to fly recreationally , or " fly for fun " , - we 've outlined the general rules you should follow in order to fly safely and responsibly in most areas and situations worldwide . <p> ( Flying commercially or for compensation ? Consult out- our guide on Part 107 for clarification on those rules . ) <p> Here are the basic rules that you should abide by when flying drones for fun : <p> 1 . Stay below the maximum allowable altitude , typically 400 feet How high can you fly your drone ? As a general rule , aviation authorities recommend flying below 400 feet or 121 meters AGL in order to avoid possible conflict with manned aircraft such as airplanes or helicopters . AGL stands for Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rules vary from country to country ( e.g. , maximum allowable height in Canada is 90 meters ) , so check AirMap or your local aviation authority . It is your responsibility to make sure that your drone stays within this safety limit at all times . <p> 2. - Maintain visual line of sight . This is the technical way of saying to always make sure that you can see your drone in plain sight at all times . You may not rely solely on your drone 's FPV camera or use vision-assisted aides such as binoculars or telescopes ( correctional lenses , however , are okay ) . Also make sure to check your local weather conditions as fog and clouds can impede your vision of your drone as well . <p> 3. - Do n't  fly over people . While you might think a popular beach might be a great place to capture a stunning view with your new drone , flights over people are not permitted . This can include over a group of people or even a single person not part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay away from stadiums , public events , and community events where large groups of people may congregate . <p> 4 . Fly in accordance with a set of community based guidelines . Your city , town , or province might have its own local regulations regarding flying drones . So make sure to check with your local authority to observe and abide by those rules . If the area you plan to fly in does not have any local drone regulations , then you can defer to the rules laid out by your country 's aviation authority , such as the FAA . <p> 5 . If you 're flying within 5 miles of an airport , give notice to the airport . A popular misconception among drone pilots is that if you are flying recreationally you are not allowed to fly within 5 miles of an airport . However this is not true . In the United States , the FAA states that drone pilots wishing to fly within 5 miles of an airport may fly within these areas , but must give notice to two entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND 2 . Air Traffic Control ( if the airport has an air traffic control tower ) <p> In the AirMap mobile apps , we make it easy to provide notice to airport managers by providing the telephone numbers of each airport as well as the ability to submit digital notice to participating D-NAS airports . Learn more about submitting digital notice here . <p> 6 . Do n't fly after dark This final rule is the most simple : do not fly after dark , even if your drone has night lights . Dark is considered 30 minutes before official sunrise or 30 minutes after official sunset . This is known as civil twilight . <p> Remember that these rules are for fly for fun operations only . If we all follow these rules for safe and worry-free flight , we can keep the skies safer for everyone . Happy flying !

In doing so , we go to great lengths to ensure the security of the drone ecosystem . <p> Attacks of this type are avoidable , however . Drones can be made resilient to attacks when architected from the start with the right security in place . <p> In order to approach UAS technology with security in mind , we have to understand the full range of attack vectors , the paths or means by which an attacker can cause a malicious outcome , and cybersecurity best practices for drone manufacturers and developers . <h> Drone Architecture <p> Let 's review the basic architecture of a drone . There are many unique varieties of drones , but most have these core components : <p> Main processor : control and sensor processing . <p> Flight control firmware : code run by the main processor . <p> Sensors : navigation and flight control like GPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( C2 ) data link radio : wireless communication to the ground control station like WiFi , Bluetooth , proprietary , or some combination . <p> Power system : powering the drone . <p> Ground Control Station : wireless control of the drone like a smart phone and remote control . <p> This list is n't complete , but it 's a good place to start . For now we will ignore additional features like video feeds , Internet-enabled ground control station , etc. , all of which could create additional vulnerabilities and should be analyzed for and protected against potential threats . <h> Attack Vectors <p> Attack vectors include direct physical access and remote access to either the drone or the ground control station . <p> Direct physical access attacks on a drone and on the ground control station can be difficult to defend against , as anti-tamper technology can be expensive . Moreover , with direct access to the hardware , attackers can more easily deny , degrade , destroy , disrupt , and deceive . An attacker can break hardware/mechanical components , upload bad firmware/software , modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remote access attacks are often more scalable than physical attacks and , therefore , tend to be more common . These remote attacks on a drone 's basic core components include : <p> Sensor jamming : disable ability to report data ( e.g. not allowing GPS sensor to get a location fix by jamming the RF frequency ) <p> C2 data link radio spoofing : sending a signal that appears to be from the drone or from the ground control station <p> C2 data link radio jamming : radio is unable to receive communication <p> C2 data link radio interception : the radio signal messages are able to be read by unauthorized parties <p> C2 data link radio attack on the flight control firmware : sending malformed data to the radio in order to take advantage of a firmware vulnerability <p> C2 data link radio attack on ground control station software : sending malformed data to the radio in order to take advantage of a software vulnerability <h> Security Best Practices <p> When securing against attacks , a layered defense strategy works best . The UAS industry will be well-served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerabilities . <p> While physical access attacks are difficult to defend against , there are some best practices worth observing . Having sensors onboard to monitor system health can alert an operator to unusual activity ; removing any Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter ( UART ) - or debug ports can make it more difficult for an attacker to tamper with drone internals ; and having signed firmware/software updates and checking the signatures mitigates against the attacker uploading her own firmware/software . Ultimately , the drone owner should always exercise care in ensuring the UAS does not get into the wrong hands . <p> Security best practices for mitigating against remote access attack vectors on drones are : <p> Sensor spoofing : The biggest concern is with navigation sensors . For most drones , GPS is used for navigation ( with potential augmentation from additional sensors ) . Civil GPS ( i.e. , the type of GPS that is used by phones , cars , and running watches " different from the type used by military ) is relatively easy to spoof , and has no mitigations in place . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Institute of Navigation is a great resource to learn more about these algorithms . In addition , selecting directional antennas that face toward the sky can help mitigate spoofing attacks because they wo n't easily be affected by ground based attacks . <p> Sensor jamming : Jamming is a harder problem to solve than spoofing . As with mitigating spoofing , antenna selection and orientation can help mitigate jamming attacks . A high enough power signal from an attacker can easily drown out a legitimate signal . Drones need a fail-safe mode that allows them to safely navigate back home on their own or take other action to minimize risks following the loss of reliable location information . <p> C2 data link radio spoofing : In order to mitigate the risk of radio spoofing , mutual authentication is important . This ensures that the correct drone is communicating with the correct ground control station . There are a number of ways that this can be implemented : One solution that will have long term viability and is already widely accepted is using Public Key Infrastructure ( PKI ) certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what websites use for authentication . This means one private/public key pair will be embedded on the drone and one key pair will be at the ground control station . While the public keys can be stored anywhere , private keys should be stored in a secure keystore " that is , a repository of security certificates . Senders can digitally sign messages with the private keys so that the receivers can verify that the correct party sent them . <p> C2 data link radio jamming : Like sensor jamming , radio jamming ( i.e. , blocking communication of the drone/ground control station ) is difficult to mitigate against . Implementing resilience measures and fail-safe mechanisms can help mitigate the risks . <p> C2 data link radio interception : To mitigate the risk of radio interception , encryption should be used on the radio link . This will ensure that the communication between the drone and the ground control station is private . PKI private/public keys that are used for mutual authentication to mitigate radio spoofing can also be used for encryption using asymmetric cryptography . <p> C2 data link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software assurance practices and embedding them within the Software Development Lifecycle ( SDLC ) will help mitigate the risk of software vulnerabilities within flight control firmware . Microsoft 's Security Development Lifecycle ( SDL ) is an excellent framework that could be followed . <p> C2 data link radio attack on ground control station software : Similar to using the SDL on the firmware , this framework will also help prevent vulnerabilities that will lead to successful attacks on the ground control station software . <p> Be sure to allow for modifications of firmware/software as new security algorithms are added and new vulnerabilities are found . Automatic updates of signed firmware/software on the drone and the ground control station create a nimble , adaptive environment well-suited to fast responses to new types of attacks in the future . <p> Setting a minimum security standard for drones will foster the UAS industry 's development to allow innovation to take flight . 
@@43940624 @3940624/ <h> Drones Are Where People Are , And Thats Really Important <h> Drones Are Where People Are , And Thats Really Important <p> Last week , the Federal Aviation Administration published a complete location database of drone registrations as part of a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request . The Federal Aviation Administration 's registration data contains 38,975 records for the United States for a total of 459,384 drones . This follows an announcement by FAA Administrator Huerta in early February that registrations for unmanned aircraft officially outnumbered those for manned aircraft . <p> At AirMap we processed the data and created heat maps as a visualization of registration density for both recreational and commercial drones . <p> Recreational <p> Commercial <p> Not surprisingly , the maps can be compared to population density maps , and tend to show that drone registrations have taken place in populated areas . This is important information , as this data stands in contrast to past assumptions about where and how drones will be utilized . <p> Let 's look at some of the thinking about drones . <p> Earlier this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most popular markets for sUAS operations would be the following : <p> Industrial Inspection <p> Real Estate/Aerial Photography <p> Agriculture <p> Insurance <p> Government <p> At the same time , the Center for the Study of the Drone ( CSD ) published an analysis of the FAAs database from 2014 to 2015 for Section 333 Exemptions by commercial drone operators . The report found that the most popular categories for intended operations are : <p> Photo/Film <p> Real Estate <p> Construction <p> **31;0;TOOLONG <p> Agriculture <p> The study noted that Agriculture proved to be a less common application for commercial drones than anticipated in forecasts . Also , the study noted sustained and consistent growth in Emergency Services as an intended application for commercial drones . <p> If the growth categories for intended commercial drone operations are Construction , **31;33;TOOLONG , and Emergency Services , then it follows that drone registration data would be concentrated in highly populated areas . With Part 107 removing the requirement for a Section 333 Exemption for commercial drone operations , we can expect to see more drone operating in these populated areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of populated areas exist in controlled airspace . That means that an effective infrastructure for low-altitude airspace management is absolutely critical for the future of UAS operations . <p> In fact , in proposed Part 107.41 , operations in controlled airspace are prohibited unless the operator has " prior authorization from the ATC facility having jurisdiction over that airspace . " <p> Knowing that drones are located mostly where people are , and knowing that substantial portions of populated areas are within controlled airspace , helps us project a potential problem the FAA is going to need a solution to manage ATC authorization in controlled airspace . <p> Just consider how difficult it will be for a UAS operator looking to conduct an inspection or engage in real estate photography in Los Angeles . The dark green areas depicted below are the most populated areas , and the red overlays depict controlled airspace below 500 feet . <p> Miami <p> Similar challenges will present themselves for operators looking to fly in controlled airspace in Miami under Part 107.41 <p> San Antonio <p> and San Antonio . <p> San Antonio ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to fly in controlled airspace after Part 107 is finalized .

It takes a global village of millions of people and thousands of companies to make our aviation system run so safely and efficiently . <p> Unmanned Aerial Systems ( UAS ) , or drones , are the next frontier for aviation technology , and hold tremendous promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We 're already enjoying the benefits of drones . Millions have already been delivered . Of course , one of the more popular uses of drones is aerial photography , whether that be capturing some epic footage of your buddy surfing or snapping an aerial perspective of a house for a real estate listing . <p> Drones are also being used for all kinds of industrial inspection . Essentially anywhere you once had to put a person with a set of eyes , you can now put a flying robot with a camera ! This is saving time , money , and human lives in hazardous places . Energy companies , mobile phone network operators , railroads , and even airports are benefiting from drones for these purposes . <p> Farmers are using drones to monitor their crops . Where it once may have been cost prohibitive to gain near-real-time insight into the health of plants , drones are making this viable , increasing crop yields . It 's early days in this area , but drone use in precision agriculture is promising . In Japan , drones have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we 're starting to see this in the US and other countries as well . <p> Public safety agencies are finding important applications for drones . Police departments can use drones to monitor an officer 's safety during a foot pursuit with a suspect . Fire departments can use drones to look behind a burning building before sending firefighters into harm 's way . <p> And of course , very soon we 'll be moving goods by drone . I ca n't wait ! <p> Amazon Prime Air delivery drone <p> And if you can deliver packages , you can deliver people . That 's maybe a bit simplistic , but the future that many of us dreamed about when watching the Jetsons is now closer than it 's ever been . <p> All of these applications have one thing in common " they happen in the low-altitude airspace . Millions of drones will soon be operating billions of flights , and we must work together to build the airspace management system that will support these operations . <p> The Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane <p> Our industry has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September 1917 . The Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane was built in collaboration between Peter Hewitt and Elmer Sperry . Hewitt was a pioneer in radio control and Sperry ran the Sperry Gyroscope Company . He was the autopilot expert of the day . Although the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane did n't find great commercial or military success , it did represent an important milestone in the development of unmanned aircraft , and it could n't have been done without these two gentlemen collaborating , sharing their expertise with one-another to help build new technology . <p> So how does collaboration happen ? Thousands of innovators around the world are working to help make the promise of drones a reality . There are people working on vehicles , flight control systems , sensors , operating models , airspace services , and other aspects . Creating the connections between these people and the capabilities that they offer is the key to success in building the airspace infrastructure . <p> One person that we should all celebrate in this effort is Parimal Kopardikar " better known as PK . In just about nine months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring more than 100 companies together as collaborators and , together with AUVSI Silicon Valley chapter , he brought together more than 1,000 people last summer at Ames Research Center for the UTM Convention . Gur Kimchi from Amazon Prime Air and Dave Vos from Google Project Wing each gave keynote addresses . PK 's efforts have inspired others . Just in the last month , we 've seen a Global UTM Association forming based in Switzerland . <p> Let 's also thank Phil McNamara , Suzanne Jordan , and Francois Colussi for organizing Drones Data X. This is an amazing event . It 's not a typical boring conference with a bunch of speakers , but an opportunity for all of us to get together socially , to get to know one-another , and to share experiences . Last November , I had the opportunity to spend a couple of days with many of you in Ireland . At Francois 's Pure Magic Lodge on the western edge of Ireland , I shared a room with three other drone people , and stayed up until nearly daybreak singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be the preferred icebreaker activity for our industry . <p> So how does technical collaboration happen ? We all benefit from an incredible open source community that we can thank for Ardupilot and Pixhawk . These technologies have truly accelerated development of drone technology . We 're also seeing companies like DJI creating SDKs that make it easy for innovators to build apps on top of their vehicles . <p> At AirMap , our contribution is tools that help drone manufacturers and app developers bring airspace information and services into their products . For example , our Map SDK can be used to easily bring global airspace maps to drone operators . This helps operators understand where it 's safe to fly . Just in the last week , I ran into three people who each told me that they would like to buy a drone , but have n't done so yet because they keep hearing that drones ca n't fly here or ca n't fly there and they 're confused about where it 's good to fly . Bringing this airspace information to end users in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerate adoption and drone sales . <p> There are many places where flying is permitted , but a notice must be given . For example , in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 , the U.S. Congress mandated that hobbyist drone operators give notice of their flights when flying within five miles of an airport . We are now offering an API that allows you to give your end users the ability to give digital notice where required . <p> We 've also recently introduced a traffic alert feature . This , too , can be brought into your apps and drones through our API . If a manned aircraft is on a trajectory that will create a conflict with the area where your drone is operating , we provide an alert and detailed information about the position , direction , and time before that manned aircraft will be in your area . <p> Our Status API makes it simple to give end users a very easy answer about whether or not any particular place is a safe place to fly . Think of it as a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green means it 's a good place to fly . Red means it 's a bad place to fly . Yellow means you can fly there , but there might be something you have to do , like give notice for example . <p> And our airspace data can also be used for geofencing . The airspace information is dynamic , with things like temporary flight restrictions , so this can be used to prevent conflicts between drones and firefighting aircraft , for example , as we saw in last summer 's wildfire season . <p> DJI has taken one of the most sophisticated approaches to airspace alerts and geofencing . The new DJI GEO system users AirMap 's API to alert users to various airspace considerations near their area of operation , and also to geofence drones where there might be some critical safety consideration . But geofencing is complicated . What if you 're an airline mechanic and you want to use a drone to inspect the tail of your airliner after a lightening strike ? What if you 're a firefighter and you want to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a temporary flight restriction ? DJI 's answer is geofence unlocking . Using AirMap 's user verification service , by providing a verified phone number or credit card number , your DJI verified account allows you to unlock the geofence , creating a simple accountability mechanism . This is a very light touch approach , but ensures that those choosing to operate in those areas recognize that there are significant safety considerations . <p> More than five hundred app developers and manufacturers are now signed up for our SDK , and we 've been slowly releasing it to select partners . A few examples include Drone Logbook , which just launched its airspace feature last week , 3DR which provides airspace alerts when you open the Solo App , as well as an airspace map , and apps like Hover and KittyHawk which have quite a following . <p> As I mentioned briefly earlier , developers can use the AirMap API to help end users provide digital notice where required . So how do we get entities like airports on board ? We partnered with the American Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's biggest airports , to launch the Digital Notice and Awareness System , or D-NAS . Here you see an image of the D-NAS dashboard for airports , which shows the locations of drone flights near the airport . The system also allows the airport to set up automatic messaging to operators , alerting them to various airspace conditions depending upon where exactly that drone operation is happening near the airport . <p> The success of our industry depends upon both technical and business collaborations . We are in the very nascent stage of an amazing movement , and I 'm excited to be working with all of you to build the future . <p> This is a recap of AirMap CEO Ben Marcus presentation at Drones Data X in San Francisco , on June 3 , 2016 .

Los Angeles was the center of aerospace innovation in the 20th century . Together with our friends across industry , we 're making it the 21st century home for the next frontier of aerospace technology . <p> Donald Douglas founded his aircraft company in Santa Monica in 1921 . In 1924 , the first ever flight around the world was made by the Douglas World Cruisers , which took off from Clover Field , the present-day site of Santa Monica Airport . <p> Douglas World Cruisers , prior to departure from Santa Monica , CA on the first circumnavigation of the world by airplane in 1924 . <p> The first commercially viable airliner was the Douglas DC-3 , every copy of which was built at the Santa Monica factory . <p> Delta Air Lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport employed more than 44,000 people in the 1940s . <p> As Douglas developed heavier airplanes and eventually jets like the DC-8 , the runway at Santa Monica became too short and the company moved to nearby Long Beach . Just south of Santa Monica in Culver City and El Segundo , innovators like Hughes developed airplanes , helicopters , and satellites . <p> But what does the future hold for aviation technology ? Since the Wright Brothers ' first flight in 1903 , aviation technology has been about connecting people across borders . When Charles Lindbergh made his record-setting solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 , he could n't have possibly imagined that only 40 years later people would be getting on Boeing 747s in Los Angeles and arriving in London just 10 hours later .

Think of it as a green light , yellow light , or red light system . Green means it 's a good place to fly . Red means flight is probably not allowed for most people . Yellow means there are advisories in the area and additional action may be required , like giving notice for example . <p> The Status API provides all of the airspace constraints for a given flight plan , defined through one of three methods " point and radius , polygon area , or a series of waypoints defining a flight from point A to point B. This includes : <p> Traffic light ( Red , Yellow , Green ) on overall safety of flight in area <p> Flight advisories that intersect your flight area <p> Known requirements for flying in the area <p> Current weather conditions <p> The Status API accepts a flight area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has a different endpoint for each . The path area is the most precise , and will result in the most precise advisory information , but requires more location information than the other area types . The circle should be adequate for most hobby flights . <p> To get flight conditions , you can query the Status API endpoint with the correct type of area : <p> The Status API has a variety of query parameters that allow you to customize the response based on things like types of advisories . At a minimum , you must include a location and area . <p> For example , let 's check the status of a flight originating in a park near Los Angeles International Airport . We 'll use a simple circle area with a point and radius of 33.9680/-118.4257 and 3000 meters . In this example , we 'll also keep things simple and only search for nearby airports , recognizing there could be other advisories that we may be ignoring . The final request should look something like this : <p> Here we can see a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this example , there are three nearby airports . Looking under the requirements section , we can see that one airport ( Los Angeles Intl ) accepts digital notification . <p> For a simple answer to whether it is safe to fly , we can check the advisorycolor value . Here is a description of the different colors : <p> Color <p> Meaning <p> Green <p> There are no known advisories in this area <p> Yellow <p> There are known advisories in the area and the operator may require additional authorization or actions to fly in the area <p> Red <p> Flight is strictly regulated in this area ( Probably not safe to fly for the majority of people ) <p> Similarly , each advisory will also have a color value . <h> Pro Tip <p> A yellow advisory for an airport most likely means the flight is within close proximity of the airport and the operator needs to notify the airport of their flight . Checkout the Digital Notice + Awareness System for capabilities to notify airports . <p> Finally , the maxsafedistance tells us how far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest advisory , returning a 0 if the flight is within an advisory area . Check out the Reference section for a detailed description of the Status API . <h> Determining Direction to Advisory <p> It may be useful to know the direction of an advisory . While this information is not included in the response , we can calculate it using the latitude and longitude that is returned for an advisory . Here is some basic sample code for finding the approximate heading of an advisory from a current position : <h> Future Flight Conditions <p> The Status API can also be used to check for flight conditions up to 7 days in the future by including a datetime query parameter . This is useful for checking the weather forecast and future temporary flight restrictions for flights planned days in advance .

Telemetry allows for realtime information and communication in the form of a data stream . It enables applications to have a live icon of a moving drone be displayed on a map . <h> Requirements <p> The Telemetry API requires the use of a few other tools in order to function : <p> Flight API . You must create a flight prior to using the Telemetry API ( since the Telemetry API needs a flight to send telemetry from ) . See Creating and Viewing Flights <p> If you are not familiar with the above tools , check out the guides above before proceeding . Finally we will need an external library : <p> Protocol Buffers . The Telemetry API uses protocol buffers to serialize messages before packing them into a UDP datagram . Protocol buffers can be implemented to structure and send data to and from a variety of streams in many different languages , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guide , we will be working in Python , using the Python protocol buffer API <h> UDP Transport <p> Telemetry is sent in the form of packets ( datagrams ) with a specific encoding to the following host on port 16060 using UDP : <p> **28;152;TOOLONG UDP/16060 <h> UDP Encoding <p> Each UDP datagram consists of a manually constructed package header with a payload that may contain multiple messages , each prefixed with a message header . All numbers are network order ( big endian ) . <h> Message Header Format <p> The payload in the package header consists of byte concatenated , serialized messages which are prefixed by a message header . Each message header contains the message type I 'd , message length , and message . <p> Position <p> Bytes <p> Type <p> Name <p> Description <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> uint16 <p> Message Type I 'd <p> Numeric Message Type I 'd <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> uint16 <p> Message Length <p> Serialized message length , for a max message size of 64kB <p> 3 <p> 1&lt;x&lt;64x <p> raw <p> Message <p> Serialized protocol buffer byte string <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of messages , which can relay data regarding the position , speed , orientation , or pressure of an aircraft . The supported messages types and their respective message IDs are listed below . Multiple messages and message types can be concatenated and serialized to form the payload . <h> Example <p> In this example , using Python , the file telemetrypb2.py is generated by running the protocol buffer compiler protoc . <p> In the main application , telemetry.py , a token is first obtained using some authentication method ( in this case , Anonymous User ) . A flight ( with unique flight I 'd returned ) is then created by using the Flight API and a communication link is initiated with the /start-comm endpoint . This returns a secret key , which is decoded from base64 and subsequently used to encrypt the payload . <p> The payload itself is generated by using the included telemetrypb2.py file and constructing a message type object ( in this case , Position ) . This object is populated with data from the flight and packed into a serialized message , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encrypted and added to the package header . Finally , the packet is sent over a UDP stream to **28;182;TOOLONG on port 16060 and communications are ended with the /end-comm endpoint.
