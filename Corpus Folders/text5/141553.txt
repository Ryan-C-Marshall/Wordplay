The time between the start and stop is measured and computed in a histogram . If no photon is detected during the specified time range , the electronics are reset . <p> The ND filters are in place to reduce the Stop/Start rate to &lt; 2 % .

The decays HH and HV are measured for a grating factor , that is to compensate for the bias of HV over HH . Note the grating factor is wavelength dependent .

To ensure the system was not already a Windows 10 Pro Device I performed the installation without any product key ; Windows 10 Pro was not activated confirming the system was not made from a Windows 10 Pro Device ( i.e. it had n't been upgraded in the past ) . A subsequent Clean Installation of Windows 10 Pro with the Windows 7 Pro key did result in Product Activation . This means the system was newly registered with the Product Activation Server becoming a new Windows 10 Pro Device . <p> * 07/08/2016 There appears to have been some minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows Installation Files is an Upgrade Install is attempted .

@@42153456 @2153456/ <h> Light Basics <p> We use English names to refer to the colours we can see A more advanced specification of light is its determination by wavelength . Note in the above schematic the distance between two maxima ( the wavelength ) is longer than that in violet . Wavelength is typically specified in nm with 1 nm being 1 millionth of 1 mm ! <p> Light of shorter wavelength has a higher frequency and hence more energy than light of longer wavelengths An analogy is a 10 km run as the crow flies in Toronto compared to the Scottish Highlands It takes far less energy to run in flat Toronto than continuously up and down the hills and valleys of the Scottish Highlands . <h> Light Source and Monochromators <p> Illustration of a grating in a monochromator of a HORIBA Scientific FluoroLog 3-22 . Light from the Xenon lamp ( white light " all wavelengths ) enters through the entrance slit and is focused onto a grating ( performs a similar function to the prism shown before ) using an entrance mirror . The grating splits the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainbow . <p> Light of a specified wavelength ( colour ) is directed to an exit mirror and allowed to pass through the exit slit . The rest of the wavelengths hit the wall of monochromator and are hence rejected . HORIBA Scientific manufacture gratings and monochromators for those interested a HORIBA Scientific Grating Tutorial is available . <p> Because gratings typically let through light of 2nd and 3rd order for instance when the grating is set to 750 nm , light of 750 nm is allowed through and to a less degree light of 375 nm and 250 nm respectively . A series of optical filters longpass ( only lows light through above a certain wavelength ) , shortpass ( only allows through below a certain wavelength ) and bandpass filters ( only lets light through between certain wavelengths ) may be used in conjunction with a monochromator . <p> Using a monochromator and Xenon lamp can hence control the colour of the light which we wish to use to look at a sample . <h> Detector Part 1 <p> The most well-known detector of light is the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range with a maximum response in the green . It does not operate well in the NIR or UV . <p> This is a picture of me taken using a standard camera . The settings on a standard camera are set to match the response of the eye as most consumers want photos of their friends which resemble what they normally see . <p> This is a picture of me taken using a NIR camera which of course has a completely different wavelength response and as a consequence I look completely different . Note false visible colour is used on the NIR image ( so we can see and contrast it ) . False colour is often used in many applications so we can compare and contrast results . <h> Spectrophotometry <p> The first measurement we can carry out is an absorbance measurement which is the comparison of the amount of light reaching a detector in the presence and absence of an object . If you have ever put on sunglasses you have carried out an absorbance measurement in this case the light source is the sunlight , the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunglasses appear relatively dark to the eye as they absorb a large proportion of the light they however do not absorb everything as we can still see through them when we have them on . <p> A more sophisticated absorbance measurement can be measured in a spectrophotometer ( that is essentially a white light source , monochromator , filters and a detection source ) . The first step is looking at the energy scan of the blank signal which reaches the detector to ensure there is sufficient light at each wavelength in order to carry out an accurate measurement . <p> One may then put a sample of interest into the spectrophotometer and a control sample to account for the absorbance of the container holding the sample and solvent for instance if the sample is suspended in water and measure an absorbance spectrum . <p> The absorbance spectrum or related transmission spectrum may be used to characterise a sample although a simple dye ( Rhodamine 6G ) in solution ( ethanol ) is used , samples may range from almost anything in solid ( e.g. a leaf , sunglasses ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , beer ) or gas form . <p> Note : An absorbance spectrum is a relative ratio and as a consequence any wavelength dependence of the optics divides out ( discussed later ) . <h> Emissive Processes <p> A sample may interact with light in a number of ways As we are interested in emissive processes I can demonstrate most these processes using some basic samples and one of our green DeltaDiode lasers at 510 nm operating at 100 MHz in a DeltaPro sample chamber . <p> The appearance of the samples in room light . Note the colour we perceive these samples is primarily due to the absorbance and not due to emissive processes . <p> 1 . DeltaPro and DeltaDiode DD510L with no sample . The sample transmits light through onto a piece of card at the back . <p> 2 . DeltaPro and DeltaDiode DD510L with water sample . The sample transmits most of the light through onto the piece of card at the back as before . <p> 3 . DeltaPro and DeltaDiode DD510L with LUDOX suspended in water sample . LUDOX consists of silica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result there is an intense green beam observed throughout the Ludox . This type of scattering called Rayleigh scattering is elastic and retains the same wavelength ( colour ) as the excitation light . <p> There will also be another type of scattering that is inelastic called Raman scattering which is dependant on molecular vibrations of the sample molecules . Raman scattering is incredibly weak compared to Rayleigh scattering and hence not observed by eye in this example . Scattering can be a huge problem in spectrophotometry and is handled better in fluorimetry . <p> 4 . DeltaPro and DeltaDiode DD510L with fluorescein suspended in water sample . Fluorescein is a dye commonly used in many fluorescence applications especially within the life sciences . A common pupose is use by opticians to check the eyes . The DD510L is not the optimal wavelength for fluorescein as it coincides with the maximum value of the fluorescence . In this case a cyan laser ( 488 nm ) such as a DD485L is more optimal . However weak fluorescence can be observed as it passes through the sample . <p> 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water sample . The fluorescence of Rhodamine 6G is strong and an intense yellow emission is clearly distinguished from the green excitation light . <p> 6 . DeltaPro and DeltaDiode DD510L with ADOTA suspended in water sample . The fluorescence of ADOTA is strong and an even more intense yellow emission is clearly distinguished from the green excitation light . <h> Steady-State Fluorimeter <p> Taking our example from earlier : <p> We can see that the green excitation light when looking straight through the sample i.e. the beam on the card appears to be mostly green coming from the excitation source and the yellow fluorescence can barely be seen in contrast . In fluorescence measurements one wants to measure the yellow fluorescence in absence of the green excitation light and for best signal to noise this is usually done using a right angle measurement . A long pass filter or monochromator or combination of both can be used to separate out these signals before placement of a detector . <p> We may take an emission spectrum as demonstrated below in a fluorimeter . In my case using a modular FluoroLog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am going to excite at 500 nm this time using a Xenon Lamp as an excitation source instead of a DD510L and measure an emission spectrum at wavelengths higher than the excitation wavelength and sum of slits in this case 520-700 nm . To reduce stray light ( light passing through the monochromators at the wrong wavelengths from the Xenon lamp ) a double grating monochromator is preferred for a Xenon Lamp . <p> The excitation arm of a fluorimeter is more or less identical to the spectrophotometer shown before however the sample chamber has been removed and only 8 % is directed onto the detector in this case called the Reference R. The remaining 92 % of the light is directed onto the sample . Fluorescence as mentioned is collected at right angles and a second monochromator is present in front of the detector S. <p> Two raw signals are measured . Essentially a small fraction of the light source gets redirected to a photodiode just before the sample . The current across the photodiode is measured and used as a Reference for the lamp output . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detector pile-up ( discussed later ) the maximum Signal should be kept within the linear regime of the detector . On the other hand two low a Signal will give a poor quality spectrum . Slit bandpasses need to be altered to optimise a measurement . <p> R " Reference . <p> A number of corrections are then typically performed . The first correction accounts for any fluctuations in the lamp output and accounts for the non-uniform illumination across wavelength . For instance the Xenon lamp output is typically much weaker in the UV . Moreover , the Xenon lamp which is a consumable may have a declining output with respect to time this correction means data should be comparable between a new lamp and a lamp operating in the middle of its working lifetime . <p> I advise measuring all signals in a Steady-State instrument with two scanning monochromators . <p> One may also measure an Excitation spectrum . This time holding the emission monochromator constant at 550 nm and measuring emission when the excitation wavelength minus the sum of slits is lower in this case 400-530 nm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One will see the importance of the division by R as the Xenon lamp lines clearly distort the excitation spectrum . <h> Detector Part 2 : Wavelength Correction Factors <p> As mentioned the quantum efficiency of the detector is the main culprit for the non-linear wavelength response . The efficiency of gratings , polarisers and other optical components also play an important role . <p> The quantum efficiency of detectors are often displayed in logarithmic scale . In logarithmic scale smaller efficiencies appear to be more pronounced with respect to higher efficiencies . It is worthwhile looking at detector efficiencies with a linear scale as shown for some common HORIBA Scientific detectors : <p> A calibrated Tungsten filament or set of Standard Reference Materials are commonly used to calibrate a fluorimeter 's emission response : <p> These standards are measured using each instrument and a correction file is made by dividing their certified spectrum through by the measured spectrum . <p> An example of an Emission Wavelength Correction Factor MCorrect in a FluoroMax 4 with R928 PMT . MCorrect gets high in the red where the detectors quantum efficiency drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the detectors working range especially with weak signals : <p> With respect to the Emission Wavelength Correction Factor MCorrect , the Excitation Wavelength Correction Factor is relatively insignificant . It is usually measured using either a calibrated PhotoDiode or a Quantum Counter such as 8 mg/ml Rhodamine B in 1,2 propandiol at Front Face Configuration and measuring an excitation spectrum at 650 nm emission with a LP610 nm-LP630 nm filter . The quantum counter is a sample which effectively has a constant yield over a workable wavelength range . The emission from a quantum counter with respect to excitation should therefore correct for the response of the excitation optics particularly the photodiode . If you wish to measure correction factors see my PhD thesis for more details . <h> Detector Part 3 : Principle and Dark Counts <p> Operation of a Photomultiplier tube ( PMT ) : <p> The incident photon interacts with a photocathode which ejects an electron that 's focused onto a dynode chain . As the electron hits the first dynode , more electrons are released , these hit the second dynode chain and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the anode . If the voltage is above a certain threshold it is prescribed to a count . <p> What can also happen in the absence of light is that an electron may thermally shake loose near the beginning of the dynode chain . This can then release more electrons in being released across the dynode chain until the anode anode . If the voltage is above a certain threshold it is prescribed to a count . This of course is not a count due a photon it is a false detection otherwise known as a dark count . These dark counts are temperature dependent and cooling the PMT will reduce them . <h> Monochromator Bandpass , Spectral Resolution and Signal to Noise <p> There is always a trade-off between spectral resolution , fluorescence throughput as the monochromator bandpass is opened up . <p> If one is measuring a sample which has two closely resolved peaks ? a and ? b such as a Raman signal ( left ) with a spectral bandpass that 's sufficient ? ? ( centre ) the measured spectrum ( right ) should resemble the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of counts being measured as the emission monochromator grating is scanned . The number of counts measured per central wavelength is equivalent to the red-cross hatching . <p> If one is measuring a sample which has two closely resolved peaks ? a and ? b such as a Raman signal ( left ) with a spectral bandpass that 's too large ? ? ( centre ) the measured spectrum may lose spectral resolution ( right ) . The schematic illustrates the number of counts being measured as the emission monochromator grating is scanned . The number of counts measured per central wavelength is equivalent to the red-cross hatching . <p> An example of a cyclohexane Raman spectrum excitated at 532 nm using a FluoroLog 3-22 from 540-640 nm using a 1 s integration time and a step size of 1 nm . The spectral bandpasses of each monochromator was varied . If the bandpasses of both monochromators are too low there is insufficient signal to noise measured see the spectrum with bandpasses of 1 nm . On the other hand if the spectral bandpass is too large the spectral resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nm where the 4 individual peaks at 550-580 nm appear to have merged . <p> In the case where one has both a weak signal and wants high spectral resolution , the integration time must be increased . The above spectra show the role of integration time . To the top left where an integration time of 0.1 s per point is used only noise is observed . This becomes slightly better with an integration time of 1 s and 3 s respectively . A decent spectrum is recorded for a 30 s integration time . <p> Difficultly comes when one has a sample that is weak , unstable and they require a measurement with high spectral resolution . One has to tweak these three parameters as best as they can to get meaningful data . <h> Detector Part 4 : Linear Regime of the Detector <p> Detectors are stated to count linearly within their working regime i.e. PMT detectors have a specified maximum working range . Just above this working range they will still count but at a reduced efficiency . At extreme intensities the detectors may begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile-up comparing the working range to twice the intensity of the working range . <p> At the wavelength of peak intensity the most pile-up is observed and hence the lowest counting efficiency . At wavelengths of medium intensity there is a little pile-up slightly reducing the counting efficiency and at wavelengths of the lowest intensity there is no pile-up observed . The spectrum measured is therefore distorted . <p> Slight pileup and extreme pileup are shown below : <p> The fluorescence emission of Rhodamine 6G in ethanol measured in a Fluoromax 2 . The excitation wavelength was at 475 nm and emission was collected at 540-850 nm . A step size of 1 nm was used with an integration time of 1 s per point . The bandpasses of the monochromators were opened from 0.5-5.0 nm . Top the raw signal measured in counts per seconds . One can see the spectra measured above the linear regime of the PMT ( +106 CPS ) begin to square off . As the count rate is even higher a series of dips are observed . The middle shows the data normalised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . The bottom pane show the corrected normalised data and highlights the fact that correction factors do n't work sufficiently when the signal to noise of the data is too poor . <h> Excitation Emission Matrix ( EEM ) <p> Naturally one can combine the information of the excitation spectrum and the emission spectrum by scanning both monochromators to create an Excitation Emission Matrix ( EEM ) . For an EEM measurement one first performs an Emission spectrum at the starting excitation wavelength . They then step the Excitation Monochromator , measure another Emission scan and continue the process until they reach the upper excitation wavelength . An EEM is a 3D dataset . <p> An example of an EEM of pure water ( Starna certified standard ) in log scale measured in a Fluoromax 4 . Data is collected in 5 nm increments using a 0.2 s integration time . Rayleigh ( elastic ) and Raman ( inelastic ) scattering lines are shown as well as low levels of stray light . Any impurities in the water ( not present in the standard ) would have an excitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem with an EEM when measured on a system with 2 scanning monochromators is the the time to acquire an EEM . Typically one has to up the spacing for instance , measure every 5 nm instead of every 1 nm or/and a lower integration time e.g. 0.1 s per point instead of 1 s per point . <p> Instead of using an emission monochromator and single channel detector such as a PMT . A multi-channel detector such as a CCD may be used with a Spectrograph . <p> Illustration of an EEM measurement using a system with an Excitation Monochromator , Emission Spectrograph and Charged Coupled Device and Auxillary PhotoDiode . The simultaneous measurement of an absorbance spectra and an EEM allows one to acquire an EEM corrected for Inner-filtering . Such measurements have became very important spectroscopy measurements for water quality applications . An example of an EEM in an AquaLog is shown here :

It is promised to be a continuous stream of updates , fixes and enhancements . With the new continuous distribution of Windows 10 continuous testing is required and Microsoft are valuing the feedback from their enthusiasts i.e. those in the Windows Insiders program . You may opt to remain on the : <p> * Requires use of a Microsoft Account if Upgrading via Windows Update but not if Clean Installing direct from . iso . <p> Below is all legacy and will be updated when I have more details about the next Insider Preview . iso . <p> The TH2 builds and later should be more stable than the Windows Insider Preview for TH1 and earlier but in general only experienced users should be on the Fast Track . Most of the issues should be reported early on the Fast Track and amended for Slow Track users . After installation of Windows 10565 Slow and Fast track Insiders will be upgraded to Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TH2 . isos are not currently available for the maintrack users . It seems Microsoft is awaiting some more feedback before releasing it . <h> Creating a Bootable USB Flash Drive : <p> Rufus does not need to be installed and can be run directly by double clicking on the application . <p> Select your 8 GB or superior USB flash drive : <p> Select the . iso : <p> There are two types of bootable USB you can make with Rufus The GPT partition scheme for UEFI computer " or the MBR Partition Scheme for BIOS or UEFI Computers " . If you are unsure what one to select see the information in Updating your BIOS and Determining if you have UEFI and SecureBoot . Its recommended to have the latest BIOS update before Windows 10 installation anyway . <p> Use with Dell hardware and Windows 8.1 64 Bit with a UEFI BIOS later than 2012 . Enable UEFI and SecureBoot . <p> Requires systems that have a Unified Extensive Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) Basic Input Output ( BIOS ) and also 64 Bit Windows . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware Dell shipped with Windows 8 or later . <p> This is a new partition scheme which is more reliable than the MBR partition scheme . In GPT multiple copies of partitioning and boot data are stored on the hard drive and checks they are consistent . <p> This partition scheme has the advantage in the fact that it can support &gt;2 TB drives and can create up to 128 Partitions . <p> This will support newer security technologies such in the UEFI BIOS such as SecureBoot and these should be enabled . <p> 2010-2011 hardware may or may not have a UEFI BIOS and you will need to check and enable the settings in the UEFI BIOS setup if applicable . These settings will also need to applied correctly for systems that have previously been running Windows 7 ( e.g. downgrade rights ) . <p> Master Boot Record Partition Scheme for BIOS or UEFI Computer <p> Use with Dell hardware and Windows 8.1 with a Legacy BIOS earlier than 2010 . <p> This can be used for an older system pre-2012 with a legacy Basic Input Output System ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows 8.1 32 Bit . <p> Limited to 2 TB of space and to 4 partitions . <p> This partition scheme is less reliable as the partitioning and boot data is stored in one location meaning if its corrupt then the data is lost . <p> If you do not select the USB Device , then load the . iso and then select the Partition Scheme and File System in order , Rufus may revert some of the settings to defaults which may be incorrect . <p> Select the GPT partition scheme for UEFI computer " or the MBR Partition Scheme for BIOS or UEFI Computers " respectively depending if your hardware is post 2012 or pre 2012 . <p> Select the FAT32 file system . SecureBoot requires the bootable USB to be formatted as FAT32 otherwise it wo n't boot . <p> Click start : <p> Select OK to format the USB flash drive : <p> Rufus will now create the Bootable USB : <p> When its ready it 'll say Done " to the bottom left . You may now close Rufus and have a bootable USB for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Power down your computer . Disconnect any external hard drive(s) and any USB peripherals such as printers/scanners . <p> It is recommended to install Windows 10 in a UEFI BIOS with SecureBoot enabled . <p> These settings should automatically be applied to any system shipped with Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 . <p> If your system &lt;2010 and had Windows 7 previously installed ignore mention of UEFI as your system does n't have a UEFI BIOS . <p> If your system had Windows 7 previously installed and is a 2011 model : <h> Variant B : Legacy Boot <p> For systems older than 2011 you will have to just use the legacy boot with the MBR partition scheme which will be listed by default . There will be no mention of Legacy or UEFI Boot but the boot option will be legacy . <p> If you wish to install Windows 10 32 Bit ( unrecommended ) on a 2012 or later system you will need to disable SecureBoot and enable legacy boot options . <h> 1 . Windows 8. x/10 OEM ( UEFI BIOS Embedded OEM SLP ) Keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will automatically be input by the Windows Installation Media . In short it will automatically bypass the enter your product key screen below taking you straight to the license agreement screen . <p> Systems shipped with Windows 8. x will have stickers like this . Systems shipped directly with Windows 10 wo n't have any stickers . <p> If you do see the first screen you have began the installation using the wrong Edition of Windows 10 . Unfortunately Microsoft do not inform you if you have a product key for another Edition of Windows here . <p> The Official 10565 . isos accept only Home and Pro Editions of Windows 8. x/10 OEM SLP product keys . Its hoped that Microsoft has taken my feedback into account and will make one Windows 10 . iso of all Editions when they release . isos on the main track . If they do n't do this they should at least put more information on this screen something like : <h> 2 . Windows 7 OEM Keys on COAs <p> Each Windows 7 OEM system was shipped with a COA which looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it with your phone as I have done and keeping it for your own records . You can then open up the picture on your phone and have it beside you when you are installing Windows 10 on your system . <p> There are also N Editions which are relatively rare but the Windows Insider Preview . iso does n't accept N Editions : <p> Windows 7 StarterN ?

Windows 10 ProN <p> As Microsoft provided COAs with low print quality that were prone to fading . Good OEMs like Dell typically hid them in the battery compartments of laptops to shield them . Unfortunately they may not be shielded in early Windows 7 models and faded to the extent that the product key is illegible . See the notes about installing Windows 10 without a product key if you have a Faded COA . <p> Once you have input your product key you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input the product key for the wrong Edition of Windows the installation will abort : <p> The Insider Preview . iso does not support any Single Language or N Editions of Windows 10. <h> 4 . Faded Windows 7 COA /Windows Insider 10130 or Trial/Evaluation <p> Special notes for a system with a Faded Windows 7 COA <p> If you have a faded COA , you need to have Windows 7 previously installed using Dell OEM factory settings or using a Dell OEM Windows 7 Reinstallation DVD . These will apply Windows 7 OEM SLP activation . This was an activation mechanism that utilised a generic product key which activated if and only if a valid Dell ( or other major OEM ) BIOS was detected . <p> These installs can be upgraded to Windows 10 without use of a product key and will be registered with a Microsoft Product Activation server during the Upgrade process . If a device has Windows 10 TH1 or later previously installed and activated it is already a Windows 10 Device . <p> If you had Windows 7 Starter , Windows 7 Home Basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Windows 10 Home Device and registered with a Microsoft Product Activation Server meaning you can select I do n't have a product key and select to install the Home Insider Preview and your system will automatically reactivate when online . If you had Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Ultimate your system is classified as a Windows 10 Pro Device and registered with a Microsoft Product Activation Server meaning you can select I do n't have a product key and select to install the Pro Insider Preview and your system will automatically reactivate when online . <p> If you have not upgraded from a Windows 7 install with OEM SLP activation and have a faded COA and unbootable Windows 7 OEM installation your only choice is to contact your OEM ( if in warranty ) , look on eBay for Windows 7 OEM media with OEM SLP activation , buy Windows again or take the Unofficial Upgrade path . <p> Special notes for those who took the Unofficial Free Upgrade path via the Windows 10130 Insider Preview <p> Unless your system had an additional Windows 7/8.1 OEM license you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 10130 to 10240 ( TH1 ) Pro your system is classified as a Windows 10 Pro Device and registered with a Microsoft Product Activation Server meaning you can select I do n't have a product key and select to install the Pro Insider Preview and your system will automatically reactivate when online . <p> The premature Removal of the Windows 7 Digital River installation . isos ( February 2015 ) before Windows 10 TH1 Build 10240 ( July 2015 ) meant those who used the Windows Insider Preview were stuck on Windows 10 Pro i.e. their system registered with a Microsoft Product Activation Server and became a Windows 10 Pro Device and not a Windows 10 Home Device . However TH2 itself will allow Windows Insiders who Windows 7 Starter , Windows 7 Home Basic and Windows 7 Home Premium to take their free upgrade to Windows 10 Home opposed to Pro should they wish . <p> Users who used 10130 to upgrade from Windows Vista or Windows XP ( with capable hardware ) are extremely unlikely to pay full retail price for Windows 10 as the hardware is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the Full Retail license in many cases . I personally suggest that Microsoft allow all these users to install Windows 10 . These users can evaluate how well Windows 10 runs on their device and Microsoft should make the license extremely cheap if the hardware is weak but capable i.e. if the hardware is of the age between 2007-2010 the license should cost no more than $20 . This will help with the eradication of Windows Vista and reduce Windows XP usage . <p> Because of 1 . and 2 and particularly the combination of both 1 . and 2 Microsoft are extremely unlikely to stop the continued use of Windows 10 Pro on Devices that have became Windows 10 Pro Devices via the Upgrade from Windows 10130 Insider Preview . <p> If you want to just try Windows 10 TH2 to see how it works on your machine for a trial or are Reinstalling on a Windows 10 Device and do n't have a product key select I do n't have a Product Key . <p> Select Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 pro appropriately : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have selected Windows 10 Home Insider Preview it will automatically reactivate when online . <p> If your system is a Windows 10 Pro Device and you have selected Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview it will automatically reactivate when online . <p> If your system is not a Windows 10 Device you may use Windows 10 but you will be constantly nagged for product activation and some of the personalisation settings wo n't work . <h> The Windows 10 TH2 Setup Part 3 : Drive Options <p> Read the license agreement , check I accept these terms " and then select next : <p> On the next screen you will be given the option to Upgrade " or Clean Reinstall " . <p> To Clean Reinstall select Custom . The following steps will result in loss of data so cancel the installation and backup your data to an external hard drive or cloud storage if you have n't already done so . I never recommend Upgrade installs . <p> Note : In most cases Windows 10 Installation Media should have the SATA Storage Controller inbuilt and hence there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a general rule of thumb if Windows Installation Media is significantly newer than your System the Storage Controller is inbuilt . Microsoft promise to keep Windows Installation Media relatively up to date so the need to load Storage Controller drivers should become relatively rare . <p> If on the other hand you get the error message A Required CD/DVD Device Driver is Missing " then your Installation Media is corrupt and you should make new Windows 10 Installation Media . <p> In the majority of cases the HDD/SSD will already be listed The partitions listed will differ from system to system aswell as the number of drive(s) . In this step you want to delete all the partitions on the SSD/HDD ( SSD recommended ) that you want to Install Windows on so all the storage on the drive is unallocated space . <p> Note if you have previously used DiskPart or Cleaned up the SSD/HDDthe drive will already show as unallocated space . Cleaning up a HDD/SSD should be done in advance of Windows Installation and is particular important if you are Clean Reinstalling to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Windows 10 device . <p> If you have any other HDDs/SSDs that have an Operating System its recommended to delete all the partitions on these in a similar manner in order to prevent an unwanted dualboot . <p> Note external hard drives and USB flash drives may also be listed here which is why it was recommended to remove any unnecessary USB peripheral devices to save confusion . Data drives should be left alone aswell as the Windows 10 Bootable USB . <p> Dual Boot Note " Advanced Configurations only ! ! ! <p> For a system with multiple SSD/HDDs multiple Drive numbers will show . You can only delete the partitions on the SSD/HDD ( SSD recommended ) that you intend to install Windows on . <p> If you have Windows/Linux installed on another drive this will make a Dual Boot . Alternatively you can delete all the partitions on other drive(s) in order to prevent an unwanted Dual Boot . I do not recommend Dual Booting and even less on the same Drive . In general I prefer virtualisation . <p> I will demonstrate a UEFI install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This lists the single internal SSD as Drive 0 . The drive had a Windows 7 Professional factory settings previously upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and was reverted back to Windows 7 Professional . It has two small partitions ( UEFI ) and the main OS partition aswell as the recovery partition . <p> Select each partition on the Drive you want to install Windows on , in this case Drive 0 , then select Delete systematically . I will start on the Recovery Partition . Note there 's no point in keeping the Recovery Partition ( this will vary in size from system to system ) while carrying out a Clean Reinstall as it 'll no longer function . Moreover even if it did work it 'll recover to an obsolete version of Windows . <p> Select ok . Then delete all the other partitions on the drive in a similar manner . <p> Your entire drive should now be unallocated space , select the unallocated space and then select new : <p> Select apply : <p> Windows will setup additional partitions and warn you that these are being created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ( &gt;2012 ) and are using a UEFI BIOS with the GPT partition scheme , the partitions will look like the following . The top three partitions should be the same size as shown below and the presence of these multiple partitions make the GPT partition scheme more robust . The last largest partition will vary in size taking up the remainder SSD/HDD . Select this largest partition and select Next : <p> If you have a older system ( &lt;2012 ) or a newer system with UEFI settings disabled e.g. for a 32 Bit Windows 10 Installation you will hence have to use Legacy BIOS settings and the MBR partition scheme . The partitions will look slightly different on a MBR install see below . There will be a single 500 MB system reserved partition opposed to 3 smaller partitions in a GPT install . The last largest partition will vary in size taking up the remainder SSD/HDD . Select this largest partition and select Next : <p> Windows will begin to install and depending on your hardware may take some time to go through all the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restart . Select restart now or wait 10 seconds : <h> The Windows 10 TH2 Setup Part 4 : Account and End of Setup <p> Your computer will restart and Windows will take some time to get your devices ready . <p> The setup will restart : <p> Note if you are going to sell or hand down your Windows 10 Device , you can force shut it down here and remove the Windows 10 Installation USB . The new owner can continue with the setup . <p> If you are connected to an ethernet or offline the next few screens wo n't show .
