In several scenes , we cut away to these memories , always returning to the current scene . <p> There are several ways to do this on the page . <p> The first technique is to simply use full scene headers . ( This example is made up just for this blog post . ) <p> Roger squints in the glare of light . <p> CUT TO : <p> INT . EXAMINATION ROOM NIGHT FLASHBACK <p> ORDERLIES strap Roger 's forehead to the table . A DRILL WHIRRS as a BRIGHT LIGHT swings overhead . <p> BACK TO : <p> INT . COPY ROOM DAY <p> Roger squats down , suddenly reeling . <p> That BACK TO : is your friend . It 's a reminder to the reader that you were in the middle of another scene , and it 's still happening . Yes , you could just use CUT TO . But it 's ambiguous . Are you still in the same scene , or is this a different place/time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cutaway involves multiple locations the finale of Big Fish , for example . It 's a signal to the reader that all of the cutting is done . <h> Doing less <p> If you 're cutting away to the same thing often , using the full scene header gets annoying . It 's like that guy at a party who keeps introducing himself . <p> We know who you are , Dave . You can stop . <p> In the example above , if we 've been to that examination room scene before , I 'm more likely to write it like this : <p> As Roger squints in the glare of light -- <p> ORDERLIES strap Roger 's forehead to the table . A DRILL WHIRRS as a BRIGHT LIGHT swings overhead . <p> BACK TO SCENE . <p> Roger squats down , suddenly reeling . <p> Removing the location and the transitions feels like cheating , but it better reflects my intention with the scene . This cutaway is meant to be a nibble , not a meal . <p> Setting it off with italics is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're doing something special here . Bold or underline would also work . ( If you use special formatting for flashbacks like this , do n't use it for any other narrative device . ) <p> That BACK TO SCENE is also optional , but here I like it as a tiny speed bump to make sure the reader understands that we 're out of flashback mode . <p> Is it weird to have BACK TO SCENE without a CUT TO ? Kind of . You could use a CUT TO : and even skip the italics . But its extra lines , and I do n't think the reader is likely to get lost . <h> In production <p> When it comes time to make the movie , everything needs a scene number . We generally think of scene numbers going with scene headers , but the reality is that anything can have a number attached , including the italicized action lines above . <p> There are different philosophies for how to number flashback scenes , but my preference would be to keep the copy room scene as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together all of the examination room scenes as a sequence ( e.g. A900 , B900 , C900 ) . This way , the copy room scene does n't get divided across a few strips , potentially confusing everyone . <p> Numbering scenes is a conversation to have with the director , A.D. and line producer . Its a luxury problem , because it means your movie is getting made . 
@@42311371 @2311371/ <p> Can you specify how to use transitions while writing a screenplay ? I 'm referring to all those " cut to " -s and other transitions . I never know if I should actually use one , or just move to the next scene . <p> Lior <p> In most situations , you do n't  need to use CUT TO : or any other transition at the end of a scene . When readers hit a new scene header ( i.e. INT . HOUSE DAY ) , they inherently understands that the old scene is over , and we 've cut to a new one . The CUT TO : is just filler . <p> However , CUT TO : can still be useful . The most common situation is when you 're ending a scene abruptly for dramatic or comedic effect ( usually the latter ) : <p> BARBARA <p> Okay . Maybe just one drink . <p> CUT TO : <p> INT . BAR LATER <p> Barbara pours a pitcher of beer over herself . She then continues a sassy bar-top shimmy that 's got the whole CROWD worked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : is when you 're moving between parallel action . If the hero is fighting his way to the back of the train while the heroine is trying to defuse the bomb in the caboose , you 'll probably use CUT TO : to switch back and forth between their situations . While you 're following your hero from car to car , it ; s therefore better to not use a CUT TO : , in order to make it more clear to the readers that were following one continuous action . <p> The final case you 'll find yourself using CUT TO : is when inserting titles over black , Law and Order-style . The CUT TO : makes it clear you 're not printing on top of the scene that follows .

With a year of deadlines , word counts , and earning endless scorn from my editor ( who I am convinced possess more red ink than blood ) under my belt , I now feel comfortable beginning the process of flushing out these stories in a structured form . <p> My question is : Which format should I pursue ? <p> Through your site , I now understand the plus and minuses of writing a screenplay . And , I take heed into delving into the business end of screenwriting . ( I enjoy living in Florida and have little desire to pack up for L.A. , at this time . ) Also , some of my ideas just seem easier to tackle for a first time screenplay than a first time novel , such as my quirky rom-com outline rather than my existential mind bending sci-fi epic . Finallynot to belittle the screenwriting processthere are some stories that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other stories I feel so strongly about that I want to collaborate with no one . <p> I know your personal answer would always be a screenplay . But , have you ever read a friends or fellow professionals script and advised her material is best suited as a book ? For what reasons ? And , what format would be best for a ( semi ) unpublished writer ? ( For some reason , the Premiere magazine feature on Rex Pickett and his struggles to sell " Sideways " as a screenplay keep popping in my head . ) <p> I searched your archives and could not find a similar question to answer my query . If I missed it , I apologize . <p> Mike Rabinowitz Head Writer REAX Music Magazine <p> Assuming you enjoy novels , you should probably write one , rather than writing a screenplay . <p> I know that seems like heretical advice for a blog about screenwriting , but I think the numbers support me . In the U.S. , more than 3,500 novels are published each year . Compare that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrically . <p> If you 're looking to put your story out into the world , paper beats film , hands down.1 <p> Beyond the hard numbers , consider the relative levels of authorship . Novels are a final art form you write a book and that 's it . It sits on a shelf with your name on it . Screenplays , on the other hand , are one link in a long process leading to the final art form : a movie . While its your name on the script , the movie is the result of a huge collaboration . Right or wrong , the director will get most of the credit for what makes it on screen.2 <p> To get rich . Often , when you read about a new script , the story has a dollar figure attached : " Joe Smoalan sold his spec MONKEY BUTLER to New Line for high six-figures . " One you figure out that " high six figures " means more than $500,000 , you realize that there 's a lot of money to be made in screenwriting . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  making that much money . <p> " I could never write a novel , but " Because screenplays have fewer words than a novel , they should be easier to write , right ? Besides , everyones seen bad movies . It ca n't be hard to write one better than The Grudge 2 . <p> " I could never direct a movie , but screenwriting is just words . " So much of moviemaking is esoteric and intimidating . Just watching the end credits scroll by is bewildering to anyone outside the industry who rated the men to pick the Best Boy ? But its not hard to imagine writing a script . Its just words and margins . <p> It will surprise no one when I point out that these are three terrible reasons to write a screenplay . <p> Well start with the money . I get frustrated when journalists treat screenwriting as a kind of lottery , emphasizing the payday rather than the work . Most scripts never sell , and most scripts that do sell , sell for a tiny amount . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are pretty infrequent . <p> In terms of the " I could never write a novel " excuse , yes , some writers seem better suited to one kind of writing than another , just as most painters are n't  sculptors . But creating characters , shaping storylines , and stringing together words in a pleasing fashion are prerequisite skills for both novels and screenplays . I would lose respect for any working screenwriter who professed an inability to write traditional fiction . <p> Its true that the learning curve for screenwriting is n't as steep as it would be for , say , directing . And it costs a helluva lot less . But a screenwriter quickly finds that maintaining a willful ignorance about the moviemaking process is impossible . In order to get your film made , you 're going to have to learn about the physical and political ordeal of production . You can do that in school or on the set , but you 'll soon know your grips from your gaffers . <p> So back to the original question : Should you write a screenplay or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does your idea want to be ? <p> Do you envision an intimate psychological profile of a half-Korean woman trapped in a mediocre marriage who imagines an affair with her co-worker ? That 's probably a novel . The story is largely internal ; the action is minor ; the stakes are low . In the novel version of your story , you can spend a paragraph detailing her decision to buy percale sheets , describing the different textures and comparing them to the geography of her homeland . In the movie version , she buys sheets , and maybe has a conversation during the process . <p> Are you looking to write a comedy about a deposed crime boss who goes into witness relocation at a fat camp ? That 's a movie . here 's a test : Can you envision a one-sheet poster ? Its a movie . Could it star Martin Lawrence ? Its a movie . Could you describe it as " something meets something ?

Yes , some books can be adapted into great movies , but its because they inherently had enough cinematic content to make the leap . If yours does n't  , you 'll only frustrate yourself and your readers . <p> Yes , I 'm omitting films not shown theatrically . That 's a significant number . I 'm also leaving out television , which is kissing cousins with screenwriting . On the book side , however , I 'm omitting paperbacks and genre fiction . The total number of books published in the U.S. is 50,000 and they 're not all gardening manuals . ? <p> Interestingly , the screenwriter may get a lot of the blame . In my experience , the screenwriters name is approximately three times as likely to show up in a negative review than a positive one . That 's a masters thesis waiting to be written . ?

@@42311385 @2311385/ <p> We got a question in the Highland support queue this morning that is less technical than philosophical : <p> I started using Highland to finish a script I started in Final Draft . <p> In Final Draft when a character speaks , then stops to do something physical , spots something , etc , then speaks again , a ( CONTD ) is automatically added . <p> When I finished writing the script in Highland I noticed that Highland does not add the ( CONTD ) so I had half a script with ( CONTD ) and half without it . <p> In short I am curious is the ( CONTD ) needed ? Should I add it to what I wrote in Highland , or do I go back and remove it ? <p> I am going to submit this script to the Black List website , and am still an aspiring screenwriter .

I wrote about it back in 2010 , and that advice still holds true . <p> In some cases , you 'll absolutely want to use ( contd ) to indicate a character is still speaking . Its a signal to the reader ( and the actor ) that the character is continuing the same thought , regardless of the intervening action . <p> In other cases , its much less clear whether dialogue continuity makes sense . If a bunch of action has occurred between the last time the character spoke , is it really correct or helpful to have that ( contd ) ? <p> Consider Sandra Bullocks character in Gravity .

@@42311386 @2311386/ <p> One of the thing I admire most about Jane Espensons blog is that she talks very directly about the words on the page , giving names to techniques I use but never really think about . The two-percenter , for example . <p> So one of my goals for 2007 is to get a little more granular in my advice-giving , and talk less about Screenwriting and more about screenwriting in particular , scene writing . <p> Spend a few years as a screenwriter , and writing a scene becomes an almost unconscious process . Its like driving a car . Most of us do n't  think about the ignition and the pedals and the turn signals but we used to , back when we were learning . It used to flummox the hell out of us . Every intersection was unbelievably stressful , with worries of stalling the car and/or killing everyone on board . <p> Its the same with writing a scene . The first few are brutal and clumsy .

Its just that your instinct is making a lot of the decisions your conscious brain used to handle . <p> So here 's my attempt to introspect and describe what I 'm doing that I 'm not even aware Im doing . here 's How to Write a Scene . <h> 1 . Ask : What needs to happen in this scene ? <p> Many screenwriting books will tell you to focus on what the characters want . This is wrong . The characters are not responsible for the story . You are . If characters were allowed to control their scenes , most characters would chose to avoid conflict , and movies would be crushingly boring . <p> The question is not , " What could happen ? " or " What should happen ? " It is only , " What needs to happen ? " If you wrote an outline , this is the time to look at it.1 If you did n't  , just come up one or two sentences that explain what absolutely must happen in the scene . <h> 2 . Ask : What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Imagine the projectionist screwed up and accidentally lopped off this scene . Would the movie still make sense ? If the answer is " yes , " then you do n't  really need the scene , and shouldnt bother writing it . <p> But its so dramatic ! you say . But its so funny ! <p> Tough . Put that drama or that comedy into scenes that are crucial to the movie.2 One thing you learn after a few produced movies is that anything that can be cut will be cut , so put your best material into moments that will absolutely be there when its done . <h> 3 . Ask : Who needs to be in the scene ? <p> Scripts are often clogged with characters who have no business being there . But because words are small , its easy to overlook that " Haversmith " has n't  said or done anything for five pages . And sadly , sometimes that 's not realized until after filming.3 <h> 4 . Ask : Where could the scene take place ? <p> The most obvious setting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  be too quick to set your scene in the police bullpen , a living room , or a parking garage . Always consider what the characters could be doing , even if its not directly related to the focus of the scene . A father-and-son bonding moment at a slaughter house will play differently than the same dialogue at a lawn bowling tournament . <h> 5 . Ask : What 's the most surprising thing that could happen in the scene ? <p> Give yourself permission to step away from your outline and consider some wild possibilities . What if a car smashed through the wall ? What if your hero choked and died ? What if a young boy vomited up a finger ? <p> Most of your scenes wont have one of these out-of-nowhere aspects . But your movie needs to have a few moments that are completely unexpected , so always ask yourself , could this be one of them ? <h> 6 . Ask : Is this a long scene or a short scene ? <p> There 's nothing so dispiriting as writing a great three-page mega-scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two-eighths of a page.4 So ask yourself up front : How much screen time am I willing to give to this scene ? <h> 7 . Brainstorm three different ways it could begin . <p> The classic advice is to come into a scene as late as you possibly can . Of course , to do that , you really need to know how the previous scene ended . There 's often a natural momentum that suggests what first image or line of dialogue would be perfect to open the scene . But do n't  stop at the first option . Find a couple , then <h> 8 . Play it on the screen in your head . <p> At least 50% of screenwriting is simply sitting there with your eyes closed , watching the unwritten scene loop in your head . The first couple of times through , its really rough : a blocking rehearsal . But eventually , you start to hear the characters talk to each other , and the vague motions become distinct actions . Do n't  worry if you cant always get the scene to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exit in the writing than in the imagining . <p> Do n't  rush this step . Let the scene percolate . Mumble the dialogue . Immerse yourself as fully into the moment as you can . <h> 9 . Write a scribble version . <p> A " scribble version " is essentially a cheat sheet so you 'll remember the great scene you just saw in your head . Do n't  write sentences ; do n't  write full dialogue . It shouldnt take more than five minutes . Just get the bare minimum down so that you wo n't forget the scene in the next hour as you 're writing it . <p> I generally hand-write a scribble version in tiny print sometimes literally on the back of an envelope but you can also type . This is what a scribble version consists of for me : <p> My wife has never been pregnant . been trying three years . fertility clinic last week <p> I examined the baby myself . nearly at term . <p> I do n't  know whose baby , not hers . <p> Its kind of a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only shortly after I wrote it . But that does n't  matter . The scribble version is only there so you do n't  get lost or confused while writing the full version of the scene . Yes , its finally time to <h> 10 . Write the full scene . <p> If you typed up the scribble version , do n't  just try to fatten it out . Start clean . The scribble version is deliberately crappy , and rewritten crap is still crap . <p> The scribble version is your outline for the scene . Yes , allow yourself the chance to detour from your scribble version if a truly better idea comes along . But if you 've really spent the time to play it through in your head ( #8 ) , its probably on the right track already . <p> Depending on the nature of the scene , getting the dialogue right may be most of the work . Regardless , focus on choosing the best words to describe the characters , the action and tone , so your readers will see the same scene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm neither pro nor anti-outline . They can be a useful way of figuring out how the pieces might fit together . They 're nearly essential in television , where many minds need to coordinate .

Yes , largely , but feel free to correct me where you disagree .

I 'm a more efficient writer , focusing on what a writer should be focusing on : words . I 've switched over to Highland for my latest screenplay and I can honestly say that I will never go back . Highland is where I will write from now on . <p> The highest compliment I can pay this program is that it gets out of my way . It makes me want to KEEP writing . Which is a writers dream . <p> Jmedwarrens five-star review is so lovely that I almost do n't  want to tell him the backstory : Highland wasnt meant for writing at all . <p> When we announced Highland in 2012 , we billed it as a " screenplay utility " for converting between formats : PDF , FDX and the newly-minted Fountain . You dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is what it looked like : <p> The initial betas had no editing view , because we assumed users would write and edit Fountain using any of the excellent plain-text editors available .

For example , if we needed to modify title page information , it was a hassle to have to save the Fountain text , open it in iAWriter , fix it , then re-open it in Highland . <p> To avoid this round-tripping , we added a very basic editor and a preview . The user could switch between these views to see the changes reflected before export . <p> As the betas progressed , we changed the UI significantly , moving from two tabs on the top to the current sidebar.1 This is what version 1.7 looks like : <p> By the time we shipped almost a year later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on writing while we converted files.2 <p> Still , I started to be comfortable calling Highland a screenplay editor rather than a screenplay utility . Last year , I wrote : <p> Highland is a great bridge between apps , but over the last year we 've found more and more users are simply doing their writing in Highland . It 's a full-featured editor , with spelling , versions and find-and-replace . Because it 's plain text , you can focus on the words and not the formatting . <p> When asked if someone could write a script in Highland , my answer was generally , " Well , you could . But that 's not really what its for . " I steered users to other apps as alternatives . As a company , we spent our time refining Highlands underlying engine for parsing PDFs and dealing with edge cases . <p> But people kept using Highland like a traditional screenwriting app .

When you 're writing in Highland , its just the words . There 's nothing to distract you . You ca n't fiddle with margins , or futz with how the pages break . Even the little bits of syntax gray themselves out so all you see is your text . <p> Speed . Highland is lean and mean . From scrolling to previews , Highland is blisteringly fast . Because its Mac-only , we optimize it using the latest Apple technologies . Because we separate editing from preview , you 're never waiting for a long document to reformat as you type . <p> Its hard to market speed as a feature , because you do n't  think of a screenwriting app needing to be fast . But in practice , Highland feels better under your fingers . <p> Typography . Highland features Courier Prime and Highland Sans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at ugly fonts all day . <p> Standards . Because we helped forge the Fountain standard , Highland does it well . Were often the first to incorporate new specs , such as lyrics and forced character names . But you can always open Highlands files in any plain text editor , so you 're never stuck with us . If another screenwriting app comes along that 's vastly better , you can jump ship instantly . <p> Dark Mode . I do n't  understand why more apps do n't  offer it . It makes writing in dark places or public spaces much more comfortable . <p> PDF melting . This was Highlands breakout feature . While other apps have added it , our PDF parsing is unmatched . Its a tricky , thankless task , but a key part of both Highland and now Weekend Read , so we keep getting better . <p> Active development . Highland receives regular updates , sometimes twice a month , incorporating user-requested features in almost every build .

Justin Marks wrote me to say he was doing his latest feature largely in Highland , in part because it made working with lyrics so much easier . <p> These are some of Highlands advantages , but there are things other screenwriting apps do better than Highland or that we do n't  do at all . Our work this next year will be figuring out what we can do to make Highland more useful without losing focus . <p> Outlining . I use Workflowy for outlining , but I 'd love an integrated outliner that smartly leverages Fountains section and synopsis lingo . Slugline sort of does it , but its sidebar outline is mostly a navigator rather than a writing tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , and I miss it sometimes . ) <p> Revisions . Last week , I needed to turn in a draft with small changes . I really wanted to create starred changes in the margins without having to leave the comfort of Highland . We have ideas for dealing with revisions , both within the Fountain spec and on an app level , but its a challenging problem . For all my issues with Final Draft , it actually does a solid job with starred changes ( and more complicated production features ) once you understand how it works . <p> Collaboration . This is a topic for a longer blog post , but collaboration can mean both two people typing in the same document at the same time ( like Google Docs ) or the ability to suggest edits ( like Draft ) .

@@42311396 @2311396/ <p> Six weeks is a long time . I say this not to panic you , but to make sure you understand that employable screenwriters need to be able to produce on demand . <p> In the comment thread that followed and subsequent emails many readers wondered exactly how long was too long , and what was a reasonable timeframe in which a screenwriter should be expected to deliver a script . So let 's try to answer those questions . <p> When a screenwriter is hired to write a project ( like Shazam ! , or Big Fish ) , the contract generally allows for a 12-week writing period for the first draft . Subsequent rewrites and polishes are given shorter time period , anywhere from eight weeks to two weeks . <p> In practice , I 've never seen these contractual writing periods enforced . 1 Rather , a few weeks into the process , a producer or studio executive calls the screenwriter and the following conversation takes place : <p> PRODUCER <p> So , hows the writing going ? <p> WRITER <p> Good . Good . <p> PRODUCER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta sense of when you 're going to be finished ? <p> WRITER <p> Umm .... <p> PRODUCER <p> Just ballpark , like , end of January ?

Follow-up phone calls try to narrow the time frame down even more , with the goal of getting you to deliver the script on a Thursday or Friday so everyone can read it over the weekend . <p> I 'm hesitant to give a firm number for how many weeks it should take to write a script . Every project is different . Big Fish took me the better part of four months , while Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three weeks was because that 's all the time there was . There was already a release date , and sets were being built . <p> And that points to the better question to ask : How quickly should a professional screenwriter be able to turn around a script , given some urgency ? In my experience , the most successful screenwriters are the ones who are able to accurately estimate how much time theyll need . Thats part of the craft , just like a cabinetmaker promising a delivery date . For my work on Iron Man , I told them exactly how many days it would take to address certain issues , and delivered pages every night . <p> For feature films , I 'd be reluctant to hire a writer who could n't deliver a script in eight weeks .

After all , you 're not allowed to put anything in a script that ca n't be seen or heard , right ? How is the audience supposed to know this information ? <p> Tarantinos cheating . Most good screenwriters cheat a little , particularly when introducing a character . Keep in mind that an audience watching the movie has the benefit of seeing the actor playing the role , and all the specifics that come with a flesh-and-blood person . Since the screenwriter has mere words , its generally okay to throw an unfilmable sentence or two at a particularly important moment . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of a key character . <p> So here are some guidelines to get you started . <h> 1 . Show and tell <p> The best character introductions tend to include both a sense of what you see ( the characters physical appearance ) and an intriguing tidbit about their personality and/or situation . That 's certainly the case with both Burke and Lance . <p> You do n't  have to give an age range , but its common . You do n't  have to say the character is good-looking , but if its your hero , that 's not a bad idea . While many actors want to play " ordinary people , " they prefer playing " quirkily good-looking " ordinary people . 2 <p> In other cases , the appearance of a character is n't as much of a concern . In my script for the never-made Fantasy Island , I needed to include the mother and father of a teenage boy . Obviously , they had to be old enough to have a teenager , but beyond that , what they looked like wasnt particularly important : <p> Jeremys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygienist named MINDIE . Jeremys MOTHER is two valiums and three stiff drinks into the afternoon . Shes trying to figure out how to work the disposable camera . <p> Look for details that have an iceberg quality : only a little bit sticks above the surface , but it represents a huge mass of character information the reader can fill in . The " ie " ending on Mindies name suggests booby vapidity , and given that she only has one line , that 's really all the setup she needs . <h> 2 . Pick the right scene <p> For major characters , you 'll often be able to structure a scene so that it showcases a characters introduction . For Go , we hear about Todd Gaines before we meet him : <p> RONNA <p> I do n't  need Simon .

No matter how **26;0;TOOLONG , unless the scene has a valid story purpose , it will likely never make it into the film . Have clever writers sometimes included big character intro scenes simply to land a specific actor , knowing full well that these scenes would never make it into the movie ? Probably .

( My iPhone does n't  have room to save them all . ) <p> Instead of ads which most podcast listeners will fwd through , consider doing PBS drives for donations two months out of the year . I 'm sure its a drag so instead of haggling listeners for money have 30 second spots from Aline , Malcolm and others guests as well as longtime listeners . You have lots of fans who are working writers and at least one Nicholls fellow who attended " Scriptnotes university . " Every fan of your show can offer an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more convincing coming from others too . <p> I understand you guys frequently do 3 page challenges that give the up-and-coming writer a chance to receive critiques and advice . You also take q &amp; a from these same writers . I think it would be amazing if you were to have one of these up-and-coming writers on your show ! Maybe even more often than not . Just like you would have a working screenwriter on your show , I would love to hear from a writer in the same boat as me . Someone who works 9-5 in retail/waiter , writes at night , and fine tuning his discipline and methods . I would love to hear a conversation between you guys and and these kinds of individuals , just as much as I look forward to your discussions with currently working screenwriters . <p> Best , Danny <h> Rodrigo Hermann <p> Congrats on the show , I follow you guys since before a hundred and it is always great . I 'm no screenwriter so things that interest me the most are when you dive deep into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character development , themes , etc . When it comes to the business side of things like guild and elections I usually spaced out . <p> Also , if sues are " stupid " and never go anywhere , why spend time with them ? Your weekly hour is precious , make the most of it . <h> Mark Hammer <p> Is there a way to just sell the special episodes for a dollar each ? Or a digital bundle of just the special episodes for a one time fee ? I do n't  like automatic subscriptions because I have so many streaming ones and I worry about losing track of them . <h> Joe <p> Love the show ! Ive been listening nearly since the beginning . Its my favorite thing about Tuesdays ( not that there 's a lot to like about Tuesdays in general ) . I happen to love the Scriptnotes app . I listen to old episodes all the time and decided to listen to the new episodes there as well despite still using the podcast app for the other shows I listen to . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed . I hope this does n't  go away because I 'm really happy with it . I 've probably listened to the Raiders episode like for or five times . <h> Steve <p> I answered I would n't buy a USB drive , but that 's just because I live halfway around the world . I probably would if I lived in th US . I do n't  know if you ship internationally or not , but I would n't pay for shipping and I 've had stuff lost in the mail before , so its just not practical for me . <h> Ben Goddard <p> I like my coffee how I like my screenwriting podcasts : focused on the writing and storytelling . Wait , what ? <p> But for realsies : I love the show . I 'd like to hear more episodes " okay , I 'll be honest ALL episodes " to be focused on The CraftG . I love when you talk about methods of approaching a type of scene , how to handle specific events with characters on the page , and recommended script reading for genres or styles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Highland . I 'm a beta tester for Highland 2 ( loving it ) and a part time coder ( Bash , mostly ) plus I love hearing how these things come together . <h> Shannon <p> I find your podcast to be refreshingly intelligent . Look forward to spending an hour with you guys every Tuesday . I love the three page challenge and the episodes about craft . Thank you for doing this . Great work guys . <h> Andy <p> Great show . I like the variety ; sometimes you have three-page challenges ; sometimes listener questions ; sometimes a wild card . I would n't change anything but I do like the episodes where you talk to a guest . It always adds a third perspective to whatever you 're discussing . <h> Ken <p> Something messed up so I could n't see what options were available for any question ( thanks a lot Stuart ) so I had to make up my own <p> How do you listen to Scriptnotes ? ( choose as many as apply ) On my bike ( with classic ipod ) At my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 friends who worship me read transcripts aloud while I close my eyes and think <p> Do you subscribe to the premium feed ( which costs $2/month ) ? No , because the exchange rate is just so awful right now ( thanks Stuart ) <p> If we made more Scriptnotes USB drives with all 250 regular episodes , transcripts and bonus episodes , would you buy one for $20 ? No because I already have one with 200 on them <p> Do you think listeners should contribute ideas/segments for the show ? <p> Yes , that 's a great idea . <p> Keep it ALL up . If the listeners are anything like me , you guys feel like a couple of real-life friends with ever-ready shoulders for us to lean oneven if you only exist in our ears . <h> John Miller <h> Timothy <p> I had some problems seeing the poll answers on Chrome , Firefox , and Internet Explorer on my Windows 10 machine . Once I signed up for the mailing list , the answer buttons appeared . Excellent , marketing " strategery " . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-screenwriter . I 'm an actress and I love learning as much as possible about every aspect of film/tv . I have to say that this is my favorite podcast , of all time , and I listen to a LOT of podcasts . I do n't  have a computer , which I imagine most screen writers do , so usb is no good for me . I also only have an iPhone and tried to subscribe to the past episodes with the script notes app and could n't figure it out at all . I 'm not very technologically savvy . I would really love to have a way to listen to back episodes . Could they be uploaded to Vimeo ? Maybe sell the password for a fee ? <h> Conor <p> Big fan of the podcast for a long time now . I usually download episodes ( as mp3 ) directly from johnaugust.com and listen to them later on an old Sandisk player . <p> I have the 200 episode USB drive , so I probably wo n't buy another one for just 50 extra episodes , especially since I DL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great , but I 'll probably wait until the 300 mark before dropping another $20 on a drive . <p> here 's an idea : you have quite a library of content now that could be repackaged into special episodes or collections that we might be willing to buy . For instance , a Three-page Challenge collection , maybe curated to illustrate different issues , or just the complete set . I 'd pay $4.99 for that . <p> Clip shows on specific topics could also be cool . Like an episode with all your best stuff on rewriting , or agents , or womens reproductive health . Youve got a lot of guest interviews as well . I can imagine people paying $1 or $2 for best-of episodes on topics they 're really into . <p> Speaking of rewriting , has any Three-page Challenger ever taken your feedback and resubmitted their revised three pages ? That would be cool to see . I guess I 'll have to sift through the back episodes and see if its been done before . Keep up the great work ! <h> Steven <p> I would recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 101-200 ) that way listeners are n't  always getting duplicate episodes with each new flash drive . I do n't  know how feasible this would be with mass production but I would be more inclined to buy the USB in the future . And thanks for everything you guys do ! Its such a joy to hear your voices every Tuesday . <h> Craig McDiarmid <p> I just recently signed up for premium and havent had any issues so far . It would be good if bonus episodes could be filtered in the app though . <p> I bought the first 100 USB but do n't  really see a reason to get it again , especially with the premium feed . <p> The problem with the USB is that I now have all these files on my computer that I need to transfer to my phone should I want to listen . The app works better in that I can just stream it whenever and wherever I want . <h> TK <p> I use the podcast app on my phone for latest episodes but I have to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scriptnotes app really unattractive and I do n't  like using it but it does all it needs to do . I 'm not likely to buy a USB because not only am I shallow , I 'm lazy . I 've had no issues with the subscription payments . I would keep my subscription even if I bought a USB . Great podcast . <p> I answered " no " to your third question , but only because I already bought the USB drive with the first 200 episodes . So I would buy another one at , say , episode 300 . I do want to support the show in some monetary way . <p> Keep up the great work ! <h> Jason Reed <p> I love the USBs so I can load up my iPod and listen while I ride to work . However , it was a little frustrating to have purchased the first 100 shows , only to then be able to buy the first 200 , now 250 for the same price . It makes me more inclined to wait until maybe 300 episodes to purchase one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm also a premium subscriber so I can access all of the bonus episodes . I do n't  have any issues with the app or payment , but I do prefer listening through the podcasts app in my phone . <p> Love the show and think you both provide an invaluable &amp; entertaining service . <h> Brynnwood <p> I have devoured almost all of the episodes on the Scriptnotes app ! I 'm really glad to have that option . Unfortunately , I like to listen at home as well as on my phone . The Libsyn interface is very unwieldy on the computer . Because it requires you to log in over and over again , for instance after you 've paused playback for a few minutes , its very hard to keep your place not only within an episode but within the list of episodes . A drive would be a great way to avoid this and to search the episodes with specific topics in mind . <p> I love the podcast and have learned so much that helps me as a screenwriting student ! Thanks for putting the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I subscribe and have no complaints paying through Libsyn , but also would n't mind a 1 time $20 , or so . I would buy a USB for easy access and to share with friends , but would like to make sure I get access to future premium episodes too . One thing about the app and site it takes a while to scroll to the bottom if I want to go back to an early episode . Also , there 's not a quick way to identify just the premium epps . <p> Those complaints are very small in comparison to all the great info and humor in each show . I love all the discussions with other writers as well as the three page challenges and Craigs umbrage . <p> THANKS SO MUCH ! <h> Larry <p> I have been a subscriber off and on several times . Currently I am a subscriber . Since I first subscribed , the only reason I have been an intermittent subscriber is that intermittently there have been annoying billing problems that automatically terminated my subscription . I wish there were a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> BD <p> Love the show and find it pretty easy to download and listen in the couple of ways that I do ie download from JohnAugust.com or through iTunes . My only issue is not knowing when there is new content in the premium feed , since I do n't  listen through the app . I usually only know when John mentions something on the show or I remember to look at Scriptnotes.net <p> Not sure if I 'm missing an easy and more obvious way to keep track of premium content . <p> I 've also been listening just about forever ( on http : //www.johnaugust.com ) . Up till some point last year , I had n't  missed an episode . Then I missed quite a few , so I subscribed to the premium feed to catch up which I then did n't  have time to do . But I will ! <p> I seem to remember that the thing that put me off buying the USB drive was the cost of shipping to the UK , especially when compared to the cost of shipping the tee-shirts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that correctly ! ) both of which I have . <h> Allison Moon <p> I purchased the USB last go-round with the 200 episodes , because I just discovered the podcast last summer . I loved being able to mainline them regardless of my proximity to iTunes ( I have an Android ) . That 's the only reason I would n't buy the new USB . <p> I 'd be open to subscribing once Ive caught up , but I 'm not likely to buy a new USB . I would , however , buy episode downloads in chunks of 100 or 50 , plus bonuses etc for a one-time fee each time . <p> I am a subscriber to the premium feed but I 've finally caught up and listened to all the shows . Right now , I do n't  think there are enough added extras to keep me subscribing , so Ill probably discontinue . That said , once I unsubscribe , I 'd probably be interested in the thumb drive archive , so I could relisten if I chose to . <h> John Hex Carter <p> Piggybacking on some suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could look into Patreon ( http : //patreon.com ) for those of us that support the podcast but have no real need/desire to look at the back catalog . <h> William McLaren <p> Making a package of all the special episodes would be great . Comedy Bang Bang do the same thing . Or just make a the USB back-catalogue available digitally . I 'd pay $20 for the ability to download all the files . <h> John <p> I love your podcast and listen to new episodes plus a couple back episodes every week . Even after I 'm caught up I 'll still subscribe because you and Craig are such a great source of advice and information . <h> Paul Rose Jr <p> Havent signed up , yet . That should have also been an option . I intend to , but have n't gotten around to it yet . Not going to buy the USB cause I already bought one and do n't  need a second . I wonder if you guys should/would consider selling some of the USBs through the Writers Store in Burbank . I know they 're huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to stop by and pick it up instead of paying $6 for shipping across town . Just a thought . <p> Assemble the three page challenges in a convenient package : transcript portions , audio , and of course the three pages . Sell this as an additional USB drive , or if you 're ambitious assemble it into an ebook . <h> Sunfish <p> I REALLY appreciate that you do n't  have ads : thank you for that and I hope you 're able to keep it up ! <p> I am totally into the idea of supporting you by buying a t-shirt but to be honest I just did n't  like the color choices last time so next time I might buy one ! <p> Also you might consider adding a " tip jar " to the website so people can donate any amount they want to after listening to a podcast , reading the transcript , or downloading the three-page challenges ( The Toast does this : I 'm not sure how much revenue it generates but it seems like a good idea ) . <h> Marcus Enochsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , and then getting access to back- and bonus episodes is something I would definitely do , rather than a monthly subscription . I prefer one-time payments . Anyway , I want to support the podcast ! <p> Ive been a huge fan of the show since it began , but lately I have n't been able to listen to a single full episode simply because Craig has become so goddamn obnoxious . I cant even make it through the opening monologue anymore . I know that at this point he s pretty much just playing the " character " of " obnoxious Craig " but sincerely I wish something could be done about this . Not holding my breath <h> BB <p> I am a longtime subscriber of the premium feed and would be super bummed if it was no longer an option . <p> I listen to scriptnotes everyday on my commute and the premium feed allows me a convenient way to listen through the back catalogue , while staying up to date with the current episodes . <p> I realize , at this point , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the first 250 episodes , but I am perfectly happy paying the $2 a month out of convenience and in support of the show . <p> I like Allisons idea of the download chunks . I would find them more valuable than the USB drive , since I easily misplace small physical objects . But I love the premium feed as it now is ( except for the cranky app itself ) , and caught up on the entire series after coming in at about episode 150 and doubling back . <h> Aaron <p> Re : premium feed , I answered that I do n't  subscribe but I did . I only canceled ( recently ) because my familys financial situation has become so tight right now that every $1.99 counts . I 'm not complaining about the price its fair and under $25/year is a great value . That said , the app while having gotten somewhat better over time is pretty horrible , and I do n't  enjoy using it , but that is the way I listened to old episodes the most . I also agree ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method would be preferable to the monthly charge , especially at a slight discount , but even if its was just the same $23.88 . ( I assume that 's more a LibSyn decision than yours ? ) The main things I miss from not subscribing are the bonus episodes , and I do plan to resubscribe , hopefully in the not-too-distant future . <p> I 'd also love to hear more three page challenges as well as the occasional ( maybe once or twice a year ? ) look at a full script ( and chat with the screenwriter ) that started as a three-page-challenge , like you did some months back . I know that 's a lot more work for you two so it couldnt be a frequent feature , but it was great to actually see where those three pages went and to hear your reactions/feedback to it . <p> Love the podcast overall . Its one of a few that I listen to weekly , without fail , if at all possible on the Tuesday you release it . <h> Chris <p> I 'd totally be open to donating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years . <p> Also , it might be a good idea to suggest that people buy the drive with the episodes as a gift for anyone considering dropping thousands of dollars on a graduate degree in screenwriting . The drive is a way cheaper option and theyll probably get more out of it . <p> Ive been a premium subscriber for awhile and I have n't had much trouble with the app . It functions fine and is well worth the $1.99 a month . Even when the app does mess up , all it takes is to delete the episode experiencing the problem and re-download it . That 's the only trouble Ive ever had and its fixed with an IT Crowd-style turn it off and on again quick fix . It works fine . <p> Thanks for all the great writing advice and hilarious asides . <h> Peter Spencer <p> The reason I would not buy the USB is that I have been with the show from the beginning . If I were a new listener I think I would buy it . I am more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and I have donated to a number of podcasts because I do believe in giving something in return . I do have certain favourite episodes I return to . <h> Lawrence <p> I 've listened to the podcast from the beginning and truth be told I probably re-listen to an episode at least 4 out of the 7 days in a week . And usually I listen to multiple episodes for up to 3-4 hours in any given day depending on what I 'm doing . Love you guys great podcast <p> Fiction writer here . I am a loyal premium subscriber ; Scriptnotes is the only podcast for me . <p> In theory , the USB drive is brilliant . In practice , it would not work for me . I would either a ) immediately lose it or b ) never get my act together to transfer it to a device where I could actually access it . <p> Then I would be irrationally angry at you guys . <p> I like the app , because it goes where I go , so if I 'm stuck somewhere stupid like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches I can listen to the soothing stylings of John &amp; Craig . <p> Also , thank you for all you do . <h> Laddie Ervin <p> I subscribe not just to get access to the back catalog and the special episodes , but to support your the podcast financially . I purchased the last USB stick for the same reason . If you set up a tip jar , I 'd use that too . I 'm not awash in cash but I do greatly value your efforts and information and It makes me happy when I contribute to the cause . <h> Erika <p> I 'm a premium subscriber . Ive been listening since the beginning of the show , but its been great when I 've missed a few episodes , and some of the bonus episodes and interviews have been truly amazing . <p> I would be very , VERY bummed if you started running pre-recorded ads within the podcast . I listen to a few things on Gimlet and Earwolf and I think they do a decent job with the style/content of their ads , but they 're still extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones ( seriously , how many Squarespace ads can one human being listen to in her lifetime ? ? ! ) . <p> If you are forced to introduce ads , I would hope that premium subscribers would not be subjected to them . I would happily continue to pay for my subscription forever if it meant no ads . <p> Maybe if you advertised products during " One Cool Thing , " as long as you announced that its a sponsor , and they were things you guys truly think are cool , that would be a happy sponsorship compromise . <h> T. <p> I love this podcast . I do n't  buy a lot online because Im paranoid . But I do buy from iTunes , and would be most inclined to pay for or donate to the podcast through them . Like some others , I do n't  need the merch. so much , because I listen to all the podcasts , but I would feel good about donating or buying a subscription . <p> Please just seed all the episodes as a torrent . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Linux distros and LibreOffice etc . Torrents are n't  piracy . You have the content . You want to give it away and help people . Seed the torrents . <p> ( 1 ) I am in favor of an option where once a year , or periodically , where listeners can just click a button and donate an amount to the podcast. so quick , so easy , so worth it . ( 2 ) I also think a " day sponsor " model like NPR would be nice , where up to three or so individuals could sponsor an episode at $200 an episodewould only add about 10 to 15 seconds to the episode if you did it NPR style . it would be a happy , upbeat way to start a show . ( 3 ) sell a HUGE ORANGE SCRIPTNOTES LUGGAGE tag , or give one to listeners that donate a certain amount , because that bright orange logo would be a big help in spotting a suitcase in baggage claim . ( 4 ) make a top ten Ted tweets t-shirt , and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sell those hot potatoes for 35 bucks a shirt . I would like to place my order now . then its kind of like ted is personally supporting the podcast . <h> Anonymous <p> I really love the show . I think many of your listeners are newer screenwriters and for this reason the craft sessions are particularly helpful . Would love to see more focus on this area . The business tips are wonderful , but if craft has n't  been mastered particularly with new writers much of the business side may be moot . Just a thought . Thank you for everything you do ! <h> Alston <p> Short-time listener here , so not sure what 's already been attempted in terms of funding , but I 'm always a big fan of Patreon for monthly donations , especially as I already have an account . I 'm not a fan of downloading a separate app to my phone to access episodes as I have an Android and am constantly fighting for app space on my hard drive . <p> That said , as I catch up on the back-catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to find a way to donate for the old episodes either via the USB or monthly donation both to simply listen to the amazing content as well as to support your future episodes . My ultimate listener goal is to both help you financially and find an easy way to listen to all your episodes . <h> Mahamed <p> First of all thank you for the extremely valuable content you provide . I feel the main issue that the podcast is facing , is whether or not to charge for previous episodes . As someone who has finally realised that screenwriting , would be something that would make me happy to do in this life . It would be nice to listen to earlier episodes to learn more about the craft . But I can understand why you charge , because you are supporting peoples living . Therefore , I think great models to follow are the moment by Brian Koppelman and the Joe Rogan experience . I use Brians podcast as a example because it has a similar tone to scriptnotes , and I use The Rogan experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples are very different , but both use advertisement as forms of income while both allowing the show to be free . I hope this help and all the best . <h> Mj <h> Mark Stalnaker <p> I bought both the 100-episode and 200-episode drives . I do n't  revisit episodes all that often , but I like having them available when I want to refer to them . If I were to buy the proposed 250-episode drive , I would give the 200 drive to a screenwriter friend like I did the 100 . <h> Anonymous <p> Firstly , thank you for an awesome podcast ! I do n't  live in the screenwriting world at all I 'm an author , and I listen to the podcast for your fantastic insights on storytelling and craft , and because its so interesting to learn about the industry . I know a lot of published novelists who listen for the same reason . <p> I 'm a subscriber , but to be honest its not because I particularly want the premium content its that I value your work and I want to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year donation drive would be easier for me , if that was on offer . <p> I did n't  buy the USBs when they were on offer because of the cost of shipping to Australia , but shipping me damned I would wear the hell out of a scoop-necked Scriptnotes t-shirt for women if you produce one . <p> Firstly , thank you for an awesome podcast !

With some favorites , I 'll go back and listen to get a certain idea in my head , or just for reference . I do n't  want to keep having to buy new USB drives every 50 episodes in order to have them all at my disposal . Also , the thought of having to keep certain batches of them on my phone instead of having access to all of them at once is a headache . I guess I could start saving them from iTunes as they come out but <p> Really , this comes down to me not wanting to plug my phone into my computer . I ca n't be bothered . <h> James McConnell <p> I echo Conors comments . I have listened to the podcast from the very beginning so would n't get much out of buying the back catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes that have been packaged together by topic . You could provide an episode each on : <p> 3 page challenges <p> The craft of screenwriting <p> The business of screenwriting <p> Movie analysis ( Raiders , Groundhog Day ) <p> One Cool Thing <p> I would be more than willing to pay for those episodes as they could form a reference library that I could continually use . I also try and support the podcast by buying t-shirts and have also picked up a couple of Writer Emergency Packs . <p> I love the podcast and cant thank both John and Craig enough for donating their time over the years . I hope it continues for the years to come <h> Dat Lawthing <p> I said maybe when queried about purchasing the USB . Normally , I find the transcript to be more helpful than listening . Just how I learn , do n't  judge me . I will give you guys a shoutout when I make the Blacklist , win Nicholl and collect my best original screenplay Oscar . I could also donate . <p> hey guys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for me , because I can just use my " Podcast " app on my phone to listen to all my podcasts . I am not currently a premium subscriber but I 'd sign up in a heartbeat if I could become a premium subscriber via iTunes . Also , I 'm a Canadian listener and really want to buy the USB drive with the back episodes . However , the shipping fee is a bit too expensive for me , sadly . It would be amazing if you 'd be able to offer a digital download of your back episodes for a fee . Hope this helps ! Thanks so much for the great podcast ! <h> Mimi <p> I subscribe to the Premium feed and think its awesome value for money . I have an undergraduate degree AND a masters degree from one of the top universities in the world for creative writing but I 've learnt more about story and narrative from your revelatory show in a few months than from years of academic study . <p> I listen on the Scriptnotes app as well as using the iPhone podcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes ! I would n't buy the drive because I find shipping from the US to the UK a hassle in general will it make it , how long will it take , will there be customs charges and so forth . <p> Your work is fantastic ! I love the premium feed , however I dislike the Scriptnotes app , and so I end up listening to new shows in my podcast app and then jumping to the scriptnotes app for the " extras " and back episodes . <p> Thanks ! <h> Tim <p> I buy a t-shirt every year and would happily pay a little extra for them to further subsidise the podcast . I would n't buy a USB as I do n't  think I 'd ever have the time to go back and listen to the episodes again . <p> I am a listener from Spain . I havent had a job in almost three years and so I 'm glad you offer the possibility of free listening to the podcast in your website because I 'm unable to pay anything beyond my rent and food and I consider this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or just writers ) . Of course I write in spanish for spanish market , which its very different than writing for english market both in format and even structure ( we usually work with more literature-like scripts with no camera angles nor visual notes ) but I 've always wanted to move to english markets and your podcast maintain that dream in the realm of future possibilities . Ill be pleased to buy the USB libraries if I had the chance or to support the podcast in any other way but economic crisis had made things here really difficult and nowadays I just cant afford it . The same works for Premium subscriptions . Despite that , I 'm glad that you continue to offer the shows in the web because I am a hardcore fan of Scriptnotes . I think that maybe would be interesting to make a show about screenwriting in different languages or markets than american . Now , companies such as Netflix or HBO are starting to arrive in spanish market ( I mean Europe , of course ) and I found maybe this traditional outdated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of american market , so I think its interesting to already have an ongoing tool to show us how this would work . Keep on with your great work and thank you very much for everything . Gracias ! <p> Ive been listening since just prior to 200 . I bought the 200 episode USB . I do n't  need the premium feed . I can save the ones I 'd like with the podcast app . I 'd be happy to donate something annually without getting a tote bag or T shirt in return . Love the show . Never miss an episode . <h> ko <p> When I first discovered your podcast , I subscribed to the premium feed so I could listen to all the episodes . Once , I caught up with episodes , I stopped with premium feed . I also bought the last USB with all 200 episodes . I think it might be helpful if you sold USB drives in 50 episode batches and maybe every 100 episodes .

Anyway , thanks for all the hours of talking and effort you guys put in . Its truly the most helpful thing in screenwriting . Really great . Please keep it up for years to come .

Subscribing even when I do n't  use it all the time is my way to continue supporting you guys . <p> ( I 'm also a screenwriting teacher , so I make my students listen sometimes . ) <p> I 'd suggest putting together a paid downloadable archive . I 'm pretty sure there are services out there that allow this Squarespace and Shopify do , I believe . You could even have small , medium and large all eps , from 0-100 , or something similar .

@@42311438 @2311438/ <p> John August : Hey , this is John . So , on April 16 , 2016 , I had the great pleasure of sitting down with Aline Brosh McKenna and Rachel Bloom to talk about their amazing show , Crazy Ex-Girlfriend . This was all part of the Writers Guild Foundation Craft Day 2016 . It was a full day session . So , I did this panel in the morning with Aline and Rachel . Later in the afternoon I did the panel with Lawrence Kasdan and me and Craig . They were both great . <p> This one was wonderful for reasons I did n't  expect , partly because it was filthy . And so this is also my parental advisory warning . If you are in the car with your kids , its not appropriate probably , because specific things are discussed which are probably not things you want your kids to be hearing . But , its just great , and so we had a fun time talking about the show and really focusing on character introductions , which is how do you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be looking for . And I thought the pilot for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was incredibly useful on that front . <p> So , enjoy . And well be back next week with a normal episode . Thanks . <p> Start of live show <p> Hello and welcome . I 'm required to say hello and welcome whenever I greet a crowd here . So , in addition to being a screenwriter , I 'm also host of a podcast called Scriptnotes . Thank you . Some people are listening to Scriptnotes . And Craig Mazin and I each week talk about the craft and business of screenwriting . And I think our very first guest ever on the show was Aline Brosh McKenna who is going to be joining us up here in a second . <p> Aline is fantastic . And Aline tells you exactly how things are supposed to be and what to do and what not to do . She gives us fashion tips , which I do n't  ever take . Not this last Christmas , but the Christmas before she came to our holiday special and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star of the TV show that theyve created together . Her name was Rachel Bloom and she sang a song to the Scriptnotes thing called When Will I Be Famous . And the answer to that question was 2015 when her TV show debuted and was phenomenal and everyone loved it . And then she won the Golden Globe . <p> So , we are so excited to welcome as our first guests today Aline Brosh McKenna and Rachel Bloom , creators of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend . <p> Aline Brosh McKenna : Hi everybody . Good morning . <p> Rachel Bloom : Good morning . <p> John : Good morning . So , I 'm obsessed with your show . And I think anyone who listens to the podcast knows that I 'm obsessed with your show . I have seen every episode . I 've seen some episodes multiple times . I saw the version back when it was a Showtime show and then I saw the CW show . So we can talk about all that stuff . <p> But because this is Craft Day , I thought we might really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to talk with you guys about how you introduce a character . Because we can look through how you guys introduced characters in the pilot , how you introduce characters later along the way . If people want to read along at home , if you go to johnaugust.com/crazy , the scene pack that were going to talk through is in there . Its a PDF . So you can look through that . Also , in Weekend Read , you can see the whole script , which you guys were so generous to provide for us . The whole pilot script for what you shot . And we can talk through stuff . But , characters ? <p> Aline : Well , I can give you an example . We were trying to figure out the character of Gregs dad . And we kind of did n't  really know what to do with him and how to make him special and interesting . And it was kind of close in to when we needed him to work . It was actually we were in production already , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of get a beat on him . <p> And then Rachel and I met at Starbucks and we were like , " How do we do this ? " We knew we wanted him to be sort of a macho guy , and then I said maybe he was a chef . And then we went on this thing of maybe he had had a restaurant that closed . And then Rachel said so this is I think typical of our collaboration so I said , you know , maybe he s a chef and the restaurant closed and we can talk about West Covina , how like all the good restaurants have been replaced by chains . But it did n't  really give us any behavior . <p> Aline : Maybe he has two macaws . And it was like we started talking about , and that gave us a lot of stuff about him being like very stubborn and collecting birds , even though its like not great for his son . And then that led to him like we had always had him being somebody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being somebody who still smokes and drinks , despite having emphysema and heart problems . So , it was like it was a combination of really trying to find the purpose and the narrative , and then finding things that were quirky and special . <p> And Rachel in particular , in part I think because her background is in sketch , always approaches a character with putting some topspin on them so that there 's always something else going on that makes them kind of interesting and different and special . <p> Rachel : But , Aline , you do the same thing . Were right in the middle of writing season two right now and I feel like we have this great pattern where one of us will ask kind of a general question , and then the other will answer with a really unexpected specific . <p> I remember in the original Showtime pilot , and this ended up being in the CW , we were talking about what happens when Greg and Rebecca go on this date . And then out of nowhere you were like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ? " And I was like , what , no . And then but then it was like , okay , well what if she did that ? And that ended up being really like the thing that sets up their relationship . This idea of this hand job/make out interrogation scene where this idea of from the beginning it was always about this messed up sexual power . <p> Aline : And that she 's not afraid to use her sexual she does n't  even understand that that might not be okay . That she 's just like and in her mind , if you asked her , she 's just giving a guy a hand job . She does n't  realize she 's doing an interrogation . Which is something they should do by the way . I think it would be much more effective than waterboarding . <p> Rachel : I totally agree . <p> Aline : Because you could get anything out of a man . <p> Rachel : Oh yeah . Yeah . If you just threaten like , you wo n't get to cum , like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . <p> John : I saw the Showtime pilot . <p> Rachel : Saturday morning . You like my cum sounds . <p> Aline : This is what we do all day . <p> Rachel : All day . <p> Aline : This show is very much built in conversation . You know , Rachel and I spend , somebody said what are you doing to prepare for season two . I said , well what we always do , which is talking for hours , and hours , and hours . And we talk about stuff that 's not relevant to the show at all , like stuff with the characters and stories . We know things about these characters that is n't relevant and will never be relevant . <p> I always say its like when they go into a hoarders apartment and he s built like an entire universe out of like creatures he made from soda cans and , what do you call that fuzzy wire , pipe cleaners ? Thats sort of what we do is we build this world and then we populate it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollhouse . <p> Rachel : Yeah . I mean , that 's why writing with Aline always feels like we were just talking about this it feels like the most effortless part . The time just flies so quickly . Because its building a world made up of a bunch of really fun specifics . And I learned so much , because I come from more sketch , and animation , I kind of worked in more broad strokes . Okay , so what are the ideas we want to service , and then kind of like not working in stock characters , but like how do the characters service this premise . <p> And when we started creating the show , I mean , I 've learned so much about character specificity from Aline , but I remember like the first day it was like , okay , so its going to be a show about how love takes you over , so how is this girl a symbol . And you were like , " What 's her favorite color ? What 's her favorite meal ? What was her childhood like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an emotional specificity that I had n't  done before , and that 's how now we approach every character . And I learned that from you . You 're so smart . <p> Aline : Thats what we do . <p> Rachel : I love you so much . <p> John : So , Aline , I know you from things like Devil Wears Prada . Youre known for long features , where you 're setting up a character and taking them through this journey , a journey that happens exactly once , versus a TV show which is were seeing this character again and again , and all of these characters again and again . <p> Rachel , I first knew you from Robot Chicken . And so Robot Chicken , those are incredibly fast sketches where the first frame we have to understand what that character is supposed to be , and then getting to the joke as quickly as possible . So , what was this first conversation between you guys about who was this character ? Did it start with who is the Rebecca character , or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations like ? <p> Aline : They were kind of both , but I will say , you know , weve always felt like we were writing a 45-hour movie . That 's always how we 've approached it . I think the series that I love the most are the ones where you feel like the creators are in control of the whole story . Like when you 're watching Breaking Bad there 's no question in your mind that he knows where he s going . Mad Men . <p> I get tense when I watch TV shows where I feel like you know that every week they 're like makes noise of car screeching . And so we divided it into four chapters , and every chapter has an ending , and its building to an ultimate ending . And that 's the only way I could approach it . <p> John : Are these chapters seasons ? <p> Aline : Seasons . <p> John : So , when you guys were having this conversation , were you talking about how you were first going to meet her . What were the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do you remember the construction site ? <p> Aline : Yeah , I do . <p> Rachel : So , I think originally because when we first met it was going to be a network show . And we werent even sure if I would get to play it , because like who 's going to hire this over someone famous . And so we were like , okay , so we werent thinking as much of like me playing the character as much as the character . And originally the pilot started with this scene of there was a construction site . It was a going to be a helicopter shot of New York City . <p> Aline : Right . We were not really up to speed on budget . <p> Rachel : No. laughs A construction site and she walks onto the construction site in giant stiletto heels and says <p> Aline : Well , it was going to be a thing where there 's like a bunch of dudes on a construction site , and then this girl comes out with these heels and she kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened is she Instagrams a selfie of herself on this construction site , trying desperately to get everyone . So you sort of immediately contrast like shes very capable at work , but she 's a loser , has no friends , so she Instagrams a picture of herself with a helmet . And the guys behind her <p> Rachel : Yes . And she chews out the guys . She basically she calls them all mentally handicapped . And she makes one of them cry . And then she 's like , " Having fun on the job . " And like hashtag Work Times . And like no one and she keeps refreshing it and seeing if anyone likes it , and no one likes it . <p> Aline : Right . And then we very early on had this idea that she runs into this ex-boyfriend , and we spent just an inordinate amount of time figuring out if it was a high school boyfriend , or a college boyfriend . There was a whole long thing that led us to summer camp boyfriend , but there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the boyfriend and then we had her having a panic attack in the script , in the outline for a long time , in the script for a while she was cutting herself in the right now in the pilot shes taking those pills . She used to be cutting herself . <p> Rachel : You had the really crazy idea that she would and I kind of loved this she would take out a pack of cigarettes , and you think she was going to smoke , and then shed take out a needle or a razor blade and be cutting herself like below her nailbed . And this is when we were with Showtime . And they were like , " Wow . " laughs They were like , " Thats dark . " <p> John : Theyre like , " We had Dexter on the air . Like that 's dark . " <p> Aline : But you know what , that became our litmus test when we were pitching the show . We 'd pitch that , and that became our litmus test for should we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , its like cutting is super prevalent , guys . Lots and lots and lots and lots of women do this , particularly well , men do it , too . But its very prevalent behavior that you almost never see , especially not in a high-functioning person . And when we pitched it that became our litmus test to like people who blanched too much at that . <p> And then ultimately Showtime was excited about that kind of stuff . But we ended up peeling away from that just because in that moment we had gone to this thing of trying to explore her medication and how she was medicated , so that 's how it ended up being that way . <p> Rachel : And then I just want to say one more thing , that the show then , once we settled upon the idea that I was going to play the character and we were going to pitch it to smaller cable places , who would n't care as much that I was n't a name , that 's we basically wrote the pilot by improvising aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebecca more in the improvisation with Aline , the character changed . <p> John : But from the initial instinct , it was always that she was the highly functional dysfunctional hero of this story . <p> Aline : Yes . <p> John : And the idea that we would get access to her inner mind by songs , was that in the very initial conception ? <p> Aline : Always . <p> Rachel : Yes . <p> Aline : Always . And Rachel comes from a background of doing musicals , traditional musicals , and then also her music comedy videos . And so she knows way more than I do about when to have a song and how the song accesses emotions . And that 's all completely second nature to her . <p> And one thing that was interesting about working with someone who is a lot younger than me , and in certain areas was not as experienced , Rachel has like rock solid experience and convictions about the music , and the songs , and how they 're put together , and where they belong in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a lot on Scriptnotes , about expertise . Rachel is no matter where we were , how intimidating the situation was when were talking about the music and the songs , Rachel has such a firm point of view . She knows every musical . And knows the background of American musicals inside and out . <p> So , that 's where our background . And I 'm a newbie and a learner about that stuff . <p> John : Let 's take a look in the packet here . I 'm going to hand these out to you guys . <p> Rachel : I have n't seen this in a while . <p> John : Yeah . I know . <p> Rachel : Its really cool . <p> John : Its so weird with a TV show , like when do you ever go back to the script . <p> Aline : Yeah . Yeah . <p> John : You shoot a script and its dead to you . <p> Rachel : Last revision September 15 , 2015 . <p> John : And this was Golden Rod pages . This is <p> Aline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what you shot for the CW when you <p> Aline : This was our CW version , yeah . <p> John : I 'd love to start with this first scene here . So this is a first time you 're going to the new offices . So , essentially for people who are n't  familiar with the show , Rebecca has bumped into her camp boyfriend in <p> Aline : Oh , these are selected scenes . Yeah , okay . <p> John : These are selected scenes . Shes bumped into her camp boyfriend , Josh , who is now moving to West Covina . Shes like , " You know what , I hate my job here .

So , let 's talk about <p> Rachel : That was weird , because I was doing an we shot that scene in the original pilot , and then we reshot because we recast the role of Darryl . And when I reshot it , I was kind of doing an impression of myself in the original pilot , because I had watched it so much . And right now I was doing an impression of myself doing an impression of myself . <p> John : You 're a copy of a copy of a copy . <p> Rachel : Yeah . laughs <p> John : So good . So let 's talk about introducing Darryl and Paula . <p> Aline : Well this is interesting , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , Darryl went through a lot of evolutions . We wrote Darryl , he was kind of a stock character , I would say , like the dumbo boss . And we auditioned a million people , including Pete Gardner , but he did n't  get the part . Michael McDonald got the part . And the reason we hired Michael was that he brought this weird intensity to Darryl that we really loved . Darryl seemed like some really strange things had happened in his life . And we really liked that . <p> So , Michael is in the pilot . You saw Michael . And Michael brings a completely different thing than Pete does . Michael really brings this thing of like he hits on her a bit , and you cant get a beat on him , and you would sort of believe that he was secretly blackmailing everyone in the office . There 's something a little nefarious about him . <p> So , then when Michael so some of this dialogue is improvised by Michael McDonald in his audition and on set , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we incorporated . So these poor actors so then Pete came back with a bunch of other people to audition and had to read stuff that had been improvised by Michael . <p> Rachel : And Michael couldnt do it because he had other by the time we got ordered to series on CW , which was more episodes than Showtime , he has a ton of directing commitments . So it was n't like a bad <p> Aline : He was the in-house director for Mike &amp; Molly . And he was really sad , but it was more of a time commitment . So , we cast this wide net . We got a bunch of different people . And we found Pete . And Pete is a veteran most of our cast are veteran Broadway people . And Pete is a veteran-veteran improviser . I mean , anyone in Los Angeles who does improv knows Pete . <p> So , when he was improvising with Rachel , I remember during his audition they improvised a lot . And I remember Rachel said to me after the audition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could anywhere , take the scene anywhere . And then Pete has then kind of lovable goofiness . He s so sweet . And so he has brought a lot of his Pete-ness to the role . <p> So , that role I would say of all the roles evolved the most to kind of suit the actor . And I think one of the things that 's interesting when you 're writing something is particularly sometimes if you have a character who is maybe not as strongly conceived as some of the other ones , an actor can really bring something very special to it . And we have really our characters have flowed to the actors that we cast very frequently . <p> John : Thats the luxury of television is that you get to see who those people are and what their strengths are and play to their strengths . <p> So , let 's talk about how we first meet Darryl . So , from the very start , " I hope you do n't  mind , but I handed out copies of your resume . Were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney of your caliber here . " So right at the very start he s laying out exactly sort of like he s like the dog who is rolling over on its back and exposing his belly , saying , " Ooh , were so happy that you 're here . " And it puts him in a strange place . It also gives Rebecca a lot of power in the situation , which is an unusual dynamic for somebody to be coming into an office as <p> Aline : A beta boss . <p> John : Yeah . A beta boss is sort of a new thing . Then were getting into his Native American heritage , which well get into a little bit later on . He leads with the fact that he s divorced and that he s sort of flummoxed , that he s easily sort of overwhelmed . So its an interesting , exciting character . I noticed that there 's actually very little scene description here . Its mostly just a big run of dialogue . <p> Aline : Yeah . There 's probably more this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pilot draft , I 'm sure its filled with lovely crafted sentences . And then when you 're in production its like , " Who needs all that ? " <p> John : But you 're still trying to keep up Rebeccas story . So , Rebecca has moved here and shes trying to find does n't  want to make it seem strange that shes moved here . So she 's grabbing the brochures in place of business cards in case Josh sees her . Its like , " Oh , well this is going to be my excuse for why I moved here . And I really do have a job here . I 'm not just stalking you . " Even though she 's really just stalking him . <p> Rachel : Yeah , because there was a risk of this scene just being like kind of a typical sitcom , like meet the new boss at the new firm , and throughout it she 's checking her phone , checking her phone . We never wanted to drop the plot of the pilot . <p> Aline : And this is the big lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later episode , in episode nine , that this is a bunch of she then tells people that Darryl recruited her . And like a lot of liars , Rebecca does n't  bother to clean up her lies . Because the clean-up of the lie is often the thing that undoes the lie . So , she just lies and just thinks <p> John : She lies and walks away from it . <p> Aline : Hopes for the best , right . And this one comes back to bite her on the ass . She never tells Darryl that its a secret , because it would undermine her . But she basically just said , you know , once he got that resume . But , part of Darryl thinks , " Oh , I deserve this . I 'm wonderful . And this is one of the wonderful things I deserve . And I finally am getting something good . " <p> John : Yeah . Like he did The Secret , and he visualized this moment and now its come true . <p> Aline : Exactly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Aline : Darryl has multiple copies of The Secret , for sure . <p> Rachel : There was always this idea of Darryl putting on an identity because he did n't  know who he was . And so hence the one-eighth Chippewa thing . He s searching for who he is . And we 've dropped this a little with Petes particular portrayal , but this idea he thinks he s he s kind of falsely sophisticated . And so the idea that he would deserve a Harvard lawyer . <p> Originally I think Darryl had a little bit more hubris . And now Pete has brought this sweet , sad , humbleness to it , but we always knew , even though he was kind of stock , that there was a deep sadness to Darryl . We just did n't  always know what it was or what it was rooted in . <p> John : And so how early on this is a little spoiler for people who are n't  caught up on the show the idea that he is bisexual , or discovers he s bisexual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or was that just <p> Rachel : Yes . <p> John : Okay , you knew that . Wow . <p> Aline : We knew very early on . And it was partly because Darryls sort of like search for identity and the amount of upset that he had about his divorce , but he does n't  dislike his wife , he just feels really upset about the divorce and he really misses his daughter . <p> And we just started talking about like who would Darryl go out with and what would Darryls dating life be like and would he be interested in Rebecca . And that never really made sense to us . And also the thing about being bi is like its the only thing that I can think of that you work up an enormous amount of courage and you say to someone , " I 'm bisexual , " and they go , " No you 're not . You 're not . No . " <p> You know , I mean , if you tell someone you 're gay , a negative reaction might be they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , " No , you 're not . No . " And that seemed like a good predicament for Darryl , because Darryl is always trying to find an identity , and people are always saying , " I do n't  believe you . You 're not really that . " <p> And so what I love about where we went with that ultimately is that when he discovers he s bisexual , that 's the first thing in his life that has really rung true for him . Its really like , " That 's it . " And so that 's why he embraces it so fully . But we did know that here . But there were a lot of things in the show that because of the really detailed pipe cleaner art , that Rachel and I knew that we waited to reveal until I mean , we still have stuff that we have n't revealed , but we just waited a long time with Darryl for the right moment . We did n't  make it part of his shtick in other words . <p> John : Let 's talk about Paula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show overall , because she ends up being the confidant , the buddy , the cheerleader . Like you 're on the road to destruction and she 's the one who says , " No , go faster . Go faster . " <p> Aline : Totally . <p> John : Let 's talk about Paula here . Because when we first meet her , it seems like she 's going to be a stock villain . Shes going to be the stock person who is taking you down . If this is 9 to 5 , shed be the Roz character who is going to stop you . And what I love about how you set her up is from the start we see her cubicle decoration , even though were not going to really catch that in the pilot , its important for it to be there so we sort of inform the choices about her . <p> But she 's telling us about herself , which is really telling us more stuff about Rebecca . " You see this resume ? Harvard . Yale . Special skills : Mandarin . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's actually really competent , which was crucial . You 're setting up Mrs. Hernandez , a character who never speaks , and who 's sort of like <p> Rachel : And we know why that is by the way . And well <p> Aline : Well get there . <p> Rachel : Well get there . <p> John : Youll get there eventually . <p> Rachel : I just want to say we know why that is . Its not just a gag . <p> John : Not just a gag . All right . <p> Rachel : Put that out for all the haters . Because this audience is clearly full of haters . <p> John : But in her dialogue choices , you 're describing she 's getting a chance to say things that she actually knows about . And she 's obsessed with popular culture . Louboutins . She wants to be she aspires to be the person who gets to talk about these things , and yet she does n't  . So , when you were writing this character for the first time , did you have a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ? It was n't written for a person , but it was just a type ? <p> Aline : She was always an antagonist she 's the antagonist of the pilot . She does n't  get on board until the very end . Well , we cast the widest net we probably cast was for Paula . We saw every kind of I mean , we werent restricted . We were color blind in almost all our casting except for no , we were pretty color blind in most of our casting . <p> Rachel : Except for Josh , who was specifically Asian . <p> Aline : Except for Josh was always supposed to be Asian . So , here 's my tip for you . If you are looking for the deepest pool of talent in the world , its women between the ages of like 38 and 58 . I 'm telling you . <p> Rachel : Theyre unbelievable and they can all sing . <p> Aline : Literally people you do n't  know can sing , so here 's the thing . When we cast Greg , there 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing . And have been told they 're amazing . And we saw more bad auditions . Like guys were like kind of handsome and someone said you should be an actor . We saw millions of those . <p> Rachel : Okay , wait . I just want to clarify . I think the thing , and this is actually really good to know for any actors out there , the problem with a lot of the people we saw for Greg was because they had in their heads , okay , I 'm the like hot romantic lead , everything was really small . And everything the wine bar is over on and they 're basically falling asleep because someone had told them this is what naturalistic acting is . This is your role . You 're the romantic heartthrob lead . And that 's why <p> Aline : But its also a supply and demand thing . I mean , if you 're a handsome Caucasian gentleman , you know , 30 , plus or minus five , you 're on a TV show . You have your own TV show . They 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented I mean , literally , women would come in and crush the scene , and then you could click on their singing thing and it would be like , wow , that was a really good sing . And then they would sing and it would be like it was like that commercial , your hair would be blown back , by how good they sang . <p> We could have cast that part I mean , Donna is amazing , amazing , amazing , and stood out even in that group , but I 'm telling you , we saw women from all different backgrounds , in a 20 age range , and they were incredible . <p> John : Let 's talk about that age range , because its an interesting gap between the two of you . Because she 's not quite a mother figure , I mean , she 's old for being a friend , but she 's not quite a mother figure . Its a really fascinating gap that I do n't  see a lot in television . <p> Aline : Well , its not that different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there a degree to which the nature of that relationship was your relationship , or that gap ? <p> Rachel : Yes . I mean , I actually remember when I first pitched the character of Paula to you . Do you remember this ? And my thinking was I remember I was filming a web series in Westwood and I was eating lunch . And I was like Rebecca needs a best friend . <p> And I was like , well what 's like a best friend character we had n't  seen . And I 've been watching a lot of Frasier , which I always do . I love Frasier . And I was thinking about Niles is a more Frasiery Frasier than Frasier is . And I was like , oh , what 's Rebeccas Niles ? And then instantly I was like , oh , it would be someone who buys into all the shit that were trying to deconstruct with the show . Buying into romantic comedies and buying into like love , destiny , destiny . <p> And when I think of that , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glued to their phones and Twitter and Snapchat , arguably more than 13 year old , are like 50-year-old women . <p> Aline : So it was like Minivan Moms . It was right around that time of 50 Shades and it was like Minivan Moms who have 50 Shades , Twilight , and some good vibrator . A good vibrator stashed somewhere . That was kind of the genesis of it . <p> And I think there 's a the season finale is on Monday and Paula has <p> John : Which you directed . <p> Aline : Which I directed . <p> Rachel : Ah yeah . <p> Aline : Paula has a huge number in it . And I have been talking to Donna about like I think there 's this vesuvial rage in middle age ladies , because I always feel like there 's three genders . Theres men , women , and women over 40 . And its sort of like and luckily we have Jennifer Lopez working on it . But I feel like I just feel like there 's this age where women sort of disappear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smartest person in our office . And she 's just as sexy and sexual as Rebecca is , but the world is telling her to sit down and shut up . And she does n't  want to . <p> And so she does n't  know how to do what she decides to do ultimately is to live vicariously through her friend . <p> John : So , ultimately were going to find sort of Paulas backstory life . In the pilot she 's just sort of the foil for Rebecca , but were going to find out her unhappy family life and why shes so determined to act out . How much of that did you know going into this pilot about what her home life was going to be like and what her ? <p> Rachel : We knew a lot of it . I mean , I think that Paula is very much like a symbol of what happens to a dream deferred , right ? And , again , there 's still stuff we know I do n't  know , the stuff , once we started talking about Paula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the things , their dialectic , like Rebecca is sort of a person who makes terrible decisions and does things that are not great . But worries a tremendous amount about being a good person and seeming like a good person . And Paula could give a rats ass about that . Paula does not care about whether people think she 's a good person . She knows what she believes in and what she thinks are the things to do , and she 's very shes the Henry Kissinger of sexual politics . She is realpolitik above all . <p> And she thinks everybody in the world is out to get some , and get theirs , and that Rebecca should be doing that , too . <p> John : Well , also , Paula is a character who did n't  do all that stuff in her time . And so she made the safe choice every time and she 's regretted making those safe choices all those times . So she sees this character who will make wildly dumb choices all the time and is like , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very interesting choice . <p> Let 's jump ahead to page 14 , which is the final scene with Paula and Rebecca . This is happening at a house party . Rebecca has gone there to try to find Josh Chan , because there 's legend that Josh Chan is going to be coming to this party . So , in the Showtime pilot she 's just started to give Greg a hand job and that did n't  go well . In the CW pilot <p> Rachel : No , no , in the Showtime pilot , she 's actively blowing him . <p> John : Oh , that 's right . <p> Rachel : And crying on his dick . By the way , and then when I did ADR for it , I had to honest to god I got an unpeeled banana and I put in my mouth doing ADR . <p> Aline : The sound guys were so happy . <p> John : They did n't  have Foley they could go through for that ? Or have some sort of like sound effects library for that ? <p> Aline : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm like , do n't  worry about it . <p> Rachel : laughs Oh , there 's this great oh , the teamsters story . <p> Aline : Oh my god . <p> Rachel : Oh , there 's this great story about real quick . This has nothing to do with anything . So the original Showtime pilot , the whole , just picture the CW pilot , but the whole scene , instead of like about to give him a hand job , I 'm actively jerking him off . Like the whole conversation is like , " So what , this is a great party , this is a great party . " <p> And so were in the car on a location , were in the van on a location scout in West Covina . <p> Aline : Were in the van with a bunch of I mean , were with the line producer , and the department heads , and the teamsters driving . <p> Rachel : Yeah . And with our director , Marc . And I said to Marc , we were talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , hey , so should I spit into my hand ? And he was like <p> Aline : No ! <p> Rachel : He was like , " What are you talking about ? What do you mean spit into your hand ? " I was like , that 's how you give a hand job . And he was like , " No it is n't . " And we had a whole argument in the car <p> Aline : A whole argument . <p> Rachel : Of how to give a hand job . And we came to the conclusion that the way penises are , some people are like shaft tuggers , and other people no , no , no , some people are , what is it ? <p> Aline : Strokers and tuggers . <p> Rachel : Strokers and tuggers . Strokers and tuggers . Some people have excess skin where you do n't  needanyway . <p> Rachel : People have been sued for this . And we are saying it would have been the first time that an actress was sued by a teamster. laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit into my hand . Oh , no , you do n't  know that . I do n't  spit into my hand . <p> Aline : Were going to try and put it up one day , because its a funny <p> Rachel : Its a great scene . <p> Aline : Quite funny scene with the actual hand job . <p> Rachel : And the sound effect of slapping . I do n't  know where they got it . They would n't tell us . <p> John : All right . <p> Aline : The CW scene is <p> John : Its a wet Shammy . <p> Aline : amorous smooching . Its amorous smooching . <p> Rachel : And at one point I 'm like grabbing his nipples and stuff . I think I had my hand up his shirt . <p> Aline : Well , there was another thing , which was they finally start making out , and to do this scene , and our actor is so kind and respectful to Rachel that he s not touching her boobs . And I turned to Marc , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on a date with someone who looks like Rachel and the first thing they would do is get to the boobs . Like , you got to go tell him to touch her boobs . <p> Rachel : And I think you went up to Santino this is obviously the show . <p> Aline : No , no , I did n't  . I told Marc . I said you got to go tell Santino that he needs to <p> Rachel : Yeah , I think Marc was like , " Um , can youcan you touch hertouch her boobs ? " <p> Aline : For the realism of the scene . Anyway . <p> John : Page 14 . We are outside Beans house . here 's a question for you , because I do n't  honestly remember the pilot very well . So , Joshs friends and Gregs friends , are they all at this house ? Did we meet them there ? <p> Rachel : No . They are theoretically there . We just do n't  <p> John : We just do n't  see them there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn , night . Rebecca and Paula walk out onto the front lawn . I 'm sorry , we should say that Paula has tracked Rebecca down to this party . <p> Aline : By breaking into her computer . <p> John : Yes . And so that 's where we first learn that she is a hacker extraordinaire . <p> Aline : Yes . <p> John : Rebecca and Paula walk out onto the front lawn . <p> Aline : Is this far enough from the house ? <p> Rachel : What are you doing here ? <p> Aline : You think you are so much better than me . Harvard , Yale Im just as smart as you , Miss SnootyShoes <p> Rachel : What are you TALKING about ? <p> Aline : I 'm talking about Josh . Chan ? Joooooosh Chaaaaaaan ? <p> Rachel : What ? What do you know about Josh ? <p> Aline : Let 's see , well , I know he lives in town , which is weird because you told me you did n't  know anyone here . And clearly you know him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instagram , 18 times . <p> Rachel : Have you been going through my computer ? <p> Aline : Yes . Yes , I have . <p> Rachel : I could have you fired . <p> Aline : You lied to me <p> Rachel : Lied to you ? I did n't  lie to you ! No one shoved a bible under my hand when I met you in the office . <p> Rachel : In love with him ? That 's ridiculous . I barely know him . I dated him for a summer when I was 16 . Okay , what are you saying ? Let 's unpack it . You 're saying I uprooted my entire life , left behind a job that paid meoh , there 's a typo . Paid me thousand dollars ? I think $500,000 was it . Left behind a job that paid me $500,000 . That 's right . For some random boy I have n't seen in ten years who likes to skateboard and thinks " whatever " is two separate words ? That makes no sense . Look , its simple . <p> Aline : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in New York and I saw him and he made me feel all warm , like glitter was exploding inside me , and now I 'm here . But I did n't  move here FOR him because that would be crazy . And I 'm not crazy . Am I crazy ? Ohmygod . OhmyGod . Is that what I am ? <p> Aline : I 'd be proud to be your friend . Now that I know the truth ? What you did for love ? The sacrifices ? You 're brave . Wish I 'd been that brave at your age . Look , I get it , its a secret . I wont tell a soul . But I 'm here now . You 're not alone anymore . We are going to win this , you hear me ? We wont let what happened to Justin and Selena happen to you , I promise . <p> Rachel : You do n't  understand . It does n't  matter anymore . Josh has a girlfriend . Yeah , A GIRLFRIEND . Also , I texted him 46 hours ago and havent heard ANYTHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And not about me . <p> Aline : His Facebook status is SINGLE . If he was into her , would it say that ? <p> Rachel : Thats what I said ! <p> Aline : So maybe he does n't  realize his true feelings right now , but if we play this right , one day he will . One day its gon na hit him like a ton of bricks and when that happens , HE WILL TEXT . <p> John : At that exact moment , a miracle . A CHIME FROM REBECCAS PHONE . A TEXT MESSAGE . <p> Rachel : Are you a witch ? <p> John : AND NOW TIME SLOWS DOWN . Slowly , Rebecca picks up the phone . Reads . Flips it around to show Paula . <p> Aline : Wan na grab dinner ? Smiley face . <p> Rachel : IS THERE REALLY A SMILEY FACE ? ? ? <p> Aline : THERES A SMILEY FACE . <p> John : HOLY FUCKING SHIT . Rebecca and Paula are blown away . Rebecca begins to sing . A reprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no , you do n't  want to hear me sing . <p> John : So , and then we get to the song , my favorite of the song of the whole series . West Covina . California . <p> Rachel : Do you want to do Paulas part ? Do you know it ? <p> John : Yes , I do . But no . I do n't  have all the words here . So , this is the turning point . <p> Aline : Yeah . <p> John : And honestly , if it were not for this scene , she would probably go back to New York City , do n't  you think ? What 's your hunch about what would happen next to Rebecca Bunch if Paula had not shown up here ? <p> Aline : I think she would lock herself in her apartment for a week and go on a very deep dark dive . And then , yeah , and then just leave all her shit in the apartment , close the door , and take a flight back . <p> Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about that . But I think you 're right . <p> Rachel : We never talked about that . <p> Aline : Yeah . I think you 're right . But Paula is the fuel . Shes the person who tells her that this is okay . And what we love about it is its the mothering that Rebecca wants and needs , but its so wrong . Its not right . <p> John : Its the wrong mother . <p> Aline : Its the wrong advice . <p> Rachel : Its interesting reading the scene because , so this is the September so this is hybrid . This script right now , its a hybrid of the original scene we had and then improvs that we did when we actually filmed it , because this was the shooting script for when we redid some stuff for the CW pilot . But the Paula and Rebecca scene , we did n't  reshoot that . So , its interesting , like on page 15 , where its like " that would be crazy and I 'm not crazy . Am I crazy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvs that we then put back into the script so that the script reflects the shooting of what we shot . <p> Rachel : And originally we were going to it was I mean , obviously in the scene its even longer , because the way that we wrote , I realized that emotionally to get to Rebecca panicking , it actually has to be a longer <p> Aline : Ramp up . <p> Rachel : build up . Yeah . And so we use a lot of improv on set , but especially in really heartfelt emotional scenes , because it I do n't  know , sometimes when you 're on set you feel the trajectory of a scene in a way that you cant when its just on the page . <p> John : So , you 're a writer who is on set , and you are on set as well . So , when those moments happen , is it while you 're running through that you feel it first ? I 'm not going to be able to actually get to this moment and we need to stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aline : No , Rachel just does I mean , Rachel is the team leader , obviously , for the comportment of the actors , because she 's the EP and its her show . And so Rachel does n't  do the scenes the same way ever . She always does something a little bit different and she always adjusts the lines and she often adds improv . And its super effortless . I 've never seen her say I 'm doing this or think about it . Its just like what comes out of her . Like one of the lines here , where she says , " I like to you ? Nobody shoved a bible under my hand . " That was an improv . <p> And what 's great about it is its very much on script , but its also improv , if that makes any sense . Its always the intention of the scene , but its the sort of wonderful filigrees . And it really has freed up the other actors to do that . And we 've just gotten wonderful , wonderful moments . <p> But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dailies , they 're very live . There 's always , if we do n't  have something , I mean , I have the vantage point of looking at all of Rachels performances in the editing room , and what 's amazing is there are some actors where like they 're so consistent , and that 's great , because you have what you have . But Rachel does so much variety and gives us so much variety that we can often make big adjustments in the performance because what she does is so flexible . <p> Rachel : And the thing , I just want to add one thing , I think that 's the biggest thing I learned as an actor watching people audition for my show , it did n't  matter if they were loyal to the commas . It did n't  matter if they got all the beats and like these reversals . The only thing that mattered was do I buy it . Do I buy them saying these words ? And do I buy that these words are coming from their mouth ? And so that taught me a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is to feel like these words are coming out . <p> And its actually taught me a lot about being an actor because I co-wrote this pilot , I had an ownership over the words where it was like I it was an ownership over the words where like they were my words . And I 've realized that that is the way that I and all actors should approach every script , as if you wrote it , so that you have a real ownership of the material , and the emotions , and you 're not doing an impression of what you think the writers want , or what you think the directors want . <p> Aline : So you 're interpreting , yeah . <p> Rachel : Yeah . You 're interpreting and you 're changing . <p> John : Youre channeling . <p> Rachel : Youre channeling in a way that feels authentic to you . And that every actor on our show does that . <p> John : So , to wrap up the discussion of character introductions , people we have n't talked about here , Greg . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which becomes a standing set that you 're going to go back to a lot . What were the initial conversations about Greg and sort of what we need to know about him ? Did you know what his plot function was going to be , or was he just this friend of Joshs ? <p> Aline : I mean , he is the guy who really knows what 's up very quickly . That 's basically his role in the pilot , was like he s on to her very quickly . And he does n't  care . And that 's the thing about dudes , like , some of them really like actively like women who are crazy . And men will say , " I like them crazy . " And Greg sees through her bullshit immediately , but is wildly attracted to it . And the crazier she is , the more into it he is . And because it allows her to reject him , and that 's what he wants ultimately . <p> He s very comfortable in a space where he s being rejected . Because the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 're smart , and you 're not listening to me . So you 're obviously my type . " He knows right away that she does n't  really she 's so attracted to someone else 99% of the time , and so that was kind of the germ of his . But , again , because we saw so many people who read that scene so straight , that was the scene we were the most sick of in the auditions . <p> Rachel : Yeah . And I remember watching , because we cast a lot of our main cast out of New York . And so we were watching tapes . And I remember Santinos audition came up . And before even watching it I was like , oh great , another white guy . Wonderful . I was just tired of white guys . <p> Aline : And she called me and said , yeah , I mean , he really took he did n't  think he was going to get the part . He thought that we were going to cast some super uber beefcakey guy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a shit , and he came in and he did one audition on scene , and then he did one super riffy thing . And the riffy thing is what we used . <p> And then we had a funny thing . We sat down with Marc Webb when we were kind of down towards the end . And I hate to sell out Marc when I tell this story , but let 's just say Marc has insight into this character . And he gave us a couple of really great lines . I think the thing of like " you 're beautiful , and you 're smart , and you 're not paying attention to me " came from Marc . <p> Rachel : Well , that 's what happened . So we cast Santino , and part of the reason we cast him was he made these big choices with these lines . And he was actively like , " You from around here ? " He really made these big , bold choices that felt fresh and unique and brought another depth , brought another dimension to Gregs character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were doing a final pass before the table read , and Marc happened to come by your house to hang out . And I was like , " Marc , I feel like we need to add we need to add some sauce to this scene . " And Marc and I improvised together for like a couple minutes . And that 's where we got " Youre pretty , smart , and ignoring me . You 're obviously my type . Are you looking for an eight-year-old or an alcoholic ? Because that 's what we got here . " <p> Marc really brought this doting bitterness . <p> Aline : Doting bitterness . <p> Rachel : Doting bitterness . In just improvising with him . So , yeah . <p> John : So the quality of Greg , that he s like a grumpy old man who 's only 30 , that 's <p> Aline : That 's a combination of what the part was intended to be , what Santino brought to it , and that little germ of Marc that we got . But really no one is better at if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Hans from Frozen . And he s really good at conveying sort of an arched eyebrow . Always . <p> Rachel : He plays high status . That 's his thing is to play high status , which was interesting because ultimately his character for most of the show is low status in that he s on a leash by his dick when it comes to Rebecca , but does n't  like that he s on a leash by his dick . <p> Aline : So every line he s ever said to Rebecca in the entire series , the parenthetical under it would be " you 're an idiot . " But he loves her , but he s constantly telling her , " You 're an idiot , " which is how he shows love . <p> John : With future episodes , you talked a little bit about Rebeccas dad , but can you give me an example of another character who had to be introduced over the course of the series who we first meet over the course of an episode , how do you get a beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is supposed to be to casting so you get a sense of who that person is coming in ? <p> I 'm trying to think , over the course of the series , people you have introduced <p> Aline : So like we have Trent , we have a character of Trent . And Trent is this guy that Rebecca does n't  remember from college , but he remembers her really well , and he s very in love with her . And the germ of that came about because we were bringing in this person who was like he s Rebecca to Rebecca , and she thinks he s horrible and creepy . And she does n't  recognize her behavior in him . <p> And so he was very much one of the things is most of the characters were conceived by Rachel and I in the pilot process . And then a lot of the other characters were conceived as the writers room developed . And Trent , being super weird and awkward , and wearing turtlenecks that he tucks into his pants , like anybody who 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So writing Trent was something that everybody in the room got very excited about and pitched in a lot of stuff about . <p> And then so we had this very weird guy , and we actually did n't  have the scene ready for casting , so we wrote a scene before we even had it in the script , and we sent it out . And then this we saw a bunch of a people who were funny , and then we saw this guy Paul Welsh . Its the hardest I think the writers room saw me laugh the entire I wish we could put up his audition . I literally fell out of a chair . <p> Rachel : We can . <p> Aline : We should put it up . I laughed so hard . And he improvised things , like there was a line of like , " Do you want to watch a movie ? " And then he said , " Do you like Tarantino ? I do n't  . " And I will tell you that we have enough Trent material from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode 15 different ways , all of them hilarious . <p> John : It struck me as a crucial character , becomes he comes in in such a weird off angle . So , its a character who she 's found him on Facebook and claimed that he s the boyfriend , never having met him . And then suddenly he shows up . <p> Aline : Right . And he knows her and he s love in with her . And then there were other characters , like we always knew we had to do her mother . Her mother speaks in the pilot , but does n't  have a role . So we always knew that was coming down the pike . And then Tovah is a more traditional , she 's a Broadway actor , and she 's a singer , and so we wrote this really specific thing . And she had to be Jewish . And so we looked for an actress who really was Jewish and who brought that to the part . And she looks a shocking amount like Rachel . <p> So Trent is sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is a big deal . We spent a ton of time on that . That was a very important episode , because you see her incoming from the pilot , and if you 're a fan of the show and watching the show , you understand that Rebeccas mother is the Bundt cake in which she was formed . And so <p> John : Theres an Aline Brosh McKenna metaphor there . <p> Aline : There you go . <p> John : I was waiting for one . <p> Aline : There you go . So , it was really , that was a very important role . That was extremely important . <p> Rachel : But I just remembered , I mean I feel like , you 're talking about introducing a character , finding like what are the most important things of a character , it just its like getting more and more specific . And so its like , well , what 's that one line in the first draft , its like what 's that one line that says everything that you need to know about them . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get even more specific ideas . <p> And so then the dialogue will get even more specific . And with Tovah , there 's this final scene where she and Rebecca are yelling at each other in a mall , and Naomi Bunch says , " I want you to survive . Survival . Survival . " And that 's based on Tovah . Like that 's we had these scenes written , and then I had an hour long conversation with Tovah on the phone where she talks a lot about the history of the Jewish people , and the state sponsored Pogroms , you know , of the Russian government . And her whole thing is like that 's why Jewish mothers are the way they are . Its survival , survival , survival . <p> And we just wrote that in . Like what a great , she just kind of gave that to us . <p> Female Audience Member : Hi , so I 'm a really big fan of the show , and you mentioned that Josh was initially supposed to be Asian , but you did n't  know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jokes are insanely accurate . So I just wanted to know like <p> Aline : So he was written to be Josh Chan . <p> Rachel : No , Josh Chang . <p> Aline : Josh Chang . And we saw Asian dudes of every description . And we always knew that whatever nationality he actually turned out to be , we would adjust it for that . And so Vinnie is Filipino and we liked the contrast of the name , so instead of doing the more Spanish sounding name , we were looking for a so Chang does n't  exist in the Philippines , but Chan is a name that some Chinese descent Filipinos have . So we changed it to Chan . <p> And then we just wrote to Vinnie and we have an amazing writer on staff named Rene Gube who plays Father Brah . <p> Rachel : Who plays Father Brah . <p> Aline : And he s one of our staff writers . And he s Filipino . And so we got so much of our specifics from Rene . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling your aunt , Aunt Ah-Tay and we got so many specifics from him . It was a real , I have to say , real lesson for us in terms of like as we said a lot , we tend to write really specifically , so we were really specific about the bisexual thing . And we were really specific about the Filipino thing . And we really wanted it to be accurate . <p> And that 's something that I 've done in my career with workplace stuff , where Ive always done a ton of research because I want the people in that workplace to be like , " Oh my god , totally . " And with the Filipino thing we just did the same thing where we like drilled down . And now we have a whole company of the Chan Fan Bam . We have a whole company of Filipino actors . And Amy Hill , who is Filipino , but plays the mom . <p> Rachel : But it just , I mean , I think that situation especially with Rene giving us these specifics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of starts one of the places it starts is in the writers room because you do n't  want to create like a false character and then just work it out in casting it . <p> Aline : Yeah , I mean , we had Vinnie . And Vinnie gave us also some things . And when the writers started , they all came in and had lunch with the writers room . And he and Rene right away had all these things . But the fact that his sisters are named Jayma and Jastenity , we would n't have known that that 's a thing , where like they name the <p> Aline : No matter in depth we would have done our research , we never would have gotten things that so , one of the things I would say , I do n't  know if you 're a writer , but being diverse is not a you 're not asking people to hire you or consider you because they 're nice and they want to change the world . That 's a qualification . You know , that 's an experience of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great to have in the writers room people who are older and younger and female and male and gay and straight and bi and trans and , you know , from the Midwest . You 're looking for a wide variety of people . <p> That 's the best writing is going to come from no , I 'm not kidding . The best writing is going to come from a room where not everybody is from the same background . And so , I mean , we even like have a writer from Ohio . We have a writer who <p> Rachel : The Midwest being the most diverse . <p> Aline : Who spent part of her life in South Africa . I mean , you 're drawing on life experiences , so for us its like its a benefit and a qualification to find people who have had diverse life experiences , because you 're trying to write about a world that has a diversity of experiences in it . And there 's even little things , like sometimes well stipulate the character should be overweight , because otherwise they wo n't bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of try and stipulate that . <p> But , you know , I would say I think its a huge qualification and asset to have an unusual background . <p> Female Audience Member : Oh , thank you . <p> John : Thanks . <p> Aline : You know , the thing I will say , its funny , because sometimes people say , you know , you discovered Rachel or whatever . Rachel was doing amazing work . It was just a matter of time . I mean , what she was doing so brilliant , and so funny , and so amazing . I just maybe sped up the process by a little bit , because what she was doing was such standout work . <p> And I have to say every day that we work on this show , its like such a privilege to work with somebody who is so smart , wise beyond her years , the kindest person . Shes so beloved on the show . But so sensible . I mean , we 've been in stressful when we started , Rachel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm the old lady on the hill . I 've seen it all . <p> And we 've been in some situations which were very weird and stressful , where people said really weird things and acted in a strange way . And she 's just like so mature and so sensible , in addition to being so incredibly talented in sort of like a visionary way . You know , I feel like in a lot of ways she discovered me . I feel like I got a chance to do this and play in this sandbox that I never would have gotten to play in otherwise . <p> John : Aw . That 's a nice way to leave it tonight . So , Aline , Rachel , thank you so much for being on this .

@@42311440 @2311440/ <p> I know one page of say a battle can last five minutes whereas one page of quick dialogue my last ten seconds if the actors talk fast So my question is , is this rule true ? <p> Has your 120 page script been a 2 hour movie or was it more like 90 minutes ? <p> My main reason for asking this is I want to make my own low-budget movie . And the best tips I get say keep the script 90 pages or shorter . And to make it a play ( dialogue heavy , one location ) . <p> However , from my short film experience and being an editor , I saw a 90 page script of a friend be only 55 minutes when edited . And I know Kevin Smiths CLERKS was 164 page script , but is only a 90 min movie because of the dialogue . <p> So , how can I find an accurate length of the movie before I shoot it . Or should I have a 130-page script if I want to make my own feature ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual screen time on the pages ? <p> Matthew KaplanNew York City <p> Your instinct is right : the one-page-per-minute rule of thumb does n't  hold up to much scrutiny . True , most screenplays are about 120 pages , and true , most movies are around two hours . But the conversion rate between paper and celluloid is rarely one-to-one . <p> That 's why when a movie is in pre-production , one of the script supervisors first jobs is to time the script . She or he reads through the screenplay with a stopwatch , estimating how long each scene will play , then adds up the total running time . Generally , they go through the whole script twice , averaging the times . <p> How accurate is the script timing ? Well , that depends on how well the script supervisor has factored in the directors style . Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain featured long , contemplative shots of the heroes herding sheep , which another director might have dropped altogether . But generally , the script timing is in the right ballpark . <p> Although a script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . My advice would be to read the dialogue aloud , while trying to pad for non-spoken moments . Its easier with some scripts than others . <p> As far as my own films : <p> Go was 126 pages , but came out at 103 minutes without any major scenes left out . It was n't play-like , but the pacing was quick . <p> Big Fish was 124 pages , and 125 minutes long . To my recollection , only one significant scene was omitted , so the page-per-minute rule came close . <p> Both Charlies Angels movies went through so many drafts during production that an accurate page-count is impossible . But the first drafts were around 120 pages . The original film was 98 minutes ; the sequel was 106 . The pacing was obviously quick . 
@@42311441 @2311441/ <p> I currently have a lit agent and a manager , both from boutique companies . Ive been with them both for about three years . I like them a lot personally , but as I look back over the years , they have not produced a lot of results . <p> I have a feature script that won two writing competitions ( one major ) , a drama serial pilot and a drama procedural pilot and am currently working on a thriller . The feature was optioned for a year , but nothing came of it . Its about to be optioned again , both are for very little money from very small companies . <p> But they never seem to send my stuff out . I 've only had one meeting of significance in the past three years that my agent got for me . Not one from my manager . <p> They are always very circumspect about exactly WHO is reading my material . And I always get the impression its because they are not sending it out . They say they love my writing , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps their strengths as representatives might not fit what I am writing . Their contacts and relationships are n't  of much value to me . But would they ever admit that ? <p> If I decide to move on from one or both , what is the protocol ? <p> In this climate , I 'd rather not drop one of them before I have new representation . But it feels like bad form to give my material to people on the sly without them knowing , to see if there 's interest . But if I drop them before I know there 's interest , and I have troubleI would have been better off keeping them and trying to work on it . <p> I feel like I 'm stuck . Any advice ? <p> RaymondHermosa Beach <p> At this stage in your fledgling career , the job of both your agent and your manager is to put your work in the hands of people who might like it , then get you into rooms to meet with them . They cant get you a job , or guarantee a sale . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they 're not doing it . So its time to change . <p> For readers new to this , a boutique agency is one with a relatively small group of agents and clients . Boutiques can be great , especially for writers and filmmakers with a very distinct sensibility that requires more careful positioning.1 Because of the small size , you 're not going to be competing with your own agencys clients for jobs . The downside is that a boutique agency is n't going to have all the resources and information that a major agency would have . <p> My first agent was at a boutique ; his name was on the door . He sent me out on dozens of meetings with the right level of junior executives including Dan Jinks , who would ultimately produce Big Fish and The Nines . Everyone I met with loved my agent . My first two writing assignments were landed through my own contacts , but he made the deals and stood up for me . He was a good agent . <p> Unfortunately , our tastes did n't  really jibe . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clients worked on the ( admittedly fascinating ) periphery . Reading an early draft of Go , he did n't  see it as a movie . And I knew it was time to go . <h> Its time to see other people <p> Leaving an agent is breaking up . You 're telling someone who has been a friend and colleague that you believe someone else could do the job better . Its going to hurt . Rip the Band-Aid off and deal with the sting . <p> Since you have both an agent and a manager , pick the one you think is the better fit and talk to him about your frustrations . If he has a list of ideas , consider them . If he tells you to keep things how they are , well , you need to leave him , too . Its not working . Sticking around is n't going to improve it . <p> Now is also the time to talk with trusted friends and colleagues about where you should go . The producers who just optioned your script may have opinions and recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Write something new and great <p> Youll be in a better position to sign a new agent or manager if you have something new to put in their hands . Theyll want to send out material no one has seen , so the thriller might be the thing . It needs to be great , better than the script that won you the awards . <p> Agents want clients who work . That 's why the biggest change should n't be who is representing you , but how you 're representing yourself . As you take meetings , make them understand that you will work your ass off to land assignments , then work five times harder to deliver . Say it and mean it . Novelists can be hermetic artistes . Screenwriters have to be hunters , hucksters and hostage negotiators . <p> You do n't  necessarily need to be at a bigger agency , though they 're often better equipped to handle both the TV and feature sides of your career . You 're wise to pursue both at full speed , by the way .

The hard work will be capitalizing on their enthusiasm to make connections , set up projects , and write movies that get made . <p> In trying to think of examples of quirky filmmakers , I looked up Harmony Korine and Todd Solondz .

Put yourself in the room . <p> Imagine that you 're sitting in the guys office , having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that office looks like , but you 're a screenwriter , so you should be able to conjure something up . More importantly , imagine whom you 're speaking with . You need a face in order to make eye contact.1 <p> I know this sounds goofy , but I think it makes a huge difference . You 're much more engaged when you 're looking someone in the eye even if its all make-believe . It changes your voice , your pace , your word selection . It really helps . <h> 2 . Do n't  multi-task . <p> If a phone call is important , dedicate every available brain cell to it . Turn off your computer and any other distraction . If possible , schedule the call . ( Even then , there 's a high possibility that an assistant will call at the last minute to push it back 15 minutes . Do n't  take any offense. ) <h> 3 . Rehearse key points . <p> Since you 're going to be talking with possible producers , agents and managers , you can anticipate the kinds of things that will come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or film ? <p> What are you working on now ? <p> What 's happening with that script from the Nicholl ? <p> You want answers to those questions , ideally phrased in ways that make you sound confident , flexible and funny . For example , if they ask if you 're living in Los Angeles , a good answer is , " Almost . I 'm packing as we speak . " That may not be entirely accurate , but the person on the other end needs to hear that you 're serious about getting to Hollywood . <h> 4 . Ask and listen . <p> Do n't  spend every brain cycle formulating the next clever thing to say . Ask questions and engage . If you 're speaking with someone for the first time , make sure you 're learning something about them as well . <p> Pitching on the phone is largely the same as pitching in person , with the added challenge of not being able to read body language . So keep it really short like four sentences unless they ask for more detail . <p> One downside of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strictly on the phone and by email . By the time I meet them in person , my brain is locked into one image of them , and the actual person seems like an impostor. ?

That 's partly why I made Highland , a writing app that let 's you focus on the words , not the formatting . <p> Because I 'm mostly a screenwriter , Highland is largely tailored towards screenplays . But I also write fiction , and I did n't  want to give up any of my Highland comforts . <p> Since version 1.4 , Highland has included a manuscript mode that strikes a good balance between helpful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single line to your file <p> Format : Manuscript <p> and with it , makes Highland a surprisingly good choice for writing fiction . When you print or export , you 'll find Highland double-spaces text to common publisher standards , perfect for paper editing . <p> Highland 1.8.2 , new in the Mac App Store today , adds a few extra features novel writers can appreciate , such as on-the-fly word count . ( Just click the page icon . ) <p> Want to put a header on every page ? Add it below the format line : <p> Format : Manuscript <p> Header : MOBY-DICK ORIGINS / Caswell Barthowly <p> Want to start a new chapter ? Use a hashtag , such as <p> #Chapter Six : The Wailing Whaling <p> Highland will automatically insert the page break , and center the chapter heading on the next page.1 <p> Highlands notes , synopses and omissions work the same as always . Text in double brackets wo n't print . Same for a single line preceded by the equal sign = . And you can keep your scraps handy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll leave it in the file while hiding it from export . <p> In Preferences , you can adjust column width and line spacing , and set your favorite colors for Dark Mode . <p> If you 're tempted to give Highland a shot for writing your November novel , we have it marked half-off through November 7th . Give Manuscript mode a spin , and see whether its minimalism can maximize your page count . <p> Fountain purists are likely scratching their heads at this choice . Truth is , this untitled manuscript format is actually more like Markdown than Fountain . It feels correct for section headers to be printed . ? 
@@42311472 @2311472/ <p> John : And this is Episode 176 of Scriptnotes , a podcast about screenwriting and things that are interesting to screenwriters . <p> Today on the show we will be talking about advice to a first-time director . Well be talking about the perfect director , part of our Perfect Series . And , finally , we will be looking at the Logic Police and why the Logic Police are our friends or our foes as it comes time to get our stories in their best shape . <p> But , we could not go into this week without talking about the big story which is Sony pulling The Interview and all of that madness . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : So I should say that we are recording this on Friday . And by the time this episode comes out on Tuesday who knows what will have happened . As fast as the story has moved , its very likely that some of what well be talking about is out of date . So , I think we can only talk in sort of our general fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Craig : Right . So , let 's sum up what we know . What we know is that Sony was hacked . We now know from at least according to the United States government that the hack was perpetrated by individuals backed by the State of North Korea . We know that it was done in retribution for Sonys production and imminent release of the movie , The Interview , in which the North Korean dictator is assassinated . And we know that the movie is not coming out . <p> John : Yes . I want to stipulate that we do n't  know some of these things . We know that the US government is claiming that North Korea is behind it , but we also know that in previous instances where the government has said this is what is actually happening was real , later on we find that not to be true . So , we know that as of today the US government is saying it was North Korea . So , we do know that to be true . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last week that changed it from a story about embarrassing leaked emails to the movie being pulled was that there were direct threats about like if the movie comes out there will be violence in theaters . <p> Craig : Correct . <p> John : It shifted from a like , oh , here 's embarrassing information to there is now danger . And it was the theaters who said were not going to show your movie . <p> Craig : Correct . That is all true . And what has been manufactured by the Internet outrage machine is some form of the following out of conventional wisdom . Sony is a bunch of cowards , they just capitulated to terrorism . This is the death of creative expression . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : Now , permit me if you will , John , to fashion my own umbrage which is not outrage but rather umbrage about the situation and what I think should happen and what I think did happen . First of all , I do think its North Korea . I 'm just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government telling me it was North Korea . You know , I tend to believe them on stuff like that . Color me na+ve . <p> I do think this was state-sponsored terrorism . I think that Sony was in a nearly impossible situation and currently they 're being blamed for something that really we should be putting at the doorstep of the exhibitors . So , the hackers threatened violence in theaters that show The Interview . There are only four or five major theater chains in the United States . If they drop out , you essentially have no real movie release , or certainly not one you can support with a marketing campaign and expect to ever make money back and so forth . <p> Those big exhibitors said were not showing this movie . Well , let me step back . Sony said , hey look , if you do n't  want to show it , we wont hold you to your commitment to show it . And they all said , gee thanks , were gone . <p> So , the primary act of cowardice if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , of course , from their point of view also understandable because , hey , we live in a society where if you get a warning that there is going to be violence in your theater and you run the movie and there 's violence in your theater , count the lawsuits that will emerge . Whether they 're justifiable or not , whether they 're winnable or not , this is the world we live in , at least here in the west . Lawsuit phobia . <p> And its Christmastime . A lot of these things are in a mall . Its just a mess , right ? So , they all say were out of here . Sony then looks at the situation and says well we cant release the movie because it does n't  make any sense . How are we supposed to release a movie when there are n't  theaters to put it in ? <p> And furthermore we do n't  want to release a movie and then , again , some theater blows up somewhere and now we look like , I mean , write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you 're callous profiteers who think that the ticket sales are more important that human lives . You ca n't win , right ? 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : So , I want to say this , and I think this is important . What just happened here in Hollywood with this hack is the most significant thing that has happened in our business since I 've been in it , by far , as far as Im concerned . This is a huge disaster . And its a disaster in part because information was leaked . Its a disaster in part because people were embarrassed . But primarily its a disaster of the community of the Hollywood studio business . <p> The real cowards , if you ask me , are the other studios . Because if I were one of these other studios , I would get everybody together as a consortium and say , look , this is not Sonys problem . This is all of our problem . Were all scared , okay , and we all have problems here and were all desperately afraid that were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my god , if you saw my email Amy Pascal is a saint compared to what 's in by the way , compared to what 's in anyones email inbox. 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Shes a saint ! Anyone , all these people out there that are pointing fingers at her or even Scott Rudin Scott Rudin who by the way basically talks in email the way he does to your face as far as I understand it . I think almost everyone complaining about this has far , far worse in their private correspondence with people . So , what a joke that is , okay . <p> But that aside , the studios and I still believe there is time for this should come together and say , look , what does this movie cost , $40 million ? Everybody chip in . We all own this movie now . Everybody kick in $5 million which we wo n't miss . Now we all own the movie . And then put it out on the Internet for free for the world . This is not something where we can pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our responsibility to do the opposite . <p> And George Clooney wrote something about this recently which I largely agreed with , except for the part where he called it a " dumb comedy , " which I thought was just egregious and pointless considering that many comedies that have been called dumb are far more culturally important than a number of George Clooney films . <p> This is what I think the studio should do . I think Hollywood needs to band together now and do this together because if any of these studios think that they 're not next , they 're wrong . All that happens if they let this continue this way is that they are individually asking for someone to do this to them . They 're begging . So , that 's my position . <p> John : I 'm in thorough agreement that the studios need to band together . And its tough for the studios to work together because they perceive themselves as being at odds with each other . But they 're 100% in the same camp on this . They can not allow this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when the emails were getting released , but now that its come to this they need to stand together . <p> The releasing on the Internet is actually complicated because they could just put it out as a torrent , which they could basically put it out in the same way that all movies have been pirated and that would be probably in many ways the cleanest way to do it . Because if they try to go to Amazon or Netflix or anybody else , one of those companies can say like , " You know what ? The hackers come after us next and our entire business is digital . " So , you do n't  want to be Amazon or Netflix and be the next target of that . <p> And this is what I think is the most dangerous thing about this whole thing that 's happened is that I do n't  know whether six months from now I 'm going to be looking at this event as being sort of the next 9/11 , where basically the entire world changed because of this incident that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of how this happened . Where everybody is running scared of a perceived attack from , you know , some foreign power , some international cabal and so the movies we make and how it gets released , television shows we make , and how everything works could fundamentally change because of this event . That 's what frustrates me the most is that I just do n't  know . <p> And I do n't  know whether I am overreacting or under-reacting to what has actually happened . <p> Craig : I think you are reacting appropriately . <p> John : So , the one thing that has n't  been as acknowledged is that Sony , when you think of Sony as being like , oh , that studio in Culver City , but they 're also a Japanese corporation . And so its very easy for us to say here in Los Angeles like , oh , come on , North Korea could really not do anything , but North Korea could do something to Japan which is right next door . And so I think there is a national/international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sony in Japan versus Sony here . <p> And its just a mess . And I 'm so frustrated for everybody . Im frustrated for our guest on Scriptnotes , Dan Sterling , who wrote it . He was at our Austin show . And so Ive been thinking about him through this whole experience of like , oh congratulations , your movie is coming out . Oh wait , your movie just no longer exists . <p> Craig : I know . <p> John : And it no longer exists because of some person probably in North Korea who decided , you know what , were going to do everything in our power to keep this movie from coming out . <p> Craig : Well , look , I think that your 9/11 analogy is apt . And that 's saying something because I 'm the person that thinks all 9/11 analogies are inapt . But this time its apt , because everyone is absolutely taking this deadly serious every company is taking this deadly seriously . And by way , its untenable for Netflix or Amazon or Apple to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then theyll be hacked next , because if that 's true they 're getting hacked next anyway . <p> John : Absolutely . <p> Craig : So , I think that , you know , in 1993 Islamic terrorists attempted to blow up the World Trade Center . And they failed . And everyone went , huh . <p> John : Phew . <p> Craig : What a bunch of idiots . Couldnt even blow up the World Trade Center . Ha-ha-ha . And lo and behold eight years later they did it . That is a very governmental kind of reaction . Governments tend to be that way , but not business . Business is focused autistically focused on making money , on protecting its shareholder value . And I think the response from every major corporation that is reliant on information services , and that means every major corporation , right now is in crisis mode . Every major organization is going through their cyber security with a fine tooth comb . If they 're not , they are organizationally mentally i 'll . <p> So , I do think that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this . It does n't  seem like this was unavoidable . It seems like this was a collision of aggressive action and lax security . But you can put it on the Internet . You can create a buy a host somewhere , you know , in freaking Sweden where all the piracy is hosted , laughs , and just create a website that 's nothing but The Interview streamed online . <p> John : Yeah . Maybe you could . Maybe you could essentially put it out on just the normal kind of torrents and stick like a tip jar for people to put in their money for it and sort of buy their virtual tickets . Maybe that 's possible . Here is where I 'm worried about sort of for the future is that in this case this was this movie that specifically made fun of North Korea and that 's what the focus of the outrage is . But like what happens when its George Clooney says something inflammatory and so therefore they say like , oh , Warner Bros , you are not going to release that George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes this cycle <p> Craig : Exactly . <p> John : Where it becomes impossible to get things made . And it also becomes impossible to get those movies insured , because one of the things we do n't  know quite yet as were recording this on Friday is Sony has said like , oh , were not releasing the movie at all . That 's what they 're saying right now . But it is entirely possible the reason why they 're doing that is they 're declaring a forced measure on it and they 're basically going to make a big insurance claim for $40 million or whatever that they can not release the movie . <p> Craig : I do n't  think that 's going to work . Ive read that , but I do n't  understand how you can make an insurance claim based on a decision you make . You know , if the movie had been literally obliterated from existence by a cyber attack , that 's one thing . But if you say , you know what , I could release the movie but I 'm scared to . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's a red herring honestly . <p> John : Maybe so . But I think insurance will be more difficult now than ever and more expensive than ever to get insured on a movie , even because if they 're stopping a movie from being released they can also stop a movie during production . <p> Craig : Thats right . <p> John : They can do things to derail a studio trying to make a certain kind of movie . <p> Craig : Thats right . <p> John : And so if you are a person who has to make the decision which movie to green light and you 're like , oh god , I do n't  know if I can even get insurance for this movie . I think its going to be just not worth my time and my hassle , then you 're just going to only make the really , really safe movies and that 's a recipe for everything getting worse and worse . <p> Craig : As if that werent already the tendency . <p> John : Exactly . <p> Craig : In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a movie called Pyongyang and that has been that was green lit with Steve Carell to star at Fox , I think New Regency . That has been un-green lit because of this . And this is precisely why the response has to be so defiant , because if its not I mean , everybody knows this from the playground . Either you fight back or you 're the one that gets bullied every day . There is no reason for them to not do this again . There is every reason for them to do it again . How obvious is that ? So , the Hollywood community , the business community , which by the way comes together very effectively to fight their prior terrorists of concern the Writers Guild , the Directors Guild , the Actors Guild they have no problem joining together to do that . <p> They must join together right now and be incredibly defiant about this , over defiant . They need to go beyond . That 's why I think honestly they need to have this movie out to the world for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , because if they do n't  , they are asking someone else to do this again . They 're begging for it . This is why you do n't  negotiate with terrorists , right ? Everybody knows that . You negotiate with terrorists , you 're just asking for more terrorism . <p> This is not rocket science , or brain surgery , or rocket surgery . <p> John : All these surgeries which are so difficult because you keep adding variables . <p> Craig : Because I keep adding variables ! Anyway , I do honestly think that everybody that the studios need to gather around Sony as a brother or sister , however the studios relate to each other . They need to own this together . They must . This was not an attack on Sony . This was an attack on Hollywood . And if they 're smart <p> John : Yeah . And I think do n't  stop at the studios . It has to be the studios coming together . Theater owners have to come together and recognize that , you know what , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have nothing to show in their movie theaters , and the guilds need to come together with them , too . <p> Craig : Well , you know , listen , the theater owners , they 're also terrorists by the way . They are . Anybody that works in Hollywood knows that theater owners are the problem . And I think you go to the theater owners and say , hey guess what you guys , you pull this again and you 're just going to see a whole lot more day and date . You 're going to see a lot more , because you know what , everybody thinks you 're dying anyway . Either were in this together or were not . <p> And it just has to be that way . This is war . This is war . We do n't  mess around in war . I take this incredibly seriously . And if we do n't  if we cant figure out as a community and particularly the business community , how to achieve solidarity on this and not turn this into a oh god , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then were doomed . <p> And , honestly , I do n't  care . here 's the god honest truth : I do n't  care what any of these people write in their emails . If there were a thousand emails about me and they were brutal , I still would n't care . Because I do n't  care what people think . I do n't  care what people say to each other in private . I only care about what people do , what they say to me and what they do . <p> Unfortunately , the press this miserable excuse of a press that we have in this country delights in this baloney . Delights in it . So , you know there is no way to avoid this . If it happens again its not like The New York Times is going to change their bizarre and stupid policy of we wont do it until somebody else does it and then well publish it because , blah , blah . Pathetic . So its inevitable . I 'm saying to Paramount and Disney and Universal and Warner Bros and Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you guys band together and put The Interview out for free to the world . <p> Hmm . <p> John : All right . Done . <p> To our real topics . Our first is a question that comes from Matthew Chilelli who is the person who edits this podcast . So , he wrote this question and I said , you know what , well answer your question on the air and you 'll get to hear it first because you 'll edit the episode that has the answer to your question . <p> So , Matthew Chilelli and his writing partner are directing a movie that they raised money for on Kickstarter . And his question was what advice would you give to a first-time director of his own script . And I 'm like that 's a great question . And so I had some thoughts and I 'm sure Craig will have some thoughts , too , because we both directed and we both learned a lot . <p> My quick bullet points of advice are to remember that you 're not there to throw a party . And one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I wanted everyone to be happy . And I wanted to make sure that the set was comfortable and that everyone was having a good time . And then I realized , you know what , this is n't a party . Its not my job to make sure everyone is having a good time . Its my job to make sure that everyone has the information they need so they can do their jobs really , really well . <p> And so once I stopped thinking about myself as host and started thinking of myself as the person who is directing the movie things got much happier and better and everyone was happier . <p> You will be facing a thousand questions . And I was terrified of the thousand questions . Should it be a green shirt or a red shirt ? Like this ? Like this ? Do you want a wider lens , a tighter lens ? Here are some things : you will usually have an answer . And just pick an answer . And answers are great . Although you can also say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicit their opinions . You can figure out sort of what the choices really mean . <p> You can also say , " None of the above . " And if the none of the choices that are presented to you are the correct choices , say none of the above and let them come back to you with more choices . <p> While you 're directing , always remember what the intention is of the scene and what the intention is of the moment . Because when you 're in the middle of directing a scene and things are going crazy and you 're turning around shooting from one side to the other side and things are just nuts , its so easy to forget what the scene is actually about . And so making notes to yourself before the day starts , like the scene is about this is incredibly useful . Like the minimum viable scene will be about this , rely on that . <p> If you are directing actors , directing actors I find works best with verbs . So , its very hard for an actor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actor a verb to play . So you can say do n't  let him walk through that door . Or , you can sort of give them a simile . Can we try that same moment but as if he s just said the most horrifying thing imaginable to you ? That 's something an actor can do . An actor ca n't be an adjective . So , those are my quick run throughs of advice . <p> Craig : All spectacular suggestions . I agree with every single one of them . <p> John : Cool . <p> Craig : I 'll only add the following . <p> John : Please . <p> Craig : When you 're directing a movie that its your first time and you 've written the script , you will have a natural tendency to want to be the person that is defending the guy that came before you , the screenwriter . So , in other situations where we 've written a script and somebody else directs it we go , oh my god , what are you doing to my screenplay , and its bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I can defend this . <p> However , that 's not the person you should be worrying about . When you direct , the person that you should be solely concerned with is the you in the future who is in the editing room . That 's the person you 're taking care of . That is the person who needs you right now to figure this out . <p> So , give that person options . When you 're a first-time director , you may think I 've figured out , I know exactly what I want to do with this . And you may think that 's the name of the game . But sometimes the name of the game is collect options . And then you 're going to find this movie and write this movie in editorial . And Matthew is an editor , so he understands this better than most . To that end , I believe in shot-listing , particularly for a first-time director , and especially if you 're dealing with limited time which typically a first-time director is . <p> You do n't  have a lot of days where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure it out today , I 'll figure it out tomorrow . " It does n't  go that way for you . Youve got to get the days work done . So , shot-list . <p> As a writer we are obviously absorbed with all writerly things : character , dialogue , theme , scenario . As a director , take a moment to just think about aesthetics . Think about your color palette . Think about movies that look the way you want this movie to look . Think about how you want to move the camera . Do you want long lenses , wide lenses ? By the way , if you 're not sure what those things are , pick up a book . There are all sorts of instructional things online now so you can learn . <p> But really think about how you want it to look , how you want the camera to move and feel , because that is essentially the directorial equivalent of theme for the screenwriter . And without theme as a screenwriter we tend to just wander without some sort of unifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making a big TV show . <p> So , work on all of those things , but most importantly really , really care for your future self who will be in editorial because that future self is the one who is going to every director , first-time , 20th time , at some point in editorial will curse themselves for what they did n't  do . So , you want to try and limit the amount of cursing of yourself you end up doing . <p> John : I think that 's fantastic advice . Let 's talk about what shot-list is , because I think sometimes people get confused about that term . So , there is storyboarding , and storyboarding is when you are sort of sketching out what you think the shots are going to be like to build a sequence . A shot-list is a much more practical thing . Its literally a thing you 're probably holding in your hand , which is like a bullet point list of these are the shots I need to make this scene . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like what the shot-list would be for a scene . But honestly its a thing you might do in the morning before you 've started that days work and you 're going to hopefully have people you can trust and talk through that shot-list with . <p> The people who are so crucial are your first AD . And your director of photography . And I found it to be so useful to like walk through with Nancy Schreiber , my DP , and my line producer , like these are the shots I need in this scene . And she could tell me like , " Okay , well let 's prioritize this and prioritize this because of light . " That was so useful . <p> Also , when you 're making your shot-list , prioritize within that . Because there are going to be some shots you 're just not going to get . And so you need to be able to tell the scenes , even if you never got that second close-up that you really wanted , okay , but that 's why you put that at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny movie or a giant movie , there is going to be stuff that you just do n't  get . And protecting that future editor self , you want to make sure you get as much of the stuff you do need and this extra stuff is just gravy . <p> Craig : Thats absolutely right . That is a perfect description of a shot-list . And what you find as a first-time director is that directing whatever you thought about directing is wrong . And that a huge amount of what directing is is breaking moments down geometrically . It is literally figuring out how to capture a moment through angles . And the angles could be moving and they could be different sizes , but ultimately you 're fracturing a moment into various geometric angles that will be repeated so that you can edit them together . <p> And understanding the geometry of your scene is really important before you shot-list , because sometimes if you think about it you 'll say I do n't  want to break this down . I actually think this is a one-er . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want coverage here . I want this to be about these two people playing something in the moment together . And if its a one-er and you know its a one-er , no problem . Everything is a tradeoff , right ? You 'll probably do nine takes of that , but there 's no more coverage , so you 're done with it , right . <p> If you 're doing traditional coverage with two people talking , you 've got yourself a master , and overs , and closes . Okay . So , you do n't  have to do as many takes of each one , but there 's a lot more setups . <p> So , one thing to do as the first-time director of your own screenplay is to go through your screenplay and start asking yourself this question : how would this moment be best broken down geometrically ? What do I want to see and how ? It will help you make your shot-list . And then as you said your DP and your first AD will have all sorts of great ideas to add to it and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , thinking about that future person you 're going to be when you 're in the editing room , a lot of times as you 're watching a shot happen before you you say like , oh , that was good , but this thing was n't good , that thing like it was almost right , but this wasnt quite right . If you know you 're going to be cutting it , it does n't  have to be flawless all the way through . It would be great if it were flawless , where you had that one take that 's fantastic , but pushing for that eighth take to try to get one perfect take through on one persons coverage is almost never worth it . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : If you know you have the moments , if you know that I can see and feel what this is like , then you 're wasting a lot of your day to try to get to that perfect eighth take when you have the stuff you need in those earlier takes . <p> Craig : Its why you need before you direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need to know where the scissors come in and where the scissors cant come in . You need to know when something is married to something else so if one half of it is no good and one half of it is good , its no good . <p> But Matthew happily has that experience , so that 's a huge part of it . Its how you figure out how to break a moment down very often . <p> John : Yup . So , a great segue to our next topic which is our Perfect Series . And this time its the Perfect Director . So , I want to take a look at the perfect director from the writers point of view since were a mostly a writers podcast . But also from what a perfect director looks like from an actors point of view , from different department heads point of view . Because how does a director do her job the best and what are the tools and techniques she 's using to make the best movie . So , obviously a very wide topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well , let 's start with what were most comfortable with , I suppose , which is how what we want from a screenwriting point of view when we work with a director what do we want . And I 'm going to dispense with the obvious ones . We want them to be good . laughs We want them to know how to shoot . We want them to be visually interesting . We want them to know how to work with great actors . We want them to be really specific , make terrific choices . But , of course , what a lot of screenwriters will say is we want them to shoot the script . <p> Well , I do n't  want the director to shoot the script . I want the director to shoot the movie of the script . But here is what I want most of all : I want the director to presume respectfully that if something is in the script its there for a reason . I think the biggest mistake directors make vis--vis screenwriters is when they read a screenplay they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments that have to happen , but then there are moments inside of the moments that are like , eh , you know what , I actually would love to do this , or I 'd love to do that or it would be more fun if the camera was here , more fun if the camera is there . This just feels like a waste of time . <p> And , not always , depending on the quality of the screenwriter , but I would argue if its a good screenwriter 99% of the time that is a huge mistake . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : It is not a mistake to ask the screenwriter how can we do this differently . It is a mistake to say quite arrogantly , " Some of this is n't important . " It is as much of a mistake as it would be to open up a human body during surgery , grab a hold of some little gibbet and go , " Eh , this probably does n't  mean anything , " and just pull it out . <p> Because we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what happens is three or four weeks later you might get a call like , " Uh , this does n't  make sense . " Yeah , well , because you took that thing out and you did n't  realize because you had n't  lived in it the way I did . <p> So , when you want to change things in a screenplay , and its perfectly fine to say , look , were changing it . We must change it for the following reasons , even if one of the reasons is my directorial taste . Tell me . How can I change this so that I do n't  hurt anything ? First do no harm . <p> That 's what I want from a director more than anything else in terms of how they interact with me and that involves obviously a certain amount of respect and acknowledgment that the screenplay is n't just a " suggestion " or even a " blueprint , " which I 've never understood , but rather is a conceptualized movie . <p> John : Yeah . So , what I 'm looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel this vision of a movie onto the screen . And its really like a person who can experience the movie internally and then has the skills to be able to put that up on a screen . And that is such a unique skill set . And there are people who are just amazingly good at it . You can do things that I would just never think of to do . And that 's what gets me so excited is when you see a director who can just do these amazing things . <p> So , I can not underscore enough is that I do n't  want this person to make my script . I want this person to make my movie . And make her version of my movie . And I want that movie to be fantastic . <p> So , when there are suggestions , or changes , or concerns , or things they do n't  like , that 's awesome . Let 's talk those through . But do n't  try to change them on the set without getting some feedback because , yes , everything that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a reason why this whole carefully constructed puzzle fits together one way . And there are other ways it can be assembled , but there was one way it was supposed to work . And if you can talk with me about that beforehand , that 's awesome . <p> In those first conversations , a lot of those first conversations with the director is basically just kind of talking through the whole movie so I get a sense of what the movie looks like in the directors head . And sometimes that really does mean as a screenwriter Im kind of explaining scenes and like , well , I wrote it and now I 'm actually talking through the whole explanation of it , but its so important that we be on the page . Literally the same page written , but also the same idea about what the intentions are of those scenes . And the times where things have gone not especially well have been cases where the director really thought the scene was about something completely different than what I thought the scene was about . 10555 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a difference of opinion , but we did n't  have a difference of opinion . Like , he just shot a different scene than what I kind of meant that scene to be . And then that scene no longer shows up in the movie and there are problems . <p> Craig : Absolutely true . And the other thing that I think the perfect director exhibits is patience . Now , directing , I 've said this before many times , directing a movie , a feature film , is the hardest job in show business . And so directors can not be patient with everybody . In fact , most directors really have only a very tiny amount of patience that they reserve entirely for their actors . They must be patient with their actors because if they yell at their actors or are impatient with their actors they 're getting bad performances . And , of course , this all about what they 're getting on screen from their human beings , unless they 're all computer generated robots . <p> I would ask the perfect director to extend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same amount of patience . And the reason I say that is not because were sensitive flowers , but rather because you will get a better movie if you 're patient with the screenwriter . Frankly , there are a lot of directors who are least patient with the screenwriter . They find the screenwriter and the screenplay to be this kind of offensive reminder that this world that they 're creating is not entirely their world . Its disruptive of their confidence . <p> And I understand that . And there are screenwriters who get fussy about changes . The perfect director is patient with the screenwriter because they will get better work and they will make a better movie if they are . I always tell my fellow screenwriters to be patient in return to the director . They need us at our best in order to survive and we are all in the same boat of trying to make a good movie . <p> But a good director is patient with the screenwriter . <p> John : You talked about how incredibly hard the directors job is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading your troops into battle . And the crucial thing is that you have to have the trust of your troops . Your crew has to trust and believe that you have a vision for how you 're going to win this fight , how you 're going to succeed in doing this thing . <p> And that means that you had a lot of planning . You really knew what you were going to do ahead of time . You were able to read the lay of the land and see like , okay , on the day we 've arrived at this location , this location is different than how I 'd expected it to be and I 'm flexible enough to roll with what needs to actually happen . Because the directors who are inflexible , who everything has to be exactly the way they had storyboarded it are not going to be able to roll with the changes and roll with the punches . <p> The great directors can also recognize and really remember the intention of the scene . And so if an improvd moment comes up that 's actually better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate it and be able to both have the version of the scene as it existed , but also recognize like this new version is better , funnier , more dramatic . It does something unique and wonderful and I 'm so glad Im going to have that in the editing room as well . <p> Craig : Right . Yeah . And that reminds me of just another bit of advice going backwards for Matthew Chilelli as he approaches his first movie . A good director leads the crew , but also understands that the crew will not be able to tell her or him that they 're making a good movie . All the crew sees are dailies , right ? That 's what they say . They see live dailies going on . And they may see funny moments . And they may see an actor do a hysterical thing or a beautiful thing . But as the old saying goes , there 's nothing better than your dailies , and there 's nothing worse than your first cut . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : They do n't  know what the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig : Do n't  ask them what they think and do n't  be encouraged or discouraged if they offer their opinions . No one except for you and your editor has any sense really of the movie that is going to result . You 're the only ones that have seen the completed jigsaw puzzle . You 're just making pieces now , right ? So , do n't  overreact to that whole thing . There 's the in comedy we call it a dailies laugh , where the crew just goes , " Oh my god , " and theyll come up to you at lunch . " That was so funny . " And in your heart you know , ah , its getting cut out of the movie . <p> There 's something about those moments , those moments that are so funny in the moment so often just do not live in the matrix of the put together film . <p> John : Yeah . So , any last bits of summary for our perfect director ? I mean , I would say there 's not one perfect archetype for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are vastly different from each other . And that 's fine and that 's okay . And they all have different ways of communicating their vision to their department heads , and to me , and to everybody else who has to see what it is . And sometimes its not immediately clear to me . Like I have no idea what you 're doing , but it all works . <p> The directors who I sort of admire as a viewer I do n't  necessarily know what they 're like on the set , but if people are working with them again and again there 's probably something that they 're doing that 's really , really good . And they 're probably treating their crews with respect , they 're probably able to communicate what it is that they 're trying to do so that people can do their very best jobs . They 're able to inspire the best work out of people . And that 's how you make great movies . <p> Craig : Yeah . I think that frankly the best directors , the directors that I love as I run down the list in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect writers . And the directors that I find ultimately are disposable , who disappear , or who just make stuff I do n't  like are directors that are notorious for not giving a crap about the script . That the script is a ha-ha-ha , I 'm a director . <p> John : So let 's go to our final topic which is from a director . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : And his question is about the script itself . And so he is working on a studio feature and he writes : " I find that 70% of the notes I 'm getting deal with logic , that is a producer or exec is bumping me on something that does n't  track for them , like why wouldnt the daughter just call the donut shop ? Why wouldnt they go to the police ? Why would she do that if ? <p> " Fair enough . here 's my question . Where do you two professionals draw the line on the logic police notes ? When does the tail start wagging the dog for you ? I think we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting room floor , especially in comedies because nobody cares . When do you run the risk of answering a question the audience is n't asking ? When does print the legend apply ? <p> " I 've never left a movie and said , boy , that was a real stinker but so logically sound . Good for them . To me so often these logic notes are easy ways for an executive to score points in a story meeting . See all these logic holes Ive helped out and Ive fixed ? But seldom if ever do they actually make the movie better . " <p> He goes on to citing an example of Sleepless in Seattle where Tom Hanks comes back to his Seattle home to find that his son has left a few hours ago . What does he do ? He buys a plane ticket to New York City , rushes off to find his son on the Empire State Building and finally meets Meg Ryan when there 's a thousand other things he could do that would make a lot more sense . <p> Craig : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different tolerance for this kind of , well , is that logical , does that make sense , why wouldnt they do this , or is n't there an easier thing . And really what these questions all come down to is either is this rational or is this something that an average person will think is a sensible course of action for a human to take . <p> I generally err on the side of being a logic Nazi . I believe in logic . I think its particularly important for comedy because comedy is so much about contrasting the absurd against what we understand to be the proper rules of the world . <p> And generally speaking the more we get away from something that 's logical the less likely were willing to laugh because we start to feel like the filmmakers essentially rigged the game . Its a cheat . Its not as funny to see a joke that you know they had to alter certain facts to achieve . Its far more funny to see something that existed completely within the constraints of the world and behaviors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a movie like for instance All of Me . <p> In All of Me Steve Martin is possessed by the spirit of Lily Tomlin . The two of them are in the same body . And that is obviously an enormously broad high concept . Its illogical , but that 's point , its magical , right ? So , we accept that . You get one . But then what 's great about the movie is that things happen the way they would happen . So , the first thing that happens is he goes , " I 've got to get rid of you . And first of all I 'm crazy , and I 've got to get rid of you . " <p> They go through all the expected things . Similarly in Groundhog Day , you watch him react in a way that somebody would logically react . <p> So , I 'm a huge believer in logic . There are times when you must cut some corners here and there or else your movie falls apart . And you try as best you can to avoid those . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a little bit too much , or the audience does n't  need all that explanation here . I will tell you though that there have been times where we 've got some of that extra logical explanation out and they did n't  miss it but they were the beneficiaries of us having thought about it , because it felt okay . It was interesting . Like it felt real around it because we had done the homework of putting all that in . <p> So , I got to say I 'm a big believer in this . <p> John : Well , here 's what you 're describing , both in your All of Me example and Groundhog Day is you 're talking about what is the internal logic given the rules of the world you 're setting up . And so the logic rules for Men in Black is going to be different than the logic rules for The Bourne Identity , because there 's different levels of reality of the world . And so once you 've created that world and you created sort of the universe of rules within that world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that world , you 're golden . Its when we do n't  understand what the rules of that world are that so many of these logic notes come up and people start to question things . I am sympathetic to this director on the sense of sometimes people are trying to score easy points . And so theyll ask these questions like well why does n't  she do this , why does n't  she do this . <p> And , like , well , if you let characters do the things they could automatically easily do they would just call the police all the time and wait for the police to show up and help them . There are times where characters in movies are going to do things that are dramatic and that 's because they 're going to be doing dramatic things . So , hopefully you 've built a story in which characters are not allowed to make easy safe choices , that they have to make bigger choices because that 's the nature of the world you set up and the nature of the stakes you 've set up . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do , but they 're not in a normal situation anymore . And so that 's my frustration . And Ive definitely been in this directors position where I get some just asinine notes that they are theoretically about logic but they 're also just about talking and sort of bullet points on a piece of paper . <p> Craig : Yeah . That is true . When I get stuff like that I tend to be patient with it because I do n't  actually care why they 're saying the note . I mean , they may be saying the note because they need to talk more in meetings to get rehired again when their contract is up . But , ultimately I do n't  care . My job is to listen to the note and go , " No , actually , its logical what they 're doing . " Or , " Okay , I see your point , we should shore that logic up . " <p> I mean , ultimately if a human being is asking the question , its likely that an audience member could ask the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense . They just wo n't like it as much . <p> John : And you say there 's one gim me , and I think there 's in general sometimes you will have to sort of lean in to that one gim me that the audience will give you . And so if you 're in a high concept comedy , its like they 're sharing a body . If you 're in the movie Gone Girl , there is a thing that I was always worried about in Gone Girl when I read the book is like well how are they going to handle this transition that happens in the midpoint . Basically the voiceover completely shifts at the midpoint . And the truth is , and I 'm sure they had these discussions or disagreements , and someone must have said , either Gillian Flynn or David Fincher said , " You know what ? I think well have enough audience goodwill that they wo n't even notice that we completely changed the rules on how the whole thing works . " And they were right . <p> And so sometimes you just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what were going to do . <p> Craig : Yes . And sometimes I will say , listen , we are always the beneficiaries of what I call the law of intentionality . The audience presumes that everything on screen is there because that 's exactly the way you wanted it to be there . So , they will automatically give you a certain amount of leeway because they 're presuming you meant to do it that way . <p> Now , we on our side know a lot of times we did not mean to do it that way at all . <p> John : No , we completely saved that in post and its a completely hacked job . <p> Craig : Or that it was kind of a cheat . Or our backs were against a story wall , whatever it is . But , yes , you just want to try and make that the last resort rather than , I mean , I remember I was in a meeting years ago . I was working on a screenplay at a studio that will remain unnamed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script I was about to write . It was a rewrite . And one of the people said , " Well , you know , what if we did this . " And I said , well you know , I 'm not sure that would make sense , because if that happened then would n't people just simply do this , or this , or this ? <p> And the executive said , " Yeah , but you know , our last hit movie did n't  make any sense . " <p> John : Ugh . <p> Craig : And I said , you know , I suppose you can get to that place , but we should not start there . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : That 's a bad place to start because its not like things get better , and better , and better . laughs I mean , the unfortunate effect of production is things tend to get worse , and worse , and worse . So , yeah , that was dispiriting to say the least . <p> John : One last point about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about some terms used in the story room and Hang a Lantern on it is one of the terms she brought up . And that 's exactly what were talking about is sometimes there 's a thing that could happen or is happening that someone would say like , wait , does that make sense ? And hanging a lantern on it is somebody in the script calling out saying like , yes , I know that this is a thing that maybe does n't  make sense , but this is really what 's happening . <p> There 's sometimes elegant ways to sort of acknowledge to the audience , yes , I see this thing here . You 're not crazy . And its going to be okay . And those are the kinds of things , sometimes they 're throw away lines that you put in there and then you see if you actually need them in the final cut and they can magically easily disappear if no one is asking that question . <p> Craig : Thats right . <p> John : So , let 's get to our One Cool Things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little short film called Interesting Ball . Its by Daniels , who are a directing team that I actually met up at Sundance who are incredibly clever . It is a wonderful story of a bouncing red ball and the people that it encounters . It reminds me a bit of the Red Balloon , but absurdist , and disturbing in ways that I think people will find delightful . <p> Craig : I 'd like to think that I am also absurdist and disturbing in ways that people find occasionally delightful . <p> John : I would say 52% of people find it delightful . <p> Craig : At least . At least 50 to 52% of people . My One Cool Thing is a bit of technology that is currently in I guess alpha or beta , but it seems inevitable that it will be widespread sooner or later . And it comes to us from Skype and Microsoft I believe . Does Microsoft own Skype ? Is that the ? <p> John : I think they own it now . I think they bought it from eBay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Skype Translate and its quite brilliant . So , we know now that we have this ability to talk to our computers and they will transcribe what were saying , speech to text . And what Skype Translate does is essentially take that one step further . So , you are on a Skype call with someone say in Germany . You say something , Skype turns it into text and then translates the text into that persons language and speaks it to them . <p> How freaking cool is that ? Now , if they get this down we essentially have the Babble Fish from <p> John : Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy ? <p> Craig : The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy . Thank you . <p> John : Nice . I have not even read Hitchhikers Guide and I knew what <p> Craig : And I 've read all of those and yet I 'm old now and sometimes , god , is n't that the worst feeling when you 're like <p> John : It is the worst feeling and it happens all the time right now . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on strike . <p> John : I both forget things I should know and I have started to have that thing where its really hard for me to read small print . <p> Craig : Oh , you know what ? I got to tell you , I 've been holding on . I do n't  know why I can . My wife has to wear the glasses . All of my friends hold menus a foot away from their face . I still have total ability to read stuff close up . <p> John : Thats great . Congratulations . <p> Craig : Yeah , well , I know , but I mean , what are we a year away from it falling apart ? <p> John : Yeah . Itll all happen . <p> Craig : Itll all happen . But I can still <p> John : But that will be in 2015. 2014 will come to an end and you will sail out this year with your perfect detailed vision and your vision for a grand world in which the studios come together and push back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have to . <p> John : They have to . <p> Craig : They have to .

So this is a portion of what we talked about originally on the podcast on Thursday . <p> And I 'm also probably a little too reliant on Dropbox . The other thing I would take sort of personally is that all of my stuff , you know , that I 'm working on currently , you know , its on Dropbox . So granted Dropbox is both local and its in the cloud , but I probably rely a little bit too much on that . <p> Craig : Well , I 'm glad you brought that up . First of all , I 'm in the same boat . I have the scripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I would imagine we had the same technological issues . Because when I look back , for instance , at my initial work , you know , way , way back when . So like RocketMan , so that was the first movie I did . Well , when I look at the files for that , which I have , they are unopenable. 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : I 'm looking at files like and I think they were Final Draft 2 files that now show up as exec files . laughs The system has no idea what to do , even the Microsoft Word files are no longer openable . And were talking about like for instance this one that I 'm looking at here was created November 1st , 1996 . Its gone , you know . However , because everybody now moves with this , we know , okay , if there 's a format change we kind of change our files along with the formats . I think we 've probably gotten past that . <p> My worry is this Dropbox worry because like you , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its synced to Dropbox . Well , I know if I go into Dropbox and I delete a file there , it deletes on my local drive . Well , let 's say there was a problem at Dropbox and instead of everything just going kaput , somebody went in and just started deleting stuff . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Its gone , right ? 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Okay . So that brings me to my next point . Well , I 'm going to put this out there for our listeners . How can I essentially double sync backup my stuff ? Wouldnt it be great if I could on my hard drive , I 'm writing something and it knows to sync it both with Dropbox and save with Google Drive , so I 'm double backed . <p> John : Yeah . So in some future world in which this podcast has advertising , one of the very , very common advertisers who is always advertising on podcasts are services like Backblaze . And what they do is basically they make a copy of your hard drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of your situation in this case . So anything that 's ever on your hard drive is also in the cloud . You can download it back off the cloud . <p> Craig : By the way , how sick would it be if this was in fact our first ad ? How insidious of us . <p> John : laughs It would be incredibly insidious . <p> Craig : It would be so insidious . <p> John : And we guarantee you it is not our first ad . <p> Craig : Its not . We are not being paid for this . But its called Backblaze ? Well , they should advertise with us because I 'm going to go check them out now . <p> John : So if you 're listening to some of the tech podcasts , they 're a common sponsor . And there 's another company , or several other companies that do similar kinds of things . So that would be a solution for that type of scenario . <p> What I do realistically is I do backup from one hard drive to another hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is n't really enough . But that would at least give you a snapshot of where you were at . And that 's been fine for sort of our stuff . <p> There 's also kind of lazy backup because sometimes I 'm sending stuff to Stuart . And so in those emails back and forth to me and Stuart , that 's a way I could find some of those files . Again , nowhere close to perfect . <p> Craig : No . <p> John : But , you know , helpful . <p> Craig : Helpful , yeah . Well , I used to have a Time Machine , you know , where you would save all of your stuff on that . They just never worked very well . I just found Apples Time Machine <p> John : They would never work great for me either . <p> Craig : Yeah . So I do n't  know if they 've gotten better at that or if there 's some other solution . Because I think actually and , you know , buying some cheap-o external hard drive that 's I mean , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something stupid ? And just having that and doing some kind of regular backup to that is probably a good idea . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : But god , I mean <p> John : Especially for the working folder , the thing you 're actually working on most commonly , that 's the one you really want to make sure you 're keeping a good clone of . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Now I wanted to also back up to what you were talking about with , you know , you have these old files , these old Final Draft files , these old Microsoft Word files that you ca n't open . That was really one of the big motivations behind Fountain which is this plain text file format we have is that it is just text . So you will never get stuck with that with a Fountain file because you 'll always be able to open it . As long as there 's something that can open any text document , you know , you 'll be able to get to that stuff that 's in those files . <p> Craig : Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John ? <p> John : You could get to it using Final Draft . Final Draft can actually import Fountain just fine . <p> Craig : Oh , they can ? <p> John : They did n't  mean to . It just happens that they can . <p> Craig : laughs But they 're hard at work to see if they can undo it . <p> John : I will say that the good folks at Final Draft who obviously we have had some disagreements , they have engaged on some level to Fountain . They really can kind of import it . Its not a deliberate thing on their side but we sort of designed the format in a way that Final Draft could just get it also . So it is helpful on those fronts . <p> And I would say also Highland , the other app we make , we do n't  ever advertise that we can open old Final Draft files . But if you have an old Final Draft file that you cant get to open or even open in Final Draft , if you change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highland will take a sledgehammer to it and smash it and try to put it back together . And so that 's a thing you might also try with those very old files . <p> Craig : Even something from 1996 ? <p> John : Even something from 1996 . <p> Craig : Wow . Okay . <p> John : Mr. Nima Yousefi , our coder , is very clever and he will smash things up and he will try to put it together . <p> Craig : He is clever . I 've looked in his clever eyes . <p> John : Indeed . <p> Craig : I mean , that 's the thing . If I 'm sitting here worrying about Dropbox and Google , you should definitely be worrying about anybody else . I mean , I cant imagine Google in particular , I just do n't  essentially , its like when they talk about earthquake insurance in California . <p> So earthquake insurance in California is regulated because basically no insurance company wanted to ever give anybody an earthquake insurance in the States and you have to . And here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the FAIR Plan is you pay a whole bunch of money every year and then if there 's an earthquake , they will take care of damage to your structure . But after you pay a 20% premium , that is 20% of the value of the home . <p> John : Yeah . Its huge . <p> Craig : You know , and so what I was always told is , " You know , if the earthquakes that bad , you got bigger problems than insurance . Like , basically everything is gone . " <p> John : Yeah . That 's what I was always told about , especially land in Los Angeles is that the land itself is what 's worth money , as to your point , the structure is n't . So the structure will be destroyed but the land is still the land . And the earthquake is not going to destroy the land probably . <p> Craig : Its actually concerning to me because I loved it . But what concerned me was , " Oh , no . Now this is the thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food industry to jam more calories into a thing and more flavor into a thing . This is the most engineered its crack . They made crack , right ? <p> John : They made crack . <p> Craig : Like Guardians of the Galaxy , they 're , " Stop drinking coffee . We have this new thing called cocaine and you can freebase it . Its freebasing cocaine . " And now Mad Max its like , " No , no , no . We mixed it with baking powder and we cooked it into a thing and now its crack . " Its scary . I just worry that this is the thing everyones going to chase because that movie is going to open huge and it should . It should . <p> John : It should . So our good friend Kelly Marcel had some hand in it . I do n't  know if shell ever want to come on the show and talk about what her involvement was . But it sounded just like madness to make it . Its been in post for forever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . <p> Craig : Well , I mean , I understand why it would have been in post forever . Everything looks like a processed shot . Processed shot , I sound like an old man . Everything looks like a VFX shot . <p> John : But it was n't effects . So that 's the whole magical thing about it . So like most of what you see , they actually did . So all those cars flipping and everything going nuts , that all actually really happened . So except where like the giant <p> Craig : Well , yeah . No , that is happening . <p> John : Except for the giant storm . <p> Craig : Sure . <p> John : Apparently , its like crazy real . <p> Craig : But everything looks like something needed to be done in post . In other words , yeah , we definitely shot that car doing that but there 's going to be things we have to paint out . Or the whole background world needs to be painted in . Or it just seemed like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of work . <p> John : They were in Namibia for forever making that movie . So I was excited to see what they did . <p> Craig : Sick . It looks sick . <p> John : It looks so good . Our next bit of news news . So last week we recorded the episode and I almost mentioned it on the episode last week but I was n't sure we were going to be able to launch . So Writer Emergency Pack which was the little deck of cards for writers when you get in a jam and you sort of get stuck . It was a Kickstarter we did back at the end of last year . They 're now finally available in stores . So you can find them at WriterEmergency.com . You can find them at the John August Store . You can also find them on Amazon . So just search for Writer Emergency Pack and we are there on Amazon . <p> So I wrote a Kickstarter update where I talked through sort of the whole process of how you actually put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things out because it was crazy . It took me three months to sort of put it all together . Like literally just clicking the buy button in the John August Store , there 's like six different companies involved to like make that transaction happen , which has just been nuts . <p> But its actually working . And people are buying them and people like them . So they are available and out there in the world . So if you missed the Kickstarter and you want one , you can now go get one for yourself . <p> Craig : Spectacular . If its on Amazon.com , can I get it through Fresh Delivery ? Will it show up in the morning before I wake up ? <p> John : I do n't  think it will show up with Fresh Delivery . But you can get Prime Delivery . <p> Craig : Oh , okay . <p> John : So you can get that sort of sweet ass Prime Delivery even the next day delivery . So that 's pretty good . <p> Craig : Prime is gorgeous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about like sort of stealth advertising and whether we want to do advertising . This is a perfect chance for us to test whether advertising will be annoying on this podcast if we were to add it . <p> So let me try to do this properly . Our practice sponsor this week is Writer Emergency Pack , an illustrated deck of useful ideas for writers to help you get unstuck . Last year , it was the most backed card project in Kickstarter history . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Now its available for anyone to buy . It makes a great gift for writers , which I suspect is pretty much anyone listening to this podcast . <p> You can find Writer Emergency Pack on Amazon . Just search for Writer Emergency . But we have a special offer for Scriptnotes listeners . Go to WriterEmergency.com and click the buy button to buy it on the John August Store . When you check out , use the special promo code Scriptnotes to save 10% on your order and help us figure out whether our listeners will actually use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character in the advertisements is going to be Golly Gee guy . laughs <p> John : Absolutely . I did n't  know that was possible . laughs <p> Craig : What ? Save $10 ? No , I 'm still on Backblaze over here . And were not getting paid for that at all . <p> John : So last week we talked about K.C. Scotts script , This Is Working . And I just loved that conversation . I went back and listened to the episode . I was just delighted with it . Have you listened to it again ? <p> Craig : I listened to it and I thought it was really good . And we did get a lot of really good feedback . People seemed to want this some more . They , you know , " Do it every week . " Well , no . Look , you cant have your birthday every week , you know . This kind of thing or when we break down a whole movie , its actually work . And we have our own work . So <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig : Yeah . We already have jobs . So that 's something that we will do not quite as frequently as many of you would hope . But I was really encouraged by all the positive feedback . And I thought it was particularly good to have Franklin on because it was nice that we had that other perspective , the non-screenwriter perspective . <p> John : Yeah . So we got a lot of great comments on Facebook and Twitter . So thank you all for sharing your thoughts . <p> It was also fun . A couple of people wrote in , like before the episode , saying like , " These are my thoughts . " Like one woman did her sort of breakdown analysis of where she thought the work was and her notes on it before the episode aired . And she was right on . So it was great to see that there was excitement and consensus about it . <p> So , yeah , I would love to do this again too . I think its not going to be a very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was really a fun challenge . <p> And Kurt , K.C. Scott , was just fantastic . So I wanted to share a little bit more about the emails we had back and forth after the episode aired . So , a little more detail about Kurt . <p> He writes , " Im married . Were expecting our first child in August . I spent most of my career in progressive politics and now I do research for a labor union . Ive been writing for a while , a mix of short fiction and sports blogging mostly until three years ago when I began writing feature length specs . TV is intriguing but my passion is film . " <p> And that was a question , like is he a TV person or is he a film person ? And he says he s a film person . <p> Craig : Good . <p> John : " As my screenwriter career goes , I 'm willing to be patient but also aggressive , whether that means flying to LA for meetings or taking time off from my day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economic security means something to me . But both my wife and I are on-board with this , so whatever it takes , I 'll do it . <p> " As far as travel to LA goes , the good thing about my job is that I 'm there once a month for work . We have an office in Commerce City , plus I get to bank Southwest miles , and I have a Southwest credit card , and buddies will put me up if I need to stay for a few days . I 'm working every angle to cut costs , no choice really . " <p> Craig : Yeah . I like that . You definitely want to cut costs . People sometimes feel like they need to invest in a new place to make it seem real . Its that syndrome of , " I 'm starting a business , so I 'm going to spend a ton of money to make that business look like a real business . And now , I just need customers . " Well , with screenwriting , you do n't  need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have to travel to LA , you know , and you do n't  have a lot of money or you have people that are relying on you , like a child on the way , then I just always advise to be as cheap as you can . <p> Just be cheap . Spend nothing . Spend as little as possible . There 's no value in and by the way , no romance in being the person who is putting hotel rooms on credit cards because you want to feel better about yourself . <p> John : Yeah . What I loved about Kurts follow-up email there was that he s both all in but he s not sort of like all in . He s not , you know , " Oh , I 'm going to quit everything . I 'm going to move to LA and start over , start fresh . " 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : You know , I think you have a moment where you can do that right after college , where like there 's really you have no commitments to anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to start somewhere , why not start there . " <p> So here 's a guy who has a kid on the way . He has a pretty good job in Oakland . Hed love to become a screenwriter , but he s doing exactly the right things . He s sort of iterating . This was n't the first thing he wrote . He s written a bunch . He s sort of built up his experience he sort of has . By the time he shows up in LA , hell have some sort of screenwriting capital . He has stuff he can show . He has a plan for what he wants to do next . <p> But he s also being smart . And he s not like getting himself a fancy apartment on the west side . He s like going to sleep on some couches , and take those meetings , and get stuff started . And I think that 's going to be a key to success for Kurt . <p> Craig : I have a question for you . So I actually was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , or as I call him , Mike Burorgaberbium . And he listened to that podcast and really enjoyed it . And he said , " I bet this guys phone is going to start ringing now . " <p> Now , I was n't sure because , you know , he s got to rewrite his script and people are going to want to read the script , and eventually hell put it online at The Black List . But what do you think ? Do you think his phone is going to start ringing ? <p> John : Well , his phone would have literally started ringing because his phone number was on the cover page originally . <p> John : So he sent a cleaner version that has his phone number off of it . But I hope that he would be getting some direct emails from folks who liked it and folks who want to pursue him . If I were a junior agent , not just in a big agency but really kind of any agency or a manager , I would say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like he s a really good writer and he s really smart and seems to get it . " These are the things you want if you 're an agent or a manager . <p> So I think a month from now , let 's follow up with him and see 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Well reach out to him and sort of what is happening next for him . <p> Craig : Yeah . I mean , I guess well find out if anybody listens to this show . <p> John : Yeah . Well see . So the thing I appreciate I think most about Kurts work is that he had good craftsmanship . Like the work was good on the page , but he also seemed to be approaching it from the right perspective . And over the spring break , I read a book that kind of reminded me of the same idea . Its this book called So Good They Ca n't Ignore You by Cal Newport , and I 'll have a link for it at the show notes . <p> But what I liked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What do you want to do with your life ? " Rather than saying like , " Oh , you should follow your passion . Like there 's a dream job out there , you just have to find your dream job , " he said , " Instead , what you need to do is figure out what is it that you are good at by just doing it and seeing how it all sort of works out . " So saying like some people will make themselves miserable by switching from job to job or like theyll get stuck in sort of the hard part of it and never realize there 's a place beyond that they 're trying to push to . <p> And what I liked about what Kurt was doing was he was at it every day and he was clearly focusing on getting the best things he can written and not trying to pursue screenwriting as a sort of lottery career , the sort of this dream of winning it . At no point in our conversations does Kurt ever bring up the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd write this script and sell it for a bunch of money and then be a screenwriter . " That 's never been part of the conversation . <p> Craig : No . I mean , he s doing that thing that I talk about where you take your plan A and make a plan B , take your plan B , make a plan A. My guess is that he s probably pretty darn good at his job . And even if that job is in terms of his long-term view , plan B , if his plan A is be a screenwriter , he s probably made that plan B job as plan A. <p> He shows up on time , he does his work , he thinks , he applies himself , he has energy , he supports a family , helps support a family . And then he also does this , which is how I think it should be done . I love this advice about follow your passion being flawed . <p> Its a little bit like saying , " Look , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , follow your passion . When you meet somebody and your heart is pounding and you 're sweating and you have that like rush , that chemical rush of just falling head over heels , that 's it , get married that day . " No . That 's not what love is . That 's just infatuation , right ? Love is the product of the work . Its the product of the commitment . <p> John : Yeah . Falling head over heels , that is , you know , lust and attraction . And its wonderful . And there 's a reason why we have so many great things written about that . But that 's not marriage . <p> Craig : No . <p> John : Marriage is , you know , the getting up and doing it again every single day . And so figuring out how you can be good at being married is like how you can be good at being in any kind of career . Its like how do you make the situation that you 're in as good as it can be . That does n't  mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> John : It means looking for what it is about the situation that you can work on it and sort of continuously kind of get better at . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And thinking back to sort of all of our friends who have become screenwriters and trying to find unifying themes , because so often the knock becomes , " Oh , well , you had this access , you had these sort of magical things that happened . " You know what , some of those things are true , and some of those things were luck , and some of those things were , you know , starting on , you know , second base . <p> But some of it is also just the constant practice . And when you sit down to write , that first 10 minutes for me is generally kind of awful . And then its like , " Oh my God , if I can push through to 15 minutes , then I 'll be done . " And then Ive written an hour . Its the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second script , and then finishing the third script . <p> No one that I know sold their first script . No one sold the first thing they ever wrote . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And if that is the standard , then people are going to start their career and be disappointed and look for reasons that are n't  their own reasons about why it did n't  happen . <p> In this book that I was talking about , the Cal Newport book , he talks about the difference between people who were in like a high school band and the people who you know , like a high school rock band and the people who became big musical stars . And it tends to be people who were just disciplined about practicing . <p> They were looking at every day how can I get better . They were looking at like how can I have fun . They were looking at how can I do this really hard work and be better at it for having done the really hard work . <p> And I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see that really hard work . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And so we just assume like , " Oh , it must have been easy for them . " And in most cases , it was n't easy at all . <p> Craig : Thats right . A lot of this is about shedding our romantic understanding of what success is , our romantic understanding of what it means to be a professional , and our romantic understanding of what passion is all about . What he says here is the better you get at something , the more it becomes a passion , a true passion . <p> When we are children , we fall in love with things and we do them for a month or two and then we stop . And you have a daughter , I 'm sure you 've seen her go through these phases where she becomes obsessed with something . And then <p> John : Oh , yeah . Rainbow looms . Oh my God , like she could not get enough rainbow looms and making these little elastic bracelets . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Craig : Thats right . My son was obsessed with rocks for five months . I have a drawer full of these rocks . laughs But he do n't  look at the rocks anymore . But that 's normal . Thats part of growing up . <p> What I see sometimes in a distressing way in people who are recent college graduates is that they 're still doing it . And the mistake that they 're making is they 're mistaking initial excitement and novelty and the romance of the what-can-be for something that 's real . What is real is the day-after-day work that exists when the novelty is long gone . <p> There is nothing new about writing a screenplay for you or for me in a sense . But because we are professionals and we practice and we try and get better , we are inspired to do better . There is something beyond the rush of the novelty . There is a true professional joy , I think . And that just requires commitment . <p> John : So I 'm just speculating here . But I 'm looking at sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at agents . And so youd never just become a talent agent . There 's a whole hierarchy you go through . <p> And so you start in the mail room , and you work your way up to a desk where you 're answering the phone for an agent , and then you might become a junior agent , and you might finally have clients of your own . That training ground , those initial steps are terrible . And they 're sort of deliberately terrible . And it is not to punish anybody , but just so you can actually see from the ground up this is how it all works , this is how it all fits together . <p> And so if somebody bails on it saying like , " I hated being in the mail room , " well , okay , you hated being in the mail room but that really was n't what you were trying to do anyway . That wasnt what being an agent was . That was just the initial thing . And if you can push through it , if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail room that I can figure stuff out , you are the person who 's going to move ahead . <p> I remember having an internship at Universal , the summer between my two years at Stark Program , and I had the most boring job . I was the intern below three assistants to the head of physical production at Universal . And there was literally nothing for me to do but like file a couple of papers every day . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : But one of the things I recognized I could do is there was this moment , like there were 10 minutes after lunch where my boss , Donna , was sort of in a happy place . <p> Craig : laughs <p> John : And so during that happy place , I 'd go <p> Craig : laughs You mean drunk ? <p> John : laughs She was just sort of like sedated . Like there were like no crises for like just a little while . <p> Craig : Oh , I thought she just had like a three martini lunch or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great stories from that summer . <p> But one of the things I recognized is Im filing all these papers and there 's all these budgets . At that time they were shooting Greedy and The Flintstones and a few other movies . And I was reading through all the budgets because the budgets are in front of me , I 'm going to read them . <p> And if I saw things I did n't  understand , I could ask her like two questions . I could ask her those two questions . And if they were smart questions , she would say like , " Well , that was actually a good question . " Like she could see that I was actually paying attention and was moving forward . I was getting something out of this . And that helped me there and it got me a better internship at the end of the summer . <p> Craig : What 's interesting is that these other job paths in Hollywood will quickly burn out , I think , the dilettantes . You can say you want to be a filmmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion and that misery , you come out the other end , and you do n't  want to do it anymore , I understand . And if you do , you do . <p> Working at an agency , working at a studio , there is that long military march through the ranks . But not so with screenwriting . Its the one gig . Its like the I guess , acting , a little bit , too . Acting and screenwriting , you could just keep banging your head against that wall for a while . <p> John : But here 's where I think there is an opportunity for writers . And maybe this is part of the reason why television has gotten so much better . If you look at television , there is that system where you work your way up through . So , yes , you 've gone off and you 've written your own specs and people are hiring you based on material you 've written before , but there 's also people who get hired on as writers assistants or get hired on as sort of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the writers all the time but are not actually being allowed to write the scripts . <p> And those are the jobs in which if you can show that you are a smart person , that you 're adding value , that you are getting your job and understanding how to push beyond past it , that 's a real opportunity . <p> I have friends who are on the fourth season of a TV show and they are remarkably capable . And because they 've been capable , they 've been given more and more responsibilities in terms of like not just being on the set , but like shadowing the director and getting to do things that a writer in their position would n't normally get to do . Because they have not only done their job well , but theyve recognized , " You know what , I see what this next thing is and I can ask those smart questions and I can be trusted to do those next things . " <p> Craig : We do n't  have that in features , obviously . <p> John : No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seems remarkably free of a sense of entitlement . And that is a lot of what the problem is . When we say chase your dream , when someone says , " I 'm going to keep chasing my dream because its my dream and I believe in it and I know that its what I 'm supposed to do , " what I hear is " Im entitled to this . I 'm entitled to it . I 'm just going to keep chasing because Im supposed to have it . " 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : You 're not supposed to have anything . You get what you earn . And there are remarkable stories of people with extraordinary talent who squander it because they 're just waiting for somebody to give them something . And of course there are people who have no talent who are also waiting . <p> And , you know , when you talk about that TV room , it sounds to me like none of those people got there and said , " Well , look , just privately , I 'm smarter and better at this than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I 'm going to wait for them to realize that . " Okay . laughs Good luck . Good luck . <p> John : This all reminds me of like sort of the final thing that Cal Newports book points out called " The Law of Remarkability " which says , " For a project to succeed , it should be remarkable in two different ways . First , it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others . Second , it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking . " <p> And this thing , it makes me think back to Kurts script because , you know , were talking about sort of in the preamble to it , were talking about how scripts get passed around and how the Black List formed . And that really is something like you need something that you think is so good that you comment on it to other people . And , you know , the network of Hollywood is set up in such a way that things can get passed around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just writing his scripts in Oakland and never showed them to anyone , there would be nothing for anyone to remark about . There would n't be any sort of venue for that to be happening in . So by sharing it with us , but also sharing it in screenwriting competitions or blcklst.com or other places , sending it out there in the world , it gives people a chance to talk about , " You know what ? This is really good . " <p> Craig : Well , I like that second point . It must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking . And part of what that says to me is that the venue has to be authentic . It has to be valid and meaningful because in general in Hollywood and I think in every business , people remark on things that have been given some sort of imprimatur . Somebody that they trust has said , " I like this . " <p> So the Black List service essentially is that , right ? Its a venue that was designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think that what we do with our Three Page Challenge , were trusted I think . So hopefully , people will see our opinions as trustworthy . And it does n't  mean they have to like what Kurt did . But what it means is that they 're going to take it seriously . <p> Its also my problem with a lot of the contests and pitch fests and all the stuff that go on because what they 're doing is they 're selling themselves as a legitimate venue when they are n't  really compelling . You 'll see people say things like , " Well , you know , I was a quarter finalist at the , you know , blah blah blah contest . " <p> And I 'll think no one cares . No one cares if you win that contest . I think they care about Nicholl . I think they care about Austin , the , " Oh , I was selected as a top ten pitch at the pitch fest blah blah blah . " Nobody cares . No one cares . <p> And so , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podcast , when people tell you , " Give us money because were going to offer you a legitimate venue that real professionals are watching , " almost always that 's not true . Because they watch very little . Frankly , if they watch even one venue , that 's more than most of their co-workers . <p> John : I do n't  know if there 's any ones that are meaningful enough that I can recommend them . <p> Craig : There you go . <p> John : But this also reminds me of what your advice was to Malcolm Spellman and Tim Talbott when they came to with Balls Out . They were writing as The Robotard 8000 . They came through with this crazy script . <p> And I think you recognized two things . First off , that it was remarkable enough that people would talk about it because it was just outrageous and it had a compelling thing , it had hooks to it that people could talk about which is great . Second , you said , " You know what ? Put it up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let people see it and let people talk about it and let it get it out there in the world because it is , you know , special and remarkable . " <p> And so not to worry about selling this as a spec script but letting people see what this thing was . And so I think you had both of these instincts from the start . <p> Craig : Well , that one was an interesting case because I felt I wasnt thinking in terms of venue but trying to put it into context of what Cal Newport has written with his book . That seemed to me like they should create their own venue , that their whole , their entire aesthetic was , " Were not like anything you 've ever seen . Were not called what you think , we do n't  write what you think . So were going to create our own thing . " <p> And they did and the website that they made , so their own venue featured is it Gamera ? Was that the turtle ? laughs It looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah . <p> Craig : It was like a huge monster turtle swinging on a gymnastics thing . It was so bizarre and just right . And then from there , they got picked up to the Black List , not the service , but the actual annual Black List . And they made the annual Black List . So that was the second level of legitimacy . <p> And curiously enough , we just did a reading of that script , Balls Out , for the Black List and its on a podcast that 's coming up . And so I did the narration . But really good actors read the parts including Paul Scheer and Jason Mantzoukas . So you should check that out . It came out really well , I thought . <p> Craig : I do n't  know the name of it . laughs So I feel like I 'm still okay . <p> John : Stuart will research the name and well put a link in the show notes so you can find <p> Craig : Its going to be on a thing <p> John : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say filthy words ? <p> Craig : Oh , my God . There were a few of those where I just thought , " Well , if people complain , I 'll just say I was reading what I was handed . " <p> John : So Craig also wrote up some great bits of advice on the outline that I thought were terrific . So this is camera directions for screenwriters . Craig , talk us through what words screenwriters should be using if they 're using camera directions in their script . <p> Craig : Well , I thought this was only fair . I mean , here we are , were the guys saying , " Oh , ignore these people with their stupid rules . Like never put camera directions in scripts . " But its not fair . I do n't  think for us to say , " No , no . Go ahead and do it , " if we do n't  talk about how you should do it . And this all comes under the general title , " You ca n't pan up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pan up to find . " Okay , so let 's just talk about some of these terms and what they mean . None of them , the mistakes that you could make with this are going to ruin your screenplay . Do n't  get me wrong . If you write a terrific script , nobody will care . But some of these things are just binary , they 're right or wrong . <p> So panning . You ca n't pan up . A pan is essentially the camera version of shaking your head no . The camera is on a spot and it does n't  go up or down . It hinges left and right . The opposite of that is tilting . You can tilt up and down . That 's the camera equivalent of nodding yes , right ? So sometimes you want to tilt up or tilt down . <p> But just think about in your mind a head moving no or a head moving yes . Think about how that means the cameras moving in relation to what 's in front of you . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really want to do is keep the camera pointing forward in a certain horizontal way , but moving the entire camera to the left or right or up or down . <p> So in that case , what you want to talk about is move right or move left . You can also say dolly right or dolly left if you want . And then for forward and backwards , you can say push in , pull out . By the way , dolly right and dolly left , those are n't  technically right either . You 're supposed to dolly forward and dolly back , and truck right and truck left . But trucking is a weird term that nobody uses really . <p> John : Yeah . No one ever says truck . <p> Craig : Right . So I think dolly is okay there . Sometimes I will see this mistake , people will say , " Zoom in on . " And I think , " Well , do you mean zoom in or do you mean push in ? " So two very different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John : Yeah , if you 're making a 70s paranoia thriller , then yes , zooming in is absolutely correct . But rarely we call that a zoom . You know , there might be some case where you really want that effect of , you know , the zoom , or you want sort of the vertigo zoom . You know , if that really is appropriate to your moment , call it out . But that 's rarely what 's called a dolly zoom , that 's often what that 's referred to . <p> Craig : Yeah . Its a dolly zoom . <p> John : If that really is appropriate , that 's fine . Go and do it . But most cases , you know , you are moving in , you are , you know , revealing . A lot of these things I find in my own script , I will say , " Move to reveal . " That way , I 'm not saying it has to be a dolly or a pan or whatever else . Its just like the camera does something to show us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . Yeah . You 're not there so you 're not sure if its going to be right or left or back or forth . But the point is move the camera to reveal something . <p> So when you 're pushing in , you 're moving the whole camera forward . And that means that everything in the screen starts to you get closer to everything sort of at the same time . <p> A zoom is a lens . On a zoom , the camera does n't  move at all . Instead , the camera operator is turning a lens and changing the focal length of the lenses they turn . So what happens is its almost like you 're blowing up the image . Rather than moving , you 're blowing it up . <p> So if you want to see an example of zoom in Quentin Tarantino will still use them to ironic effect in Kill Bill when the Bride shows up to train with Pai Mei , he does lots of zooms on Pai Meis face because he s the whole thing , I mean , even the film has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70s karate movie . So that 's a zoom . You generally are n't  going to be zooming . <p> If you want the camera to go up or down without tilting , right , then you could talk about booming up or camera rises or crane up or crane down or boom down . <p> And then let 's talk about some angles . There are times when you want to be looking down on something and there are times when you want to be looking up at something . You can say we look down on or we look up at . Or you can also say high angle on , low angle . Low angle means you 're down low looking up . High angle , you 're up high looking down . <p> John : If you ever get confused just think a giant is high . What would a giant be looking at ? A dwarf is low , what would a dwarf be looking up at ? That 's the difference between high angle and low angle . <p> Again , you 're not likely to have to call these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very specific case that really needs to be in the script if you 're going to be using either one of those . <p> Unmotivated camera direction is a bad thing to do when you 're making a movie , as a director , as a cinematographer , you do n't  move the camera pointlessly . You want to move it for a reason , right ? Okay , what 's your reason ? Maybe your reason is just to create a feeling . Maybe your reason is to see something specific . <p> As a screenwriter , you want to make sure that if you 're calling out a specific camera move or angle , its for a purpose . Ask these questions , why does the camera need to move ? Why do I have to see what it is showing me ? What information do I learn from what it showing me ? And through those , the answers to those questions , you will have intentional motivated camera direction . <p> John : Absolutely true . And I was thinking back to recent things Ive written . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and we stay behind the room . The camera turns around and very slowly creeps in on something . That 's the definition of intentionality . Its like there 's nothing making us look over in that direction so the choice to do that makes it really clear something very big and unsettling is about to happen and be ready for it . Thats motivation . But so I have to write all that stuff into the script . <p> But in most cases , you 're not going to do that at all . And so its not going to matter to me whether somethings a two shot or a single shot or how were dollying or how were moving through these things . <p> Sometimes , you want to call out a general style for how things are supposed to feel . And so there 's moments in the script that definitely have a different feel . And I would talk about sort of like there were times I would say sort of very loose documentary style footage . That 's great , but rarely am I calling out stuff otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing now , there are two characters who are scared to go somewhere . Theyre scared to cross something . And they decide the only way they 're going to be able to do it is if they do it together . And so they sort of push themselves together and start walking slowly . <p> And then I call out a shot on their feet to see how close their feet are kind of and how trembly they are . You know , look , you can watch movies and see a shot like that and go , " Oh , you know what ? Its nice to occasionally look at the feet . That 's cool . " Not good enough . Why am I looking at feet ? What am I learning from the feet ? I need to know . <p> So unmotivated camera direction is just like unmotivated dialogue or action . Do n't  talk to me if I do n't  need to hear the words or they do n't  mean a damn thing . And do n't  show me something that does n't  mean anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you have a moment where you know why you want to do it and you know what the audience is going to get out of it , here 's a sense of what the vocabulary is so you do n't  write pan up . <p> John : Do n't  write pan up . Never write pan up . <p> Craig : You ca n't pan up . <p> John : So on the topics of the words on the page , Dave wrote in with question . He s writing , " My protagonist is traveling from neighborhood to neighborhood . For my scene headings , should it be as generic as EXT . NEIGHBORHOOD DAY and EXT . NEIGHBORHOOD- TODAY ? Or do I need to be more specific ? " Craig ? <p> Craig : Well , you know , I think you need to be much more specific than that . First of all , there 's no such thing as neighborhood . Even if you were in one neighborhood , I would n't write neighborhood . That means nothing . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : That is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . You need to define my space . EXT . BLANKETY .. WILLIAMSTOWN DAY , a da-da-da kind of place . Fine . He crosses out of Williamstown into EXT , da-da-da , a new kind of place . Heres what its like . " <p> No , of course I need to know . Neighborhood is , that 's like EXT . BUILDING . <p> John : Absolutely . Or INT . ROOM . <p> Craig : Yeah . laughs <p> John : What is a room ? I have no idea what a room is . So what Craig is pointing out is that youd probably have both in your scene header something that encapsulates the idea of what the place is , so a name for like its Williamstown . And then the first time that you are there , you 're giving us a sense of flavor of what this thing feels like . The next time we see Williamstown , were like , " Oh , its that neighborhood . " But you have to be really specific in those scene headers so we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John : You do n't  want it over describe in the scene header . Do n't  throw us 15 words in the scene header . But just give it a name so that once we so that sticks in our head . And it may be a very good idea to make sure you 're not naming two different locations really similar things . So if you have Williamsport and Williamstown , we wont be able to tell the difference . <p> Craig : Correct . Now , if you have a situation where your character is on a bus or a train and the ideas is they 're traveling rapidly through , you know , from place to place or its montagey , you can shorthand it because well never know , were never going to be there . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : So we do n't  know the name and we do n't  need to know the name and we could just say , you know Jim looks out of a train as it passes through , you know , urban blight , suburban blah , blah , gentrification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . So just think to yourself , some locations scout has to go out and figure this out . Where am I sending them ? They need to know . You know , neighborhood 1 and neighborhood 2 tells nobody anything . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : All right . <p> John : 100% agree . Next question , Brian writes , " Ive written an animated pilot script and I 'm wondering if I should denote anywhere in the script that it is in fact animated . I made the mistake at an early table read of not indicating this and most of the notes I received assumed it was live action . Like , It would be impossible to make , or , You cant train a cobra to do that , et cetera . " <p> Craig : laughs You cant train a cobra to speak . <p> John : " As my script is now getting in the hands of agents , producers and et cetera , I 'm wondering if there 's anything I should add in the script itself to make it clear to the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion ? " What would you do Craig ? <p> Craig : Very simply . Let 's say the title of this were , you know , John the Cobra , then I would say John the Cobra an animated pilot by Brian , right ? Just put it right on the title page , put the word animated pilot and this way no one will even get to page one without knowing its animated . I mean , yes , for sure , I think you 've got to just call it out . <p> John : I think you got to call it out too . But I 've had this actually happen to me . There 's a project I wrote recently , you know , I say recently , three years ago , and people who read it were like , " Oh yeah , so this is animated , right ? " " Like no , no , no , I really mean for this to be live action . " They 're like , " Oh . " And its like , " Oh , I really should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , 90 minutes reading the script . " So , that 's also a great case for whatever were going to call the intermediary page between the title page and the first page . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : If you have something to talk about like this is the animation style that its going for , that 's the perfect place to do it . <p> Craig : Yeah , for sure . Yeah , but no , you need to make that clear . You cant train a cobra to do that . <p> John : Never . <p> Craig : That cobra is having a discussion with a rat . laughs How do we do that ? <p> John : But Craig , could you train cobra to fight polio ? <p> Craig : No , but I 'll tell you what . You can train polio to fight glioblastoma multiforme and that is my One Cool Thing . Look , its like now Segue Man has gotten a sidekick ? laughs <p> Craig : I 'm Transitioned Boy . Anyway , so here 's my One Cool Thing . Polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that used to kill and paralyze millions of people and was finally eradicated by vaccines and use it to treat glioblastoma multiforme . Glioblastoma multiforme is pretty much the worst diagnosis you can get from a neurologist . <p> John : I do n't  know what it is . So tell me what that is . <p> Craig : Glioblastoma multiforme is a kind of brain tumor . It is malignant , it is incredibly aggressive and it essentially becomes inoperable . And here 's why its operable . Its very operable , but pointlessly operable . Because what happens is theyll go and theyll take out as much of it as they can . But its impossible to get 100% of it . So they can literally remove 99% of this glioblastoma multiforme tumor and the tiny remaining cancer cells will just go bonkers again . It is incredibly aggressive . <p> And the deal with glioblastoma multiforme is that if you were diagnosed with this , you 're looking at anywhere from four months to four years . Nobody makes it past five years , period , the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's with surgery and radiation and chemo . And the chemo , they say , will give you maybe two months . I mean , its the worst . <p> Well , so laughs a group of brilliant people have come up with this idea and its showing early promise . Its not perfect yet but its showing early promise . What they 've done is they have engineered poliovirus . Theyve taken poliovirus and theyve genetically altered it . So , if you are afraid of genetically modified organisms , I 'm so sorry , they 're wonderful . And they actually spliced it with some genetic code from the common cold . One of the things about polio is that its really good at replicating itself . <p> Well , this polio is n't so good at replicating itself but what it does do is it attaches to these very specific receptors on the cancer cells themselves and starts to destroy the cancer cells without infecting healthy cells . Its kind of brilliant . It is incredibly painstaking . They have to figure out exactly how much to put in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyve got to wait . And essentially what happens is the polio is n't really killing the cancer cells because its a weakened poliovirus anyway . What the polio is doing is turning the cancer cells which normally exist like ninjas that the good guys cant see and they 're basically shining a light on them , so that the immune system which normally can not tell that the cancer cell is bad , now sees , " Oh my God , its polio " . <p> And it goes rushing in to kill the cancer cells and they 've had some initial very positive results , not perfect yet by any stretch . But this could be a big deal as in they could , if this is refined , this could actually cure a number of and it seems to have already cured a few people and this was an incurable disease so that 's just a remarkable breakthrough and I hope that it pays off in the way that they 're thinking it eventually will . <p> John : Yeah , I hope it works well . I just have this real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am Legend . And it has one of the best intros to a movie Ive ever seen . Its basically this CNN interview with Emma Thompson and she 's like so the interviewer says like , " So youve cured cancer ? " Its like , " Yes , we 've cured cancer , " and then smash cut to the end of civilization and basically they genetically modified something that became the disease that killed everybody . <p> Craig : Well , this is where Hollywood makes me angry because its easy for us that 's a great way to get into a movie and it is . The problem is that what is narratively convenient for us is actually damaging the credibility of really good science . Because in truth , that 's not what we should be scared of . What we should be scared of is glioblastoma multiforme , not these fascinating treatments to cure it . <p> So , yes , ever since War of the Worlds , I mean we 've always dreaded the virus , you now . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Now , we dread vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught that science is messing with the primal forces of nature . Yeah , well , that 's how we got aspirin and that 's how we got Advil and that 's why do n't  all die when were 40 . So I 'm entirely in favor of these things . <p> And by the way , if you read about this polio treatment of glioblastoma , you 'll see that it was subject to some of the most rigorous controls by the federal government . And they were really careful . <p> John : Oh , I could imagine why . <p> Craig : Yeah , they were really <p> John : Its polio . <p> Craig : Its polio , you know , so they were really , really careful . And they did a spectacular job . So , here 's hoping . <p> John : Hurray . My One Cool Thing is the resolution of a lawsuit about Threes Company and an Off-Broadway play called 3C which was a parody of Threes Company or a very specific satire based around Threes Company . <p> So what happened is a federal judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. District Court , a rule that the play 3C did not violate the copyright of Threes Company . So , its a complicated situation , so essentially there was this Off-Broadway production of this play called 3C and it was essentially a parody of Threes Company . <p> And from what I understand , I never saw it but it was happening in the same time we were doing Big Fish , is so basically all of the constructs of Threes Company , so like the set and the basic characters and sort of what their situation was and played it as if they were all really real . So like what if Jack Tripper really were gay and were around all these sort of homophobic insults . And like what if all this leering and all the stuff this happened sort of around him . <p> And so it was a very pointed thing . And it got sort of mixed reviews . But it also got a lot of concern by the copyright holders . So its a company called DLT Entertainment owns the copyright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said , " Uh-uh-uh . " And they filed a cease and desist . <p> And so this playwright was stuck in this weird situation where the play closed . And he could n't publish the play , he could n't find other stages for the play , he couldnt do anything because there was this specter that this other company might come after him . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : So , he went and sued them and basically this is the first rule and it says , you know what , this was fair use . This was a fair way to sort of take this existing property and , you know , satirize it the same way that an SNL sketch can satirize Scandal or any other sort of popular cultural thing . So , I thought it was really fascinating . I could feel for both sides of the situation as a person who might create the thing that gets parodied . Like , " Well , at what point do I have the opportunity to sort to say like , You cant do that , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much no point . I mean , that 's fair use . Its pretty clear about the parody exception and then the Supreme Court expanded that concept as well to include what it meant to parody public figures . <p> As somebody that did parody , you know , we would n't have been able to do a thing if we did n't  have that fair us . I mean we were copying things down to when and we did the here 's how close we were . We , in Scary Movie 4 , part of the parody was the movie Saw . So , we recreated the bathroom , the iconic bathroom from Saw . And we did it so well that when they went back I think and made another Saw , they used part of our set . <p> Because people buy sets back and forth from each other all the time . And I think we even had part of their set when we made ours . So the key is , is there any chance that people are going to confuse these two things ? There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play that you just described and think , " Ah , this is Threes Company but on stage . " No , its not . Its clearly not . Its clearly parody and I 'm not surprised . I do n't  like it when people try and get heavy-handed about copyright stuff because I do believe in copyright . And I do believe in the rights of intellectual property holders . <p> So , when they truly are bullies , I think it weakens the general cause because there are people out there who want everything to be free all the time , you know . And I 'm not one of those people . So , I 'm glad that this prevailed . I presume its going to stay this way because it just sounds like a classic case of fair use to me . <p> John : I agree . It sounds like fair use . But part of the reason why I want to bring it up is because if you were this playwright , you know , he was correct and was ultimately vindicated but this is two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his play to anybody . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And so just as a warning that if you 're going to walk into dangerous waters , you might ultimately be right . You might have the law on your side , that wont necessarily help you for a period of time until you get those decisions back . <p> Craig : Thats right . <p> John : So , you know , he would much rather not have had to file a lawsuit and then be able to make other plays and he wasnt be able to do that . <p> Craig : Yeah . And some of these cases , unfortunately the way the law is set up , its better to ask for forgiveness than permission . What we found was that if you ask a company for the right to parody a product by let 's say , " Can we please use your logo to parody you ? " And they say no , it starts to fall out of fair use because you 've essentially demonstrated that you did n't  think it was fair use . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . <p> And then they come after you and then you go , " Oh , what ? Well , fair use . " And you usually win . But you 're right , this is the cost of doing business . And this is why in general , you 're better off with somebody big behind you when somebody big comes after you . Obviously , that is n't always possible . <p> John : Yeah . So it was pro bono representation in this case . So thank you to whoever lawyers who stepped on his behalf . <p> Craig : Indeed . <p> John : That is our show this week .

Not too far . <p> So what do you know about us ? Great well let me tell you . First of all , were not like other producers . We do n't  have 80 gazillion things in development . We do n't  develop . That 's not what we do . If we decide to do something , then we do it . We make movies . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plain and simple . <p> The old days of buying up everything under the sun , that 's not us . That 's not what we do .

" Then we take all of that to the studio and we say , " Heres the movie . Do you want to make this movie , with this script , with this director , with this cast at this amount of money ? " Then we go . <p> Because they 're not looking for scripts anymore . They 're looking for movies . Amy ? Donna ? To a lesser extent , Stacey . That 's a whole separate thing because they 're dealing with Steven and who even knows what they 're doing over there anymore . But all of them they 're looking for movies .

Let me tell you where we were and where we are . <p> Do you know of a property called SLAPPY PAPPY ? Why would you , right ? <p> Well , its based on a best-selling childrens book and was like the number one show in all of Europe for like five years . And no one over here had heard of it . No one . So we bought it and brought it over here and we gave it to Attanasio who did a pass and then we gave it to McQuarrie who did a pass but no one could crack this thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this , I love this but I cant solve it . Hahhahah . You know ?

And anyway , he has this old grandpa who 's always trying to hit him I mean , we say " spank " we do n't  say " hit " but anyway , the kid finds out about these worm-people who are taking over his town and he has to convince his Pappy this is real but everyone thinks the Pappy is crazy , and he s crazy , and maybe he is , you know ?

@@42311507 @2311507/ <p> John : And this is episode 147 of Scriptnotes , a podcast about screenwriting and things that are interesting to screenwriters . <p> Craig , this is the last episode of Scriptnotes were recording <p> before the Worldwide Developers Conference . Apple will release all the brand new stuff on Monday but this is before Monday , so we do n't  know what that stuff will be . <p> Craig : When you say they 're going to release all the brand new stuff , is this when they 're going to announce the next iPhone and such ? <p> John : Well , they 're going to announce the new operating system , so for Macintosh and for iOS . And so its where all , you see , its sort of the future . And so our listeners who are listening to this on Tuesday or sometime after Tuesday , they are living in a future in which all these things are known . But we are living in a place of uncertainty . Its like its a quantum flux flux is really the word but there 's the decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold but they are made in the future that they 're living in . <p> Craig : You know what happened is the power of movies just happened there , because you saw Back to the Future . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : And in your mind , flux capacitor is permanently lodged . Its neurologically lodged right next to time travel . <p> John : laughs 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Well , I mean quantum and quantum flux , I think they sort of feel like they belong together but I 'm not sure they really do in a scientific way . But I do know that I envy the people in the future who know what the futures going to be and , yet , I do n't  want my time to move any faster . <p> Craig : Its getting a little sad . <p> John : No , no , its getting exciting because exciting things are brewing . So , you know , its exciting for me as a developer because we are always so excited to see what the next things are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be . And so the very first Mac app we ever created was called Bronson Watermarker . I do n't  know if you remember Bronson Watermarker . <p> Craig : I do , I do . <p> John : So Bronsons really useful for watermarking scripts or any PDF that you need to send out . And it does a good job with that . But it looked just so awful and it actually sort of caused me pain every time I looked at it , so we decided a couple of weeks ago like you know what , were just going to dust it off and make a new version . The challenge is you would have to figure out like , well , do you make it look like the apps look right now or how you think the apps are going to look like after they announce all the shiny new goodness . <p> So we just kind of took a guess about where we thought the apps were going to look like . And so we just released it today , the new version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the people who are listening to this podcast will know whether we got it right or did n't  get it right because we made choices that could be completely wrong . <p> Craig : And even though you only have 40 people working for you , laughs , you managed to do it in two weeks ? <p> John : We did manage to do it in a very , very <p> Craig : That is right . You have 40 people working for you , right ? <p> John : No , we actually that 's not quite correct . If you count me , and you count Stuart who you can sort of only kind of half count because he s really , you know <p> Craig : Stuart . <p> John : He s Stuart . Stuarts wonderful but he s not a programmer . <p> Craig : No , he s not a full human being , right . <p> John : Stuarts a wonderful human being with many other qualities , but coding and design are not his forte . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half , counting me as a half person that could do it in two weeks . <p> Craig : Two and a half but that 's what ? <p> John : No , I know it does seem impossible . Granted , it is a simpler app then , you know , a mega-giant screenwriting app . But it does a lot of stuff and so it does sort of the watermarking stuff it always did , and does it better . But we also added in password protection , so we now create encrypted PDFs with passwords that are going to be individually generated and its stronger . A couple of weeks not couple weeks probably months ago we talked about the Tarantino script that leaked . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And there are all these people who were saying like , " Oh , if they just like watermarked it , it would have been safe and protected . " Its like , yeah , stuff can always get out . <p> Craig : Ish . Yeah . <p> John : Ish . It would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful for saying like , " Hey , you know what ? Do n't  copy this . " <p> John : So for this new build we did a couple of things that are sort of also social engineering and a little bit more hidden engineering . So password protection is really obvious . So like if you 're sending someone a password protected PDF and separately sending them like this is the password to unlock it , you 're really sending a message like , hey , you know what , we really do n't  want this going any place . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : We also had this thing called finger printing which is it creates a bunch of invisible watermarks on the file itself , so you do n't  necessarily know that its invisibly watermarked but if that file gets out some place , other people can see that , ah , this was who the file actually came from . <p> Craig : Thats cool . You know , when you say developers , you know what I think of because I mean <p> John : Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the business , but whenever I hear the word developers , I think of <p> Craig : Developers , developers , developers , developers , developers ! And you could hear you could hear his heart , whatever is inside of his heart , congealing , and his cardiac arteries are struggling and he s just it seems like he s killing himself by talking that much . <p> John : You know what ? I think for Halloween you could go as Steve Ballmer and I could go as Tim Cook and we would be like the CEOs . <p> Craig : Developers , developers , developers , developers ! And the other thing that 's so great about Steve Ballmer is he s got this really high voice . So , you know , because , I do n't  know , when I think of the man that runs Microsoft , they go , " Developers , develop " <p> You know , and he looks like a he s like a linebacker , you know . But he has this really high Its funny , both he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenory voices , you know . <p> John : Maybe that 's the quality of being a great Microsoft CEO is that you have to have that voice .

You ready for it ? <p> John : Tell me . <p> Craig : Developers , developers , developers , developers , developers . <p> John : Its going to be a great voice . <p> So last bit on Bronson , so we put that out in the world today , so its out and through next Sunday So if you are listening to this on Tuesday , through Sunday its half off , so its $15 rather than $30 .

Were going to talk about whether to chase projects or whether you should spec scripts . And this was a listener question that we thought was great and applicable to many of our listeners and sort of at many stages of your career . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Were going to talk about Edgar Wrights style of comedy and a video that says that more directors should take lessons from Edgar Wright . <p> Craig : Okay . <p> John : And we will talk about Shawshank Redemption which is 20 years old and was not a success in its time and it has done really , really well for itself in the 20 years that have passed since then . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : So let 's do it . <p> Craig : All right . If you would <p> John : First , we have a bit of follow up because several episodes ago we did The Angeles Crest Fiasco where you and me and Kelly Marcel played Fiasco . And we played a specific scenario in Fiasco called Hollywood Wives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but somehow it got dropped out of the edit . So Hollywood Wives was created by a guy named Jobe Bittman and he did a great job , so . <p> Craig : Yeah . So thank you , Jobe , and we do apologize for the initial omission . <p> John : Our question today comes from Jason . And we actually know Jason because I talked to him at the live Scriptnotes we did . So I remember who he was and in the email he singled out like , " I 'm the guy you talked to . " Its like , I remember that guy . <p> Heres what he writes . " I 'm a writer with an agent trying to get my first assignment . Ive been on almost 50 general meetings . And the advice from productions and execs seems to be the same : spend time to write more specs because they usually find buyers and chasing assignments never works out . But my agents and managers think the chase is good and puts me in rooms with people who remember me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the feeling of defeat , I 'm actually more upset about the amount of time I spend coming up with fixes or building worlds for projects that do n't  choose me. " 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : " The last one was over a month back and forth to the pitch and the same idea three times . And in between I was tweaking my pitch and world base stuff , each persons notes to have it ready for the next meeting . Now Im faced with a conundrum of the summer . I 'm house-sitting for the next three months with no rent to pay and a small stipend , so I quit my job just to write fulltime . I can get my job back if I need it back . <p> " I have the whole summer before me and I want to write a spec but several assignments have been put in front of me and my team wants me to go and try to snag them . I do n't  want to waste this golden opportunity for writing , but come September I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were starting out in a similar situation would you go all in on yourself or chase some ideas that are n't  bad but you 'd have to beat out seven to 10 writers possibly to get the gig ? " 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : What I love so much about this question is like it so encapsulates the experience of being a starting writer presently in Hollywood . And honestly , kind of at every stage in your career you kind of face the same questions , whether you should try to land that job or you should just write your own thing . <p> Craig : Right . And of course , things have changed somewhat over time . There was a time when chasing down jobs as a strategy , putting aside whether it was creatively fulfilling for you as a human being but just as an economic strategy of somebody trying to pay bills , it was n't a bad strategy . They were making a lot of movies and they would have to hire a lot of people . They were making a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greater . So overall , it just seemed like there was a there were many , many more jobs in features . <p> Today , no longer the case . They really , as an industry you can see them moving towards this theoretical one-to-one development ratio where they only pay for scripts for projects that they want to make and they make many , many fewer movies . <p> So its absolutely true that when you 're chasing those movies , you are in fact competing with many , many other writers . Many of those other writers are more experienced . Many of those other writers will be more comforting as hires to the people who are spending all the money . And most disturbingly , because of that pressure , because there 's so much more leverage on the employer side now , they will make you jump through endless hoops . It becomes Kafkaesque really quickly . <p> And it does require a lot of work . I mean , listen , they , on their side , think that screenwriting is , you know , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format . And we , on our side , know that so much of the work , perhaps the most important work is what happens before that . But that 's the stuff that they 're sort of expecting from you speculatively just to see if maybe theyll hire you , maybe . <p> John : Yeah . The other thing we should stress is that a change from when you and I first started to what we see happening now is its not just that like were going to develop , you know , these movies the ones were going to produce . Its like a lot of them wo n't , theyll never hire anybody , o theyll never actually proceed . And so I think so many more movies like never actually pick any of the writers . Like seven people will go in on a pitch , theyll pick the best of the pitches to go up to the highest level and then theyll say , " Nah . " <p> Craig : Thats right . <p> John : " We do n't  really want to do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted a month trying to do that . <p> Craig : Yeah . People lose jobs to no one . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : That we , the writer we prefer is no writer . And , you know , what 's going on also is that just as we have pressure on us now because of the way that the world has changed in terms of film production , so too is there great pressure on the executives . They now are almost acting entrepreneurially because they need to justify their jobs . So what 's happening is back in the day when you and I started , some executive picks up the phone and says , " I have this thing and we love it internally and we want to make it and we want to hear from a writer . " You would at least know it was real . Not anymore . <p> Now they call sometimes and like , " Theres something and I love it and I know that , you know , whoever the boss on high is is really into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're actually trying to make something happen which may not happen with anyone . <p> John : It may not happen with anyone . So Jason is talking about the very first wrung , when you 're trying to land that first job . But from my personal experience , I can talk about two projects in the last six months that a similar kind of thing has happened . So both of them I think I obliquely referred to in an earlier podcast where we talked about like well what should I do next . <p> And one of them was an adaptation of a book . And it was a YA book that was a hot sale , a studio bought it , they were looking for a take and so I went in and I met with them and I pitched a take to the producer . And I met him and pitched the take to the studio boss and that went really well . And so as we started to make a deal things just slowed down and things slowed down . And sometimes its like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this book and this whole world and that can happen . <p> But really what had overall happened is like the book came out and it was n't a huge bestseller . It was n't The Hunger Games . It was more just like a mid tier . And so suddenly they were looking at the book and its just like this book , this plot , this story . And while there was something promising there , it was n't it had no extra juice to it . And basically , I think they hired nobody . And that 's a thing that happens . <p> Craig : They just kill it . Practically speaking , it does seem to me where were both going with this is that this Jason should in fact spend his summer writing something original . <p> John : I think he should . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And probably in retrospect , should I have spent that time writing something original ? Its very easy to say that hindsight . The other example I wanted to give was I think I 'd also kind of obliquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property that was based on a piece of IP that was very linked to a studio . So no one else could do it . <p> And the real question was like , is there a movie here ? And that 's a really dangerous thing because when you go in on a property that is exclusively at one place either because they own the book or because its already part of the studio general package , you 're really competing against nothing . You 're competing against the alternate choice of just like let 's just do nothing . <p> And so this is the process over like many , many months of like this meeting and that meeting and this meeting and that meeting , going up through the ranks to see whether everyone sort of agreed like this is a way to approach the movie . And so when I pitched it they all said like , " That 's a really good pitch . I totally get what that movie is , its not what we see ourselves doing with this property . " 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . <p> John : And that 's going to happen . So from a beginning writers perspective , Jasons representatives are saying , you know what , its good for you to be in those rooms , its good for you to have exposure to those executives , to know who they are , know who you like , know , you know , sort of all that stuff . To some degree , that 's true . But after , you know , 50 projects , you 're wasting a lot of time . <p> Craig : Yeah . Let 's come at this from a couple of angles . The first angle is from the agency side . Why are his representatives advising him this way ? Because its what makes sense for them . As an agent , the amount of work that is required to put your client in a room with somebody and who 's willing to meet with a certain tier of writer is de minimis . And you are also aware that those jobs are jobs . I mean , listen , maybe it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point is they 're there . Someones going to get hired . That 's at least your theory , maybe itll be my guy . <p> And while he goes through , even if he s not hired on this particular one , theyll know him , theyll like him , hell impress them and they will think of him . And in this way , its a very simple way for them to have their client do the work for them . All they have to do is pick up a phone . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : On the flip side , specs are a lot of work for agents . You write a spec , you give it to your agents and you say , " I want to sell this . " The first thing that has to happen is they need to agree , right ? And they do n't  not all of them , but many of them frankly do n't  really have very strong or reliable opinions anyway . So if they 're going to go out with a spec , they feel like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . Can I find an actor that goes along with it ? Can I find a director that goes along with it ? So that 's work . And it also requires them to go out on a limb which they hate . <p> John : They do . Its requiring them to take a risk saying that I like this thing , I believe in this thing and then if they are n't  people to sell it you 're going to blame them to some degree for not selling it versus you not getting the job , yeah , you did n't  get the job . <p> Craig : Everybody will blame them even if they never even if its stillborn . You hand them a script and they say , okay , and you and well , we should go to the studio and give them a movie here . Let 's give them a director , an actor , and a script . Fine , well , this is the actor I want for sure . And they work up the courage to go to that agent down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me this crap ? I hate you . Youve lost credibility with me . " <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : Its all that 's how they see the world . Its just a lot of risk . Doing nothing , no risk ; doing something , lots of risks . Specs require them to do a lot of somethings . And so this is not I do n't  mean to imply that they are being aggressively manipulative and self-serving . I think they 're just simply being human . <p> John : Theyre being rational to some degree . They 're taking the path that is least likely to end up in tears for them . <p> Craig : Theyre being rational . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : Yes . Well , yeah , what they are doing is they 're following a risk minimization strategy . The problem is that risk minimization strategies are n't  very useful for new writers . In fact , the opposite is useful . Risk maximization strategies seem to be what works for a new writer because they have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big rolls of the dice . Because if you really want to get to the kind of land of milk and honey where somebody calls you up and says , " Hey , would you be interested in getting paid a lot of money to work on this thing , " and all you 'll have to do is basically say , yes , I would be interested in that because here 's what I would do with it . And after that 20 minutes , they go , " Great , here 's $2 million . " <p> You 're never getting there unless you can establish a beachhead as a writer with an original voice who can take a script from start to finish , guide the readers through it well and write something that could be a movie . <p> John : Write something that actually was a movie . I think that 's a crucial thing too is that you could have written the most brilliant screenplays that mankind has ever known , but if theyve not been produced as movies and turned out as really , really good movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk and honey that Craig just described where they pick up the phone and just sort of offer you the job . <p> Craig : I do n't  like milk or honey , by the way . <p> John : Really ? Both of those things ? <p> Craig : I do n't  like well , I 'm Jewish <p> John : You do n't  like any substance that like comes out of a creature . <p> Craig : laughs Well , that 's excreted from insects or mammals . I mean I do n't  I 'm Jewish and Jewish people are notoriously poor at processing milk . I 'm definitely in that subset of Jewish people . I 'm not I do n't  do well with milk . And honey , I do n't  know , its like its too much . Its just too much . <p> John : It can be overwhelming at times , yeah . <p> Craig : You know , like if somebody said , " Congratulations , you made it to the land of milk and honey , " I 'd be like , " Oh " <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good buttery buttermilk biscuit and a little honey on top of it , that 's a delicious thing . <p> Craig : You are so Goyishe its unbelievable . <p> John : Or if you ended up at Casa Bonita in Denver and you had the sopapillas and you poured the honey in there , come on , itd be great . You raise your little flag again and again for more sopapillas . <p> Craig : Yucky . <p> John : All right . <p> Craig : I do n't  like it . <p> John : You do n't  like it . <p> Craig : No . I just want can I just have dry toast ? I just want dry . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Yeah . Anyway , that 's I think that Jason should spend his summer writing something original . You 're not going to lose out on some wonderful opportunity by taking a break for two months from the water tour of Los Angeles . Go ahead . Take the two months . Write something wonderful because I 'll tell you , when you do resume your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to talk about because they love to hear , " Oh , you have a script ? Oh , well now there 's an action item . We can do something . We can read a thing . " <p> John : You can read a thing . here 's the other reasons I wanted to talk through Jasons decision process . So the reason why you take those general meetings is to meet people but I think its also very good practice of figuring out like how would I write all these different kinds of movies . And so that sort of quick scramble of like , you know , figuring out like how to do this movie or that movie or this movie or that movie , I did a lot of that . <p> And that was incredibly helpful for me thinking about story overall . So someone would said like , " Hey , would you want to do a Highlander movie ? " And so I 'm like , well , how would I do a Highlander movie ? And so its a project I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's why you only do so many of them . Its because you could spend six months doing that and never have actually written something new . And suddenly then you 're not actually a writer , you 're a person who pitches things . And that 's not what you came out to Hollywood to do . Writing something give you something new , it gives you leverage with your agent to some degree . They 're going to try to sell this . <p> Craig : Yeah . I mean , listen , there 's no question that the screenplays are the commodity , not the people . And you need to have some work that they can review . And if its not a prior job , it needs to be a screenplay . Fresh material keeps you fresh . I think you 're making a great point that the practice that you get from very quickly breaking down something and coming up with a story is excellent experience for the new writer . <p> Like you , I did that deal . You know , I can remember my former writing partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole scene-by-scene story to rewrite a project that was a modern day Noahs Ark . <p> It was like a comedy where you know , and god , there was probably a thousand of those , you know . And it just does n't  work , you know , it just does n't  happen . But you do learn from those . There is a point , however , where you have to stop batting practice and actually go out onto the field and face live pitching . And that 's the deal . Write your spec . I mean , I started with an original , with something that was original and you started with something that was original . Most people start with something that 's original . I do n't  know of anybody that did n't  . I mean , I do n't  know how that would happen in any other way . <p> So in a weird way , if you have n't sold anything original yet , that 's what you got to do first . The Black List is not a substitute for selling a screenplay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hired to write something before I had sold something . So I wrote a script that got me an agent and I was able to actually land a paid job without ever having <p> Craig : Really ? <p> John : Sold something before that . But I would say that 's unusual and it was one of the things where I think I just ultimately got lucky . I was the right person to hire for that job and it was also in a day when it was like a five-step deal and they paid me through all five steps which is just crazy now , but that 's how it used to be back in the day . <p> Craig : Well , I mean , and also to be fair , I did n't  actually the first thing that my writing partner and I sold was original but it was a pitch . So we had n't  actually sold a script ourselves either . But my point being we sold something , you know . <p> John : You sold something , yeah . <p> Craig : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could certainly do much worse than spending a couple of months this summer writing some fresh interesting material so that when his current agent or his new agent calls and says , " Listen , we 've got a Black List writer , he s got his new thing , you got to jump on this . " Its a selling tool . And sometimes we as writers have to , in a weird way , excite our agents . It does n't  seem like we should have to do that , but sometimes we do . <p> John : Sometimes you do . Great . <p> Let 's move on to our next thing which was this video that Tony Zhou did about Edgar Wright and Edgar Wrights directing choices for comedy and Zhous call to action for comedy directors to take lessons from Edgar Wright and use some of his filmmaking techniques in their own movies . Basically , really it was , you know , it was a celebration of Edgar Wright but in some ways at the same time kind of a condemnation of what he perceives as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors . And I have a feeling this provoked a little umbrage out of Craig Mazin . <p> Craig : It provoked quite a bit of umbrage . And it bummed me out more than anything but I think the umbrage was certainly there but the stronger note in the bouquet of my reaction was sadness because this it was so unnecessary to have been done this way . I think that Edgar Wright is extraordinarily good at what he does . And I loved how much passion this fan had for the work and how carefully he had studied it and how careful he had placed it in the context of other movies that he really liked . And particularly zeroing in on something that Edgar Wright is known for which is , I guess I would call it a visual bravura in the storytelling that he does . <p> And his movies are comedies . They are n't  traditional comedies . Frankly , even all parts of Edgar Wrights movies are distinct . They are not genre films . He s one of those guys that 's sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across many different kinds of movies . And so I love that and I thought how wonderful . And then it all succumbed to that thing , that disease of needing to justify and define that which we love by placing it in the context of that which we do not love . <p> And in doing so , I think , frankly , the creator of the video was just wrong . He was just wrong on so many levels . <p> John : Yeah . So let 's talk a little bit about Edgar Wrights style and sort of what makes it so successful for an Edgar Wright film . And is that some of the eight things that Tony Zhou highlights are things entering frames in funny ways , people leaving the frame in funny ways . There and back again where a character walks over something and then walks back to where he was after having encountered something . Matching scene transitions . The perfectly timed sound effect . Action synchronized to music . Super dramatic lighting cues . And then sort of two gimmes of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visual gags . <p> What I noticed in all of the things he s clarifying is that they 're all very planned , very meticulously chosen beats that are n't  just sort of discovered . They were very much like you can sort of feel the storyboards in them . <p> John : Sort of like how I feel about Wes Anderson movies . And Wes Anderson movies kind of used to drive me crazy and then just I crossed over into a place of just loving them . But they 're not natural , normal worlds . And I was frustrated that he was Tony Zhou was comparing the Edgar Wright movies to movies that are n't  supposed to take place in a special artificial , unnatural world . Theyre supposed to take place in a really real world . And real worlds do n't  necessarily have this kind of visual flair for really good reasons . <p> Craig : Yeah . I do n't  think Tony understands how the music works . I mean , listen , there 's nothing particularly visually arresting or again , I 'll use that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length on the podcast a few weeks ago . But Groundhog Day is brilliant . Most of the filming in Groundhog Day is consistent with Harold Ramiss oeuvre and that is shot extraordinarily traditionally with extraordinarily traditional coverage and a naturalistic camera that is n't structuring reality-bending moments because tonally that 's not the kind of story he s telling . <p> Why would we beat that up ? Similarly , he makes strange straw dummy comparisons . At one point , he goes after Todd Phillips . And , you know , granted , I 've worked with Todd Phillips , I 've made movies with him , so naturally I 'm a little biased here . But I thought that was really off base because Todd actually is and has been visually arresting at times when he chooses to in his movies , when he feels its tonally appropriate . In The Hangover there 's that great car crash moment where that 's been aped by many other directors since , by the way Ive seen , where they 're talking in a car and we see headlights in the distance and they keep coming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t-bones them , all in one shot . <p> And its really creative and not at all the way you normally would shoot something like that . There are many other examples I could cite , but it seems like he just ignored those and instead just cherry-picked a moment where people were just talking , which by the way , works great . He picks a moment in Old School that sets up a joke that works really well . And then he also does something else that I do n't  understand . He compares some things that Edgar Wright does to other visual jokes that he does like and appreciate but they 're very different kinds of moments . <p> For instance , one of my favorite visual jokes he cites in this compilation which is the soldier running in Holy Grail <p> John : The Holy Grail . Yeah . <p> Craig : Which is great . And its a wonderful visual trick and it worked and its hysterical . But then he shows this bit with the pouring of the beers and the pouring of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just do n't  think that that 's funny . <p> John : I do n't  think that 's funny either . <p> Craig : I think its really interesting . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Its visually engaging and fascinating , but I do n't  think its funny . Similarly , the transition of a policeman going from one town to another , which I have to say , kind of was cribbed from Guy Ritchie who did it I think in Snatch with Dennis Farina . But regardless , that 's a really cool moment . That 's not funny . Its not meant to be laugh-out-loud funny . I just do n't  think this guy gets the how the music of this all works . <p> John : Its also your relationship with your audience . And if you 're in an Edgar Wright film , and again , none of this is like criticisms of Edgar Wrights films . They 're very specifically and very planned . <p> Craig : Theyre awesome . Theyre great . <p> John : Theyre great . And they 're very well planned for being in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have these kind of quick cuts at times . You 're going to have this again visual bravura that 's not part of your universe . <p> If you try to apply that same kind of speed and time and tempo to something like The Heat , you 're not going to have a good outcome . <p> Craig : It will break it . It will just break it . <p> John : It will break it because you have to believe that those two women are existing in a moment together and that this is the fatigue . And the most alarming thing in the frame has to be Melissa McCarthys actions , not how you 're cutting . <p> Craig : Well look , I engage with the characters in Edgar Wrights movies . I believe that they 're real . But I also understand that the entire thing is pushed in an interesting way . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : Its part of his style . Its part of his deal . That 's why I do n't  need every movie to be a Tarantino film . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie . I 'm happy that Edgar Wright makes Edgar Wright movies . I just found that there was this bizarre chauvinism that other movies were lesser because they werent doing this . <p> And I have to say , maybe I 'm totally off base , but if Edgar Wright were with us right now I have to presume he would agree , because I 've always found that the people who make comedies and who have been bloodied in the war of making comedies are so much more charitable and understanding of their fellow filmmakers then is often the case with some of the more some of the more attentive viewers out there . <p> John : Yeah . So a few things I do want to give him credit for which is I think its reasonable to have a call to action , really , a call to awareness for all filmmakers , comedy and otherwise , to certainly think about making some of these choices , and think about like , can you service a joke better by moving the camera in certain ways . <p> Can you service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to , you know 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : Revert to standard coverage . These are all really laudable things . And I think if this video had been framed around the idea of like , look at some of the great things that Edgar Wright does , let 's point some of these things out <p> Craig : I would be so much happier , yeah . <p> John : Other filmmakers can learn from this thing rather than sort of , you know , crapping on other people who do n't  <p> Craig : Calling people out Yeah , like , I love Bridesmaids . I understand that Bridesmaids is n't visually arresting . I understand that it absolutely broke zero ground visually or cinematically if you want to use the term . But I also loved it . It made me laugh and I cared about the people in it . And I have to think that some of these things would have broken that movie . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Now where I think Edgar Wright has terrific lessons for all comedy filmmakers is in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people around . There is , no question , there is a certain malaise in a lot of comedy filmmaking where everybody goes , " Nobody is here for that stuff . Let 's just get to the parts that are funny . " And he s right about that . <p> One thing that 's interesting is that in studio comedy making , and Ive often come up against this distressingly : the budgeting process is such that it becomes very hard actually to do the kind of things that Edgar Wright does . His movies are not inexpensive . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : When we were making Identity Thief , at one point there is a car chase and , you know , we were down to like how can we make a car chase when theyll only give us two cars ? 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Suddenly , you run into these budget issues where believe me , you have all these interesting ideas for how to make these transitions and then they say , " Nope , its the second unit and they 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and well just play music . " And you get jammed . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Part of the situation in studio comedies is that they will budget the movie . Theyll just say , look , here 's what were going to give you for this comedy . Most of the money will go to comic stars who deservedly get a bunch of money . So then what you have left is enough money to make a kind of a dingy looking movie . laughs <p> I see this happening all the time where , you know , Hot Fuzz , that 's not an inexpensive movie . I think it was into the $40 million in terms of budget . And because of the way he works with his collaborators , I suspect that they it was n't a case where they have to pay , you know , each actor $5 or $6 million , but rather everyone is kind of working together and sharing in the pool , but I 'm just guessing . <p> Similarly , Scott Pilgrim was $70 or $80 , possibly $100 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig : Yeah , Bridesmaids I 'm guessing was about $25 million . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : So when you look at the shots that he is doing , for instance , the montage of Simon Pegg moving from one city to another , that 's many , many multiple shots and its set-ups , and its time , and its money . <p> John : Yeah , yeah . <p> Craig : I would love comedies to get that money . <p> John : But they 're not getting that money right now . The last thing I 'll say is that he does highlight a little bit like , you know , oh , Pixar will still do these things . And yes , animated films will do sometimes much more visually sophisticated things because they have that time and its honestly generally no more expensive to build that as a really fascinating shot because you 're building everything from scratch anyway . <p> So those visual gags are very natural there because you 're not trying to again , its completely constructed reality . So within that constructed reality , the choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your joke , you can do whatever you want and you have so much time to think of what those shots are . <p> So if you do n't  like what that one was , throw it out and put a new thing in there and you 've got that time . <p> Craig : And I 'll just say in conclusion , I could go through a bunch of movies that this guy is implying are visually inept or mediocre and find moments that comedically are entirely about how the shot was composed and how the editing was composed . <p> I learned a lot , you know , David Zucker made wonderful comedies and none of them were visually stunning , on purpose by the way . And yet , there was an enormous attention to detail when he made those movies . <p> One thing , one wonderful lesson that he taught me early on was , in physical comedy , if you can see the result of an action within the same continuous cut as the cause of it , it will be funnier . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to shoot things was a constant discussion . <p> But it was not visually shocking or bravura or in your face or innovative . It was rather just quietly constructed . And I think that 's okay . I guess what I want to say to the guy making this is you should love Edgar Wright movies . Theyre wonderful . Please do n't  beat up other movies because they 're not doing that . That 's just unnecessary . And frankly , its just misguided . <p> John : I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about these concepts in relation to actually writing the words on the page , because a lot of what he s describing here you would never see manifest on the page . It becomes very annoying to read about sort of like , you know , a spoon enters frame from off-screen . <p> Sometimes you can do that and sometimes it works . But its very hard to picture what that 's going to be . So like trying to sell a visual joke on the page can be really , really tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though . And techniques for like the there and back again . It can be very hard to describe like in a continuous shot the guy goes , you know , says something , goes to the window , look out the window , comes back . But sometimes the way to do that is to sort stay in the dialogue block and like put all that action in parenthetical , which is sort of cheating . But sometimes its worth cheating so people can actually follow what it is that 's funny that you 're doing there . <p> Craig : Well there 's I do n't  know how those guys go through their process . But if I had to guess , there 's a certain kind of casual , visual experience that I suspect is either figured out in the storyboarding process or on the day when they 're staging the scene in the morning and figuring how they 're going to do it . And they find these moments like , you know what , let 's follow with him and then let 's follow back . <p> But then there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ montage has to be scripted because it has to be shot . The pouring of the beers in the water must be scripted . There 's no way that they just decided on the day to do that . Or if they got it into storyboards , it probably then had to be written into the script so that you understood , okay , were going to need some macro shots and we have to shoot through the bottom of the glass . There 's a whole there 's 10 meetings about that shot , so that it comes off , you know . <p> John : In the script I would n't be surprised if it says , you know , in uppercase " SERIES OF SHOTS , " And either bullets them out or like in that action block talks about what happens in there and that they did have to have three production meetings to talk through what was going to be in that , what the steins looked like . And is going to be shot as a primary unit or is that something that is secondary unit ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it happening weeks after you 've wrapped your thing to get those extra shots ? That is how its going to go . <p> So you do n't  know what that 's going to look like . To the idea of storyboarding stuff , The Coen Brothers are very who often have very visually sophisticated movies . Apparently , when you show up on the day of shooting , theyve present your sides and they show like the storyboards , like they 've storyboarded everything so you know like this is where this is what the shots are going to be for the day . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : So everyone can actually really have a plan for this is how it is . So you look at a movie like Raising Arizona that they do , the visual guides in there were really planned . They knew they were going to be using those wide lenses and how stuff was going to be going through the frame . But you would n't necessarily see that in the script . <p> Craig : Thats exactly right . In fact , if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means that they have n't seen those things because they do have the script . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : And those things are I mean you cant basically , you should n't put anything in a script that as you 're doing it makes you think , oh , I 'm just ruining it . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : No ones going to think that this is any good if I spell it all out in the script . I have to again give Edgar Wright a lot of credit for having the patience and the faith to carry through on these plans because , you know , what happens is you do end up in your seventh meeting about how to shoot the glasses and the close-ups and everyones asking these questions . And inevitably people start to think , why am I doing this ? This is an enormous <p> John : Do you really need this ? Its not that special . <p> Craig : I 'll give you an example from something I did with Todd Phillips which I thought was very visually interesting . In the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flashback where he remembers some of the incidents of the night before but in a kind of a dreamy state . But in Alans point of view he remembers himself and his friends as 12-year-old boys because that 's how he sees the world . <p> John : Which I love that moment in the movie . And I remember commenting , I think even on the podcast , like that must have been so hard to shoot <p> Craig : It was so hard . <p> John : And convince people to shoot that . <p> Craig : It was so hard because on paper , it takes up a half a page and all you say is , " Alan and Stu and Phil as 12-year-olds . " But then you realize , oh my god , we 've got to cast 12 year olds to be like them . Weve got to put them in these clothes , and then we have to shoot a second movie , because all the stuff where these guys have been , we 've got to then redo , so we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enormous riot and police and mall to have cocktails , then we have to shoot it again with children . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : And we have to do it over and over and over . But , you know , it kind of came together but many , many times Todd and I looked and each other and thought why would we have ever done this . Just like , you know , very famously Parker and Stone decided early on that they were going to make Team America with marionettes. 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : And about , you know , a month in of misery they just thought , we have killed ourselves on this , killed ourselves . But , you know <p> John : They already committed . <p> Craig : They already committed . And frankly , in the end its not the audiences problem . If you can provide them with something that is visually fascinating , it does n't  matter how long it took , it does n't  matter how meetings you went through . Its really cool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think that what he does is spectacular . I would be shocked if Edgar Wright were ever to stop and think , boy , I wish all comedies look like my comedies . I just think he would say , oh my god , no. 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Why would I want that ? I like my comedies looking like my comedies . <p> John : You want to be distinctive . That 's absolutely true . And same with Tarantino and same with Wes Anderson . I mean , the fact that you can parody a Tarantino film or you can parody a Wes Anderson film means that they 're doing something very special . They have a unique voice and unique eye and celebrate that rather than sort of , you know , crapping on everybody else . <p> Craig : Yeah and at least acknowledge that while there are lazy tropey moves in comedies that I would love to see eliminated , budgetary concerns aside , there are also incredible classic , great , great comedies that invent not one new bit of cinematic language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx420556 <p> John : Our last topic today is The Shawshank Redemption which is rated on IMDb as the best movie ever made . But a lot of people could agree with that . There 's an article that Russell Adams wrote in the Wall Street Journal last week celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Shawshank Redemption and I had to remember sort of like what it was up against , but it came out the same year Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump . <p> So in its time , Shawshank Redemption was n't a big success . It only made $16 million in the box office . It got seven Oscar nominations , but no Oscars . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And now its kind of a classic . So this article is specifically talking about how , you know , the residual value of a well regarded movie and literally the residuals that happen . So , you know , minor actors in there are still getting residuals and they 're still getting like a tremendous amount of residuals because that thing airs all the time . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Shawshank Redemption just in 2013 . <p> Craig : Did I ever tell you the story of sitting in a car with Bob Weinstein and he was talking about the movie business and he said to me , " Hey , Mazin , you want to know how to make money in the movie business ? " <p> John : And you said , no sir . I do n't  want to know . I want to make art . <p> Craig : I said , let me out of this car . I said , yeah , sure , how do you make money in the movie business ? He said , " Its really simple , man . Have a library of movies and do n't  make movies . " And he s right , I mean <p> So yeah , a library sits there and unlike most warehouse products , it costs nothing to keep and yet it generates money forever . And a movie like Shawshank Redemption which crosses into that Im going to say a land of potato chips and ice cream , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , it generates a massive amount of money forever and increases the value of other movies , because if you want to show Shawshank Redemption , you cant get it unless you also agree to take a bunch of other movies that maybe are n't  , you know , quite as exciting to the audience . <p> John : And that 's something I do n't  think people appreciate is that when you see a movie on television , you think like , oh , okay , so ABC bought the rights to that movie so they could show it . And yes , they bought the rights to that , but they had to buy a package . <p> Craig : Yup . <p> John : And so what the studio did is they package together this one movie that everybody really wanted along with a bunch of movies that you really did n't  want . And they would only sell them as the package . And the frustration as a filmmaker is the studio wants to divide that money equally between those films just because and pretend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's worth doing , so theyll spread it on all the different movies that they 're selling . And that is incredibly frustrating . <p> And sometimes its the subject of lawsuits . And I do n't  know that it ever actually went to trial , but the first Charlies Angels was a big success . And we ended up selling it to I think ABC , selling rights to ABC , but it was packaged with these other movies . <p> And I remember producers being not especially happy about the way that it was packaged and the way the money sort of being divided it up because obviously we were the movie that was the goldmine there . <p> Craig : Yeah , well , what they do is they divide it up . They 're not looking to screw over any individual writer , director or actor . What they 're trying to do is avoid any movie showing a profit . laughs <p> John : Yes , that 's exactly what it is . <p> Craig : Yeah , so they 're just sliding this stuff around so that , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when we talk about this thing , and this is all under the heading of distribution . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : This is the answer to the question , why are there the same five big movie studios that were around for decades and decades and decades ? Why if we live in a world now where Tesla can show up and actually be a viable new car company , why cant there be a viable new movie studio ? And the answer is distribution . Distribution impacts everything . <p> That is why these studios have a strangle hold on films and television , because to get a movie into a theater , all those screens is an art of negotiation where you are trading on a very desirable title . And thus , getting in maybe ones that are more speculative because theater owners lose money when nobodys in the theater to see the movie . <p> John : Yeah , absolutely . <p> Craig : They do n't  want bad movies . They want the good movies . Well , you 're not getting the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies . Warner Brothers is making 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Well , you 're not getting one of those unless you take a bunch of these things , too . And it works that way for television and pay cable and all the rest . I have a question for you . <p> John : Okay . <p> Craig : Of all your movies , can you tell from your residuals which one has had the most after theatrical success ? <p> John : Yes , that was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by like a landslide . And just because it sold a tremendous amount of DVDs right at that moment where like they were still selling a bunch of DVDs . <p> How about you ? I mean you 've got The Hangover movies . Those have to be the number ones . <p> Craig : Theyre not . Theyve both done very well in video but by far , Identity Thief . <p> John : Thats not because its the sole credit ? <p> Craig : No , no , no . I kind of did the math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just been after market-wise , after theatrical I think the most popular movie Ive ever done . <p> John : Well , that 's great . <p> Craig : I think so . <p> John : Thats wonderful . And again , this is a good lesson in why residuals matter so much . So the short version of what residuals are for people who are sort of new to this discussion is writers as part of this sort of grand charade we do legally about the work we do and copyright all this stuff , we do n't  have royalties on movies , we have what 's called residuals . <p> And as movies are displayed on things after theatrical , so after they 've left the movie theaters and after theyve left airplanes , but as they sell on iTunes , as they go through Netflix streaming , as they show up on broadcast TV , we get a certain percentage of what that money is that comes back to the distributor or the studio to the film . We get that percentage . And that percentage can add up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Craig : Yup . <p> John : Yup , its good . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And so is Shawshank Redemption which I do n't  think Ive actually seen since it came out , so its one of those things where its always on . If you flip the channels , its always on somewhere . Yet , its a great movie and it was Frank Darabonts sort of first big success . He bought the rights to it for $5,000 . <p> Craig : Isnt that great ? And I love that Stephen King did n't  cash the check . <p> John : Ooh , Stephen King . <p> Craig : Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic movie . Its one of those movies , I 've never met anybody that did n't  like it . <p> John : No , how could you not like it ? <p> Craig : I do n't  know . Its just a terrific movie . Its also a movie that while very cinematic in moments , plays wonderfully on TV . Its like The Godfather . I very happily have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is obviously its not something that happens frequently because , you know . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : But when I see The Godfather on TV , I 'm like , yeah , this works on TV , too . It actually works everywhere . I can watch this in my shower . <p> John : Yeah , I think maybe the reason why it does , both of those films would work well on TV is because they 're sagas and they definitely kind of feel like there 's act breaks in them . You feel like , there 's moments like , okay , this is a moment where we can go away and we go to commercial and come back and regain the energy . And like its not going to be shattered . <p> Craig : The only thing that bugs me about Godfather is that sometimes when people are going from one place to another , Coppola will just show a car driving by . <p> John : Thats so incredibly lazy . I wish they would n't do that . <p> Craig : Like when Michael Corleone goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waa , waa , waa , waa . That 's not cool . <p> John : Thats not cool at all . But , you know , what is cool ? One Cool Things . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Its time for that . So my One Cool Thing is also on the topic of filmmaking . Its this thing called A Guerilla Filmmakers Guide to After Effects . And its this course I think its like $99 , with a whole bunch of videos that you get access to , about how to use After Effects to develop visual effects for Indie projects . <p> Its really well done . The sample video they have up there is Gareth Edwards who did Godzilla and Monsters and is now doing the new Gary Whitta Star Wars movie . <p> Craig : Gary Whitta . <p> John : Gary Whitta . <p> Craig : Gary Whitta . <p> John : Its Gareth Edwards talking through doing the visual effects for this Attila the Hun movie he made and he did all the visual effects himself . And you 're literally seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrating as he s , you know , like a 40-minute lesson on sort of how he s dealing with the timeline , the spreadsheet he s built for himself for the work , how he s composing these things . <p> And its just the little lesson I watched , it was basically he had to put I guess Constantinople on a hill , and so he had two shots that where handheld shots , a wide shot and the closer shot and like Constantinople had to be over there . <p> And so he s doing motion tracking and figuring out like to get this city to land right in the distance . And it was just really , really cool . And so I think if you are a person who is looking to make films or honestly just kind would want to learn more of about how that stuff works , I thought it was just fascinating and really well done .

But we can be better . Weve been better at other times . <p> Craig : Oh really . <p> John : Thats sort of why I 'm bringing it up . And so its not that we have fewer listeners . We actually have a lot more listeners . Those stats are really , really good . Its that when people do n't  interact with us on iTunes , we drop . And so its people adding us on iTunes is what moves you up the charts . <p> Craig : All right , well then everybody you 've got to add us on iTunes . <p> John : Just add us on iTunes .

We also have a Scriptnotes app for your iPhone and for your Android device . With that app you can access all our back episodes back to episode one is you want to . Subscriptions for the back episode are $1.99 a month . Pennies , for you . Less than a year of that would less than a year of the New York Times crossword puzzle . <p> Craig : But not necessarily more valuable . Not to run us down . But boy , those crosswords are good . <p> John : Those crosswords are good . We have transcripts for every episode . So about got five days after an episode airs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to go back and refer to something we said , you can always look for that , so just look for the original episode and there 's always a link to the transcript for that .

@@42311516 @2311516/ <p> A bunch of interesting questions have backed up in the queue , so let 's see how many we can get through while waiting for the new iPhone to be announced . <p> I 'm currently outlining a spec feature , 98% of which takes place at the Superbowl . I 'm on the fence about proceeding , however , because a few creative executives Ive pitched the idea to were concerned about 1 ) the production costs and 2 ) the need to secure the NFLs approval . One of the execs did say , however , if the NFL took to the script and got involved it would be a potential dealmaker . <p> While the production costs are n't  as much of a concern for me ( given that those particular naysayers had n't  gotten past the logline ) , the seeming make-or-break nature of the NFLs involvement is a bit daunting . Before I take the plunge from outline to first draft , do you think its worth the risk ? <p> Patrick Los Angeles <p> Yes . If you believe in the story and the characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes your script , shell be smart enough to the realize that the NFL of it all can be figured out . 1 <p> At a USC workshop this weekend , a student asked me about writing a spec Alien vs . Predator . I gave him roughly the same advice if you think you can write a kick-ass version of it , do n't  let the potential unmake-ability of it deter you . My caveat to him was that in the case of AVP , its a really tired franchise , so you 're starting with a significant enthusiasm gap . Better to make your own mythology . <p> I 'm about to re-write a script that I 've been working on for a little while now . Its a small character road trip drama in the spirit of 1970s American films ( e.g. " Five Easy Pieces " , " Coming Home " , " Sugarland Express " though not all films referenced there are road trip movies ) . This is my do or die draft if its no good , then I will abandon it . But I 'm hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome . <p> My concern is that too many of the scenes right now are overly reliant on dialog and I do n't  want to tread into unnecessary exposition . At the same time , I want to be able to reveal character and backstory ( and obviously , dialog plays a huge part in that ) . Do you have any general pointers on how to balance scenes ( or sequences ) of relatively quiet character moments , with the overall dramatic push that 's necessary to maintain tension ? I want to make sure that both aspects remain compelling . <p> N.S.Los Angeles <p> There 's nothing wrong with dialogue scenes if they 're moving the story ahead , or enjoyable enough on their own merits . But I suspect you 're finding that a lot of your dialogue scenes are telling us backstory about your characters , and the thing is , we just do n't  care . <p> That 's hard to hear , but you need to hear it : except for crucial , story-twisting revelations , we simply do n't  need to know more about who your characters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start that next draft , take a red pen to any chunk of dialogue that is n't about what 's happening now . Be brutal . I suspect you 'll find that you have a lack of action and some unclear goals that were hiding behind the chatter . <p> The movies you cited , along with more recent ones like Lost in Translation , Sideways and Little Miss Sunshine , are all good examples of movies that are talky without ever becoming expositional . Characters talk about what they want , what they fear , but they never dwell on what happened . And each movie finds moments to be quiet . Long stretches of each film play as montage , letting the characters do things without commenting on them . <p> Let 's say you 're working on a script that 's based on a musician .

Ron Wells , it was you all along . <p> So , that 's the retraction apology . And now a little follow up on Raiders . I got an email from Larry Kasdan . And here 's what it said . And it was for both of us , but he did n't  have your email , so he sent it just to me and then I forwarded it to you : <p> " Craig and John . Your podcast about Raiders blew my mind . Fantastic . The best analysis Ive ever seen by a power of ten . I loved it and I learned a lot . Lawrence Kasdan . " <p> Now , how about that as a little feather in our cap ? <p> John : Well , that 's fantastic . And for folks who really have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lost Ark . And so our podcast talking about it , apparently he listened to which is just weird , and meta , but great . So , hooray . <p> Craig : Pretty great . And , always nice to engage in an hour long discussion of a movie and then have the writer respond back and say , " Hey , you got it right . " <p> John : Aw . <p> Craig : Yeah . So , good for us . We win , again . <p> John : We do . Craig , it is weird to have you doing business on the podcast . Its so like you came with a prepared list of things you wanted to talk about . Its just unusual . <p> Craig : It is unusual because , and I suppose people have picked up on this by now , my entire approach to podcasting is to be as ill-prepared as possible , almost really to be aggressively unprepared . <p> So , this time I came slightly prepared . <p> John : And you did ask Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah . No one should be under the impression that I was really on the ball here . I was not . <p> John : I 'm just saying , like if you were to go in that direction in the future , I would welcome it . <p> Craig : Oh , I see . This is a gentle suggestion that maybe I should actually <p> John : Theres carrots . Theres sticks . There are many things . I can offer you carrot sticks , but its something that in the future as I get busier and busier with Big Fish , if you were to choose to do that , that 's just a thing that could happen . <p> Craig : I love that were having this discussion here on the podcast . And , you know what ? You 're right . I 've always been very careful to tell people when they compliment me on the podcast that you do all the work . That is correct . You pick the topics . You edit the show . You really do everything . <p> So , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe even come up with a thought about what we should talk about . <p> John : Every once in a while you do . I will give you credit for that . There have been times where I said , " Hey , were going to record a podcast . " You 'll say , " Let 's talk about this . " And we have talked about that . <p> Craig : Right . Those are far and few between . Probably of our 77 podcasts , maybe I 've done that four times . <p> John : Well , today were going to talk about three good topics , and I think were going to have some good conversation on them , so let 's get started . <p> First off , this Vanity Fair article in the March 2013 issue is by Margaret Heidenry , I 'm guessing , which I thought did a terrific job explaining sort of the history of spec scripts as a sales thing . I mean , screenwriters have always written scripts by themselves , and just defining terms , a spec script is technically any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not under contract to write it for somebody ; you 're just writing it because you can just write a book . The same way novels are often written on spec . <p> But , what this article does is sort of track the history of when that began as a process of " Im going to write this script and sell it to a studio , " which was a new thing , when it became really huge , which is the 90s , and sort of what 's happened to it since then . <p> So , I strongly recommend everyone read it . But , I want to talk through some of the points because I thought they were really , really interesting . <p> The story , if I were to fault it for anything , it got a little bit heavy in the Schmucks with Underwoods references and the Sunset Boulevard of it all . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : But the history stuff of it was really new to me , so I thought that was cool . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And we 've talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lottery mentality . I think a lot of people approach screenwriting as a career thinking , like , " Oh , I will write a script and I will sell that script and then I 'll have a million dollars . And then people will make my movie and I 'll be set . " And that 's not the way that most screenwriting works , particularly now . But it did n't  work back then that way , either . <p> So , this article starts back in the days of the studio contract writer system , which I guess we should really talk about because its such a different experience than what we have right now . <p> Craig : Yeah , so , in the old days writers were essentially employees of studios . They got buildings to work in called The Writers Building . And they were under contract the way that actors used to be under contract . And you would work for a studio . You would n't work on a project ; youd work for a studio and the studio would assign you to projects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary . <p> And you would type up what they told you to type up . And , frankly , a lot of wonderful movies came out of that system , but also a lot of junk , too . I mean , let 's not get too rose-colored about the past . Barton Fink does a great job of sort of portraying the worst of the old studio system days where writers were cogs in machines being assigned to Wallace Beery wrestling pictures . <p> John : I was just at a meeting over at The Lot , which is the old Warner Hollywood , and they sent me to the wrong place . But they said , " Oh , you 're going to The Writers Building . " I just love that there 's still a building called The Writers Building . <p> Craig : Thats right . In fact we have Phil Hay , and Matt Manfredi , and Ted Griffin , and Alec Berg , and Dave Mandel all have their offices in that building , which I love . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : But , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergence of free agency . At some point in that studio system collapsed and writers became freelance and able to sell their wares wherever . And they werent tied down by these contracts . <p> And essentially the era of the entrepreneurial screenwriter began . And it began perhaps most in earnest with one script in particular , and that 's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . <p> John : Yeah . So , her article goes through , she thinks the first spec screenplay that would sort of count under our terms is the 1933 Preston Sturgess script called The Power and the Glory , which sold to Fox for $17,000 back in 1933. 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And that 's probably that feels right . It was unusual for a writer at that time to just have the time and initiative to go off and write something for himself , but he did . And so that was the first thing that sold , and did n't  do very well , but Butch Cassidy has got to be what we think about for the first groundbreaking spec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassidy managed to do two things at once . It sold for a big huge amount of money and it was a big huge hit . <p> John : Yes . Those are good things . <p> Craig : And Hollywood is as susceptible to confirmation bias as anyone . They say , " Look , we spent a lot of money on a completely original screenplay and we got this big huge hit movie out of it . Maybe we should do this more ? " And so began the heyday of the spec seller . <p> John : It was n't overnight . And its important to understand that William Goldman at that point had already written other scripts . He had had movies produced . But this was a thing he chose to do , just write for himself . He was at a point in his career that he could have gone and just pitched it to somebody , attached some actors , and set it up at a studio in a normal way . But he just decided to go off and write the script by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And so it was a surprise that it sold for $400,000 , which is a little over $2 million now . And that was unique , and wonderful , and great . And it was unusual at that time to come in with , like , " Heres a fully developed script . We can make them make this movie and attach actors and succeed . " <p> What I do n't  know sort of the movies that have come directly before and after that , but my perception of Butch Cassidy is that it was so different that it might have been hard to pitch it . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And so that is a good argument even now for when you spec some things rather than pitch some things is if its going to be so hard to explain what your vision is for the movie in a pitch , sometimes a spec is a better place to spend your time . <p> Craig : Thats right . And even if people can understand the pitch , and want to buy the pitch , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  get the opportunity to present your screenplay and say , " This is how I want it to be . " You are immediately involved in a collaboration . Sometimes that collaboration is rewarding and sometimes its not . Either way , its a collaboration . <p> William Goldman obviously thought to himself , " I would like to write the screenplay without anybody in my ear saying , Do n't  do that . Do this instead . ' " <p> John : Yes . So , in the article they point to the 1988 Writers Guild strike as being the other major turning point for spec sales . <p> The 1988 strike was a five month strike , which is a very long time for screenwriters to be not working in their normal capacity . So , during that time a lot of people wrote spec scripts . They wrote scripts because they could . During that strike you could not work for the studios , but you could work for yourself . <p> And so the wonderful thing about being a writer is you can just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . And as the strike wore down and was resolved , those went onto the market . <p> It was also a time when the business was expanding . So , you had studios like Disney that were going and trying to make a lot more movies over the course of the year . I remember during the Katzenberg era , was n't it like he wanted to make 30 movies a year ? <p> Craig : Well , you know , between all of their divisions Miramax , Touchstone , Hollywood Pictures , and Walt Disney Pictures one year they released more than a movie a week . <p> John : Yeah . Which is crazy now . We would never do that . <p> Craig : Crazy . <p> John : So , the business was expanding . You had a bunch of writers who had written stuff who could now sell that stuff . It was a really great time to be selling a spec script . And so suddenly you had " common " makes it sound like everyone was doing it , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hundreds of thousands of dollars , or even seven figures . <p> The first million dollar sale , which is in the article but I also think I remember , that was Ticking Man , which is the Brain Helgeland and Manny Coto script , which still has never been made . <p> Craig : Thats right . That 's right . It was an interesting time because the reason the strike occurred in the first place was also in part the reason that the spec boom occurred . The strike in 1988 was in a weird way a redo of a failed two-week long squib of a strike in 1985 . <p> The studios on their own had unilaterally decided that they were only going to pay one-fifth out on video residuals . And their argument in 1985 when they did this , or 84 when they first started doing it , was that the video market , this VHS market , was very new and they needed a break on all the residuals because it was a new emerging market . It was a bunch of baloney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982/1983 was really when video was just starting to take off . The Betamax/VHS war had been settled . By the time 1988 rolled around it was quite clear that video was enormous . It was an industry all of a sudden . Renting videos and watching videos and buying videos this was a huge part of the Hollywood system . <p> In fact , video was so lucrative for the companies that essentially the name of the game was make as much as possible and get it on video . So , the studios were incentivized by the market place , by the consumer , to create an enormous amount of product . The writers , angry about how theyd been screwed over in the early part of the 80s decided to go on strike to undo the residuals formula that they detested . <p> They failed to do so , even after the longest strike the Writers Guild has ever endured . But what happened at the end of that strike was a confluence of the following things . Studios needed to make a lot of movies because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were incredibly short on movies to make because nobody had been writing anything for a half a year . And writers had been writing stuff during that time for themselves that they were now willing to sell . <p> Talk about a sellers marketplace . So , all of these writers went out with all of these scripts . The studios were desperate to make movies . And people started buying things . And , of course , this being Hollywood , when something sells for $500,000 every agent gets on the phone and says , " Okay , its the new deal , $500,000 now for a script like this . " And then it just goes up , and up , and up . <p> And at some point what ends up happening , like in any marketplace , whether its for visual art , art you hang on your wall , or whether its for tulips , you start to get into the realm of a bubble . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : And that 's kind of what happened . <p> John : And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that stuff that happened before we got here , to literally this is what Los Angeles and Hollywood was like when I got out of my car , sort of 1992 . The business was expanding . Spec sales were happening . There was n't a lot of sort of common popular press about Hollywood , but there was Premiere Magazine . So , Premiere Magazine would write the articles about the big spec sales and like , " Oh , my , I want to be in screenwriting because the spec sales are happening . " <p> Youd see big articles about Joe Eszterhas selling a script for $3 million . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And , yes , it feeds that bubble . You know , like all bubbles , more people enter and it seems like its going to keep growing forever . What I think the article does a nice job is also pointing out a few of the unique factors that were happening right then . <p> First off , this was still a phone call and paper business , and so if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of copies , or the agency was making a bunch of copies , sticking them in envelopes , messengering them out to the studios . And agents were on the phone . <p> And that 's inefficient , but that inefficiency actually probably jacked up prices because no one had perfect information . You did n't  really know who was bidding on things . And so if the agent said , " I 've got an offer , " it was very hard to check to see whether that was true or that was n't true . Even things like tracking boards were very new . There was n't a lot of ways to share information . So , you had to sort of take it on faith that , " This thing that I 'm kind of into , that I would like to buy , well , I need to hurry and buy it right now because otherwise its going to become unavailable . " <p> Craig : Yeah . Its a very simple human phenomenon : We want what other people want . Not always , but often . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an agent you would simply just lie and say , " I 've got two studios . I 'm not going to tell you who , but theyve already put bids in , so you 're stupid if you 're not putting a bid in . And also , your boss is going to beat you over the head with this when its a hit at this other studio . " <p> I 'm not a studio executive , but I hear something like that and I start to get sweaty because , what if its true ? And , of course , nobody knows anything . And it might be right ; that might be right . If two other people want it , maybe I should want it , too . <p> It was much easier to create hype back in the day . And it did n't  hurt that some of the big notable spec sales continued to work out . Lethal Weapon is a great example . <p> John : Absolutely . So , Lethal Weapon was a very big sale at its time , but that became a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money very , very well spent . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And you had , in the article they cite Alan Gasmer who one year sold like 30 spec scripts , which was remarkable . <p> But friends of mine were in that pool of those spec scripts . I was in my first year of Stark at USC and this was the very early days of cell phones , so not very many people had cell phones at that point . <p> My friend Jen , we were at a night class , and my friend Jen , her cell phone rang , she ran out into the hallway , and it was sort of a big deal to run out of a classroom and to take a phone call . But she came back in and she said , " Al and Miles just sold their script for a million dollars . " And so , Al Gough and Miles Millar . <p> Craig : Wow . <p> John : And it was very , very exciting . And we applauded for them and she hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was teaching a class about how to get money from public television to do small documentaries . <p> Craig : laughs What a hard class to keep teaching after that news . <p> John : Exactly . But , I mean , that fever does continue . And I think " bubble " is a really nice way to describe it , because I remember the housing bubble that happened in Los Angeles where suddenly you would go to an open house on a Tuesday and thered be five offers by the end of the day . And you 're putting in backup offers . That was really , really common at one point . And now its gone away . And the same thing happened with specs . <p> Craig : Yeah . This is general human nature but its exacerbated by this business which is such a chasey business . Everybody is always chasing things , you know . And so they get so excited whenever there 's this nobody wants to feel like they 've been left out of a party in Los Angeles . This is their biggest fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : So , when the spec market was booming , it sort of fed in on itself . But with all things like this , eventually there is a correction as they say in the Wall Street Journal . <p> John : And that correction came partly because of overspending , but also because of other factors , just a change in times . <p> First off , most of the studios became bought by much bigger corporations . And so those corporations sometimes had deep pockets , but they were also very risk-adverse . They also had reasons to be using the material that they already owned , intellectual property that they already owned , or to gather up intellectual property that they could use and exploit . <p> So , it became much more reasonable for Disney to try to base things off of theme park rides , or for Fox to sort of look at what their publishing arm had and try to base off the books that they had . They wanted synergies . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger , and bigger , and bigger , and looking for reasons to sort of justify why they were all under one big umbrella . <p> Second off , we talked about how paper and phone calls sort of helped inflate things , because information was hard to come by . But with PDFs they were just attached to an email , so they could zip out and everyone could have it at once . It was much easier to sort of leak things to other people just through email . And emails were just faster and quicker . And we did n't  have to wait on somebody calling back . <p> Like one of the most powerful plays an agent can have sometimes is just not calling somebody back and driving that paranoia . Email does n't  do the same thing really . <p> Craig : No , it does n't  . And then you also had the rise of the tracking boards online , which essentially eliminated the chicanery that would go on where you could essentially pump and dump a spec . People started talking to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , its funny . Its all sort of probably an antitrust violation , but one of the things that goes on at studios is they get very angry at any studio that breaks ranks and overspends on something . <p> When Jim Carrey got $20 million for Cable Guy , every other studio went bananas at I think it was Sony that paid the $20 million went bananas at them for basically resetting the pay scale for every A-list actor . They had n't  just cost themselves $20 million . Theyd cost everybody $20 million . And they do this with screenplays as well . <p> When you work in Hollywood , you have a quote . That 's what you get paid . And the way that business affairs departments work is , okay , if you got paid this and then your movie got made , then you get a little extra . And if your movie was a hit you get a little extra after that . They have all these little formulas . If anyone dares violate the formula and overpay somebody , everybody else goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there is a natural tendency once the tools are in place for the studios to start talking to each other and saying , " Let 's not get suckered anymore , not by the writers , by the agencies . " The agency became the enemy here . CAA and William Morris and ICM and UTA and Endeavor were and continue to do everything they can to get as much money out of the studios as possible . And the studios , frankly , have gotten much better about talking to each other to prevent that . <p> John : Yeah . We talked about how the rise in spec sale prices came because of supply and demand . Essentially the studios had demand and then they would buy scripts because they had to fill a pipe . Those pipes became much smaller . They did n't  need as many scripts . And so as demand fell so did the prices for these things . <p> You know , first off , they 're just making fewer movies . Like that idea of , " Oh , were going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home video became less lucrative , less important . Movies themselves became more expensive , so were going to step up to the plate fewer times and bat at fewer things . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : Plus , as these corporations grew , there were fewer buyers . There were fewer buyers because Warner Brothers takes over New Line , so you ca n't Warner does n't  want to bid against New Line on a property . <p> Craig : They cant . <p> John : As more labels get folded under each other they start having to negotiate who gets to buy something . So , if Fox 2000 does n't  want to bid against Fox on a property , even if they might both want it , only one person is going to bid , so you cant play them against each other . <p> Craig : Thats right . And there was this whole world of mini majors that existed with the Carolco and Orion and MGM and UA . And all these people just started disappearing and boiling down to five major buyers who were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous that it almost seemed that that department was the one to satisfy more than any other department . Specs were considered an inordinate risk . <p> The success of Batman in the late 80s , I think , woke the whole town up to the notion of franchises that they were already sitting on that they should just exploit . <p> John : Yeah . Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : And then as things were sort of struggling and petering , the writers decided to go on strike again . <p> John : Yeah . That probably did n't  help . It was a rough time to do that . I think we should fast-forward to today because we talked I think two or three weeks ago about that spec sale report which showed sort of how many total spec scripts sold over the course of this last year , which I thought was really fascinating . And the numbers have trended up over the last three years . And there are more spec sales selling now than before . <p> They 're not nearly at the stratospheric prices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do sell . And often they 're selling for smaller figures to smaller places/labels that you may not necessarily have heard of . They 're happening in genres that are less expensive . So , its the horror and thriller ones are the ones that are selling . Its not the giant action tent-poles . <p> Its not Lethal Weapons that are selling . Its smaller movies that they can make for a price that are selling specs , but they are still selling . They are still selling . <p> Craig : In general , yeah . I mean , there are some exceptions . All You Need Is Kill is a big huge action-adventure that sold for a lot . But , yeah , it does seem like a lot of the smaller genre movies are what they 're picking up . <p> John : Yeah . So , I want to sort of wrap this up by saying our sort of standard disclaimers that its interesting to think about and talk about spec sales because that 's often what people think about when they think about the life of a screenwriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing a script and someone will buy the script and make that into a movie . " But that 's not the bread and butter of what most actual writers do . <p> And its not really necessarily the reason to write a spec script . Most spec scripts will never sell , but those good spec scripts will get those writers future work and future employment . Most of the things that are on the Black List wont sell , and they wo n't get made . But those good scripts on there will get those writers meetings and give those writers projects down the road to write and keep food on the table . <p> Craig : Precisely . <p> John : Cool . So , one of the things that a writer is going to be doing if he s not selling a script is going out to pitch a project , and so I thought that would be our second topic today , because yesterday I had to pitch two different movies in the same day <p> Craig : Eke . <p> John : which was exhausting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! That sounds crazy . Why ? <p> John : its just the way my schedule worked out . Because I 'm heading off to New York to start some Big Fish stuff , so it was the only day where I could go in and meet on these two different projects . And it was tough . One of them was a phone pitch and one of them was in person . <p> But I want to talk a little bit about getting ready for a pitch , not the days of prep going up to it , but just like literally the couple hours ahead of time . Because one of the projects was the very first time I 'd ever really pitched it , and so it was all sort of new and fresh , and it could be a little bit less formed because it was one of those pitches , like , is there even an idea here that we feel like could make a movie ? It was a property that they owned the underlying rights and they werent sure if they wanted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something cool to make out of it . <p> The other one was based on a book , and so theyd already read the book , and I 'd already pitched it other places so I definitely knew what the pitch was . But that was a pitch that I had n't  done for four weeks . And so I had to refresh myself on it . <p> Craig : Got it . <p> John : So , I thought wed talk about that . <p> What was the last thing you had to pitch , Craig ? <p> Craig : Well , you mean to pitch to say get a job as opposed to pitching an original thing ? <p> John : Either . And we can talk about what the difference is there . <p> Craig : Probably , well , its been a long time frankly . I mean , I was with a director the other day talking about rewriting a project that he s attached to . So , I was sharing my thoughts and my opinions about how it should go , but that wasnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're sort of describing a take but its not " buy this . " <p> Craig : I think if I collect enough information together to sort of say , " Okay , yeah , I do want to do this , and here 's the story , " and he agrees , then I 'll go and pitch it probably to the studio . But its been awhile . <p> John : Yeah . I find every couple months I have to sort of dust off my sort of pitching brain and go in and do that . And I genuinely enjoy it . A few things that I found really helpful , and so Ill talk first about this one project that I 'd already pitched before , so I sort of had it worked out , but I had to sort of refresh myself on it . <p> If I 've written something down , a lot of times I will write up sort of the pitch . And I 'll write it up sort of the way I would normally speak it . And that 's a document I will carry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Chosen , I had to pitch the Chosen pilot to Josh , and then I had to pitch it to Fox , or 20th , and then 20th again , and then I had to pitch it to NBC and ABC . And so I had to pitch that thing a lot . <p> And , in that case I would only have a couple days off , but what I found to be really , really helpful is because I had this written document , in the couple hours before I would have a meeting I would go through and I would rewrite the document . And I found that actually just going through and rewriting and sort of putting it in my the way I was thinking about it today , really helped it fit it helped it come out of my mouth better when I was speaking it to a group because I had just written it , and so it felt real and it felt sort of alive in my head . I could sort of see it all again . <p> Just reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passive . Writing forced me to really engage with what the story was and what the points were . I could remember sort of like how I was getting from A , to B , to C , to D. <p> Craig : Right . Exactly . Yeah , you want to be able to inspire confidence . And part of what inspires confidence is sounding like you 're in control of your own story . Sounding like you 're in control of your story does n't  mean you are ; it just means you sound that way . <p> But its important to sound that way because the worst thing is to be in control of your story and sound like you 're not . Then you 're pitching yourself out of a gig that you deserve . <p> John : For this other property I pitched yesterday , I did n't  have a written pitch , but I had slides . So , I 'd done slides and keynote on the iPad . And so because there were some very distinct visual images I needed to be able to show , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> And it had been a couple weeks since I looked through it , so I went through and I sort of did the quick version of it just to myself going through the slides , and that helped me sort of put it all back together . Basically you 're just trying to recreate the best performance you have of what it is you 're doing . <p> And think of it like an audition . And I do definitely treat it like an audition . Even in that drive over as I 'm headed there , I wont listen to the radio . I wont listen to a podcast . I will just speak the pitch . And I will start the pitch . And get the pitch rolling . If I cant get my mouth to move right I will do those little vocal exercises I learned in college to , you know , just be able to speak , and speak clearly and intelligently . <p> I definitely find that the beginning of the pitch is crucial . And if the first few minutes are awkward you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . So , you have to really think about , like , how are you going to introduce this property ? How are you going to introduce this project ? You can talk about : If there 's an anecdote , that 's great ; if its something about the people who are in the room , that 's fantastic . With this book I could talk aboutthe producer had called me , we traded voice mails , and finally I just bought the book on my Kindle and I read it overnight and loved it . <p> And that 's not important in a weird way , but it just gets the ball rolling . It gets stuff started . <p> Craig : Well , it is important though because it shows that you care . I mean , we 've talked about this before . Its a weird thing to pitch something because you 're a salesperson . And when sales people come up to me , I 'm annoyed and skeptical frankly , as I should be . Because we all know enough about sales weve all seen Glengarry Glen Ross to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , if you care , and you are passionate about the material , then its not flimflam . Frankly , you are doing them a favor . You are giving them a chance to buy something that should be bought , because you 're going to do a really good job . And if you convey that and you get that across , its a very important thing . But it has to be true . <p> John : It has to be true . I mean , I think its a good idea to acknowledge someone else on your side , on your team who 's in the room with you . Just because if you 're going to be doing most of the talking , at least you 're sort of giving them a nod to say , like , this is an important person who 's here and there 's a reason why this person is in the room . <p> Then you 're going to talk about the things , you know , this is sort of Pitching 101 , but you 're going to talk about what the story feels like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of movie it is . You 're going to talk about the most important characters . If its based on an underlying property , you 're going to talk about what 's fantastic about the property , but also be honest about these are the challenges with this and this is where I think we can go in a better direction . <p> Because , they would hopefully have some exposure to what the underlying thing is . And they probably have some genuine concerns . So , if you head them off and sort of state their concerns , like you 're going to be worried about these three things , then they feel , " Oh , not only am I smart , but this writer is smart and understands what it is that I need to hear from him to get me past my basic objections . " <p> So , if you can start that way and then get into your actual , " This is how we open , " you 're going to be in a much better place . <p> Craig : Yeah . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , you pointed out its sometimes hard to begin a pitch . Its such a formal , strange thing to do . And weve all seen parodies of it in movies about Hollywood . It seems so ridiculous . <p> You know , in The Player its , " Night . Chinese Lanterns . " Its always so absurd sounding and kind of gross . But , what saves you is your first scene . Because the first scene of a movie is a similar difficult transition . People are in their seats , and they 're eating popcorn . Its quiet . There 's a company logo . And then something happens . And that something is designed to be a wakeup and an introduction , whether its gentle or abrupt . That 's why its there . So , use that . <p> If you 're not pitching your first scene the way people would experience it in the theater , I think you 're pitching it wrong . You may spend three or four minutes pitching that first scene , and then eight minutes pitching the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first scene , a well-crafted introduction to a world , and a character , and a problem , and a situation that gets everybody in the front of their seat and makes them think , " Okay , that 's a sample of how this person is going to be in control of this story , hopefully . " <p> John : In my experience I 've found that the degree to which its not quite clear when you started pitching is often very helpful . And so a lot of times you can start by talking about the character . And obviously you 're talking about your main character , and you can just sort of describe him . And we meet him and this is what 's happening . And because you 're often meeting your hero in the opening scene , that 's a nice way to transition into it . So , like you 've gotten into it without the sudden like stop , and then like " Tracking through the Los Angeles hill sides . " <p> It makes it feel like you are starting your story with your hero if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Craig : Right . Exactly . <p> John : Cool . So , that 's pitching . <p> And now I want to get to the third topic which is what I 'm sort of most excited to talk about which is your movie , Stolen Identity , which opened so huge <p> Craig : I think that 's great . laughs We should have called it that . <p> John : laughs Which opened so terrifically over this last weekend . And I got to see it at the ArcLight and loved it . I saw like a 5:30 show . It was pretty full . <p> And its always weird when you go to see a friends movie , in this case two friends movies , because I wanted it to be good for you , and I really wanted it to be good for Melissa . And Jason Bateman I know , but he s fine . Whatever , Jason Bateman . But I wanted it to be good for both of you , and it was really good for both of you . I was very , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a weird week . <p> John : Yeah . I know you did . So , tell us about that . <p> Craig : Well , I will . So , well start with the good news . The good news is the movie is a big success . And the audience that we set out to make the movie for showed up in droves . Weve gotten great word of mouth . It had a terrific opening weekend , far beyond our expectations . Frankly , if it had n't  been for the snow storm we could have made upward nearly $40 million . So , its a lot of people buying tickets ; a ton of people buying tickets for the movie . <p> And were still doing well . I mean , even on Tuesday , a Tuesday in February we made almost $3 million . So , that 's great . That is incredibly gratifying and it confirms what I suspected , because I watched the movie with test audiences long before the movie ever came out . So , I got to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a great time . Not everybody , but most of them . <p> And that 's why probably if you look back a couple of podcasts ago when we talk about Stolen Identity , or Identiweenie , as I like to call it . <p> John : I was also going with Identi-Thiefy . <p> Craig : Identi-Thiefy . When I was talking about Identi-Thiefy I was like , " Oh , and you know , I think the critics will like it . " Oh Craig . Oh stupid , stupid Craig . <p> So , my love affair with critics continues . Not big fans of mine . And this is the bad part of the week . And I want to talk about this in a way that perhaps people are n't  anticipating . Heres what I do n't  want to do : I am not going to discuss why the critics did n't  like it . Why so many of them seemed very , very angry about it . I 'm not going to talk about Rex Reed . I 'm not going to talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I 'm not going to do any of that . Not interested . <p> The critics will continue to do what they do . And I will continue to do what I do . And there 's nothing that either party is going to say to each other that 's going to change anything . So it goes . So it goes . <p> What I want to talk about is how terrible it all made me feel . And I want to talk about it because this is a podcast for screenwriters . And some of you out there are trying to be screenwriters and in success will have a movie in theaters . Some of you already are and have had movies in theaters . All of us who have movies in theaters , me more often than some , laughs but all of us will come face to face with bad reviews at some point or another . Or at all points . <p> And I am going to be very , very frank with all of you . It feels terrible . It was awful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , and I was proud of what I had done . I had watched it with people and I saw how Melissa and Jason had made people laugh , but also moved them to tears . And it was so great to watch . And then here come these reviews that basically say everybody stinks , especially this Mazin guy , how atrocious , how stupid , and illiterate , and so forth . <p> And for about three or four days I was kind of paralyzed in emotional anguish and misery . And I felt very , very stupid and very , very sad for myself . And rejected . And frankly just in pain . It really hurt . It hurt my feelings . Sometimes these phrases from childhood express our emotional states the best : My feelings were hurt . <p> And I wish that I could say to anybody out there that there 's a strategy to avoid this . There is n't . In fact , I think this is what needs to happen : It is a sign that you care . Do not bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason you 're in pain is because you care . The reason you 're in pain is because they 've attacked you and your expression . And they 've discounted it , and debased it , and frankly just made fun of it which is very much what goes on now in film criticism . There 's a mocking quality , all of it . You feel like a kid in the school yard who 's just been beaten up . <p> And good . That power that they have over us to some extent is real and will always be there . If you begin to close yourself off to being hurt , I fear that you begin to close yourself off from caring about what you 're doing . So , a good sign , I think , that I was in such terrible pain . But that 's not really to paint it with any kind of a brush . It stank . I 'm just now kind of coming out of it . <p> I cant even say that the big weekend sort of cured me of anything , because the truth is if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people go to see the movie and they send you all of these wonderful cards and things cards ? Sorry , what am I , in 1970 ? emails and Facebook posts and so forth , we have a natural tendency to discount the positive and over-emphasize the negative because the negative feels more honest somehow or more real . That is an illusion . <p> I think that there is just as much dishonesty in negativity as there is in positivity . So , when it happens to you , or if it has happened to you , all I can say is , " Yup , that stinks . " And there is nothing we can do about it except to endure it , and then when its done let it go and then get back to work . <p> And I 'll tell you for me the tough part is I know it will happen again , and again , and again , because I think what I like and what I do , they do n't  like . laughs And never will . And so this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I just have to find solace in the fact that the audiences do seem to like it . And they are who I make the movies for , for sure . <p> And so this pain goes along . There 's this phrase that Nietzsche popularized . I 'm a big fan of Nietzsche , John . Have you ever read any Nietzsche ? <p> John : laughs I 've read some Nietzsche . Its a little sad that you 're bring this up in the podcast , but yes I have . <p> Craig : Oh , why is it sad ? laughs <p> John : Its such a paragon of bleak times for me , yes . <p> Craig : Oh , it is ? You mean when you read Nietzsche ? 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Oh , I 'm sorry . Well , well work you through your therapy after . But Nietzsche is my favorite of all philosophers , if you can even call him a philosopher . I think he s sort of something more than that . But he spoke often of this concept of Amor Fati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love your fate . " <p> And this is my fate . laughs I get it . I am not to be feted at fancy dinners . I will not get awards . I will not get Red Ripe Tomatoes . I will for many , many people always be looked at as a goof and a bad writer . But , I do n't  believe I am one . And so I just have to accept it . That 's the way it is and that 's the way its going to continue to be . And so it goes . Amor Fati . <p> And here 's what he wrote . I just want to read one little thing that he wrote because this is sort of how I feel about it all . Nietzsche wrote , " I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things ; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful . Amor fati : let that be my love henceforth ! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accuse those who accuse . Looking away shall be my only negation . And all in all and on the whole : some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer . " And I love that . <p> And so I 'm going to really try next time to I 'm going to try looking away . That shall be my only negation . So , next movie I have out , please remind me to look away . <p> John : Can I challenge some of your theses here ? <p> Craig : Yes , of course . <p> John : Great . So , I 'll start with this last one , which I wont challenge , but I will actually encourage . And Frankenweenie was the first movie that I did not read reviews . And the reviews were pretty good . So , it was kind of easy to not read the reviews because I 'd say they were going to be good reviews , so that 's fantastic , and most people seemed to really like the movie . But I did n't  read them . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessed with them . Because my experience has been even in times exactly your point , that you will read ten glowing reviews and one negative review , and you will focus on the negative review . So , I decided , you know what , I 'm not going to read any of them this time . On Frankenweenie I read none of them . And I would encourage that . <p> Second point . I would remind you of an earlier conversation we had where we discussed film criticism versus film reviewing . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And so film criticism is the actual study of film and what film is doing and what it means , what the trends in film are . Film reviewing is , " This is what opened at the movies this week . " And film reviewers are the people who had it out for you with long knives this last time . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : My third point is that I feel like some of the reasons why they had their long knives out for you is because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this exact same movie , if exactly the same print was shown on the screen , but that opening card had read Kristen some-last-name , and it was her first script sale , they would not have been anywhere nearly as harsh . <p> Its because you were the guy who wrote the Hangover that I felt like , well <p> Craig : Well , the Hangover and Scary Movie whatever . <p> John : Oh , yeah , and Scary Movie , yes , yes . <p> Craig : That is true , contextually I think there is and its human , you know , but here I am , I 'm trying to explain it away . I do n't  want to do that . I 'm willing to stipulate that they genuinely hated it . <p> John : Yes . And so I would stipulate that there were people who genuinely did not like the movie , but I would also argue that any reasons for singling you out for it in many cases was because you are that guy . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : My next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Ben Affleck . Ben Affleck was a joke . Ben Affleck was a punch line . And Ben Affleck is now considered the best director . So , for you to say that this is your fate , and that you will always be perceived as this person , that 's absurd . And the fact that Ben Affleck <p> Craig : Well , I know what you mean <p> John : That like Ben Affleck can go from being the punch line and the guy who was dating J-Lo to acknowledged as a really good writer-director , I think , should be some evidence that you can arc . <p> Craig : Yes . You 're right . And really all I 'm saying I 'm not saying that I am incapable of writing something that maybe one day critics will like , although that 's not certainly my goal . I guess what I 'm saying is I have to be okay with the fact that it might not ever happen . That essentially I have to stop caring about it at all because the truth is its immaterial to what I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . <p> I do n't  know any writer that thinks that writing towards critics is a good idea . <p> John : I would agree . I think we talked about as part of my New Years resolution is not counting chickens before they hatch . This is not counting your emotional chickens before they hatch . And its trying to divorce yourself from the expectation of like " I will be a better person if a lot of people like this thing I just made . " And that 's not the reality and that does n't  last . <p> Craig : Yeah . Yeah . So , not counting the emotional chickens , precisely . And , you know , in a very real way I want to thank you . I 'm so glad that you liked the movie , because I know that you are a very , very honest person . And that means , frankly , more to me than buckets of bloggers and their pun-based reviews . So , thank you . <p> And I 've heard some great things from a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel goofy , and that 's why I needed to do this , frankly . I needed to be a little mawkish . But I also wanted to be honest because , look , in the end , what the hell else are we doing this for but to help each other ? Not you and me helping each other , but to help our little community of people . And this is something that happens and it wrecks people , you know ? It does . It really messes them up and it makes them sad . And I do n't  like that . I do n't  want any writer to be out there feeling as bad as I felt last week . It sucks . <p> And when I talk to writers , suddenly they have their stories and you start to realize , god , this is n't cool . This is n't healthy . We should n't get quite so dark about it . But yet by the same token its kind of a sign that we care . <p> The only thing I can say about reviews that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cynical " or " It was lazy . " No . If it were cynical or lazy , believe me , I would not have shed a single tear about the reviews . <p> John : Yeah . Now , Craig , I enjoyed so many things about it . And I do n't  want to sort of spoil it for people who have n't seen it by focusing on any one , although having directed a movie and having directed several things with Melissa , its so fascinating when you recognize an actors face so well that you recognize like , " Oh , that 's what Melissa looks like when she cries . " And so when she cries in the movie not a huge spoiler , there 's some actual genuine tears in there it was fantastic . And it was just so exciting to see like , " Oh , that 's Melissa . That 's what it looks like when she cries . " <p> But I also ca n't watch a movie without some sort of producer brain kicking in , or someone who has been through the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you which if you 'll indulge me. 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : Which is a game I like to play called Guess the Reshoot . <p> Craig : laughs Go . <p> John : So , I 'm guessing that when they go from St. Louis back to Denver there 's a car shot which was a reshoot which was done significantly after the fact . Because they shot the car , its daylight . <p> Craig : You mean that little car ride back to Denver ? <p> John : Yes . Its the one where shes sleeping with her eyes open . <p> Craig : No . Not a reshoot . <p> John : Thats crazy . Because it looks like he s in a wig . It just looks like it was shot seven months later . <p> Craig : You know what ? I think something kooky happened with the green screen at some point . You know , these days Well , first of all , the movie did not have a large budget . I think it was maybe $33 million or something like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Molly , and then literally the day after we wrapped on Identity Thief she flew to Boston to shoot The Heat which is coming out this summer , which also looks really , really good . <p> So , there was a tight schedule . And sometimes you 'll still shoot characters driving in cars in actual cars on little trailers which you pull around , but largely now theyll kind of cheat and theyll do a green screen thing . And then put plates in and so it looks like they 're driving but they 're not . And something seemed to go a little kablooey on a few of those . laughs I do n't  know what else to say . <p> John : Sorry , it was a bad plate shot rather than a reshoot . Its weird ; I noticed first that his hair just looked bizarre in it , so I assumed he was wigged because his hair had changed for some other role . And I 've been through that so many times , on Charlies Angels and on The Nines . <p> Craig : There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional photography . And that was n't where it was . But it was elsewhere . <p> John : Okay . Then I have to single out , first off , Amanda Peet who is just a national treasure , and she 's so good in your movie playing , you know , what seems like a its basically a reactive role . Shes sympathetic but she 's strong enough to say , " Well , this is not a good idea . " And yet she actually can bend to the fact that the plans change . <p> The scene with Melissa and Amanda at the kitchen is so good . laughs Its so specific . <p> Craig : Yeah . And I have to give Amanda credit because when she came onboard , the idea of that scene was her suggestion . And I loved it . And so then I went and wrote it and then , you know , shot it . And Melissa , definitely the Bermuda Triangle is Melissas invention inside of that scene . But , yeah , big fan . Big fan of Amanda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular . And I love Jason , too . I think they 're both great . And it was not to drag it back to mawkishness , but I was so angry about some of the stuff that was said about her . It justugh . I got very , very angry . <p> John : I got angry to hear the reports about it . But , again , I deliberately did n't  read it because I knew , " Do n't  read things that you know are going to just piss you off . " <p> Craig : Yeah . Well , you 're smart . <p> John : Craig , over the course of this podcast have you come up with a One Cool Thing that you want to talk about ? <p> Craig : I 'll bet I can figure one out by the time you finish your One Cool Thing . <p> John : Great . My One Cool Thing is something called Dungeon World , which sounds like its a fetish magazine , but its actually a role-playing game . Its a new take on something that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped down . <p> And so I had tweeted a few weeks ago about TSR which is now part of Wizards of the Coast , they had released all of their old modules as PDFs . And so I 'll have a link to that in the show notes . But this thing , Dungeon World , another reader had sent me the link to it . And its very , very cool . Its a cool idea . <p> So , it takes all the sort of , the stuff of D&amp;D and boils it down to a really , really simple system that does n't  have turns or initiative . Its all just talking . And its a very clever idea . <p> Its a Kickstarter project that got funded , so its in this weird in between state where its sort of open source and sort of a physical product you can buy , but I 'll have a link to it . And if you 're at all curious about sort of what a reboot of Dungeons &amp; Dragons would look like . Its worth your time to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were talking I did actually think of a possible Cool Thing . And , you know , I love Possible Cool Things . You do things that actually are currently cool , and I do things that might be cool if they ever happen . And you know I love science and I love medicine . <p> John : Please . <p> Craig : So , the Holy Grail what do you think , John , if you ran a pharmaceutical company , what to you would be the Holy Grail medicine , to find , to discover , and bring to market ? <p> John : A cure for cancer . <p> Craig : Exactly . And you would be right if companies were interested in saving lives , but they 're not . Remember , you are the CEO of a corporation with shareholders and they want money . Now , reevaluate your answer . What would be , you , money bags , what would be the drug you 'd want to bring to market ? <p> John : A sexual aid ? <p> Craig : No . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of a pharmaceutical company and I did not care about saving lives , I only cared about my bottom line , I would want to bring an anti-obesity drug to market . <p> John : Oh yeah . I 'm an idiot , of course , that 's exactly right . <p> Craig : Boom . Yeah , I mean , you would just make a killing , right ? <p> John : And at times they have had anti-obesity drugs , but theyve always done terrible things to you and they get pulled from the market . <p> Craig : Thats the thing . Here are the problems with anti-obesity drugs to date : A , they do n't  work ; or , B , they work but they 're addictive because they 're basically speed and they mess up your brain and your metabolism ; or , C , they have terrible life impinging side effects like damage to your valves , the cardiac valves . All sorts of problems . <p> And it makes sense because if you try and pull on strings and gears inside the metabolism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body in a huge important way . Its going to , perhaps throw other things out of stasis , and then you have a huge problem . <p> So , they keep trying and they keep trying . There is some glimmer of hope all of a sudden . You know how Viagra came to be discovered as a sexual aid ? <p> John : It was as a side effect on another drug they were testing , right ? It was a heart medicine I thought . <p> Craig : Yes , it was a heart medicine . I believe you 're exactly right . Same thing for what 's the Minoxidil <p> John : Yeah , Propecia . <p> Craig : Yeah , the stuff that grows your hair . That also , I think , was for some sort of heart condition and they went , oh look , people are suddenly hairy . <p> John : I 'm correcting myself already . So , Propecia is a different thing than Minoxidil , but Minoxidil , you 're right , was a heart thing . <p> Craig : Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these off-label applications . You have a drug that does one thing , its intended to do one thing , its FDA-rated to do one thing , but then , " Oh off-label it also does this other thing . Maybe we should use it for that . " <p> Of all things , there is a drug that is used to treat canker sores . And what researchers have found is that this drug happens to be extraordinarily good at turning obese mice into normal weight mice . And apparently does so safely . That this drug is one of those drugs that 's been around forever . There 's a ton of research to back up its general safety to people . It does n't  seem to do anything wrong . It just , at least in fat mice , makes them skinny . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : So , soon theyll be starting clinical trials on people . Now , at that point well read about how their hands are falling off , or their hearts are exploding , but still , considering the enormous health implications out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that there might be a medicine for something like this , particularly for people who are just biologically inclined to gain weight like myself , its encouraging . <p> John : I agree . <p> Craig : Because , let 's face it , the whole eat less and exercise thing for 99 percent of people does n't  seem to work . <p> John : Its a very challenging chore . <p> Craig : So One Almost Cool Thing . <p> John : That 's a very cool thing . And if I were to be writing a spec TV pilot , for example , I would think of House of Cards but in the pharmaceutical industry and you have that drug . So , writers , go off and do that . <p> Craig : Come on guys . Go off and just kick us back 1 percent . <p> John : Wed like it . <p> Craig , thank you so much for a fun podcast . This is our last one that we will be recording in the Los Angeles region . I will be in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a different microphone so Ill sound different , but it will still be fun . <p> Craig : Well , you know what ? You 'll always be you . <p> John : I 'll always be me . Ill always be me no matter what time zone I 'm in. 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : So , standard reminders : If you enjoyed the podcast , please subscribe to us in iTunes because that 's how we can actually know that you 're listening to it . While you 're there you could leave us a nice review , because we like those , and we actually do read those . And they 're lovely and they 're a great counter to the negative reviews of movies we 've made . <p> Craig : Yeah , yeah . It would be nice to read a couple of good reviews for once . laughs Sure , why not ? I 've admitted I 'm human . <p> John : Those are reviews we actually will read . People have continued to fill out the screenwriting survey , but I think were kind of done . So , thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to take that link down because we have like thousands of responses , which is great , and we 've learned a lot about who our readers are and what we want to do . 
@@42311521 @2311521/ <p> I was perusing your site , and it occurred to me that you might be a good person to ask a question Ive been struggling with . <p> Ive been a working screenwriter for about five years . I 've never had anything produced , but some things are looking promising . I 've worked at most of the major studios , and my career thus far has been steadily getting better . No spectacular ups and downs . <p> Over the years , I 've pitched on quite a few rewrites , passed on a few , and done a few . Most rewrite opportunities that come my way are pretty bad . A lot of times , people are looking to breathe new life into their stalled projects . When you read them , its clear those projects have stalled for a reason . <p> here 's my question . I mostly get rewrite opportunities on scripts that are based on mediocre ideas that are also badly executed . I 'm generally interested in making money , but I 'm not desperate . I do n't  HAVE to do everything that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make much , much better . <p> here 's the catch : they 're based on mediocre ideas . Its never going to be GREAT . If I bust ass and do what the producers want , it might be solid , professional , entertaining and generally well-written , but itll still be kind of derivative and unoriginal . In this ( very common ) case , should I : <p> Take the job and just make it the best it can be , without making fundamental changes to the idea . I 've done this . The problem , it seems , is that people are really happy with you initially because you 've fixed the problems . But , when they go out to get it made , the fact that the idea was never that great becomes a problem . And inevitably , their enthusiasm for you as a writer cools . Since you were the last writer on the project , it becomes kind of your fault that the project is stalled again . Is that okay ? Does it matter ? <p> Take the job and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the project actually good . I tried this , as well . I 'm proud of the work I did , and everyone I gave it to who had nothing to do with the project thought it was a HUGE improvement . But it was a horrible move politically , since I was changing ideas that had originated with the producers . I had been careful to make it clear what I was doing , but they werent listening they just wanted it rewritten . Then I turned it in , and was burned alive . <p> Pass on rewrites that are n't  based on good ideas . I 've certainly done this , but I worry that it just takes you out of the rewrite pool . My agents are n't  going to endlessly send me rewrite gigs if I pass all the time . Rewrites are a big part of the business . <p> I know this is a long-winded question , but its a thorny dilemma .

But I think his question is helpful because it points out the tough choices you end up making as a screenwriter . <p> Deep down , a screenwriter wants many things : money , artistic satisfaction , the respect of his peers . But if you were to really ask <p> STUDIO EXEC : What kinds of movies do you want to write ? SCREENWRITER : Movies that get made . <p> Unlike the novelist , whose work is finished the minute she hits " Print " , the screenwriter is beholden to countless external forces who will determine whether or not his screenplay becomes a film .

Still , he has a career , because the people who hire screenwriters recognize his talent . <p> What should Matt do when rewrites come knocking ? I think all three of his options have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd do : <p> Pass on fundamentally bad ideas . Note the difference between " bad idea " and " not based on a good idea . " Lots of good movies are based on ideas that , on their surface , do n't  seem especially promising . Keep those in the mix . You 're just trying to weed out the concepts that , even if perfectly executed , would be lackluster . ( " He s a clown who solves grizzly murders ! " ) <p> Pass on perma-development projects . Watch out for the project that one mid-level studio executive is championing , particularly if he says something to the effect of : " I think if we could just crack this one thing , then the Studio Bosses will get it . " Nope . That project is going to be sitting on the development list for years . You have plenty of unmade projects . You need a produced movie . <p> If you 're planning major changes , say so before you take the job . And if they 're squeamish about what you 're planning to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities involved with the project , but at least they were warned . <p> Accept that sometimes , you 're shining shit . Or to put it more optimistically , you 're making a bad movie better . Think of yourself as an interior designer . True , new paint and curtains wont fix the hole in the living room ceiling , but they might make you notice it less . <p> In the end , remember that you 're a screenwriter , not a screen-rewriter . You do n't  want to make a career of it . But sometimes , rewriting a bad movie can be liberating , because you know that almost anything you do will improve it .

My manager is very well-connected and on the up-and-up , but as he will take a producing credit for this film , I know he s after his own interests as well as mine , and I want to make sure hell get me the highest possible paycheck for my efforts .

Assuming the films budget is around $15M and I 'm a first-time writer , what can I expect ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That 's currently WGA scale for an original screenplay . At $15 million , your movie would very likely be made for a company that 's a WGA signatory , and would fall in the " high " budget category.1 All of the major studios are signatories , as are most of the production companies you 've heard of . If you 're with one of these places , the least they can pay you is WGA scale , and you 're automatically a member of the guild.2 <p> So that 's how much you should expect to earn . Should you hope to get more ? Yes . And maybe you will , especially if you have multiple interested buyers . But I 'd urge you to emotionally condition yourself for that number and be delighted with anything above it . <p> If a deal comes together quickly , use an entertainment attorney to negotiate on your behalf .

Once you sign with an agent , he or she will start making deals on your behalf in concert with your manager and attorney . But its not an essential component right now . <p> Its scary and exciting think about What Might Be , but far more important is the work in front of you . <p> Keep writing . I know far too many screenwriters who pinned all their hopes on one script that never quite found footing .

Screenwriting is the art of economy , and overusing parenthetical comments will not only break the flow of the dialogue , theyll drive the reader crazy .

Hey , its gon na be a good podcast ! <p> John : laughs Yeah , we 've gotten Craig angry . I do n't  know what to say to Amazon . It just feels like a really weird , dumb choice . Because if they 're going to trumpet their system and how they were able to get to this point based on their system of development then you should talk about the people who were involved in that system . And that feels like a frustrating choice . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : So I cant help but kind of wish Amazon well , because I want them to succeed , and I want them to be able to make movies and spend money in the industry because I think more people need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they chose not to trumpet the right things in the press release . <p> Craig : I know . And just to be clear , this is n't about ego . If it were just a matter of professional pride I would choke it down because I do n't  really care about stuff like that . The issue here is when you do n't  talk about the writer , and when you just go I mean , look , who 's directing ? Clive ? <p> Craig : I mean , he s a pulp novelist , and a fine one at that . But , I mean , come on . You know , when you do n't  mention the writer what you are doing is by extension perpetuating the culture that sort of says , " Well , you know , but the script , who cares . The most important this is that we got Clive Barker to direct Zombies vs . Gladiators . " Its actually not the most important thing . You would n't have gotten there without it . <p> Why do n't  you extend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , especially if you 're running a business that is trading on screenplays ? Argh ! Come on . Stupid . <p> John : Next bit of follow up : Last podcast we talked about were going to do a live version of Scriptnotes at the Austin Film Festival and were very excited about that . But wed love to do some live episodes here in Los Angeles . And so we solicited some listener feedback on places where we could do it , and we 've gotten like a lot of really good suggestions . So , thank you for that . If you have further suggestions for a venue we could use well certainly add them to the list . <p> Ideally we 'd want some place that we could control for the night , have some people in there . It does n't  have to be too many people , but enough that we could actually solicit some feedback . Drinks would be fantastic , but not required . So , if you have more thoughts , you 're always welcome to send them in . <p> Craig : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated . laughs <p> Craig : And you do n't  either . Yeah , I think , I would say sort of east of La Brea , north of Downtown would be spectacular . <p> John : I went to a really good video game little summit meeting thing that was done at Bergamot Station which is in Santa Monica . And so I was like , wow , Bergamot Station is fantastic . But I 'd never want to come back to Santa Monica at night ; I never want to fight traffic to get there . <p> Craig : Oh yeah . I was working for Bruckheimer for awhile . And those guys , I love those guys , but man every time they would do this to me . They were like , " Look , " they would always apologize , like it mattered . Like apologizing to me was going to fix what was about to come and then say , " We need you to come in tomorrow and the only time we have is 4 oclock . " <p> So , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the world . But then you have an hour and a half meeting and it was always lengthy . And by the time you 're out its 5:45 , or 6 , and I would just make dinner plans ahead of time . I would just stay because you simply could n't get back from there . <p> John : Listeners who do n't  live in Los Angeles cant possibly understand the east/west divide , its not about territory or anything else , its just so hard to move east/west in this city that if you get stuck at the wrong place at the wrong time you 're in for a really hellish amount of sitting around . <p> Craig : And I should also mention its just as hard to move north and south . laughs Yeah , and there 's a diagonal that 's also brutal . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : The 101 is sort of diagonal . And I do n't  know if you guys have seen the sketch , the recurring sketch The Californians on Saturday Night Live ; the running joke is that everybody in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take to avoid traffic . laughs <p> John : laughs Its horribly accurate . What I will say about the north/south split is that most of the business of Hollywood sort of takes place on an east/west axis , and so you do n't  have to go north or south that often . Unless you 're like shooting something down in Long Beach and then just god help you . Just god help you . <p> Craig : Well , the worst of it is , I remember talking to , there 's a Mark Vahradian , he works with Lorenzo di Bonaventura I think ; they have a deal at Paramount , producers . But Mark was a Disney executive and the very first thing I did for Bruckheimer was way back in like 2000 or something like that . And Mark was the executive and he would have to go from Disney to and Bruckheimer is like Olympic and 10th , or some horrifying Santa Monica location and he s like , " This is the worst possible because now I have to go west and south , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we could only have meetings basically at 1 oclock . It was the only time that would sort of save us all the grief . <p> Its awful . Awful . <p> John : Yeah . Skype . Skype is really what you need . And the Bruckheimer people , if they 're going to have like hour and a half meetings , just get good at Skype . I have not seen Craig Mazin in person in months . <p> Craig : Right ! <p> John : And I 'm better for it and were able to make this podcast . <p> Craig : Right . If we can do this , I mean , cant we just have a discussion via Skype ? But its gotten to the point now where honestly I do n't  , and this is n't going to come as any no despair will result at Sony by me saying this , but I do n't  want to really work there . Its too far away . laughs Not that they 're pounding on my door , but its far away ! And then Bruckheimer is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Nothing to do . Let 's move on to our big topics , our three things . First off I want to talk about screenwriting software and sort of where were at because , I do n't  know if you can tell , I 'm actually kind of floating a little bit today because I finished a script . I finished a script this afternoon . <p> Craig : Congratulations . <p> John : Thank you . And as we talked about on an earlier podcast , you do n't  do anything special to celebrate . And I do n't  usually do anything special to celebrate , but this was like a long time coming . You know what this project was . To actually be done with it is just a huge weight off my back . I cant sort of talk about the project itself , but I can about what was different about this one its the first thing I ever wrote in Scrivener rather than writing it in Final Draft or Movie Magic . I wrote it in Scrivener . <p> And so I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you downloaded it ? Have you ever played around with it ? <p> Craig : I have . And I did n't  It was a little , um , because its not simply for screenwriting , its for outlining and idea collecting , whatever , it just <p> It was too much . <p> John : It seems like too much . And they have really good tutorials that can sort of walk you through it , but still like that first window opens and you 're like , oh my god , there 's just too much on the screen . I cant . <p> Craig : Too much . Yeah . <p> John : Yeah . And so you can get rid of a lot of that stuff . And , some of that stuff is really ingenious , but the short version of this review , if people want to fast-forward , is that Scrivener is an amazing application if you 're writing a novel because it can organize things in ways that are just spectacular . And you can do several little things for your character stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters separately , and I ended up keep scenes separately . <p> So , I 'll talk you through sort of my workflow on it , and the things I liked about it . <p> Craig : Okay . <p> John : So , as I 've discussed before , when I start to write a project I usually go off and barricade myself someplace and I just write scenes by hand . And I send them through and Stuart , or whoever my assistant is at that time , types them up and puts them in a folder . And then at some point in the process I will gather together all those little typed up things and make the full script . But I usually wo n't do that until I 'm like 50 or 60 pages into it so that Ive broken the back of it . <p> What Scrivener is very good about is how it will let you keep those files separate . And they gather in sort of like a notebook and then at any point you can sort of combine them or split them apart and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one little scene , or the next little scene , and not see everything else that 's around it . When you 're working on a long and real full screenplay in Final Draft there 's that constant temptation to scroll up and scroll down , and scroll up and scroll down . And you 're just working on this little piece in the middle , but then you want to kind of look back at that thing there . This kept me really focused on this is the scene I 'm writing . Each little scene is like a little slug line over the left hand side and I 'm only working on that . And its all I 'm seeing ; I 'm not seeing above it and I 'm not seeing below it , unless I choose to go see something above it or below it . <p> And it was very good for helping me focus . It has a really good full-screen mode , which I 've come to appreciate . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : So , the sides go dark and you 're just seeing your main text . You can zoom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does a pretty good job with the screenplay formatting . It does some of the same matting things that Final Draft does where you put the wrong name God help you if you type someones character name wrong . And it provides that 1,000 times and you have to go through and clear the smart type list . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : It does a bit of that . A few times grabbing the wrong element . But on the whole it was fine . And so if someone has Scrivener and they say , " Could I write a screenplay in it ? " Yeah , you could . That said , when I was done today , one of the first things I did is I exported to Final Draft and sort of I made my clean up in Final Draft . <p> Craig : Yeah . And just to be clear : Scriveners composition area for screenplays , does it have essentially the same kind of function that Movie Magic or Final Draft does where it organizes it by action , character , dialogue , parenthetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements that you 're selecting work largely the same way , little selectors at the bottom of the screen . It does a reasonably good job of guessing what the next element should be most times . A few times I got a little frustrated , but a couple is fine . <p> Craig : And its a tab-enter ? <p> John : Tab-enter , that whole kind of thing . <p> Craig : All right , well , that 's a pretty good review . I mean , but then again , you went running back to the comforting bosom of Well , I do n't  know how comforting that bosom is . <p> John : Its not comforting . <p> Craig : The rocky , unsightly bosom of Final Draft . <p> John : I wanted to go out to Final Draft because I knew I would need to ultimately be there to do some stuff . I mean , down the road I 'm going to have revisions , its going to be there . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And there was n't so much that was so amazingly better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there rather than be in Final Draft for the real stuff . <p> Oh , but I will say that the most illuminating thing about being in Scrivener for this whole script is Fountain , which is the other project Ive been working on here , which is that plain text screenwriting format that we 've been developing , I 'm definitely going to write my next script just in Fountain . <p> So , Fountain is just text . There 's no formatting . Its just character names are uppercase , dialogue is the line below a characters name . That 's what we 've been working on here and we have Highland which is the utility for it . And it was n't quite ready for me to start working when I was starting this draft , but I totally from now on would write a first draft in that . <p> Craig : Thats your plan ? <p> John : Thats my plan . Because I feel like we focus so much on getting , like , the margins right and getting everything to look like a screenplay a little too early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book were going to publish back when were still typing it . And you can really type it without getting all of those margins stuff ready . <p> Craig : Thats right . I have become comfortable , I suppose , with my OCD in that regard . And I think I do n't  have it any better or worse than the average screenwriter , you know . I do have a concern about how the page looks . I do n't  like important revelations to be split up by a " more , " " continued , " and page break . You know , stuff like that . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : But , yeah , I mean some of it is just sort of fussy delay tactics to provide the illusion of control over something that you are hanging onto for dear life . <p> John : I would say that I 'm actually OCD about all those same things , but I 'm pushing back that OCD to the point that I 'm really compiling the whole script together . <p> Craig : Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . Because I shouldnt be focusing on any of that stuff when I 'm just pushing the words around on the page . And so a lot of my frustration with , like , " Oh it thinks that element is this when it should be this , " well I shouldnt be worrying about that at all . It should be perfectly clear I know that 's my characters name , and I know that 's dialogue ; I do n't  need the program to do anything for me right now . <p> Craig : Its funny . Sometimes what I do is I will take a walk and think the scene in my head , write in my head essentially . And then when I get back I will just email to myself in nothing but text , and almost no description at all , really just the flow of the dialogue , because I know what 's supposed to go around it . And then when I sit down and write I am essentially compiling it myself instead of having but even then what I 'm writing is an even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : But honestly , what that bare bones you 're doing , that is essentially Fountain . Fountain can take an email and make it into a script . So <p> Craig : But I do n't  even write character names . So it cant do that . <p> John : No , its cant . Its not psychic . <p> Craig : Its not magic , John . <p> John : Its almost magic , but its not magic . It ca n't quite do that , but its very close to that . <p> Craig : Its close to wizardry . Ive been a little behind . You know , my secret hope for the future is Fade In , which is this wonderful piece of independent screenwriting software that Kent Tessman has authored . And I 'm a little behind because I got a version a couple months ago and I started working with it and discovered three or four things that I knew werent right that needed to change . And I spoke with Kent about it and he finally agreed . <p> And I liked why he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that things are is n't sort of normal . And I had to sort of explain that screenwriting is n't really normal and it needs to be .. You know , things like when you delete things , normally you would want to pull stuff up , but in screenwriting you do n't  . You actually want to leave everything where it is . Kind of . I mean , not pull up , but like you do n't  want to move elements up . You want to leave them in their box . <p> So , I have n't had a chance to see the latest version . But I would love to write my script on Fade In . So , that 's where I Because it is cleaner , and prettier , and full-screen beautiful . And I like it . <p> John : Yeah . I did n't  sign a non-disclosure agreement , so I do n't  think Im violating anything weird by saying I had a chance to see Final Drafts iPad Writer . So , theyve announced that they 're going to make a writing app for the iPad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was actually kind of impressed by it . So , its really Final Drafty , but it seems really functional . So , its another choice that screenwriters will have down the road . <p> Craig : I do n't  like writing on an iPad . Its very slow . <p> John : Well , with a proper keyboard I 'm sure its much better . <p> Craig : Yeah , I guess . But then at that point just give me my laptop . You know what I mean ? <p> John : A case can be made for that . <p> Enough on screenwriting software . Let 's segue onto just the whole genesis of when do you know that you 're ready to start writing a script ? This is a thing that came up in a discussion I had at the Outfest Screenwriters Lab yesterday , sort of how do you know that you have enough set and ready to start writing . <p> And it came up because there 's one guy who I was talking to who had a project that sounded really cool , incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doing his outlines for more than a year . And I said , " No , no , no . You need to actually write because you are going to become one of those writers who never actually writes but is always planning for like the big thing . " <p> Craig : Yeah . Thats kind of the opposite of the more common problem which is the whole , " I find it as I go . " Yeah , that which I really do n't  like . <p> John : Theres two reasons why writers , I think , often fail is that they started writing too soon , because they really knew how the story began , so they wrote that . And they were so excited and they had no idea what happened after that point . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : So they lose their enthusiasm . They have ten interesting pages sitting there . Or the writers who just kind of never start because theyve just been staring at it for so long and trying to figure out those little things that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff and see what happens . <p> Craig : Yeah . And writers , of course every writer must be accountable to their own brain and what works best for them . You know , some writers require a kind of a scene-by-scene understanding . I have sort of over the years found myself basically using an index card system . I need to know what basically is happening in each scene and what the purpose of each scene is , all the way from beginning to end . And , you know , I do n't  know ; I 'm looking at actually right in front of me are the index cards for I 'd Theft . And , you know , there 's about maybe 15 , 16 cards in the first deck . There 's probably 20 cards in the second . And five cards in the third . <p> So its not a tremendous amount . But I know what all the scenes are . And more importantly , I know what the movie is . So everything is written with that purpose and unity . But once I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the issue is I do n't  need to have all the cards , but I need to know what the movie is . And to me knowing what the movie is is n't just knowing where the movie starts . I need to be able to picture several scenes in the middle of the movie that feel like , okay , I get what that movie is ; I see what that thing is . I know how that 's I do n't  necessarily need to know quite how I 'm going to get to that thing , but I need to know what that thing is. 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : So , I need to be able to picture those moments . And this script that I just finished today , it sort of sat in my head too long because it got pushed back because of other stuff that came up . But by the time I could sit down I could really see what all those big moments were along the way , and I could see what sort of the reversals were with some characters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also knew that all of those moments were going to feel like they were part of the same movie , even though they were different colors and different textures , and things were going to change over the course of the movie , I knew it felt like one thing that wanted to stay together . <p> And I 've found that at a certain point , this happened with The Nines , too , where like the ideas will say , " Okay , you either have to write me or abandon me . " Because its taking up so many brain cycles to sort of keep it alive in your head that you have to , " Okay , I 'm going to sit down , and buckle down , and actually get this on the page . " <p> Craig : Yeah , you know , its funny . What you just described is sort of where I am right before I fill in all the other cards . And that 's a perfectly reasonable step to skip because I do n't  start writing cards in sequence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , what is the premise , who is the hero , and how does it end because what is the theme ? What is the argument of the movie on some level or another ? <p> And then I come up with those big goal post moments that are in the very big , broad sweeps . You know , there 's probably only four of them in the movie , I think , you know . And then I start to fill in around them to connect them together . But I could also write from goal post to goal post . I do n't  have to do index cards . It just makes me feel better . And , of course , as you start writing you realize , oh , my index cards are stupid now ; I do n't  need them . <p> But the other great thing about index cards I will say is that when I am done with the content that was indicated by the index card , then I draw a big red Sharpie across it . It feels so good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've done some part of it , that its finished . I do n't  do a lot of that outlining stuff until I get pretty deep into writing the script , and then I can start to figure out , " Okay , what do I have left to write ? " And then I make my list of like these are the scenes I have left to write , and then its incredibly rewarding to be able to scratch those through . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And for whatever reason I always end up at the right page length . <p> Craig : Always . I always do . <p> John : My friend Rawson who I love dearly but is like , " Oh , I got the first draft done . It was like 170 pages . " <p> Craig : Come on , Rawson ! <p> John : Something did not work right there , because you should not be writing a 170-page script . <p> Craig : And that to me is , and I love Rawson , too he s a great guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , obviously he has his process . I mean , my whole thing is I do n't  want to write 170 pages . I feel like I 'm wasting everybodys time , including my own . I want to kind of figure out the right 60 pages to cut before I write the 170 pages . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : So , I actually start to do that . One of the great things about outlining and index carding out your movie is that you can really just see where it suddenly starts to get sodden and limp . And then you compress and typically I actually do n't  get scared when I see like , " Oh god , there 's like five scenes here , there should be one . " I just think , " Or there could be one really good scene that layers in a whole bunch of these things so its not so linear . " <p> And I routinely land between 107 and 119 , like every time . <p> John : Yeah . I was 114 pages when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that 's right in the middle of my thing . <p> John : And so here 's the thing , because I was doing it in Scrivener I did n't  compile it until I was really all done . So , literally until this afternoon I had no idea how long it was . <p> Craig : Oh , that 's like , " What will our baby be ? Oh , its a boy ! " <p> John : Yeah . There were two choices . But , well , you hope there 's two choices . <p> Craig : Right . " Oh , its intersex ! " <p> John : Yeah , the life became challenging , but potentially rewarding and maybe there 's a great narrative to be found there . <p> Craig : Oh , its a Rawson ! <p> John : Oh , come now . <p> Craig : laughs I hope Rawson listens to this . <p> John : Yeah . Rawsons busy . Rawson is going off to direct a movie . But he does listen to the podcast sometimes . <p> Craig : Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> John : Yeah . here 's how Rawson will find out about this podcast . I 'm sure Rawson has a Google News Alert setup . And so when the transcript of this podcast is posted he will get a Google News Alert , and then he will know that we talked about him . <p> Craig : Right . So in that Google News Alert will it mention that Rawson is , and now we can fill in anything we want . <p> John : Absolutely . Because that will become part of his little Google profile . <p> Craig : Will it mention that Rawson is a synthetic life from ? <p> John : laughs Yes . That 's already well established . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Craig , before we go to our third point , there 's something I meant to bring up earlier , because an amazing thing happened this last weekend . For the first time I got a script that they wanted me to read over the weekend , it was kind of a high priority project for these people , and I 'm the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people want to watermark their scripts so they do n't  get circulated beyond places . <p> And I 've dealt with , like Marvel , who 's really notorious for super watermarking all of their stuff . So , I 'm pretty used to watermarking . This time what they sent over was not the script . They sent over an iPad with the script as a PDF in iBooks . And its a big old , well that 's not very secure . But , what theyve done is they 've turned on parental lock controls for the whole thing . <p> Craig : Ah ! <p> John : And they have taken out all of the web accessibility and stuff . So , I 'm sure there probably was a way that a person could get it off , but it would be really , really hard to get that script off the iPad . So in the end I was kind of impressed by it . That 's not a bad way , if you need to give a script to somebody and make sure they read it but do n't  do anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not , yeah , I 'll have to see . I mean , I 'm sure within four minutes on Google we can figure out how to foil that . But , still , not a bad idea . <p> John : Pretty good . <p> Craig : Yeah . And , plus , its fun . If somebody sends me a script by email or messenger or something , then its on my pile of things to read . But if somebody sends me a script on an iPad , I just want to read it . laughs I want to read it right away . <p> John : So , Craig , I 'm going to send you over this script on an iPad so that you 'll actually read it . <p> Craig : Oh , yeah , because I did read 30 pages of your script and justlaughs <p> John : Yeah , the one that I sent you before . You were like , " Oh , yeah , I 'll get to it . " Yeah , that was very helpful . <p> Craig : By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Craig is a little behind on reading something . But you know what , Craig ? You can stop reading that for reasons that I 'll talk to you about offline . <p> Craig : Well you see then I really saved us both time . laughs But the truth is until you just said that I forgot . I totally forgot it ! I feel terrible . Because I knew I had read 30 pages and was like , " I got to finish that , " and then it left my mind . And you , honestly , are either incredibly patient or you were just really setting a trap for me because you never mentioned it again . And so then I forgot . I 'm sorry . <p> John : Yeah . Its okay . <p> Craig : It was a good first 30 pages , though . <p> John : You know , a script that might circulate on an iPad because they certainly do n't  want people to know spoilers is Game of Thrones . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : Segue into our last topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Craig : I liked it a lot . <p> John : Yeah , so again , spoiler alert here , because there 's sort of no way to not talk about spoilers for the season finale of Game of Thrones . But we had talked in an earlier podcast about how amazing the season was and my only one frustration was I felt like the Qarth plotline was sort of tap dancing around a bit because they clearly had a big reveal and they werent ready for it , so they were just sort of stalling to save that for the season finale . <p> But the stuff in the season finale was really good . <p> Craig : It was . Although I will still say , okay , so I mean I guess we should put the spoiler alert on for anyone who has n't  caught up yet , bizarrely . The zombie army at the end was awesome . And everything , as always , with Dinklage was awesome . And Brienne had a great moment . That was sick . Loved that . <p> I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff in it . And , oh , a really funny moment , I mean a sad but funny moment with Theon and his guys clocking him and , like , " I thought he would never shut up . " That was great . I did not see that coming , so , well done as always with those guys . <p> The Qarth thing for me ultimately , I was like I just , I 'm not sure if any of that was really worth it in the end because , you know , remember the first season ends with this amazing moment where this girl who had been kidnapped and sort of subjugated by her mean brother and then her rapist husband , sort of blossoms into this incredibly self-possessed woman who then at the very end survives fire and hatches dragons which that 's quite an arc . <p> And this season she went to a town and then the dragons sort of lit a guy on fire . <p> John : Yes . What I will say is that if you take out what I thought were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you just took a look at what she did in this episode , yes , she goes into that tower , but then she also goes through that temptation sequence where she ends up at the Wall , she ends up back with her husband . She sees the throne , but like everything has changed around it . She has her temptation sequence . I thought it was very , very cool . It felt like it sets her up as a truly kind of mythical creature . <p> I like that she defended herself as like , " Well what about my magic ? " And that defining kind of stuff . And the warlock saying , " You know what ? Its because the dragons are here that the magic is increasing in the world , " which is cool . <p> Craig : Right . I like that .

Its hard to direct television like that because I would imagine they 're producing these things in huge chunks . They do n't  do them episode by episode . Theyve got to do all the stuff in Iceland . Theyve got to do all the stuff in Ireland . <p> And , so , they managed quite beautifully over many directors and many different locations and completely out of sequence to maintain these wonderful transitions and hold everything together . The show is very well written and very well acted .

And this thing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he s waking up in a hospital . And you do n't  see the plane crash at all . And then over the course of the trailer they give you drips and drabs of his plane crash . And then there 's one final shot . <p> John : That shot , I get goose bumps just thinking about that final shot . <p> Craig : Okay ? Just thinking about it . And my deal is , and I wrote something for , you can dig it up for the links if you want , for WordPress sic. many years ago about marketing and how screenwriters can help marketers in one little tiny way . And that is for all of the goo-goo bananas silliness of trailers , if there 's one image or line moment in a trailer that is really astonishing , or surprising , or fresh in some say , sometimes its even just a little joke that grabs people , it will work . You will drive people to the theaters . <p> I think in that essay I wrote I refer to the moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Caribbean , I 'm like , okay , yeah , its pirates and guns and stuff . And then they turned into skeletons and I was like , " Okie dokie , that was cool . " laughs You know ? Like I did not see that one coming . " You better start believing in ghost stories , you 're in one , " you know ? <p> And in this theres this shot at the end where you go , " Oh ? ! OH ? ! " And then you really want to see this movie . So , awesome trailer . I 'm sure the movies gon na be fantastic . Very happy for John .

@@42311541 @2311541/ <p> Discussing the very talky opening scene of The Social Network , Aaron Sorkin makes a key point about how writers dole out information : <p> We started at 100 miles an hour in the middle of a conversation , and that makes the audience have to run to catch up . The worst crime you can commit with an audience is telling them something they already know . We were always running ahead . <p> Figuring out what the audience needs to know and when they need to know it is one of the trickiest aspects of screenwriting . The novelist can suspend the action for paragraphs or pages to establish background information . Screenwriters cant . We do n't  have an authorial voice to fill in the missing details . Everything we want the audience to know has to be spoken by a character , or better yet visualized in a way that suits the big screen.1 <p> So we have to be clever . Sometimes , we use the form to our advantage : A lengthy sequence explaining dinosaur cloning techniques in Michael Crichtons novel Jurassic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation . In most cases , we do more with less , distilling the information down to a minimum effective dose to get the audience through the scene , sequence and story . <p> The frustration for screenwriters is that many of the decision-makers directors , producers , studio executives will have different opinions about that minimum effective dose . Directors will try to cut all the dialogue . Producers will focus on strange details , having read the script so many times that theyve lost fresh eyes . And studio executives , having faced confused audiences at low-scoring test screenings , will want things over-explained to painful degrees . <p> But that 's politics . In terms of craft , Sorkins point holds : you engage the audience by making them work . One of the best ways is by understanding and controlling what they know . <p> As a trade-off for losing the authorial voice , movies get something good in return : the audiences complete attention .

I 'm from India Bollywood . Been here , in Los Angeles , for three years . People whove read my scripts ( Hollywood scripts ) like em except the dialogue . After a lot of research , I understand how to write American " lingo " , but . <p> I have no clue when to use " I 've " as opposed to " I have , " " Youre " as opposed to " You are . " In recent movie Bad Santa even word " Okay " on subtitle was " Kay " . <p> The usual internet response to this kind of basic question is : " If you do n't  know the difference , you should n't write .

Why ? cuz you do n't  give up when you 're 23 . <p> I know , most help on this on the internet is towards American writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , but a British school . I have better command over the English language than many here , and I hate when they say " We understand , English is your second language , " cuz of my dialogue . <p> I 'm happy to get readers anywhere . According to my web log statistics , India falls at number 16 , between the Philippines and Mexico . So to all my Indian readers , welcome . <p> I share your frustration with the " if you do n't  like it , then leave " attitude of far too many Americans , whose concept of internationality begins and ends at the namesake house of pancakes . <p> There is a difference between " you 're " and " you are " as used in American English . Unlike spoken French , where consonants sort of attach themselves to the nearest convenient word , an American speaker either says " you are " or " you 're . " Its not just spoken laziness . <p> For dialogue purposes , here 's my advice : <p> The contractions were talking about are basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or would ) . If this contraction precedes another verb , use the contraction . " I 've told her not to talk with anyone . " " You 'll see what I mean . " " Hed be a fool to listen . " In the context of the scene , the character might speak both words for emphasis or parallel construction : " Believe me , I am regretting it now . " " You would think that , would n't you ? " <p> By the same logic , American English leans towards the nt verb negation . " I did n't  understand at the time . " " You should n't have come . " There may be instance where you want to emphasize the " not , " such as , " You should not mock the Moccasin Man . " And do n't  stack up contractions . " You would n't have known " is fine . " You wouldntve known " is fussy and awful . <p> Do n't  use cuz . " Because " is a word that 's naturally shrunken down by the reader . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta , " in the sense of " got to " or " have to , " is pretty common in American dialogue but do n't  use it in normal prose . " Youve got ta be kidding me " or " I got ta get to the store by five " are both a little idiomatic , but read well . <p> There are probably a few dozen other words that are fine in some circumstances , dreadful in others : gim me , shoulda , kinda , sorta , etc .

@@42311564 @2311564/ <p> How do you ( roughly ) calculate the ratio of script length to screen time ? Would you use a different calculation for different genres ? <p> Rebecca <p> The very general rule is that a page in the script should equal a minute of screen time , which is one reason the industry has standardized around 12-point Courier for the font . Since most screenplays are around 120 pages , the movie should work out to be 120 minutes , or two hours , assuming every scene in the script makes it into the movie . <p> Of course , a page full of action would likely take longer than a minute , just as a page of rapid-fire dialogue would be a lot faster . That 's why before a movie goes into production , the script is often " timed " to estimate how long the movie will be , so the director and producers can plan accordingly . <p> A " script timer " is a professional reader who estimates how long each scene will play , and thus , the length of the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account the directors vision and style when timing the scenes ; the David Lynch version of a scene would tend to run longer than the Michael Bay version .

@@42311568 @2311568/ <p> Since the early days , I 've been using Find and Replace to take care of small issues in scripts . For example , I change the location in a series of scene headers . Or I 'll search for two spaces and replace them with one , because I 'm now a one-spacer . <p> Today , I came upon a new use for Find and Replace . <p> In Fountain , you can leave notes for yourself by surrounding them in double brackets like this . These notes do n't  show up when you print or export , so its fine to leave them in your script . <p> But sometimes , you want the notes to print . David Wain wrote me this afternoon : <p> I 'd love to be able to send a PDF of my Fountain script that looks like a screenplay , but still has the bracketed notes inline so the reader can see all info in the document . <p> A super-simple way to do this is to get rid of the closing brackets on those notes . That way , theyll print as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , and replace them with nothing . If you do n't  want the opening , just search for those and replace them with nothing or maybe something like " Note : " <p> This technique works in any text editor . But if you 'd like a little more power , there 's now a better way . <p> Highland 1.7 has new find-and-replace talents that can do much more sophisticated matching . <p> Using the pattern above , you can change out double brackets for double asterisks all in one pass . Your notes will print in the script as bold action lines . <p> here 's how to do it . <p> First off , save your document . Better saved than sorry , and you 'll want a version that keeps your notes all note-like . <p> Do a Find ( GF ) . <p> The pattern you 're looking for is ( any random text ) . The brackets are easy . Matching the text between them has traditionally been more difficult . <p> Highland now has a wildcard token called ( Any ) . You can find it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu . <p> In the next menu , choose " Any Characters . " <p> Your find field should now be ( Any ) . <p> Tick the Replace checkbox on the right . In the next field , you tell Highland what you want it to put in place of what you found . <p> Let 's start with two asterisks . Then put another ( Any ) token . You can get it from the same Insert Pattern menu , or just copy-paste it from the line above.1 Finally , put another two asterisks so the whole line gets bold formatting . <p> Click the All button to replace all of the notes in the script . Those bracketed notes are now bolded action lines . <p> The options in the magnifying glass are useful for other things as well . <p> By unchecking Ignore Case , you can match TOM versus Tom . To swap out a characters name , do one pass for TOM , another for Tom . <p> Use Full Word in order to match " ant " but not " antagonize . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . <p> Finally , one of my favorite features in Highland 1.7 is the faceless Find Again . Even when the Find field is closed , GG will repeat your last search . Its a handy way to hop through your script . <p> Almost all of this functionality comes for free with Mac OS . Its one of the reasons its not easy to port Highland directly over to Windows or Linux or a web-based application . <p> Behind the scenes , this is done with regular expressions .

In terms of exposure , its easier to get someone to watch something than to read something . More importantly , the process of making a short film helps screenwriters understand how words on paper translate to the screen . <p> That said , making a quality short film is a huge investment of time and money and stamina , all of which might be better spent writing . Nick Rheinwald-Jones agreed to write up his recent experience making a short , providing useful illustrations of what happens when screenwriters get behind the camera . <p> 1997 was such a hopeful year . The dot-com bubble had only begun to inflate , the TSA did n't even exist yet , and as far as anyone knew , the Star Wars prequels were going to be amazing . Even the famously Eeyore-ish world of screenwriting was much more upbeat back then , buoyed by continued reports of million-dollar spec sales . And I , a happy-go-lucky college sophomore , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train as soon as I graduated . I 'd move to L.A. , work my way up the entertainment industry ladder , and let the magic unfold . <p> ( If you 've ever watched VH1s Behind The Music , you should have a pretty good idea of what 's coming in this next paragraph . Heartbreak . Disappointment . Abject misery . And that 's just The Phantom Menace ; I have n't even gotten to Attack of the Clones yet . ) <p> Dissolve to 2013 . I 'd been calling myself a screenwriter for over fifteen years accurately , I should say ; I 'd certainly been writing all that time but that all-important sale or commission that would allow me to call myself a professional screenwriter ? It still had n't happened . There had been a few inklings of encouragement ( for example , a pilot script of mine was a quarterfinalist at Slamdance ) , but no money , no representation , not even one actual meeting . <p> In other words , it seemed like a good time to re-evaluate things . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . I did n't want screenwriting to be a hobby , because heaven knows there are better hobbies than staring at Final Draft all day . But if I was n't getting paid to do it , if nobody was even reading my scripts , then that 's what it was going to be . <p> As I saw it , then , there were two options : Either come up with a new approach to my career , or change course altogether . The latter was certainly tempting ; I knew I was smart and hard-working , and why not put those attributes to use in a field where I 'd actually be appreciated ? But even after all that time , I was n't quite discouraged enough to give up my Hollywood dreams : I 'm nothing if not stubborn . <h> Step one : write the script <p> Somehow , I thought this would be the easiest part . I mean , I 've been writing screenplays longer than some pop stars have been alive . Problem is , I 'd never thought much about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a feature screenplay , that 's just when things are starting to get going . <p> Beyond that , all my previous material was written with a studio budget in mind . Things would have to change a great deal if I was going to be the one writing the checks . <p> Fortunately , the budgetary constraints actually helped me with finding the story . I decided to write something that could mostly be filmed inside our house , so I 'd have more money to use on other aspects of the production . <p> Genre-wise , I did n't want to do a straight-up comedy , since that 's not what I typically write , and I wanted the short to serve as a good representation for the kinds of scripts in my portfolio . I opted for an action-comedy instead . A spy-action-comedy , to be specific . That was going to be a challenge , but it also focused my thinking . ( For example , I did n't have to spend a lot of time deciding what country I 'd set it in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier or a bullet train . ) <p> Reading John 's short script for God was also helpful , in that it reminded me the needs of a short film are very different from those of a feature . You do n't need a lot of characters , you do n't need subplots , and you do n't have to turn the world upside down by the end of the movie . You do , however , need to be efficient and get to the point quickly . Luckily , I 've always been pretty strong in those areas . <h> Step two : hire a producer <p> Here is yet another situation where luck played a huge part . I asked one friend ( a writer/director ) if he could recommend a producer ; he had one producer to recommend , and she was available . I sent her the script and we met up to discuss it . <p> I figured there was no reason not to be completely frank with her , so I told her I 'd never done anything remotely like this before ( shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest I 'd come ) and that I needed all the help I could get . Although I knew a fair amount about most areas of filmmaking , I was fairly clueless about the actual process of , you know , putting a movie together . Scheduling ? Budgeting ? Renting equipment ? Hiring a crew ? Permits ? SAG ? Big bowl of nothing , as Jeff Garlin would say . <p> But by the end of our conversation I felt like I was in good hands . She had plenty of experience on movies of various sizes , not only as a producer but also as an AD and even a director , so I would n't be throwing her any challenges she had n't faced before . <h> n++Step three : pre-production ; or , is it too late to change my mind ? <p> Our shooting schedule allowed for about two months of prep . I 'll be honest : I spent much of that time freaking the hell out . What was I worried about ? Hold on a second and I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LLC paperwork would n't be filed in time . ( You have to form a corporation if you 're funding a movie , for a whole variety of reasons , and this entails working with California 's legendarily crummy bureaucracy . ) <p> I was worried that we would n't find a decent location for the opening scene . ( The movie only needed one location other than my house , but it had to serve a pretty specific purpose , and it also had to be fairly cheap . ) <p> I was worried that I would n't get a decent cast . ( Low-budget equals open calls , and also I could n't afford to use a real casting agency . ) <p> Oh , and then there was that small matter of actually directing the movie working with real actors , keeping to a ( very brief ) schedule , and surviving it all without an Apocalypse Now-level meltdown . In all my years of work experience I 'd never managed a single person , and now I was going to be managing an entire cast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced than I was . <p> But it was n't all nail biting and night sweats . A lot of it was pretty great : Meeting a real stunt coordinator ; working out the shot list with my DP ; even casting , one of my biggest fears , turned out to be a ton of fun ( and quite successful ) . <p> ( I should also note here how helpful it was to have a good producer at my side for this part of the process . Yes , I was freaking out on a regular basis , but I never actually had to worry about which forms I needed to sign , which checks I needed to write , or how I was going to find a cast and crew . She was taking care of all of that , and I am eternally grateful , because otherwise I probably would have gone insane . ) <h> Step four : let 's shoot this thing <p> This is where I learned that adrenaline is a wonderful thing . Did n't sleep for days before the shoot , definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I was on set I was more upbeat and alert and on the ball than I 've ever been in my life . <p> Luckily , my editor was a **32;297;TOOLONG , handling sound , visual effects , and coloring in addition to the already-punishing workload of cutting the picture . And one of my best friends , who has worked for many years in the music business , hooked me up with a great composer who delivered a great original score in record time . Now its in the hands of the festivals , so my job is pretty much crossing my fingers . <h> What I learned <p> Making a film even a ten-minute one completely changed my perspective on my career and my identity as a creative person . Although I absolutely intend to keep writing , I no longer think of myself as just a writer : I know now that I can do more than that . I 'm excited to look for more opportunities to direct , and maybe I can even make some money at it someday ( since self-financed shorts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> I 'm not holding myself up as some special case , either ; I 'd wager that a great many people who see themselves solely as writers could do an excellent job of directing . It sounds scary , and sometimes it is , but being a screenwriter is fantastic preparation for it . As John often says , when you 've written a script , you 've already seen the movie in your head , and that 's at least half the battle . The other half is being able to explain it to your collaborators , but if you pick talented people and Los Angeles is positively teeming with them it 's not really that hard . <p> I think people write spec scripts for two reasons : ( 1 ) They want to see their scripts made into movies ; and ( 2 ) They want to get paid . And I think that for most people , the priorities go in that order . Getting a paycheck is great , but the dream is seeing your words and scenarios brought to life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big studio to achieve that . The only difference between the biggest studio movie and the smallest self-funded independent movie is money . ( A lot of which is often wasted , as demonstrated in this piece by Gavin Polone . ) Money is the only thing hiding behind those studio gates not ideas , and certainly not talent . Great actors , great crew , and great equipment are available to everyone ( and you 'll pay far less for all three if you 're not part of a giant expensive production ) . <p> You can spend your entire career waiting for permission to see your work brought to the screen , and you can give up if it never happens ( and , like I said , I was very close to giving up ) . Or you can jump the line and do it yourself . Instead of being the person desperately trying to get hired , you can be the person doing the hiring . That 's a pretty nice ego boost . <p> So things are going pretty well these days . I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so my scripts are getting some exposure instead of languishing in the void .

Were nine writers ( or teams ) making the same deal . <p> And what is the deal ? here 's the short version . <p> Were each committing to writing an original ( i.e. not an adaptation ) for Fox our next original script , in fact . For it , well take a greatly reduced upfront fee , in exchange for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the movie get made that 's the gamble the writers are taking . <p> Helping to ameliorate that risk , we are producers on our projects , and ca n't be rewritten except in fairly narrow circumstances . We consult on the major creative decisions ( like director , stars , other producers ) . Lastly , if the project is n't getting a greenlight , we have the ability to take it back in a timely fashion . 1 <p> Note that when I say " we , " I 'm referring the writers individually . There 's no group decision process . No production company . Were each autonomous entities . <p> Its in each writers interest to write a really commercial movie that ( a ) Fox will want to make , and ( b ) will earn a bazillion dollars.2 To me , that 's the secret of the deal . While there are protections for both sides , the key ingredient is mutual benefit . Both sides have a lot to gain from making it work . <p> It sounds relatively simple , but Great Zeus , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest props . If I had 10 phone calls a day about it , Craig had 30.3 It was a super-heroic effort , for which hell be repaid in alcohol . <p> And now for the backstory . The day the John Wells deal was announced , Craig called me and asked what I thought about it . I thought it sounded terrific , and so did many other writers . Craig had already had conversations with Ted Elliott about doing something with a group of screenwriters , but the Wells deal was specific and tangible . It provided a focus , a template . Within a few weeks , a group of writers met at my house on a weekend afternoon to discuss the possibilities.4 <p> After phone calls with all of these writers representatives , Craig and I met with several studios , explaining why we thought the deal was good for them . There was a lot of interest from most of the studios , 5 but Fox stepped up in the biggest and most enthusiastic way . To put it politely , they pursued it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued it with a vigor that sometimes frightened me . But their zeal was genuine , and the deal ended up happening much more quickly than any of us anticipated , through the combined efforts of many attorneys , agents , and executives . Im loathe to start naming names for fear of leaving off someone who worked their ass off on the deal some at the cost of family obligations so Ill just extend a public thank you to all of them on both sides . <p> So . Will it work ? Will it change anything ? <p> I do n't  know . I think its best to classify it as an experiment . Were each committing to one script , so if it simply does n't  work out , no one is particularly worse off . And its hard to say whether the basic idea could ( or should ) be expanded to include the other kinds of movies screenwriters are hired to write : adaptations , sequel , remakes , and everything else that relies on underlying property . Without the ability to take the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a writer to reduce his upfront money . Even among this group , most scripts do n't  become movies . The gamble might not make sense . <p> What I will say is that as an A-list screenwriter , its become increasingly difficult to set up an original project at the studios , who ( understandably ) want to save their development budgets for the movies they 're pretty sure they 're going to make largely sequels , adaptations and remakes . I 'm very excited to write an original for Fox , a movie not based on anything other than what I think would be great idea . So while this deal is largely about rights and money , I think it has the potential to lead to some better , more original movies . If so , that 's a win for everyone . <p> I can now explain that the reason I had to bail on the LONG ... for Student Films Across America was that the deal was closing that Friday . My phone was ringing every two minutes as the negotiations kept spinning . ? <p> There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's at least another dozen who would make just as much sense on a list . A lot of us knew each other , and the few people we did n't  know had great reputations . My hope is that other writers and other studios would see this as something to try , either as a group or individually . ? <p> here 's the pitch : " How would you like nine original scripts by some of the top feature writers for less than what youd pay for one of them normally ? But wait ! There 's more ! " ? 
@@42311574 @2311574/ <p> I 've had my share of troubles related to typing all day . Its hard to say if I ever had classic carpal tunnel syndrome , but a few years ago , my hands started going numb if I typed too much . Worse , I would wake up in the middle of the night with both my arms dead asleep . <p> Since then , Ive gotten a lot smarter about general office ergonomics . I try to remember to take breaks , and keep aware of not slouching over the desk . But being a geek , my hard-wired inclination is to address the problem with gadgets . <p> GEEK FACTOR : FOUR <p> My first life-saver was an ergonomic keyboard . For the last few years , I 've been using the Adesso NuForm keyboard . Like most ergonomic keyboards , it breaks the traditional keyboard in half , placing the right hand and left hand sides at a slight angle , saving wear-and-tear on the wrists . Most ergonomic keyboards are raised in the center , but the NuForm is basically flat , which I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I find it hard to type on a regular straight keyboard . When I 'm traveling for work , I usually bring it along . In London this spring for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , I broke a few keys , but managed to keep it going . Good thing , too : I have n't been able to find a source for the NuForm anymore . <p> GEEK FACTOR : NINE <p> Screenwriter Dana Fox , who happens to be my former assistant , has had more troubles with repetitive stress injuries than I have . She was the one that turned me on to what is quite possibly the Holy Grail of insane keyboards , manufactured by SafeType . <p> Like most ergonomic keyboards , SafeType breaks the keyboard in half . But it then goes berserk , mounting them vertically , with the number pad and arrow keys placed in between . You obviously need to be a touch-typist , since you cant see keys . And since no one really knows where the function keys are , there are two " rear-view " mirrors mounted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards , so in the reflection , you can find F7 or whatever . <p> As you might expect , the first hour or two using this keyboard is terrifying . I got a headache . After two days , though , you stop thinking about it . Your fingers inherently know where to go , and once you get used to feeling for the home row ( the J and F keys have indentations ) , you rarely screw up . In fact , I 'm probably typing just as fast on the new keyboard as I did on the old one . <p> Ergonomically , the big advantage to a vertical keyboard is that you 're not twisting your forearms around to type . By keeping your wrists neutral , there 's a lot less strain . SafeType recommends a Quill Mouse to go with it , but I cant imagine life without my wireless IntelliMouse Explorer , which makes web surfing oh-so-much more pleasant . <p> If its not obvious , I really like the new keyboard . However , I would offer a couple of caveats to anyone thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New , it costs $295 . They also sell factory-refurbished models for $149 . <p> It is n't USB . You need to buy an adaptor cable for USB , or for Macs . <p> On a Mac , the extra buttons ( volume , etc. ) do n't  work . But I really doubt I would use them if they did . <p> Command-Key combinations are more difficult . But that can be addressed <p> One nice side benefit of my new keyboard is that it takes up less desk space . That let 's me keep my mouse a little closer on the right-hand side . With the extra room on the left , I invested in the Nostromo Speedpad n52 controller , which I think may catapult me the extra few parsecs into Geek Factor 9.5 . <p> The n52 is really designed for videogames , letting the player keep his right hand on the mouse while hitting all the keystrokes with his left . I do n't  play Splinter Cell , but on a daily basis I do a lot of Cut , Copy , Paste , Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using the Nostromo Array ( ! ) software that comes with it , I have all these functions mapped to the fifteen keys on the n52 . <p> This has made high-volume text editing extremely productive . Right hand selects ; left hand clicks . Combined with a good clipboard utility , I can stack up a half-dozen chunks of text to paste at will . You can remap the keys for different applications . I still need to go through and set up macros for Final Draft formatting . 
@@42311575 @2311575/ <p> The program had been sitting on my TiVo for a while , because its hard for me to commit to an hour of Alias , much less a three-hour made-for-cable movie . But I knew I 'd eventually watch it , because from the moment I first heard about the Yellowstone supervolcano , it was one of those nagging , back-of-my-mind fears . So much so , that I actually included a lengthy monologue about it for a script I was writing . ( That scene got cut , so feel free to write your own . ) <p> For those who do n't  know , Yellowstone National Park , home of the Old Faithful geyser , is actually the caldera of a massive volcano . And not just a " theoretical " volcano : its erupted at least three times before : 2.1 million years ago , 1.3 million years ago and 640,000 years ago . Which , if you do the quick math , suggests that it erupts every 800,000 to 660,000 years . Which means its due to erupt now . <p> Which is very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be **25;331;TOOLONG apocalyptic . Think Armageddon x The Day After Tomorrow . Twenty feet of jagged volcanic ash strewn across the Midwest , tapering down to a centimeter on the East Coast . Global temperatures will fall . The monsoon will fail . Drought , famine , starvation lasting for years . As Discovery says on the website : <p> A modern full-force Yellowstone eruption could kill millions , directly and indirectly , and would make every volcano in recorded human history look minor by comparison . <p> Suddenly , moving to Australia looks a lot more enticing . Yes , there 's the global famine , but at least you do n't  have ash falling on your head . <p> But here 's the thing : Yellowstone is not actually " due " to erupt . That 's a logical fallacy . And the celebrity spokesperson who proved it to me is Michelle Pfeiffer . <p> Let me provide context . <p> In 1994 , my friend Elizabeth and I went to see The Madness of King George at a movie theatre on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting next to a man and woman who turned out to be Michelle Pfeiffer and her husband David E. Kelly .

We just ate our popcorn , watched the movie , and gossiped after they left . <p> The following Saturday , Elizabeth and I went to a different movie theatre and ended up sitting directly behind the Pfeiffer-Kellys . Now , at this point , one could argue we were stalking them . But it was n't intentional . It was just a coincidence that we all had the same taste in movies . Still , I felt guilty on some level . I considered saying something , but every scenario I played out in my head ended up with Michelle Pfeiffer looking disgusted , and David E. Kelly getting pushy . And he s taller than me . So instead , Elizabeth and I just ate our popcorn , watched the movie , and gossiped after they left . <p> Then a week or two later , Michelle Pfeiffer drove past me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional moment , or bond over a shared reaction to a film , but it happened . Another Michelle Pfeiffer sighting . <p> I had seen her three times in the course of a month . When I 'd tell friends about it , theyd rightly acknowledge it was quite a coincidence . But that 's all it was a coincidence . Had I seriously said to my friends <p> " I 'm due to see Michelle Pfeiffer in the next week to ten days , " <p> they would have slowly backed away . The fallacy is obvious : three sightings is n't a pattern , and the two intervals between those sightings is even less of one . The most precise guesstimate a reasonable person could make is that I would see Michelle Pfeiffer again sometime between Eventually and Never . ( It turned out to be Never . ) <p> Michelle Pfeiffer is the supervolcano . <p> All of this is a very name-dropping way of explaining why I should n't lose any sleep over Yellowstone erupting . You cant say something is " due " just because a similar interval of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the subject is a beautiful actress , but harder to grasp when you 're dealing with cataclysmic events . I think one difference is scale : When you 're dealing with millions of years , your brain gets overloaded . You lose touch with common sense , and start thinking purely by numbers . But the more important factor is stakes . If you never bump into Michelle Pfeiffer again , your life wont be significantly worse . However , if the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts , you die . Or at least suffer horribly . <p> All of this is not to say we should ignore Yellowstone . Scientists might one day tell us that the area is due to erupt based on studies of magma , crust density , earthquake activity and their correlation with historical patterns . But theyd be looking at the real causes , not guessing based on a two-sentence summary of the situation . <p> Which leads to the final mystery : Why did I see Michelle Pfeiffer three times in a month , but never since ?

Better might be : <p> JIM , 23 , jogs along the sidewalk effortlessly , as if floating . <p> Remember : your goal is not to write pretty words ; its to write words that clearly express a pretty scene . Colorfulness should clarify your intent , not confuse the reader . <p> Clumping . Pages need room to breathe . Break up long description into multiple paragraphs . Break up long runs of dialogue with short description . Use sluglines . <p> Write your screenplay in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace as the movie that 's playing in your head . If the words on the page are shoved together , or if paragraphs run on too long , that 's how the reader will read the scene . <h> Formatting <p> Characters names should be written in UPPERCASE the first time we meet them , and only the first time we meet them.2 Most of you got the first-time-we-meet-them part of this correct , but a lot of the samples continued to put characters names in all caps , sometimes inconsistently . <p> Important sounds should also be in UPPERCASE . When sneakers crunch gravel , " CRUNCH " should be in caps , not " sneakers. " 3 Uppercase should be used whenever something deserves special attention , from the reader and/or from a specific department4 : an important sound , detail , or effect , a vital prop , a newly introduced character that will need to be cast , a noteworthy piece of wardrobe , etc . <h> Presenting characters and content <p> When we meet a named character , his or her age should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , or can simply be put in parentheses after the characters name .

Or a single fifty-something who is still going through the motions but is wishing he had someone waiting for him at home ? <p> Vary character names . As much as possible , do n't  use the same first letter for multiple characters . Readers do n't  sound out every word , especially words that repeat often , like character names .

I 'm looking for competently written submissions with a clear intention , where something happens , and there 's something to talk about . <p> So keep em coming . <p> One of Stuarts early observations was The Mystery of the Js ; there seemed to be a disproportionate number of entries from writers whose names begin with J.

Episode-by-episode , this makes sense ; why spend more than you have to ? But in pinching pennies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . And you really notice it in groups in which you did n't  have a lot of actors to choose from in the first place , such as minorities . If you write a role for a woman in her 60s , and race does n't  matter , you can cast anyone , including the Chinese woman . But if you write a role for a bossy Chinese grandmother , you really need that actress in town and available . <p> If you look at any one actor getting economically forced out of the craft , oh well . Sad story , but Hollywoods full of em . But when you apply that loss across a swath of your talent pool , suddenly its impossible to find that African man in his 80s you need for your episode . So you 're stuck rewriting it for a white guy , or a younger guy . The product suffers , and TV gets a little more white and boring . <p> I bring up this anecdote because its the kind of issue you really wish the industry was addressing in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , we get a three-way shoving match . <p> I 'm not claiming this situation is causing a lack of diversity in television , but it makes it harder to combat . As writers , we can create rich , multi-ethnic worlds . But if we cant find actors for those roles , its all for naught . <p> Obviously , the same economic pressures apply to plain old white actors as well . But there are more of them to begin with , so you do n't  notice their absence as quickly or as acutely . <p> You do n't  notice the problem as much in features because there 's so much more time to do casting , and ( generally ) more money . <p> I do n't  have a solution to the situation , but its almost certainly not DVD residuals . Bumping up scale minimums will help , but only to a degree . <p> We cant conflate raw numbers with talent . When a showrunner and her casting directors are pulling out their hair because they cant find a Pacific Islander for a part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may simply be none with the chops to pull it off . Doubt me if you want , but 95% of Americans could not convincingly say four lines of dialogue on Law &amp; Order . Its tougher than it looks . <p> One anecdote : We shot my first show mostly at stages in Toronto . We quickly learned to check any dialogue to be spoken by a Canadian day player to avoid the ooo problem , and beyond that , we found most of our day players to be terrific . Except for one . She had two lines of dialogue with Mark-Paul Gosselaar , and no force on heaven or Earth could get her to say them properly . It turned out she was drunk . Because she was nervous . Because she had a crush on Mark-Paul Gosselaar . The truth was charming , but she was recast on the spot . ? <p> Obviously , you could substitute " screenwriter " for actor in this thought experiment . But its not a perfect analogy . For instance , an actor cant work on spec. ?

@@42311584 @2311584/ <p> John : And this is episode 160 of Scriptnotes , a podcast about screenwriting and things that are interesting to screenwriters . <p> Craig , you and I are both writing scripts . Were both in our first drafts . I just crossed page 60 . Where are you at ? <p> Craig : Oh , well , see , you 're lapping me because this is really where the difference in our processes is driven home . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Because you like to go kind of get a fast draft out and then you go back , whereas I am painstakingly whistling this thing . So I am currently on page 41 , I believe but feeling <p> John : Okay . <p> Craig : Feeling very good about it , feeling very good . <p> John : Yeah , its important to have a good 40 pages . <p> Craig : Yes , yes , I 'm <p> John : Thats nice . <p> Craig : Happy with the 40 . <p> John : Today on the podcast , we are going to be talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my favorite topics of all things to discuss . But before we get to that , we have some housekeeping to take care of . <p> First off , Craig and I were both on the nominating committee for the WGA board and we were the people who interviewed people who wanted to be on the WGA board and sort of asked them why they wanted to be on the board . And it was four nights of fun and hilarity . <p> Craig : laughs Yes , yes , high <p> John : At the WGA headquarters . <p> Craig : High stakes fun and hilarity . <p> John : So on previous podcasts , you and I have endorsed candidates . We said like , well , these are some people who are running and these are people who we think are fantastic and you should vote for . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : But this year we can not do that . <p> Craig : No . <p> John : Specifically because we are on a committee , we are not supposed to endorse anybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should absolutely vote for the candidates of your choice . If you are a WGA member , you have received a packet in the mail that has all the candidate statements along with statements from people who are endorsing those candidates . You will not see me or Craigs name on any of those endorsements , but we definitely think you should vote for people because its an important election . Its always kind of an important election . There 's always stuff to get done . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : You should read those candidate statements and really think about who you want to be representing you . And you actually have an opportunity , if you 're listening to this podcast on Tuesday , tomorrow , Wednesday , there is a Candidates Night at the WGA , so you can go and listen to them speak and ask them questions . <p> Craig : Yes . You can listen to them and point your finger at them and boo and cheer . Its like a zoo . Its great . <p> John : Yeah . You know , weirdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't  know that 's a good idea but <p> Craig : Rotten vegetables , yeah . Why did people throw rotten vegetables ? First of all , the forethought like , okay , were going to go out to the theater tonight in 1920 and we paid , you know , paid money for this but were expecting that at least one or two of the acts will be so bad well want to hit them with stuff . So who 's going to bring , but were poor and vegetables are kind of hard to come by in the Lower East Side , so whose got just rotting cabbage ? <p> John : Well , I think rotting cabbage is n't that hard to find . If there is cabbage that does n't  get consumed or cabbage that you could pull out of the ground and the maggots have already gotten to it 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : Thats the kind of thing you bring to the theater . <p> Craig : Do maggots eat cabbage though ? <p> John : No , they really do n't  . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like there 's probably a cabbage worm . <p> Craig : Oh , like a fungus rot ? <p> John : Yeah , that too , yeah . <p> Craig : So you just gather it up and then you 're like , " Oh yeah , where are you going ? I 'm going to the theater that 's why I have this bag of just stinking refuse . " <p> John : Yeah , because , you know , Im broke and poor but I 'm going to pay for a ticket to see <p> Craig : Well , I still love the arts , yeah . laughs <p> John : I still love the arts . <p> Craig : But I <p> John : I mean , you have to support the arts . <p> Craig : But I also hate the arts so much that if somebody just does n't  make me happy , I 'm going to laughs hit them with stuff . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : It never really happened . I think that was just made up in the movies , right ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John : I 'm sure people threw garbage at , like , candidates they did n't  like or like political figures they did n't  like . <p> Craig : So great . <p> John : But I do n't  know . I mean , The Gong Show was an extrapolation of that idea but 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : The Gong Show was just a unique cultural moment that never needs to be repeated . <p> Craig : Oh , I do n't  know . I mean were trying , right , because Americas Got Talent , they have their little " Eh " and there 's an X or something like that which is really just a gong .. <p> John : Yeah , that 's true . <p> Craig : But The Gong Show was great because there was an enormous amount of power in any particular judge . Anyone hitting the gong , that 's it , right , you 're done . <p> John : Mm-hmm . Yeah . <p> Craig : So if Jaye P. Morgans not into you , its over . <p> John : Yeah . Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . I mean Kitty Carlisle could just postulate about sort of what someones profession was . I 'm guessing its Kitty Carlisle . I 'm sort of making that name up but , to tell the truth . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And that was kind of a fascinating show because like who are these people , the people on Password , like we do n't  have kind of that level of celebrity anymore . <p> Craig : No , I know . There was all this wonderful sort of , where a celebrity became a professional game show person . <p> John : Yeah , Paul Lynde . <p> Craig : Paul Lynde or Charles Nelson Reilly , I mean they were just kind of Or who 's the woman on Match Game who really was just famous for being on Match Game . I do n't  even know what she was famous for . <p> John : Is she the one that Kristen Wiig is sort of impersonating or like <p> Craig : No , no , shes , you know , I wish that TS Fall were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know something . <p> Craig : TS would know . Yeah , you know , the old game shows were great . I do n't  know , these new things , they 're . I do n't  know . I really , oh , you know , its funny , The Gong Show , Rex Reed was on The Gong Show a lot . That was before he became an enormous asshole . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : Yeah . An enormous drunken asshole . <p> John : Yeah , it was certainly good training . <p> Craig : In my opinion , in my opinion . laughs <p> John : laughs <p> Craig : I do n't  really know if he is . That 's just my feeling . <p> John : Yes . Its also possible that everything was just better back then because it was our youth and everything seemed better 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : If we actually were to look and compare it on The Game Show Network , we 'd say , oh you know what , it was actually kind of terrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth was Scriptnotes t-shirts . And so we used to make Scriptnotes t-shirts and we sold them to people who liked them and it was nice . And so our first batch of Scriptnotes t-shirts were the Umbrage Orange and Rational Blue . <p> And we sold a whole bunch of them and people really liked them . And we also did a batch of black . But that was about eight months ago . And so my open question to you , Craig , but really to the audience is , should we make more t-shirts ? And so if you would like to have more t-shirts , on johnaugust.com , the same place where you may be listening to this podcast , there 's just going to be a poll saying like , hey , should we make more t-shirts . And if we should make t-shirts , what color should they be because were happy to do them if people actually want them . <p> But we wont do them if people do n't  want them . So that is a question I am positing to the readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like but we are considering making t-shirts in time for , possibly Austin , but more likely for the holiday season . So if you would like a t-shirt , that is something you can weigh in on . <p> Craig : Is Jaye P. Morgan still alive , do you think ? <p> John : I think of JP Morgan being the banker . Is that a different person were talking about ? <p> Craig : Well , its Jaye , J-A-Y-E P. Morgan . <p> John : Oh . <p> Craig : So she was a <p> John : Its a she ? <p> Craig : Oh yeah , Jaye P. Morgan . Oh my god . <p> John : Well , I 'm Googling this right now because this is <p> Craig : Jaye P. Morgan . <p> John : Fascinating information . <p> Craig : Yeah . No , see , Jaye P. Morgan is still alive . Shes 82 years old . She lives apparently , oh no , she was born in your home state of Colorado . <p> John : Yes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainer . You know , back in the day , you could be an entertainer . That was your job . <p> John : Well , looking at the Google Images , she 's having a conversation with Kermit the Frog which seems like exactly the kind of thing an entertainer would do . <p> Craig : Absolutely . So Jaye P. Morgan is still alive . If you guys out there say , yeah , we should go ahead and make some t-shirts , were sending a free t-shirt to Jaye P. Morgan . <p> John : Well , that was never even a question . <p> Craig : She made me so happy . <p> John : Aw . <p> Craig : She did . <p> John : Yeah , anybody who makes Craig happy rather than angry 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Deserves a t-shirt . <p> Craig : Deserves a t-shirt . <p> John : A place where people could wear their t-shirts if they wanted to is the Slate Culture Gabfest . We can actually announce what this thing is now . So on October 8th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be joining our friends Julia Turner , Stephen Metcalf and Dana Stevens from Slate for the Slate Culture Gabfest . <p> And so its a fantastic podcast . It should be a fantastic night . Tickets are on sale now . So its actually their event . We are just going to be guests , which I 'm so excited not to have to host something . <p> Craig : Yeah , we just show up and were brilliant , huh ? Is that the idea ? <p> John : Yeah , that 's the goal . So weve back and forthed about what our topics are going to be . I think its going to be fun . A chance to talk about what its like to be creators of content versus critics of content and consumers of content . So I 'm excited to have this chance to be on stage with them . <p> Craig : Yeah . For those of you who might be thinking , ah , I 'm on the fence , should I go or not , let me just underline for you : I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> John : Thats true . Fireworks are promised . And the whole thing is sponsored by Acura , which is just kind of great and odd but wonderful . <p> Craig : Acura . Oh , that 's right <p> John : Yeah , we never have sponsors on our show , laughs so it sort of feels it feels fun to sort of say like , brought to you by Acura . <p> Craig : laughs Were such namby pambies . <p> John : laughs <p> Craig : That the only time were ever sponsored by anybody , its a charity . We never make any money for any , like were so Its funny because its not like you and I are particularly anti-corporate or anything like that . <p> John : No . <p> Craig : Weve just kept this whole thing very , very pure . And its so odd , yeah , that Slate , liberal Slate , will be sponsored by Acura this evening . The Japanese Daibutsu . <p> John : Julia actually emailed like she 's like , " I know you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a problem ? " Like , eh , like its no problem . <p> Craig : Its your show , so . <p> John : Its your show . Were happy to be there . <p> Craig : Oh , I said Japanese Daibutsu , I did n't  mean that . A Daibutsu apparently is a giant Buddha , laughs so I mean the other thing , like what 's the word for the Japanese business , word for corporation ? <p> John : I have no idea . <p> Craig : I 'm looking it up right now . <p> John : Okay . <p> Craig : Its like Zen its zaibatsu . <p> John : Ah . <p> Craig : Okay , that 's a totally , totally reasonable mistake . So I said Daibutsu and I meant zaibatsu . <p> John : Yes , but in Tokyo , that could get you shunned or killed . <p> Craig : I mean , no ones going to kill I think the whole point of Buddhism <p> John : I guess , no , if you call the corporation a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> John : Yeah , but the thing is that they 're not Buddhas . They 're zaibatsus , not Daibutsus , so . <p> Craig : Well , the zaibatsu people may also worship a Daibutsu . This is the best episode we 've ever done . And I have to assure people , neither one of us is high right now . <p> John : No , god , no . <p> Craig : No . <p> John : Were recording this at 1:24 in the afternoon . <p> Craig : On a Friday . <p> John : Yes . So let 's go to our main topic because this is a thing that I 've definitely noticed for a long time and you and I have gone through this topic before . And I would posit that there 's actually a thing I would call , a variable I 'd call the Armageddon delay which is how long it takes a group of screenwriters gathered together to not talk about the end of the world . <p> Craig : Yup . I have witnessed <p> John : Its this thing that just inevitably comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : And so we 've had long online conversations about , specifically the longest one I remember is what do you do in the event of a zombie apocalypse . And I blogged about this . Basically , what is your plan when the zombies attack . And you are way out there in La Ca+ada , so you have a completely different game plan than I do here in the center of Los Angeles . <p> Craig : Yeah , for sure . So last week or a couple of weeks ago , I joined a writer named Will Staples . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : He wrote a few of the Call of Duty games . And <p> John : Yeah . And he has the best name ever . <p> Craig : Will Staples . <p> John : Yeah . He s heir to the Staples fortune , right ? <p> Craig : I do n't  think so . <p> John : No ? <p> Craig : I do n't  think so , yeah , or the Staples Center which is also the Staples fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I just think its bizarre that there 's an office supply place called Staples that 's named for staples . <p> Craig : Well , its also just seems like a dumb name because I mean the whole point is like Amazon , look , were as big as the Amazon . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Staples . Its pretty much what you would think . We got Staples . <p> John : Another Los Angeles chain , a food place , a food service place is called Smart &amp; Final . And its like , that 's weird . Its like it just feels sort of like two adjectives . No , it was named after a man named Smart and a man named Final . <p> Craig : Are you kidding me ? <p> John : No , its real . There 's a Smart and a Final . And they were grocery stores and they became this sort of warehousey thing over time . <p> Craig : And , you know , Ralphs is not Ralphs . <p> John : No . <p> Craig : The mans name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smart &amp; Final thing , the Outerbridge Crossing , which is a bridge connecting Staten Island to New Jersey , its named after a man named Outerbridge . <p> John : Yeah . It just happens to be a bridge 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Thats named after Outerbridge . <p> Craig : How about that ? Anywho <p> John : Wouldnt the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis say that , you know , that the word itself sort of creates the reality ? You know , essentially having your name be Outerbridge means that you were destined to <p> Craig : Design bridges ? <p> John : Design bridges perhaps ? <p> Craig : Perhaps . I mean it certainly does n't  explain you or I , although our names are nonsense . <p> John : My names made up . My names made up , so . <p> Craig : Well , your names made up but your real name and my name are very similar actually . <p> John : Yeah , yeah . <p> Craig : And they 're just nonsense . They mean nothing . <p> John : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of bird in German . <p> Craig : Yeah , but that 's German . We <p> John : Yeah , we live in America . <p> Craig : Were in America , man . We won the war , bro . Anyway <p> John : Back to Will Staples . <p> Craig : So Will Staples puts together this group of writers . I was there , Alec Berg of Silicon Valley <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : And Nicole Perlman . <p> John : Oh yeah , Guardians of the Galaxy . <p> Craig : Guardians of the Galaxy and well be having her on the show soon . And we all went out to the Angeles gun range <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : Which is out in like by the Hansen Dam . You do n't  know where that is. 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : But anyway , we were joined by some military folks . I can not say of what type . And they 're active duty military folks . And we just <p> John : They were not Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military folks <p> John : Okay . <p> Craig : Of a certain stripe . And we were instructed on shooting all sorts of gun , sniper rifles and .50 caliber Barretts and Israeli machine guns . It was amazing . It was just an incredible day . But it struck home how my strategy , my surmised strategy , is absolutely the correct strategy for where I live . Get up into the Angeles Crest Forest , its just full of gun nuts . laughs Get around some gun nuts , hunker down , its mountainous territory . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : You can see a lot . So , you know , in warfare , you want the high ground . So we get up high , load up on guns and ammo , look down and theoretically I think we should be okay . <p> John : Yeah . That 's a very reasonable you know , you 're picking a defensive location . You are , you know , barricading but you 're barricading smartly . In the middle of the city , its tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly for an earthquake were well set up for , like we have our supplies and we can get out and 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And lord knows we have solar panels , we can sort of do a lot of stuff here at our house for a good long time . But its not ideal for a zombie apocalypse because I live like in the heart of the city , so . <p> Craig : Thats right , John . <p> John : I think were going to have to just bail and just get out of the city . <p> Craig : And my feeling is always that if you live like where you live , your primary strategy should be an efficient painless suicide . <p> John : laughs <p> Craig : Because you 're not going anywhere . I mean , you 're just not . <p> John : Yeah , our emergency kit definitely has the cyanide in it . So I want to talk about sort of why I 'll just give a quick rundown of sort of what were talking about when were talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant theme in all of our recent literature really , movie literature , TV literature , written literature . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : So 28 Days Later which is very much the scenario were describing , World War Z , The Road , Revolution which is just like all the power goes away , The Walking Dead , End of the World , Shaun of the Dead , Day of the Dead , Terminator which is basically the rise of evil robots . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : Planet of the Apes which in this most recent version , is essentially <p> Craig : Dead dirty apes . <p> John : An outbreak that kills everybody . <p> Craig : Apes . <p> John : Did you see the most recent Planet of the Apes ? <p> Craig : What do you think , John ? <p> John : You see nothing . You just see nothing . The Hunger Games in terms of , you know , in the movies , its not especially clear what has happened to the world that 's put in this place . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened but like there was I think an environmental catastrophe that sort of led to the world falling apart in that specific way . Outbreak , again , is an outbreak of a disease . The Day After Tomorrow , climate change again . Terra Nova by our friend Kelly Marcel 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : Which is basically not Well , the world is ending but therefore were going back to a primitive time . <p> Craig : With the dinosaur she did not want . <p> John : Yes , yes , lots of quality dinosaurs . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : Mad Max , you cant get sort of more end of the world than Mad Max . <p> Craig : Yes , very , very end of the world . <p> John : And then there 's the things that are sort of in between . So like The Leftovers , which I 'm enjoying the series , its not the end of the world but its just the world is bent in a way that is so irrevocable that it feels like everything has changed . 10555 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also even look at like the space epics like Battlestar Galactica which is about the end of the world and the migration to a new place . So we do this a lot and I sort of want to talk about why we do it so much . <p> Craig : Well , there 's something I think inherent to the human condition . We are fascinated by our own mortality for obvious reasons . We also contain a certain amount of inherent self-loathing . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : And I think that 's part of the human drive to improve the world around it and to improve itself , right ? Humanity is constantly trying to make humanity better , trying to make the world better . We occasionally screw up as we do it but we have that instinct . And that instinct I think is driven in part by the opposition of our self-loathing . I hate the way humans are now . Let 's fix things . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : So we will dwell sometimes on the parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which humanity has destroyed the world . Very frequently in the movies you 've cited , humans have caused this . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Even when the machines rise up to beat us , its because humans made Skynet and got lazy . And you can see this over and over that really its our fault . We did it . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : And then , of course , when it comes to the idea of zombies , we are externalizing time . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : And particularly when the traditional zombies are slow-moving zombies , they 're just time . They 're just sands in the hourglass . We are all of us running from this very slow zombie called death and it starts shambling after us once we are born and it eventually catches up to us and bites us . <p> John : I think you 're hitting on some of the key themes that are going to be , you know , endemic to any discussion of the end of the world which is mortality , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die but we want to apply it to everyone at once . And so its mortality , but its also scale in the way that movies and TV shows and books , they take generally , they take ordinary experiences and then they heighten them . They push them beyond sort of normal expectations . And so an individual person dies , well , that 's sad and tragic but what happens when everybody dies . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : Well , at a certain point , it stops becoming just , you know , exponentially more tragic and just becomes , wow , its completely new framework for how you have to think about sort of what 's there and what 's next . <p> I think you also hit on that sense of its self-loathing but we also have this inner question about like , well , what would I do if I did n't  have all these things . <p> Craig : Mm-hmm . <p> John : In sort of a stoicism that kicks in where I do n't  need all these trappings around me . If I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could be great . I could be a king in an earlier time . <p> Craig : Mm-hmm . <p> John : And that I think is a fascination as well . Its that question of , what would it be like if I were in a time back before we had all these things . <p> Craig : Absolutely . <p> John : Even back to Twains like , you know , a Connecticut Yankee at King Arthurs Court , that sense of like what it would be like to be transported back to a place that was simpler . <p> Craig : And this is particularly seductive for writers . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Writers typically do n't  grow up as the head of the cheerleading squad or the quarterback . When writers sit down to imagine starting with a blank slate , they very often drift into a classic conflict between might makes right , and rationality and what we would call enlightened wisdom . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : And of course , the screenwriter , the novelist , they laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to I 'm going to hit you over the head and drag you away . If you want to look at the cleanest , simplest version of that , screenwriters are Piggy in Lord of the Flies and the people that used to beat up screenwriters are Jack laughs from Lord of the Flies . <p> John : Yeah . Even if you take a look at Lost , which is not the end of the world but it functions the same way where people are stripped away of all of their normal things , its a chance to take a look at those archetypes in very clean circumstances because in normal daily life , none of us are like a hero or a villain and were all like in line together at Starbucks . But when you take away all the trappings of society , you 're able to look at those stereotypes as archetypes and those drives much more cleanly because there 's not everything else surrounding them . So , you know , by stripping away everything else , you can sort of see what is there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a truism that so much of what we do during the day is an expression of how we survive . Our survival instinct . Almost never in a day are we making a decision that actually impacts our very survival , but the survival instinct is always there . Is your survival instinct to create a consensus and an alliance based on mutual respect ? Is your survival instinct to lash out and defeat ? laughs Is your survival instinct to lie and cheat ? Is your survival instinct to be noble and heroic ? That will come out so much more clearly when in fact every choice you make impacts your actual survival . <p> John : I think the key point is that in daily life , your decisions kind of do n't  matter that much . Really they do n't  . Like , you know , are you going to invest in this or in this ? Are we going to have takeout or are we going to cook food at home ? It just does n't  matter , whereas in the scenarios that were describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . <p> And so you look at , you know , Rick , Lee and the group in The Walking Dead , you know , literally the decision to do we go into town to try to get some more food or do we wait until , you know , some later point , all the decisions are life or death all the time . And in our daily life , we do n't  really experience that . And I think there 's an attraction to feeling that danger . That 's the reason why we go to movies and to watch TV shows is that sense to escape our daily life and to imagine ourselves if those decisions we made were actually important , mattered . <p> Craig : Which , by the way , that 's why I 'm not a huge fan of the zombie genre , the survive the apocalypse genre . When the genre creates a situation in which every decision is a matter of life and death , I get fatigued by it . <p> John : I do too . <p> Craig : You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like even a Mad Max , I mean he s driving around , he s pretty happy and then he runs into some trouble , you know . <p> I like situations where there 's some sort of stasis . I mean , a typical zombie movie just gives us the world , everything is fine , you fools you do n't  know what 's coming , you fools . Its very anti-human . Zombie movies hate humans by the way . That 's the point of zombie movies is that humans are stupid . But oh , these two or three are noble and so they will continue the humanity forth . Its very confused . But everythings fine and then everything goes to hell and then a few people make it out . But its all fatiguing to me . And I recognize other people love it but <p> John : Well , I think part of the fatigue is the futility of it all is that in most zombie stories there is no perceived end to it , like its going to suck forever . <p> Craig : Right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you were joking about sort of like the suicide pills , but like in many ways , like that probably would be the most reasonable course of action because there 's no destination to get to that is actually going to be safe . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And that becomes an exhausting aspect of two characters who are living in it but also the people who are , by proxy , living in it through watching your story . <p> Craig : I mean the world now , the best you can do is find some terrible , uninhabited island that zombies cant get to where you 'll just sit there for a while . And then , by the way , you 'll die anyway one day . So its such a direct metaphor for mortality that its just kind of vaguely depressing . And Ive already accepted that I 'm going to die one day anyway , so , you know , meh . <p> John : Meh . <p> Craig : Meh . <p> John : So another kind of end of the world scenario tends to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world , so either an asteroid has smashed into us , there has been an extinction level event that killed everybody but like they 're not walking around as the dead . And that I find more interesting in some ways because you 're adapting to a new reality but that new reality is not trying to kill you at every moment . <p> Craig : Thats right . I 'm totally with you . I 'm fascinated by peoples responses to things . Its interesting to watch characters respond in various ways to a disruption of stasis that can be overcome . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : One of my favorite books from childhood was did you go through your Heinlein phase ? <p> John : I did n't  really read the Heinleins . I read like short bits of things but I did n't  go through a big binge . <p> Craig : Well , so you did n't  soak in adolescent space fascism the way that I did . But he wrote this great book called Tunnel in the Sky . I loved this book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So producers listening to this , somebody go and get this book . Get the rights to this thing and make a series out of it . It would be an awesome series . <p> So the idea is that in the future , people have to go leave earth and colonize other places because earth is really crowded and that 's the way it goes . And there are special groups of people that go to new planets and kind of are the frontiers people to see like , okay , can we actually live here and if we can , then other people can show up . And so our young hero , he s a senior basically in high school . All these kids are like really hardened teenagers and theyve taken this super awesome survival class , right ? <p> And what 's the final exam ? They open a tunnel in the sky , a space portal , and they send you somewhere to a planet that no one has been to before or maybe theyve scouted briefly and you have to survive . <p> John : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you pass . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : If you die on the planet , you fail . And so they go there and of course something goes wrong . The tunnel does n't  open back up in time and they 're marooned there and they must truly survive there . And what was so fascinating to me about the book was that they had to form some kind of society . And , you know , Heinlein was so like , you know , he was such a nut about that stuff . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : So it was really interesting to watch these people like create a constitution and it was very cool . Anyway , I like that sort of thing . <p> John : Well , I think , part of the reason why I like that type of fiction is that the villain is not this faceless thing that 's always going to be there . The villain or the antagonist is going to be someone else who 's in that same situation who wants different things , which is true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wants , it has cross purposes to you . And it could be the other group leader who is trying to get your stuff . <p> And you see that on The Walking Dead . We see like , you know , the real villains become like the mayor of that town or the sheriff or whatever his name was who is much more dangerous honestly than most of the zombies in the world . And yet , ultimately , you feel the fatigue of like , but there 's always going to be more zombies out there . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : And so in the scenarios in which like everyone has died and you 're starting to create a new society , Stephen Kings The Stand is an example of that . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : Youre trying to create a new society and so you do n't  have to worry about the dead people . You only have to worry about sort of what happens next . And so as I read The Stand , or reading the sort of unabridged The Stand , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out how to build society from scratch , which is a good segue to this book I 'm reading right now , which I 'm loving , which is The Knowledge : How to Rebuild our World from Scratch . Its by Lewis Dartnell . And its talking about exactly that topic which is if everything did go away , how would you start everything over again ? <p> Craig : Well , youd use Sugru . <p> John : The Sugru would be , obviously , the first thing you would go to because you need to have good grippy handles on all the tools , the hoes that you 're now using for agriculture . <p> Craig : Youve got to have hoes in a new world . <p> John : Youve got to have hoes in probably two two dimensions of hoes . <p> Craig : When things go bad , the first thing I go looking for , hoes . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : And the guy with the most hoes obviously is the most powerful . <p> John : Because his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soil will be so well tilled . <p> John : laughs Yes . He will have fertility . <p> Craig : Yeah . laughs Oh god , this is the worst . <p> John : Terrible . <p> Craig : This is either the best or the worst that I can remember . <p> John : Terrible metaphors stacked upon each other . So Craig 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : I think , before reading this book , Ive given it a lot of thought , and I always had this sort of vision in my head where I did get like transported back to year 0 . <p> I 'd be like , wow , you know , I would know so much and I would be able to therefore rocket , you know , science ahead , like people would benefit so much from everything I could tell them . <p> Craig : What year have you gone back to ? <p> John : Let 's say I 'd go back to year 0 or year 1 . <p> Craig : Oh , they would stone you to death almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to death . But let 's say I 'd go back to some place that likes me and <p> Craig : No , you want to be somewhere in the , I would say , the 1600s , 1500s would be nice . Anything before that , if you start talking about atoms <p> John : No , I do n't  think even talking about atoms . I think you can talk about some sort of fundamental things . First off , you and I know , we know that there 's a new world . We know that there 's a 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : We do know some fundamental things that could be very , very useful to people . But what 's challenging is we do n't  know some fundamental things , like you and I do n't  know fundamental things that are super crucial like , how to make steel ? 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : How to sort of make furnaces . I kind of know how to make electricity . But I do n't  know how to make the wire and the magnets that were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what you 're describing is the difference between creators and consumers . Were consumers of technology . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Were not creators of technology . So its literally of no use . It would be like if you went back in time and you were a very well-read person , you 're not going to be able to cheat Mark Twain by writing Huck Finn instead of him . You wont be able to do it , you know . We will be , look , if I go back in time , I do n't  care where I 'm going . I 'm just going to keep my head down , laughs , try not to get burned at the stake , you know , I 'm Jewish which is already an issue . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : You know , I 'm just going to like keep my head down . Certainly , if I were going , like if you sent me back to a time when I thought I could do some good , I would try to do good . I would . <p> John : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you head for the hills . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : To the past , you keep your head down low . <p> Craig : Keep head down low . Keep your head down . Remember , those people are not like us at all . Speak of the dumbest mob on the planet currently . Go to whatever country you feel has the dumbest , most ignorant people . Find them at their worst . That 's everybody back in the day . That is the entire world in the year 500 . <p> John : The other challenge , I think , and I have n't gotten so far in the book to know whether he actually addresses this , is clearly you need a critical mass of people in order to do any of the kinds of bigger projects that he s talking about . So you cant build a dam with just , you know , five people . You cant make steel with five people . <p> But so much of what we 've done historically has been on the backs of slaves . And so could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forward in time like let 's say everything falls apart . Could you rebuild civilization without slavery ? And I would hope so . <p> Craig : Yeah , I think so . <p> John : But certainly it would be challenging . <p> Craig : I think so . But how awkward for us if the answer is , no , you cant . Like , oh man . <p> John : Yeah , that slavery is just like a key , crucial component at certain point . <p> Craig : You know , were really progressive people , but ooh . <p> John : Ooh , but , laughs Im going to have to make you my slave . Sorry . <p> Craig : I 've got to own humans now . Oh well , sigh . <p> John : Sigh . <p> Craig : Yeah . Yeah , you know , I think we could do it without slaves . I feel pretty good about that . <p> John : Yeah , so a zombie situation or any situation in the future without medicine . So what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge but without the actual medicines and what do you do without the technology to be able to look inside a person ? And so this book goes through like how to create x-ray machines , but that 's <p> Craig : Oh no . <p> John : No . Challenging . <p> Craig : No , no . Yeah . The way to kind of handcraft an x-ray machine probably involves the cancerous death of the crafter . I do n't  know . laughs I mean if the zombies come and I 'm up in the hills , you 're going to want some basics , you know . There are medical basics which should keep you alive for awhile . But there 's simply no way to avoid the fact that even if no zombie ever breaches your perimeter <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : Life expectancy is going to plummet . <p> John : It is because mortality is not just , you know , that zombie biting you . Mortality is all the things that could kill you , but would n't kill in normal society because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeries . So that impacted tooth could kill you . <p> Craig : Childbirth . <p> John : Childbirth , incredibly dangerous . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Yeah , I would n't recommend it . <p> Craig : No , there 's laughs . <p> John : laughs <p> Craig : I 've personally , I 've watched it and I caused it to happen . But I <p> John : Yes , and Ive cut cords . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : But I would n't want to do it in a non-medical setting . <p> Craig : No . No , I 'm just befuddled . Again , I really do believe this . The same instinct that makes people want to write stories about how humans have destroyed the world , its the same thing that leads them to say , I think a home birth is better for my baby than a hospital birth . I do n't  think the baby cares . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Theres like a weird thing where people want to turn away from the modern because they suspect it . They feel that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there 's nothing unnatural about humans doing stuff . We 'd been doing it forever . <p> John : So I think that keys in to sort of my final point here , which is that , all these dystopian scenarios that were laying out , I think underlying most of them is this utopian ideal that 's there . And what you describe in terms of like , oh , it would be so much better without modern medicine or if , you know , well be able to have natural things , the people would just chew willow bark instead of taking drugs . <p> Craig : laughs <p> John : Theres a utopian idea there . And I kind of applaud that utopian idea . But at the same , we need to recognize that that 's , you know , that 's not realistic . And you cant get some of those few utopian ideals without all the stuff that feeds into making those possible . You cant have perfect representational democracy and still get those power lines lit . Ideals are wonderful things , but the reality on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig : I completely agree . I think that one of the interesting things we see from culture and from stories about the end of the world and the recreation of a new world is that we tend to give more credence to dystopian visions . Because we feel like a self-critique is more valid , whereas utopian ideals seem sugary and silly and corny . But the truth is they 're both dumb . There will never be a perfect world nor is there going to be some horrendous awful world . <p> The world we have will continue to get better . I think things are better now than theyve ever been before , as bad as they are . And I think things will get better . But there 's no utopia . <p> John : No . And there are dystopias in the modern world . But luckily , they 're pockets of dystopia that hopefully can be eradicated and they will show up somewhere else . So like , Somalia seems like a dystopia at times . <p> Craig : Liberia . <p> John : Liberia , yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go Liberia and Syria . <p> John : You look at some of the things that are happening in Iraq right now , there is huge pockets of terribleness , but that 's not the general state . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : But let 's talk about it from a writers point of view in terms of you are creating a story that is taking place in one of these worlds . And what of the crucial things because the world building you 're doing here is very important and there are useful short-hands and then there are some really dangerous short-hands . And , you know , we talked about expectation . And so if you 're doing a zombie story , you get a lot of zombie stuff for free . We sort of know basically how zombies work . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And you have to be clear about the things you 're changing . So its no longer a spoiler , but in The Walking Dead series you do n't  have to be bit , you know this right , you do n't  have to bit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just will become a zombie when you die . And so that 's an important rule change they had to make . But kind of everything else with zombies they got for free . <p> Craig : Yeah , yeah . <p> John : Or 28 Days Later , like they are fast zombies . They have to make that clear . But that 's an easy thing to make clear . <p> John : Basic monster rules . But yeah , I think you have to extend beyond those , then take a look at like what is the overall world in which your story is taking place . And that could eat a lot of pages as you 're trying to describe it . And so you have to be very , very smart about what you 're doing and how you 're doing it . <p> Craig : Mm-hmm . <p> John : The initial images you 're showing will lead us to believe whether this is a Mad Max world or a Hunger Games world . And those are n't  the same thing . <p> Craig : Yeah . Or a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , Snowpiercer , the entire world is a train . <p> John : Absolutely . <p> Craig : Yeah , you know , there are movies , I mean Blade Runner obviously was a huge influence on anybody that was trying to write some sort of dystopian future . I thought that Rian Johnson did a great job in Looper of just casually setting up a world that was n't , I do n't  think of it as dystopian . <p> John : Its not dystopian , no . <p> Craig : Its just its kind of just the world . Its just <p> John : Yeah , its messed up in a way that would be realistic for the world to get messed up in . <p> Craig : Thats right , exactly , but not a dystopia per se . Yeah , you want to make sure if you 're going to write a world , a dystopian world , that you have some sort of point . And here is where I think a lot of dystopian movies go awry . They 're just too on the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must work together and stop killing the planet . I mean we get it . We know . Yes . Absolutely . laughs But surely , there 's something else to say . <p> John : So you have to look for what is the , you know , your movie ca n't just be about this world you created . This world you created has to support the story you 're trying to tell . And so I think an example of a movie that does it really well is The Matrix . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : And so The Matrix is this , obviously , its sort of two levels of dystopia . Like Neo is in this sort of messed up world to start with . But then you realize like , oh its actually much more worse than you think . And its Neos story . And so that 's the backdrop for this journey that he s going on throughout the course of the story . And its exciting because it works . But if it had just been that cool world , who cares ? <p> Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the dystopia is a straw dummy set up for the screenwriter to knock down . Elysium , the concept of Elysium was that very rich people lived on this space station floating above the planet . And then all the have-nots lived on the planet where they suffered . Well , that 's just , its too simple . You know , so you want to get <p> John : Its way too simple . <p> Craig : Yeah , if you want to get angry at the 1% , it could have been like space 1% . Its just too obvious . And the whole movie feels like a rigged job for people to basically tell rich folks , you stink , which often times they do . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Of course , the people making the movie are all super rich . And the movie was made by a mega corporation . All of which just seemed very odd to me . <p> John : Yeah . But you compare that movie , its the same director to District 9 , which actually had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , exactly . <p> John : And so District 9 could talk about immigration and squalor and <p> Craig : Racism . <p> John : And racism . And it focused on a character who could move from one world into that other world and actually become a part of that world which Matt Damons character never did in Elysium . <p> Craig : Well yeah , and so part of what made District9 ? <p> John : District 9 , yeah . <p> Craig : District 9 . I always want to say District 7 , I do n't  know why . But District 9 , part of what made it so good was that it was getting into this really greasy stuff about what it means to be a policeman . <p> John : Mm-hmm . <p> Craig : And to be a policeman in a bad neighborhood . And to feel like you are both a part of and at war with the community around you . You have this sympathy and then this repulsion and disgust . Some of those people , you 're there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You start to hurt them . That stuff is good , greasy stuff to get into . <p> John : Yeah , because they 're deep human themes but also completely relatable to modern experience . <p> Craig : And there 's conflict to it , you know . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : You can see how a human being becomes torn by the dilemmas of all this . But , you know , if you just get too on the nose with your conceit , then its just like , no ! Its a little bit , you know , I mean it goes back to The Time Machine , Eloi and the Ewoks , or whatever the other ones were . laughs <p> John : laughs Well , I want to step back for a second , when you say like you see the dilemma . Dilemma is another word for a choice . And the dilemma is you 're forcing your protagonist to make a choice between this way of doing things and a new way to doing things . And the choice that you want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the most pain but is the one that 's going to lead to an outcome that 's rewarding . <p> Now I would also state that like the dystopia does n't  have to be the thing itself . In some ways it can function like a MacGuffin . And so if you go back to Terminator , you know , Terminator is coming to kill Sarah Connor . So while we see these moments of dystopia before John Connor , wait , no. 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : John Connor comes back , we see these moments of dystopia where like , you know , tanks are crushing human skulls . Most of the story is not that . Most of the story is this chase movie set in the real present day things against this incredibly dangerous killer robot . <p> So that dystopia is an incredibly important piece of set up and is a thing to avoid , but in order for the movie to resolve successfully she has to win and defeat this one thing . She does n't  have to stop the apocalypse . That 's a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just , you know , she learns to , she 's going to be carrying a baby who 's going to be this important leader . But she herself does n't  have to stop Skynet within the course of this one thing . And it let 's it be much more contained and let 's it be a story about human beings rather than this grand Skynet . <p> Craig : Yeah . And The Terminator is I think the best version of the zombie story anyway . You know , he ca n't be reasoned with , he ca n't be defeated . He will never stop no matter what . Very zombie-like , right ? It just keeps on coming . You chop him in half , he keeps on coming . But he is defeatable . <p> And ultimately you can defeat it . And that 's why Terminator is I think a more interesting story ultimately than the general zombie story because we like stories where we triumph over death . At least , if I 'm going to do a fantasy story , and all science fiction is fantasy . Terminator is fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a fantasy story , I might as well I 'm an optimist , so I like fantasy stories about triumphing over death , even of course , in the end , though , everyone dies . <p> John : Mm-hmm . Yeah , everyone does die . <p> Craig : You die , she dies , they all die . <p> John : To wrap this up , I would say that , you know , you and I are both fans of life with a purpose . And therefore , hopefully death with a purpose as well . And so if in crafting these stories , you 're able to make that characters existence meaningful in the course of the movies world , that 's success . <p> Craig : A good purposeful death is a wonderful thing . <p> John : I agree . Craig , I think that 's the end of the world for us here in the end of our show . Do you have a One Cool Thing ? 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Yeah ? laughs <p> Craig : Yeah . I 'm trying to decide between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Have I talked about this , I do n't  know , I always feel like I 'm app heavy . So I was thinking like , you choose , do you want a One Cool Thing that 's an app or One Cool Thing that 's something you can hold in your hand and put in your mouth ? <p> John : I 'm going to pick an app for myself , so why do n't  you do the thing you put in your mouth ? <p> Craig : Okay . So I was over at Chicago Fire/PDs creators home , Derek Haas . <p> John : Yes . <p> Craig : His wife put out all this <p> John : His wife is the best . <p> Craig : Shes the best . <p> John : I love Kristi . Shes the best . <p> Craig : She is the best . So Kristi put out all these things because we had all the kids together and she put out these things . And it was boxed water . Have you seen this ? <p> John : Yeah , Ive seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Okay , well you live in fancy town . I live , you know , in Mormonville where we do n't  have boxed water . And so I thought it was pretty genius . I hate bottled water . I hate the concept of bottled water . I hate the bottles . I do n't  understand why we do n't  just drink water out of the tap . I 'm the one guy left in LA that drinks water out of his tap . <p> John : I only drink water out of the tap . Out of the tap or out of like the filtered pitcher . <p> Craig : Okay , exactly . So I do n't  understand , I mean , understand occasionally if you 're serving people or things and you do n't  want keep filling stuff up , maybe then . Or if you 're going somewhere I guess . But people , it makes me nuts . Anyway , at least with boxed water , you 're not just filling the trash with all these bottles . Its much easier to recycle . And you can squish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just do n't  What is the story with bottled water ? Why did that happen ? Why ? <p> John : I think bottled water serves a crucial need when you can not count on the safety of your water supply . And so for those purposes , I think bottled water is a great thing . And I guess if your choice is between drinking a soda and drinking a bottled water , the bottle water is healthier for you to be consuming . But in general , I completely agree with you . And that 's why we do n't  have any bottled water in the house . And I either drink directly out of the faucet , well , I drink it in a glass . <p> Craig : Right . I will do it out of the faucet . <p> John : Every once in a while , I will do the , you know , the two-hand scooping thing . <p> Craig : Oh really ? No , I just do the sideways head , like lapping noise , like a dog . <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're mostly just drinking air , but it feels good . I mean when I was a kid , we used to just drink water out of the hose . <p> John : Yeah . Yeah , you shouldnt do that honestly because the plastics in a hose are not <p> Craig : Oh , get out of here . Look at me , I 'm as healthy as an ox . <p> John : laughs Yes . They actually make hoses , though , that are designed for drinking water that are safe . <p> Craig : I 've just had it with this . You know what , now I want the world to end . Now I hate the world . Oh , your hose , we 've got a special hose for your special body . I used to drink out of some nasty hose that was <p> John : I used to drink out of puddles . laughs <p> Craig : laughs Yeah . And like our garden hose was smelted in the basement of some weird prison . And it was all coils and nasty chemicals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we liked it . <p> Craig : It was delicious . And the end was like a rusty nozzle . <p> John : Thats good stuff . <p> Craig : Yeah . And look at me , strong . <p> John : Strong . <p> Craig : Strong like an ox . <p> John : You could not be stronger . <p> Craig : Strong like ox . <p> John : My One Cool Thing , I do n't  think I 've talked about it in the show before . And I 'm curious whether you use it . Its Waze .

And you 'll notice that I ultimately did go back to using paragraph tags , rather than list items . <p> One frustrating part of discussing scripts on the internet is that the formatting is always wrong . Changing the typeface to monospace ( such as Courier or Monaco ) helps a little , but the indentations are still wonky . <p> Beginning with yesterdays post , I 'm using a new CSS style template I created to handle screenplay markup on the site .

The rest of this post gets kind of technical , so you may want to bail out now . <p> Okay , geeks who are still with me : <p> Doing screenplay in CSS seems pretty straightforward . The base class ( Screenplay ) would handle the width of the virtual page , and make everything 12pt Courier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , . character , . dialogue , . parenthetical , and . transition . <p> My first instinct was to handle the elements with paragraph styles , like this : <p> &lt;p class= " sceneheader " &gt;INT . BOB 'S DINER NIGHT&lt;/p&gt; <p> Unfortunately , paragraphs carry with them a bunch of problems . First , they 're the bread-and-butter of blogging programs like WordPress , so odds of choking the interpreter seem pretty high . And in order to use them , I would have to wrap them in &lt;div&gt; tags , which is another potential boondoggle . <p> So instead , I decided to define a new class of unordered list for the container class , and define each of the elements as list items . One issue that quickly comes up is line spacing . For screenplays , you need one blank line after a line of action or dialogue , but none after a character name . <p> EXT .

She smiles at Melissa , who walks by with two cups of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenbox ( 420 px ) , but the formatting looks okay for anywhere between 300 and 700 pixels . Everything else is handled by percentages for horizontal spacing , and ex heights for vertical spacing . <p> You 'll notice that . sceneheader is really no different than . action . I defined it so that if at some later date I decided to tweak it ( for instance , adding scene numbers ) , the markup would already be there . <p> As always , anyone is welcome to use and modify this template as they see fit .

This is my umpteenth paying gig , and somehow I 'm not really that much further along in my career than I was four years ago when I started . But I am a bit wiser . Wise enough to know when producers and development execs are really out to lunch . But apparently not wise enough to jump off this sinking ship . Baby needs a new pair of shoes , right ? <p> And so I must ask someone wiser and infinitely more successful than I am : at what point do you pull the plug . You know , you 're getting notes that make no sense .

The Writers Guild ( or the Canadian equivalent ) would like to remind you that you 're never supposed to do free rewrites , but the reality is that for a project you believe in , you 're willing to do whatever it takes to get it right . But if you 're questioning the producers commitment to the project , ask to get paid for that next batch of tiny tweaks . If they balk , its that much easier to walk . <p> Set some objectives and deadlines . Agree to do that next pass , but only if theyll commit to taking it out to directors .

More recently , I had to let Tarzan go , after more than a year of work . <p> In both cases , I felt profound frustration and disappointment , both in myself and the people whod hired me . It was n't just the amount of wasted work , but the sense that I was abandoning my creations . The characters were real to me , and now would n't get a chance to live .

@@42311596 @2311596/ <p> One page of screenplay translates to one minute of movie . Since most movies are a little under two hours long , most screenplays should be a little less than 120 pages . <p> That 's an absurd oversimplification , of course . <p> One page of a battle sequence might run four minutes of screen time , while a page of dialogue banter might zip by in 30 seconds . No matter . The rule of thumb might as well be the rule of law : any script over 120 pages is automatically suspect . If you hand someone a 121-page script , the first note they will give you is , " Its a little long . " In fact , some studios will refuse to take delivery of a script over 120 pages ( and thus refuse to pay ) . <p> So you need to be under 120.1 , both Big Fish and Go are more than 120 pages . I 'm not claiming that longer scripts are n't  shot . I 'm saying that if you go over the 120 page line , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the reader is going in with the subconscious goal of cutting something.2 <p> Which usually means you need to cut . <p> Before we look at how to do that , let 's address a few things you should never do when trying to cut pages , no matter how tempting . <p> Do n't  adjust line spacing . Final Draft let 's you tighten the line spacing , squeezing an extra line or two per page . Do n't  . Not only is it obvious , but it makes your script that much harder to read . <p> Do n't  tweak margins . With the exception of Widow Control ( see below ) , you should never touch the default margins : an inch top , bottom and right , an inch-and-a-half on the left . 3 <p> Do n't  mess with the font . Screenplays are 12-pt Courier . If you try a different size , or a different face , your reader will notice and become suspicious . <p> All of these donts could be summarized thusly : Do n't  cheat . Because we really will notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> There are two kinds of trims well be making : actual cuts and perceived cuts . Actual cuts mean you 're taking stuff out , be it a few lines , scenes or sequences . Perceived cuts are craftier . You 're editing with specific intention of making the pages break differently , thus pulling the end of the script up . Perceived cuts do n't  really make the script shorter . They just make it seem shorter , like a fat man wearing stripes . <p> Fair warning : Many of these suggestions will seem borderline-OCD . But if you 've spent months writing a script , why not spend one hour making it look and read better ? <h> Cutting a page or two <p> At this length , perceived cuts will probably get you where you need to be . ( That said , always look for bigger , actual cuts . Remember , 117 pages is even better than 120 . ) <p> Practice Widow Control . Widows are those little fragments , generally a word or two , which hog a line to themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOFFMAN <p> Oh , I agree . He s quite the catch , for a fisherman . Caught myself trolling more than once . <p> If you pull the right-hand margin of that dialogue block very , very slightly to the right , you can often make that last word jump up to the previous line . Done right , its invisible , and reads better . <p> I generally do n't  try to kill widows in action lines unless I have to . The ragged whitespace helps break up the page . But its always worth checking whether two very short paragraphs could be joined together.4 <p> Watch out for invisible orphans . Orphans are short lines that dangle by themselves at the top of page . You rarely see them these days , because by default , most screenwriting programs will force an extra line or two across the page break to avoid them.5 <p> here 's the downside : every time the program does this , your script just got a line or two longer . So anytime you see a short bit of action at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write it that can make it jump back to the previous page . <p> Nix the CUT TO : s . Screenwriters have different philosophies when it comes to CUT TO . Some use it at the end of every scene . Some never use it at all . I split the difference , using it when I need to signal to the reader that were either moving to something completely new story-wise , or jumping ahead in time . <p> But when I 'm looking to trim a page or two , I often find I can sacrifice a few CUT TOs and TRANSITION TOs . So weigh each one . <h> Cutting five to ten pages <p> At this level , you 're beyond the reach of perceived cuts . You 're going to have to take things out . Here are the places to look . <p> Remove unnecessary set-ups . When writing a first act , your instinct is to make sure that everything is really well set up . You have a scene to introduce your hero , another to introduce his mom , a third to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need to know much less about your characters than you think . The faster we can get to story , the better . <p> Get out of scenes earlier . Look at every scene , and ask what the earliest point is you could cut to the next scene . You 'll likely find a lot of tails to trim . <p> Do n't  let characters recap . Characters should never need to explain something that we as the audience already know . Its a complete waste of time and space . So if its really important that Bob know what Sarah saw in the old mill a scene we just watched try to make that explanation happen off-screen . <p> For example , if a scene starts <p> BOB <p> Are you sure it was blood ? <p> we can safely surmise he s gotten the necessary details . <p> Trim third-act bloat . As we cross page 100 in our scripts , that finish line become so appealing that we often race to be done . The writing suffers . Because its easier to explain something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to be efficient . So you need to look at that last section with the same critical eyes that read those first 20 pages 100 times , and bring it up to the same level . The end result will almost always be tighter , and shorter . <h> Cutting ten or more pages <p> Entire sequences are going to need to go away . This happens more than you 'd think . For the first Charlies Angels , we had a meeting at 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon in which the president of the studio yanked ten pages out of the middle of the script . There was nothing wrong with those scenes , but we could n't afford to shoot them . So I was given until Monday morning to make the movie work without them . <p> Be your own studio boss . Be savage . Always err on taking out too much , because you 'll likely have to write new material to address some of what 's been removed . <p> The most brutal example I can think of from my own experience was my never-sold ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages out of the first draft basically , everything that did n't  support the two key ideas of Zombie Western . By clear-cutting , I could make room for new set pieces that fit much better with the movie I was trying to make . <p> Once you start thinking big-picture , you realize its often easier to cut fifteen pages than five . You ask questions like , " What if there was no Incan pyramid , and we went straight to Morocco ? " or " What if instead of seeing the argument , reconciliation and breakup , it was just a time cut ? " <p> Smart restructuring of events can often do the work for you . A project I 'm just finishing has several occasions in which the action needs to slide forward several weeks , with characters relationships significantly changed . That 's hard to do with straight cutting you expect to see all the pieces in the middle . But by focussing on something else for a scene or two a different character in a different situation I 'm able to come back with time jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a big chunk of your script , something that may have taken weeks to write . So do n't  just hit " delete . " Cut and paste it into a new document , save it , and allow yourself the fiction of believing that in some future script , you 'll be able to use some of it . You wo n't , but it will make it less painful . <p> I try to keep paragraphs of action and scene description between two and six lines . ? <p> While I rag on the program , Final Draft is smart enough to break lines at the period , so sentences always stay intact . Its a small thing , but it really helps the read . Other programs may do it now , too . ?

Sometimes this means simply repurposing internal thoughts as dialogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , storyline and characters to achieve the goal . <p> I think one reason that many adaptations rely on voice-over is that the filmmakers never found a way to externalize the essence of the novel they were adapting . Instead of making a movie that could stand on its own , they created the cinematic equivalent of a book-on-tape . To me , these movies always " feel " written , a huge limitation .

" Pay for your ticket and do n't  complain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled to be the subject of your podcast and this gathering . There is behind us <p> Craig : This is what its like all the time , by the way . <p> Lawrence : Theres a secret life going on with everybody all the time . And its the one that feels like , oh , I 'm a fake . I 'm a sham . How am I going to get through this ? Can I get through it with people thinking I know what I 'm talking about ? Will you guys ask questions you 're wondering , can you ask a question he has n't  been asked a hundred times ? <p> Craig : I know . We 've really tried hard . How are we doing so far ? <p> Lawrence : So far so good . <p> Craig : Okay . <p> Lawrence : The thing that got me about that Raiders episode , which I do recommend . These guys know Raiders much better than I do . Last night I was listening to a little bit of it , and I thought , " Really ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " This is masterful . And that 's masterful . " And I 'm thinking like , masterful , me ? Is that ? Wow , great . Because you do n't  feel masterful . You do n't  . <p> And you do n't  feel it when you 're doing it . And you hope for it to be considered that way later on . When it holds up , when you guys can deconstruct it for an hour and a half , and it not just fall apart in your hands like dust <p> Craig : It holds up . <p> Lawrence : Its very nice . <p> John : Well , what you 've described is like we say its masterful and you had no idea that it was masterful at the time . Weve talked about imposter syndrome where you feel like , you know , people are going to figure out that I really do n't  know what I 'm doing . <p> Lawrence : Yes . <p> John : And these lovable jerk characters , Indiana Jones , the Han Solo , I think there 's a quality of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one will pay attention to the fact that they really do n't  know what they 're doing . And there 's an inner doubt there that 's coming off through some of their dialogue , some of their lines . <p> It strikes me that like you cant have those characters unless there 's someone to play opposite that character . So , if you do n't  have a Marion , if you do n't  have a Leia , if you do n't  have a Luke , someone who is not that person . If you try to stick two of those characters together , its going to be chaos . <p> Lawrence : Well , the whole thing that interests me about writing movies , aside from the images and the power of the images and the way you can do that has nothing to do with dialogue , but I 'm always interested in you have a character but he does n't  have any shape . There 's no molding . There 's no contrast until there 's the light of another character shown on him . <p> And what 's wonderful is a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character is so right about the other one . And I had n't  thought of that . " And the protagonist , who you started with , is thinking , " Damn , she 's right about me , " but he cant let that out . If its in his eyes . And then maybe later in the story he proves himself not to be exactly what she thought . What a great surprise that is . That 's the delight of a good movie . <p> Craig : We talk about this a lot , but I think we see it in your work throughout , that your characters really are defined by the relationships that they 're having . Its very difficult to I think sometimes new writers think that they have to write a character . You know , you 're going to write Indiana Jones . But Indiana Jones is defined from the start , even from the very start , by the fact that he s not the guy that he s with . You know ? I just think that you do that really well . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know if any of you have seen the talk that she does . <p> There you go . I do n't  know when she does it fairly frequently at the Guild , but she 's wonderful and you should see it when you can . And what she talks about ultimately is she talks about the last scene of movies . And that we think in our minds , we remember , like what 's the last scene of the movie ? Its when the thing blows up . Its when the plot is resolved . But that 's never the last scene . The last scene is always Luke , and Leia , and Han standing on a ridiculous platform with stupid medals , but they 're smiling at each other . Its the relationships . <p> Lawrence : Yes . Well , all of film , and the way this thing works , whether its film or digital , is there 's nothing until there 's a contrast between one pixel and another , between one grain of film and another . So , right at the essence of film , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And that same thing follows right through the story , through all the characters , and everything is illuminated by the contrast . <p> John : So , you had a unique opportunity to go back and take a look at Han Solo , a character that you worked with before , in The Force Awakens . And a number of years have passed between them . What were those conversations like as you started looking at that character and where hed be at now , what his relationships were like , what his relationship was like with his son , with Leia ? What were those discussions and how did you figure out who he was then ? <p> Lawrence : You know , Harrison is a little older than me , but our careers have been oddly entwined . We 've never been close , but he s a lovely guy . And he s turned into a great , great man . And something happened where , you know , he s relaxed into <p> Craig : I think its pot , from what Ive heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know . I 've never seen it , but that 's what Ive heard . <p> Lawrence : He is a prince . A god . A king . And I could see that as soon as we came into the process and J.J. and I started talking to Harrison in some way early on . And after we had a draft , we had a really funny , wonderful meeting with him . And we did a lot of the writing in various cities , because J.J. he had to be in London . He had to be out of London for tax reasons . And we were in Paris . And London . <p> Craig : That dodge has been canceled . <p> John : High class problems ? 10556 @qwx420556 <p> Lawrence : But we did most of it walking around Santa Monica and Manhattan , a freezing day . It was total fun . Most fun ever , really . But when we got to this stage where Harrison came , we had done a lot of work at the various Soho Houses . Now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that go to the Soho House . In London , there are like five or six of them . And J.J. is a member . I 'm not a member . I think I heard you guys talking about it . <p> John : Yeah , Dana Fox talks about it . And Aline goes to the Soho House . I 'm not a member . I tried . <p> Craig : I 'm not a member . <p> Lawrence : You 're not a member . But you 've been taken there by wonderful patrons . <p> Craig : Douchebags usually . <p> Lawrence : But Harrison came , and so did Carrie . We had these meetings , a series of meetings at one of the Soho Houses . And it was great to Harrison first of all was totally , he was so positive about the whole thing . And he did n't  ask for much . And you really wanted to do anything that any problem he had , you either wanted to fix it , or you wanted to bring him over to your side . <p> You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door to the Falcon came down . It was a big could have been a disastrous mistake . It was an understandable mistake , but a bad one on the part of the guy in charge of the door . <p> Craig : Where is that guy now , by the way ? <p> Lawrence : Yeah . Well . <p> John : He had to leave for tax reasons . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> Lawrence : laughs He is in Paris , I 'm sure . <p> Craig : Wont see that guy no more . <p> Lawrence : Meg was visiting that day and she and I went out to get something to eat . And we came back and everything had locked down . So , it happened like I probably should never have left the set . <p> John : Lessons learned . So , in going back to revisit Han Solo , you were presenting him with a whole set of challenges which the old Han Solo would never have to face . So , what is it like to ? <p> Lawrence : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> John : No , no , no . <p> Craig : Stuff like that . <p> John : Youre giving him responsibilities that are sort of un-Han Solo like . So , like having a relationship with <p> Lawrence : Well , this is what I started out to say . Even though Harrison is a little older than me , but we knew each other 40 years ago practically now when I did Empire is when I met Harrison . And then we did Actually I wrote Raiders . I did n't  meet Harrison . He did n't  know who was going to play it . That could have been Tom Selleck . Could have been anyone . <p> Then I did Empire . And then we got back to Raiders and that 's when I got to know Harrison . He is now so that was around 1980 . And what 's this , 1956 , 1987 , where are we now ? <p> Craig : Right now ? <p> Lawrence : Yeah . <p> Craig : This is 2016 . <p> Lawrence : Oh damn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Do you not remember ? <p> Lawrence : So 36 years ago . <p> Craig : Right . That 's a long time . <p> Lawrence : Its a long time . And he s had a lot of life in between . I 've had a lot of life in between . Its very easy to relate to this character who has been out there doing stuff for 36 years . And that 's how we treated . And J.J. and I never had the slightest doubt that that 's what it was about . You know , its about what have you learned , what have n't you learned , what mistakes will you make forever until you drop , you know , and what mistakes can you learn from . And that 's very easy to write . <p> Craig : And that span of time for you as a filmmaker gives you a certain perspective that I think is interesting to all of us . And the list of questions you 're asked a million times , how have the movies changed I 'm sure is one of them . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , because you 've always written movies for audiences . And that sounds like a strange thing are n't  they all for audiences ? But I feel like sometimes there are filmmakers who are writing it for , I do n't  know you 're writing them for audiences . <p> How have the audiences changed in the time since you started ? <p> Lawrence : I 'm glad you think Im writing for audiences , because very often the audience has not shown up . <p> Craig : This occasionally happens . <p> Lawrence : Yeah . They have n't done their part . I did my part . You know , I honestly believe that I 'm not writing for audiences . I 'm writing for myself . And when J.J. and I sat down to do this one , we sort of came into it under a lot of time pressure and everything , and we were sort of clearing the decks . There had been some false starts . And I said to him , " We have only one job . The job is to delight . This movie does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment . " And that 's not usual for me , because usually I want to make it as hard as possible for people to sit there . <p> But this clearly was going to be satisfying a lot of long-suffering fans . And I said we just want to delight . You know , Akira Kurosawa , who is my greatest hero , and is I think the greatest director that ever lived , and one of the greatest writers that ever lived , his greatest film is Seven Samurai , if you have n't seen it , go home and see it . Its everything . <p> He is the Shakespeare of movies . He does everything . He does comedy . He does drama . Historical drama . Intimate , tiny personal dramas . And swashbuckling action . He s the greatest director that ever lived . At one point , he decided to make Yojimbo , which you can watch as an appetizer for Seven Samurai . And it is , I think , maybe the most entertaining movie ever made . Just frame-by-frame , most entertaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-writers , as he sat down was he said , " I want to make a movie that 's so delicious you want to eat it . " Thats Akira Kurosawa . And Yojimbo is that movie . And incident to incident you say , oh my god , that 's so great . What would be the best thing that could happen next ? <p> Well , I said that to J.J. I told him that story . And I said let 's just write what we want to see , that would delight us , and then the next thing is what 's the next great thing that could happen . And that 's not I approach everything . Its not how I approached The Big Chill , or Accidental Tourist . <p> But this was clearly meant to delight . So that 's a great sort of flag to be operating in . <p> Craig : And you did . I mean , that 's the thing . What 's so fascinating is that 36 years go by , or 35 years , and whatever happened with the audience over that amount of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empire Strikes Back , and they were delighted . You wrote The Force Awakens , and they were delighted again . Its a remarkable thing . <p> Lawrence : How rarely everything happens the way you want it to . In fact , that release it was an amazingly fun time . It was really three years of my life , because I was on it before I officially came on writing it . And then the last two years were just intensely with J.J. and then on the set and production . And when you have a really great experience like that , you 're thinking if you 're Jewish you know , you 're thinking , okay , wheres the kick in the ass ? <p> Craig : That is what I think . Yeah . <p> John : So , at our live show , we had at the very back of the house we had paper where people could write down their questions , because they came there , they showed up that night thinking you were going to be there . And so we only had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question down and well ask some of your questions to Lawrence Kasdan when we see him next . <p> And so some of these are questions that these people wrote . So , Greg Macklin wrote , " What 's your advice to learning to enjoy writing for the sake of writing when things get demoralizing , such as your new movie gets terrible reviews , your pilot gets canceled , life goes south ? " <p> Craig : Oh , I want to know the answer to this one . <p> John : Yeah . And also I think Greg is presupposing that you enjoy writing . So , do you enjoy writing ? <p> Lawrence : You know , the great quote about that , and its been true for me my whole life , is do you enjoy writing ? No . What do you like ? I like having written . Well , everybody likes having written . And you say , oh , well , here I 'll give you another copy . Want another copy ? <p> But , writing it is rarely fun . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , in the best cases , you get caught up in it and its suddenly six hours later and you say , " Shit , we did n't  get anything done , but this is kind of good . " And very often you think the next day , I do , I put it away and then I come back the next day and I 'm expecting to think its terrible . And it often is n't , or at least Ive convinced myself . And that 's fun . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> Lawrence : But then even if I do that , even if I read yesterdays stuff and I say , " Thats pretty good , " then I have to turn to this days stuff and its a drag . <p> Craig : And now you 're thinking how am I going to do as good of a job as yesterday guy did . Yeah . No , it never ends . <p> Lawrence : So its never easy . <p> Craig : Never ends . <p> Lawrence : Never ends . <p> Craig : Heres a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've written that has not been produced that you would still love to make someday ? " <p> Lawrence : Oh , yes , not a lot , because when you go through the whole process and it does n't  work out and you have the whole experience of defeat , very often you get alienated from that . <p> Craig : Stank on that one , yes . <p> Lawrence : But I adapted a Richard Russo book called The Risk Pool . And there was no reason in the world we should n't have made it . Tom Hanks was going to do it , and then he changed his mind . And Richard Russo is a great writer . And someone had sent the book to Meg just to read it , and she said , " Youve got to read this . I think there 's a movie here . " And I do n't  even that excuse . <p> But what got me was it was about a character who was so much like my father . And he s got a lot of problems and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that were enormously attractive , which is how I felt about my father who I lost when I was 14 . And I thought , this is amazing . Richard must have had a similar kind of experience . And if you read Richard Russos stuff , this father figure recurs again and again in Empire Falls and all his work . <p> And because that 's such an important fact of our lives , and if you lose them suddenly and abruptly , that becomes another thing to deal with for the rest of your life . I really wanted to make that movie . And when Tom decided he did n't  want to do it , it just cut all the steam out of it . And it was very hard to get it back . <p> And I would still like to make that movie . And I was working with a wonderful independent producer , Anthony Bregman , on something else , and I said , well you know what I really want he asked me the same question . And I said and I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What ? " He just did n't  get it . It did n't  excite him . <p> You know , he thought , well how are you going to get people and he knows , because he s so prolific . He s knowing that he s going to be in a meeting with Weinstein or Sony Classics or something , and they 're going to say , " How do we sell this ? " <p> Craig : " Ask him which of his sons he prefers . I have my suspicions . " You 're still sticking with <p> Lawrence : Talk to John . He s moved to New York . And I do n't  think its related . But we talked to him this morning , and he was feeling good about me . So I thought he was a wonderful son . <p> Craig : So the answer is you prefer him today . <p> Lawrence : But he and I went through the crucible . Its never easy to I 've collaborated with a lot of different people . My brother , my wife , friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.J. , and became friends . When you start to collaborate with your son , everyone says , " Whoa . " <p> Craig : And was it whoa ? Did you have those moments ? <p> Lawrence : It was a challenge . And we had great moments . And we had difficult moments . And its not over . Were going to go back and do a little work probably . Chris Miller and Phil Lord are directing the movie . Were very excited about that . And they 've been great . Theyre hilarious . <p> Craig : Theyre the best . <p> Lawrence : They came to my place in Colorado and worked with us for a week . And they 're just fun to hang out with out . And they 're brilliant . You know , imaginative guys . <p> The whole reason that I tried to get them onto it , because it was a difficult process . Not because everybody did n't  want them , but money always , and Disney is difficult . But we did get it . But I said to Kathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Look , John and I are going to run out of ideas , probably very soon . And these guys are great writers . So , you 're getting the directors , but you 're also getting these amazing writers . And you should do everything in the world to make it happen . " <p> Craig : Yeah , but on the other side , these movies do n't  make a lot of money , so they have to really be careful about what they spend on the writers . <p> Lawrence : Theres that . <p> John : Larry , could you tell us about the process of collaborating ? Because most of your credits , you are the sole screenwriter . But some of these other ones , you 've had to work with other folks . What is the process when you are coming in on a project that 's already moving ? How are you getting up to speed ? How are you finding common ground ? <p> Lawrence : That has n't  happened much . When I got involved with The Force Awakens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to do the Han movie . But they said to me , " Well make a separate deal for you where you will consult . Were going to have a story group to talk about The Force , " we did n't  know what it was called , but the next Star Wars . <p> And I said , okay . But that involvement I thought would be very casual and intermittent , became very intense as it just did n't  come together . And it was only after nine months of that that they decided to change directions . And I was hesitant . Michael Arndt , an incredibly talented writer , and a great guy <p> Craig : Yeah , great guy . <p> Lawrence : Loved working with him . And he said , you know , " I cant do this in the amount of time . " They were under an enormous time pressure . He said , " I cant do this . " And he stepped away . And J.J. and I took it over . And that was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've had books , two books , but basically Ive been there at the inception . <p> John : And we think of you as doing features . Are there any TV things that I 'm not aware of that you 've done ? Is television interesting to you at all ? <p> Lawrence : Its very interesting to me . And I have a great agent over here and he would like me to be successful in television . Do n't  know if its possible . Its so different . <p> But , it is where all the quality stuff is happening . You know , the chances of making a really good , intelligent , adult movie you can still do it but the odds are a million to one . You do n't  even blame them , because there 's no one going to those movies . You know , you cant get your money back . <p> But there is now , Eden has opened up , which is there 's all this money to do very adult , very complicated stuff , and since The Sopranos there 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , people are competing like crazy . Say , Craig Mazin , can we get Craig Mazin ? John ? What if they do it together ? Well give them the entire network . <p> John : Never . Never . <p> Craig : Oh . So <p> John : laughs <p> Craig : Well , one thing that 's interesting about television , you I think are exceptionally good at what I call closed ended narrative , and that 's what movies are . They begin , they proceed , they end . <p> Lawrence : Yes . <p> Craig : And your endings are always great . In television , at least historically , the whole point of television was never end . But now there is this middle ground . <p> Lawrence : There is . <p> Craig : Its interesting . People are making either short term miniseries or movies for television . I could certainly see like I would imagine once this goes out that people are going to be calling about the movie that you were just talking about . There 's a demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah , they do n't  put in theaters right now . <p> Lawrence : Yeah , which is amazing . And its great news for everybody here . Because five years ago you would have said , " Oh , its the end of the world . " Because studios are not interested in anything that is n't slam-dunk branded . And that does n't  mean its going to work , but its branded . And so they 're making a tiny number with big movie stars that will do some other kind of things . And then there 's independent film , which is very much alive and thriving , but you 're headed toward Netflix and Amazon and Apple anyway . I mean , that 's really where people are going to see it . They 're not going to see it in a theater . <p> So , the fantasy of the kind of movies that I made for 30 years , that 's sort of over . You know . <p> Craig : Even a movie like The Bodyguard . <p> Lawrence : Very hard . <p> Craig : Like The Big Chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a specific movie of its time , but you could look at it now and go , " Oh , they do n't  make adult dramas like that . " But even Bodyguard <p> John : Body Heat , they would never make as a feature now . <p> Craig : Never . Never . <p> John : Body Heat is a Netflix series , a 13-episode series . <p> Craig : Right . But it would have been a good one on Netflix . <p> John : So good . Slow burn . <p> Lawrence : But I 've been intimidated by the length of time . And I have a couple projects that I 'm working on now that would be eight hours . And that seems possible to me . I have n't quite worked them out . But as long as someone else is writing those eight hours . I do n't  want to . <p> Craig : You do n't  want to write them . Of course not . <p> John : So , are both your sons involved in the film industry ? <p> Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Craig : Yeah . Jake is a big comedy movie director . <p> Lawrence : Yes he is . And in TV , he s got all these TV series . <p> Craig : You were giving me a look behind me earlier . <p> Lawrence : I did n't  know what you said . <p> Craig : Okay . Its paranoia . <p> Lawrence : Craig did n't  used to have a beard , but part of his comic stylings is to murmur or something that you cant quite hear . He can score on you without you ever hearing it . So everybody is that right ? <p> John : Its absolutely true . <p> Craig : Kind of a weird defense for hearing loss , but okay . <p> John : laughs <p> Lawrence : Somehow I think the beard has made that even more effective . Maybe you cant really see your lips moving . <p> Craig : He s the dad I always wanted . <p> John : I can tell , yeah . So , both of your sons are writing and directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things have changed obviously since when you started . What do you talk to them about if they come to you for career advice ? <p> Lawrence : Well , they used to , but they do n't  anymore . When they were younger , and they did care what I thought . And there was a period when I became very discouraged about movies , you know , because they just stopped making the kind of movies that I had thrived on . And I said to them , " You know , movies have gone to hell . The end of the world has arrived . Its all crap . " <p> And they both said sort of , " Dad , you know , you 've been saying the same thing for 25 years . " And I was thinking we had reached some <p> Craig : But apparently your whole life is that ? <p> Lawrence : Yes , my life is down in the valley . And the truth is it has always been hard always . When we were moving recently and I came across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , who made Hud . A great director . And George Miller . A young George Miller . And Peter Bogdanovich . And were all saying this is 30 years ago . <p> Craig : Same thing ? <p> Lawrence : Were all saying , " Oh , they just want to make comic books now . Its all branding and super heroes . There wont be another good movie made . " This is 30 years ago . So , somehow the movies get made . But it is a struggle . Always . <p> Craig : Should we ? <p> John : Open it up for questions . <p> Craig : Yeah . And well start with you , sir . <p> Male Audience Member : Okay , for Mr. Kasdan , how did you learn your craft ? And I want to preface that by saying it sounds like you just started writing screenplays . But did you study acting ? It seems from your work that you did . Or Shakespeare ? Or write plays ? Or any of that ? <p> Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be an actor . And people kept saying , " Youre terrible . You 're terrible . " And I actually think that 's very important , because no one these are all good jobs if you 're working in the movies or television or everything . And people will discourage you . And if you can be discouraged , you should be discouraged . And I was discouraged about acting and I gave it up . <p> But when they said , when I wanted to be a writer-director , they said , " What are you thinking ? You 're crazy . " And that did n't  mean anything to me . And I think that 's the natural selection process that happens . <p> How did I learn it ? I watched movies and movies . I was studying literature in college and was knocked out by the writing that I was exposed to . I came out of West Virginia , but we had a pretty decent English program at my high school in West Virginia . But in 1961 , I saw Lawrence of Arabia . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . And this is before high school or anything . I thought , " I want to direct movies . " <p> And my brother had gone to Harvard and he came back from Boston and he said , " You know , people make movies . They do n't  just happen . The actors do n't  just make it up . " We did n't  know that in West Virginia . In West Virginia it was like you 'd call the theater and youd say , " What time is the showing ? " And theyd say , " Well , when can you get here ? " <p> We had no real connection . But my brother said there 's a whole job you can have doing this . And that was terribly important to me . And from the time I was 14 on , all I wanted to do was direct movies . <p> John : Larry , when did you first read a screenplay ? When did you first start working on a screenplay versus writing other stuff ? <p> Lawrence : Well , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there had never been a screenplay <p> Craig : 73 ? 69 . <p> Lawrence : 69 . I had been watching movies , but I do n't  know that I had seen a screenplay and what it looked like . But when Butch Cassidy came out , it changed the whole world for people who wanted to write movies . And it was published in book form as a screenplay , which almost no one out in the world had seen before . <p> I mean , by 69 I had seen a lot of screenplays because I had gone to Michigan to try to become this thing . But that was a big moment where you read it and you said , " Well , why was this the highest priced screenplay of all time ? And why do I love it moment to moment ? And what freedom Bill has , " William Goldman . I did n't  know him as Bill then . " He seems to have such freedom about how to do this . " <p> And that was very liberating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different style . And its I think the greatest screenplay ever written . And you should get a hold of it . Robert Bolt . And its just one amazing thing after another . And lucky for him , David Lean was there mentoring him and telling him what he wanted , and then going off and doing you know , making the greatest movies of all time . <p> But if you just study if you stop wasting your time on Raiders of the Lost Ark and just talk Lawrence of Arabia and look at it page by page , and then read it , and then read it again . That 's an education in screenwriting . <p> Craig : And you showed up one movie after Alec Guinness on Star Wars . He was right there . You had him <p> Lawrence : Oh , how I wish I 'd met him . <p> Male Audience Member : Hi . A quick three-part question . <p> Craig : No , no , no . A one-part question . <p> Lawrence : One-part question . <p> Male Audience Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ? <p> Male Audience Member : About being pigeon-holed as a writer . You talked about genres as vessels and then usually you 're telling the same stories essentially , just finding a different vessel to put it in . <p> Lawrence : Yes . <p> Male Audience Member : How do you experience with being pigeon-holed , or being forced to pigeon-holed . And how as new writers , you know , you 're constantly being pushed into that fear . <p> Lawrence : Thats the kind of problem you want to have , where anyones even thinking about you . And they say , " Oh , you know , he s written only this kind of movie . " I 'm not putting that down at all . But it is really a high class problem you have . <p> What you want is you want how can you be considered a writer that they will give money to . That 's the first step . That you 're doing work that they want to pay you for . And pigeon-holing comes with great success and its not to worry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Or one thing Ive always heard about in development is the point of view of the story . When it comes to film , is this different from having a narrator ? <p> John : Oh , talk to us about point of view . What does point of view mean to you ? <p> Lawrence : Point of view . Yes . You know , the point of view can change 50 times during the movie . Development is a word that generally is accompanied with locusts and drought . Development is a horrible thing . Once I hear the word development , I 'm already gone . You have to bring me back . <p> Things that people say in development . These are very smart people , because those jobs are hard to get , too , you know . So , there 's a lot of competition and you practically have to go to Harvard . You meet an unbelievable number of Harvard people out here . You say , why ? There 's no connection . <p> Craig : Theyre dicks . <p> Lawrence : No connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development is not a place to be edified or to have your life get good . So , the thing is what you really want is that when you 're doing your work alone you say , " Well , what is the point of view of this story ? Who is experiencing the things I want the audience to experience ? How am I going to convey that as a writer so that they know ? " And as I said , it can change from one moment to the next . <p> But , I 'm working on a project and the woman who is the protagonist is thrown into a situation that she 's excited about being in , but has never been in before , and everything is coming at her . And shes trying to figure it out on the fly . And that 's perfect for movies . You know , its her point of view . And then when that scene is over , we get the point of view of someone who was watching her and evaluating her and comes up to give her his praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think its very fluid . Fluid is actually not a bad word to keep in mind all the time . <p> John : So talk about point of view . Some movies , like Body Heat , are going to have a clearly limited point of view because we do n't  want the audience to have more information than our protagonist does . But you look at The Force Awakens , it seems like , oh , this is from Reys point of view , but then you realize there 's many characters who have sort of storytelling power . And as long as were with one of those characters , you can have a seen driven by one of those characters . <p> Lawrence : Because if it were just Rey , you would be very limited . You know , you would not know all of these things that are going on with Kylo Ren and you would n't but it happens that Han comes to Rey and Chewie comes to Rey . And Boyega comes to Rey . The secret sauce of that movie is Daisy Ridley . Shes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was good was we all agreed right from the start this was going to be a young woman who was going to be the protagonist . But we got really lucky when we got Daisy , because she 's more than that . And every frame she 's in glows . And her presence in the movie , you know , ripples out from every scene . So even if she 's not in , you 're sort of feeling Rey . <p> John : And point of view also can be affected by when you 're introducing characters to an audience . And so I think in an earlier version did n't  we meet Leia earlier on in the story and then you ended up sliding that back <p> Lawrence : Yes , but how do you know that ? Have you been in my house ? <p> John : Sorry . But its a lovely house . I know you were doing construction . It was fine . Good choices you made . I like the paint colors . <p> Craig : This is what I have this all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of you probably made one choice originally , and then you saw how the audience is experiencing the movie . <p> Lawrence : J.J. shot it that way . And Leia came into the movie much earlier . And we discussed it at the time . When is the right time for her to come in ? And I always think put off everybody you know , anything you can put off , you should put off . And then maybe it will fall out of the end of the movie and never have in the movie . Because the fewer things that are in the movie , the better , almost always . <p> So , you 're trying to cut , cut , cut , cut , cut , cut . But , no , we did n't  know exactly the right place . And we werent set when J.J. shot it that way , and he started cutting it that way . And then one day he called me and he said , " Weve taken her out . And she comes in at the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Han for the first time . That 's her entrance in the movie . Isnt that when you want to see her come into the movie , when she and Han lay eyes on each other for the first time ? " <p> And I said , " I 'm so happy . " <p> Craig : Fantastic . <p> Female Audience Member : Thank you . <p> Female Audience Member : This question is for my 15-year-old son and his buddies that are haunting my house today . Did you play , Mr. Kasdan , did you play Dungeons &amp; Dragons or chess when you were a kid . If not , how did you learn to move the characters around so cool ? <p> Craig : That is a good question . <p> Lawrence : Great question . <p> John : Great question . <p> Lawrence : Great question . <p> John : Also a very good mom there . So thank you for that . <p> Craig : And a good mom . <p> Lawrence : You know , I did n't  play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have to tell them that . But what you should do is show them the great movies that have stirred you and stirred your parents . And live without any explanation . You know , you do n't  have to explain these great movies . You can sit any <p> A few years ago we were at a vacation home and there were a bunch of kids , like from 10 to 18 . And I said , " Oh , let 's watch Casablanca . " And everybody is like , " What ? " And it was a Blu-ray . A B&amp;W Blu-ray , because its a B&amp;W movie , which is gorgeous . I recommend getting it . And they did n't  fuss that much to start . <p> And then it started and they did n't  say anything . They were silent for the entire length of the movie . They were riveted . Because once the lights go down and that title is the title of one of Pauline Kaels books that my brother actually gave her , When the Lights Go Down but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment . Which is the lights go down and everybody focuses on that frame . And all bets are off . All the prejudices are off . If the movie works , they 're in . They can be five years old . They can be 85 years old . If it works , they 're in . <p> And that 's a beautiful thing to know . That if you 're doing your job , and you have n't let them go , which we sometimes drive them out . We tell them shit they do n't  need to know . We make it longer than Ive done this make it way longer than it has to be . And you 're driving out . But the instinct is to stay in . And it does n't  matter how old they are . Show them the best movie you think , and they will learn all these things about , " Gee , that character did that . And that character did that . " Its almost as good as Dungeons &amp; Dragons . <p> Craig : But not quite . Maam ? <p> Female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opposite gender . So when I think about Marion in Raiders of if I 'm thinking about Rachel , I see strong , beautiful women who are in peril and need to be saved . And yet even though they 're being commoditized , they know that they still have dignity and they move through that story with a sense of themselves . And sometimes even save the man that came to save them . Was that a natural tendency of yours ? Did you have to work harder at writing credibly authentic women ? And can you tell other men writers how to do the same thing , please ? Thank you . <p> Lawrence : I think I what saved me is I did n't  make that distinction much in mind . I thought every character had to be interesting . Every character had to be as complicated as the people I knew . And the women I knew were even more mysterious to me , so they were very complicated . <p> And if you are making a person , you know , theyll probably be interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under everything you ever do is ask yourself as things are bouncing around down there , is it true ? Does this feel true ? And it does n't  mean that it had to happen . And it does n't  mean that it ever will happen . It means that in the world we 've created , does this seem real ? Does it honor the reality you 've created up till then ? If its true , you 're half the way there . So , that would be man , woman , child , whatever . <p> John : Larry , that seems to go back to your acting . You said you werent a good actor , but that 's very much an acting kind of question . Does this moment ring true ? Could I play this ? Could I actually believe that I 'm in this moment as its happening . <p> Lawrence : Yes . And you know , I like to think of myself as a director . Ive spent years of my life directing actors . I love actors . And when they have a problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wardrobe . Sometimes its about the other actor is doing something that 's driving them crazy . And you have to suss out without making villains anywhere and not alienating anybody else , you have to say how can I make them more comfortable . How can we get through this ? <p> And I sometimes use the example that if they say , " These lines . I just ca n't say these lines . " I say , okay , well , its possible they 're no good . First of all , would you like to write some new ones ? That usually slows the process down . But , I say , what if you pick up the glass in the middle of the scene and then do n't  drink from it . You put it down . And that says something about where your state of mind is . And they go , " Mm . " And you have a conversation started . <p> And maybe the thing is there are lines that should n't be in there . That 's usually what it is . There 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't  say it at all , and you never have to say it , you 'll never say it in this movie , and you 'll never have to say it in your life . " And they say , " Okay , I like that . " That 's very possible . <p> So , you 're looking for a strategy that gets people who are stuck over the part they 're stuck about . That 's true of cameramen , and production designers , and costume designers . If they have a problem , you 've got to say , " What is the real problem , " and not let your own sense of pressure or being a fake overcome your ability to open up that conversation . <p> John : Do you think its easier being the writer-director to tell them like , " Oh , just do whatever you want , " because you 're the writer and you know how its all going to fit together ? Have you directed things that youve not written ? <p> Lawrence : Just a couple . <p> John : And so is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and do their own thing when you 're not the writer there as well ? <p> Lawrence : Being a writer-director is a place of enormous power . Everybody wants to please the director , but the security if you 've written it , too , there 's enormous credibility you have . And you can sometimes get things that a director could not get . <p> And theyll ask you , " Well , why is this like this ? " And you say , well , you know , its not about this . Its about 40 pages later this has to happen . And sometimes they have not made that connection . And no matter how committed they are , no matter how great they are as actors , they just do n't  think the way you do . And sometimes if you say , " Well , you know , 40 pages later when he does this , that 's because he said that earlier . " And they go , " Oh my god , that 's great . " <p> And it helps everything for the next 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . We go into meetings . The studio executives or the producers have missed things that we do n't  understand they 've missed . Actors miss things we do n't  understand they miss . But the truth is , their minds do n't  work like ours , and thank god . <p> Lawrence : Yes . <p> Craig : Because , A , that means we have something worthy and not replicable . And also I do n't  want my actors to be screenwriters . I 've seen screenwriters act . I want actors to be actors . And its a different way of approaching material . I completely understand that point of view . <p> Sir ? <p> Male Audience Member : Craig and John , thanks for doing this . You 're doing a great job . Do you need a water or anything ? Mr. Kasdan , my name is Nathan Scoggins , and I 've been fortunate to get a few things made . And I remember when I was 11 and my parents asked me what I wanted to do , and I talked about movies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . One was The Accidental Tourist and the other was Grand Canyon . <p> Lawrence : Great parents . <p> Male Audience Member : They had good taste . They had good taste . And Grand Canyon is one of those movies that <p> Craig : Theres a question coming , right ? <p> Male Audience Member : There is . <p> Craig : Good . <p> Male Audience Member : And it feels like one of those movies that is kind of a forgotten film of the early 90s , and yet it feels as current now in terms of the themes that it deals with as it did then . And I 'm curious , because it feels kind of like a movie out of time , could you talk a little bit about what went into crafting that film ? <p> Lawrence : Absolutely . I wrote Grand Canyon with my wife , Meg , who is here . And we had raised two jobs in Los Angeles . And things were happening in the city and I found we were both trying to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we wanted to figure out why is there all this energy that 's so negative , so dangerous , and there 's also all this thriving , throbbing life in the city . <p> And we were just trying to figure out if we could make some sense of it . And public discourse has become so politically charged , and Grand Canyon may have difficulties in this time because it dares to talk about some things that you 're not supposed to talk about anymore . You 're not allowed to . <p> And I liked the movie a lot and in the privacy of my home I can look at it and say I know why I did that was a great experience by the way . It was total , total great experience . And I wish that there were more freedom now to talk about these kind of things , but they 're really hot button issues . Every single one of them . <p> Craig : Well , there 's a certain expectation now that if you do talk about things , you have to talk about them perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would argue that its literally impossible for a film to not fall down some because it is n't real life . Its some simulation of life . <p> Lawrence : Yes . <p> Male Audience Member : Thank you . <p> Male Audience Member : Mr. Kasdan , you 're such an integral part to two of the biggest and most popular franchises of like movie history . I was wondering since franchise and universe building is such like key words in the industry today , what are some of the touchstones that keep rooted to a really good story even within a franchise ? And what are some of the pitfalls that you can see writers falling into when they 're trying to create the perfect franchise movie ? <p> Lawrence : Yeah . I do n't  think you can create the perfect franchise movie . These guys did an interesting analysis of the top 100 movies , and there were 14 standalone movies of the top 100 . The other 86 were all related to franchises . That was so discouraging . <p> Craig : Well , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what the discouragement is about . <p> John : Hows that next Han Solo movie going ? Yeah . <p> Craig : Yeah . As you remodel your 12th house . We could do this forever . <p> John : We could do this forever . And actually , that 's the thing , we may be making Star Wars movies forever . Star Wars may outlast us . <p> Craig : Were going to . Yeah . <p> John : So its a different thing that 's happening . <p> Lawrence : Thats not the issue . That 's the outside looking in . What were talking about , what your challenge is your challenge is to find I do n't  know , maybe you want to write the perfect franchise movie . That means you need a franchise to work on and you need to say , " I want to do a really good job on this . " Okay , this will be a nice entry in that . <p> But if you 're interested in other things , that is entirely on you . And you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , go home , sit at your computer , and say , " What is the story I most want to tell ? And I know that its going to be really hard to get it made . And everyone is going to tell me I 'm crazy because its not a franchise and its not a brand . But I really want to tell this story . " <p> And then work as hard as you can to tell that story . That 's actually how you do good work . And its also how if you are charged with creating a franchise movie , its the same process . What 's the best way we can do this ? Without cynicism . Without presumption that people already like it when they do n't  . How can I make this particular movie honorable ? How can I make it true ? How can I make it worth peoples time and money ? <p> John : Going back to Raiders of the Lost Ark and the story conference , which people have seen the transcript of that , that was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's going to keep going on . Looking at that discussion you had , everyone is referencing the things that are so important to that , and the things they love . The serials are important to them . What if this character did this ? I want a character who can do these kind of things . <p> That was you guys forming the template in real time for what this whole thing was going to be . And it started with what do I love . What do I wish existed as a movie ? And that 's , I think , what we are urging him to write is that thing that he wishes existed . <p> Lawrence : Thats exactly right . And George and Steven are very strong that way . And you can see it all through their work . And Steven continues to make movies at an unbelievable rate . And its always for that reason , because he always wanted to make a movie like this , or he always wanted to make a movie like that . <p> And just forward movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying I want to do a scene like that . I want to direct a scene like that . <p> Craig : And that 's also how you end up getting to work on a franchise . You worked on that because of your work on Continental Divide , which is as far from a franchise film as it gets . <p> Lawrence : Yes . <p> John : The second half of his question I thought was really fascinating , too . Let 's speculate . If one of these franchises goes south , what will have happened that caused it to go south ? What will be the film or the series of choices ? <p> John : But I would speculate that if these franchises go south , its because either we go back to the well too many times . We sort of keep making the same movie too many times , or we sort of make desperate choices to sort of we sort of kowtow to sort of desperate choices for things . <p> Craig : Well , you see , sometimes as things start to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batman movies . It started with this fascinating Tim Burton take that was so wildly different than what we knew from the campy show on TV , although I love that show . <p> And what happened was each successive seemed to look backwards and say , " What was the stuff people liked about that ? More of that . " <p> John : Thats Charlies Angels 2 , by the way . I can tell you what a franchise looks like as it is falling apart . <p> Craig : I may be involved in one right now as were speaking . But they lose sight , I think , of what you were talking about . The essential nature of contrast . That the big and the loud needs the quiet and the soft . The thoughtful must be there for the explosions to be interesting . So by the time you get to Batman with a Nipple , its just noise . There 's no contrast at all . Sometimes I feel like that 's where and I suspect that this iteration of Star Wars , that lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with Han Solo . <p> Lawrence : What 's mystifying is that the people who are getting these jobs are really talented people . Youre knocked out by how sharp they are . And its not just technically . They love the form . They love the genre . And the weak link is and you know , effects , you just cant get any better . Effects are just getting better , and better , and better . But the weak link is always in the writing . And its always in what they leave in the movie . Which is the movies are always 20 minutes too long and they always have explosions you do n't  have any emotional connection to . <p> And its mystifying , because these are not dumb people . But there 's some culture of making these movies that they just feel they have to be bigger and louder than the last one . And that 's never the answer to anything . <p> Craig : Agreed . Maam ? <p> Female Audience Member : In the nature of contrast , across the span of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been your greatest evolution as a writer and what has remained a core truth for you as a writer ? <p> Lawrence : That 's a great question . I do n't  think I 've evolved at all . As you get older , and you cant believe how old you are , you say , " Why am I not wise ? " I 'm not wise . I honestly believe . But it turns out that you do n't  get wise . You get experienced . And you have more experiences to reference . And , of course , you start forgetting them , so <p> But , its only experience . So that when a new problem arises , you say , " Wait , this is very familiar to me . " And I remember panicking and acting like an idiot back then . Is there another approach ? And you know that you 're going to get through it . And the movie will come out and maybe forgotten . Thats what 's really incredible . <p> But , you know , about ten years ago there was an ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a guy , maybe you remember this . A guy walks into a desert motel and there 's like a stoned young woman behind punk woman behind the thing . And she says , you know , " $25 . " And he says , " What movies do you have ? " Its in the Mohave . <p> And she says , " We have every movie ever made . " This was ten years ago . And he says , " What ? " And that is the situation now . You can go home right now if you 've paid your bill , and you can access almost any movie that 's ever been made . <p> Craig : I do n't  think you even need to pay a bill anymore , frankly . Theres ways to just watch . <p> Lawrence : Oh , well I do n't  encourage that . <p> John : You get a young person with the Internet , yeah . <p> Craig : Of course not , no . <p> Lawrence : But everything is available to you . Its all there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also get the great books , but that 's so much harder work . But that is only of so much use , because you do n't  get that much brighter or anything . So you know I was pretty sharp when I was younger . And so I dealt with problems the best way I could think at that moment . <p> If I had that same problem now , it will be maybe 5% better because I 've had these experiences . You know , its a big surprise of age that you get there very quickly and the benefits are n't  that great . But you are very thankful every morning when you wake up . You say , " Oh , I get to have another day . " <p> Female Audience Member : Thank you . <p> Craig : Awesome . <p> Male Audience Member : First of all , of course , thank you very much . This has been very illuminating . A little left field question , Larry . What are your favorite TV shows and why ? <p> Lawrence : Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its become kind of a burden . <p> Male Audience Member : Thats why I asked . There 's so much . <p> Lawrence : Everybody says , " Have you seen this ? Have you seen that ? " And you 're 10 , 12 , 30 episodes behind . And you have to think am I going back to the beginning ? But they 're just endless . Its The Wire , and Sopranos , and Breaking Bad . And now its Better Call Saul , which is one of the weirdest wonderful shows ever made . And Silicon Valley . I mean , there 's just so many great things . You cant watch them all . And you cant say that about movies . <p> I mean , it used to be that in a year there would be five , or six , or seven movies that you 've got to see that movie . That does n't  happen anymore . <p> Craig : What are we down to ? <p> Lawrence : I 'd rather not say . <p> Craig : Sir ? <p> Male Audience Member : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending the Star Wars drought . It had been a while since I 'd been that entertained . But I wanted to ask , when I watched it it felt like I was reliving being ten again , right down to seeing a Death Star blow up again . Was there a conscious <p> Lawrence : Everything in it you mean . <p> Craig : I think he s getting to the question , is n't he ? <p> Lawrence : What you say ? <p> Male Audience Member : Was that the plan when you ? <p> Lawrence : No , in fact , I said to J.J. when we started , you know , let 's not have anything blow up at the end , you know . <p> Craig : Cut to . <p> Lawrence : But that 's a perfect example . My collaboration with J.J. which was pure it was heavenly . He s so funny . And so smart and good . And he s a good writer . It was a manifestation of something that I have resisted for years accepting , which is sometimes your collaborator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them about , they 're right . And sometimes you 're right . And if you have a good collaborator , they sometimes see that , too . <p> But you 're really lucky when you get to work with someone like that . So , now you say , " Did it need to end with something blowing up ? " Well , no . But it seems to work for a lot of people . But that does n't  mean that was the only ending . There was another way to go , and we discussed other ways to go . And there was a point at which we talked about it having a much quieter ending . And I think that would have been interesting , too . <p> You know , these things are not one way or the other . You know , what happens is , if a movie is successful and its good , the waters seal . And you never think about them any other way . That 's why if you ever get a DVD and it says " the deleted scenes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Lawrence of Arabia , the second greatest movie ever made , when David Lean added back the scenes that had bothered him for 40 years , they 're not as good as the others . <p> Now , I do n't  know if that 's truly the fact , or that when the waters closed , I fell in love with that movie . And when there was something added to it , it never seemed necessary or right or helpful . <p> Male Audience Member : Thank you . <p> Craig : Sir ? <p> Male Audience Member : Hi . Thank you . I can you pacing around the room before writing a big scene . And I was wondering , because I 'm a fan , how was it on the day that you wrote Han Solos death ? <p> Lawrence : He dies ? <p> Craig : Spoiler ! You have n't seen it , yeah . <p> Lawrence : My five-year-old grandson learned Spoiler Alert last week . <p> Male Audience Member : Oh , I 'm sorry . <p> Lawrence : And now he says it about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionally charged were talking about Han Solos death . I did n't  get to finish because these guys interpreted me . <p> Craig : Here we go . <p> Lawrence : After Harrison was hurt , luckily not too bad , he went away and eventually they ran out of things to shoot and they closed down for a while . And during that time , there was some rewriting done . But none of that explains what happened which is that Harrison came back and there was a kind of golden glow about him . He was totally comfortable . It was the most positive thing Ive ever seen in an actor . And he made every moment we reshot most of what little had been done before that , and he made everything perfect . He was so great to the young actors . And he was so great to everyone on the crew . <p> It was magnificent . And so when we got to him dying , and this was true when we had written it , it was very emotional for everybody . Everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a long time in the writing stages , you know . <p> I had wanted to kill somebody in Empire . And George did n't  want to do that . But I thought that would raise the stakes , and that we would know that you cant get away with everything in this universe . But that did n't  happen . <p> And at the time of Jedi , Harrison was ready to get out . He had an incredible career going and he had had enough Star Wars . And he said , " Kill me . " But George did n't  want to do that . And I did n't  even want to do it then . I thought the time was in Empire . <p> And when we told Harrison about this , he was 100% cool . Now , after this charmed experience , I think he had some feeling of like this was kind of great . <p> Craig : Unkill me . <p> Lawrence : Yeah . laughs But he never protested and he did it with great grace . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the grips , it was emotional . Because Harrison is a unique personality . <p> Craig : We have time for one more question . One more person . Perfect . <p> Male Audience Member : Its a question for each of you . When you look back , especially at the early parts of your careers , and if we take your writing ability out of the equation , we ignore that . <p> Craig : Thank god . <p> Male Audience Member : What is it that you think set you apart from other writers that made you the types of people that studio execs wanted to work with , that directors wanted to work with , that actors wanted to work with ? <p> John : I would say it was probably the therapist quality . The ability to really listen to what a person was saying , be able to echo back what they 're saying in different words that were constructive , and not seem like a not seem like a difficult person .

I think that its a combination of what these guys have said . First of all , what John said to me , you can say it about all of life .

@@42311629 @2311629/ <p> Is it necessary to have a film-related degree/course in order to break into screenwriting ? <p> A. Plange <p> No . The truth is , no great screenplay has ever sat unsold because the writer did n't  go through an acclaimed program . No writer has ever been denied the Oscar because he did n't  finish his masters thesis . <p> Frankly , a film degree is n't a prerequisite for any job in Hollywood , from actor to gaffer to studio chief .

All that really matters is whether you can do the job . <p> That said , I personally went through USC Film School .

This is n't cheesy , gross lets-swap-business-cards " networking , " but simple reality . You tend to help people you like , and people with whom you share a common experience . The " boot camp " aspect of film school can be important . <p> Is film school right for you ? It depends on your circumstances . If you 're still an undergrad , by all means switch to film .

@@42311631 @2311631/ <p> Since subtitlers are often the final writers on our movies , I asked Denizot to give an introduction to subtitling for screenwriters . <p> As a teenager growing up in France , I fell in love with both cinema and the English language . I used to videotape subtitled versions of British and American classics broadcast very late at night . Everything else on television was dubbed the dialogue replaced . <p> At the time , I could n't have agreed more with Gena Rowlands when she said , " I like subtitles . Sometimes I wish all movies had subtitles . " <p> It used to be very difficult to find theatres showing subtitled films in France , but theyve become much more popular . Today , most Parisian cinemas show subtitled films , and its almost a challenge to find dubbed versions of foreign films in the city . <h> Getting the words right <p> In this day of technology , when subtitles are all the rage and anyone can have a go at amateur subtitling , its easy to overlook how complex it is to subtitle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide quality subtitles . <p> The subtitling process goes as follows : <p> Time-cueing . This involves creating the captions ( in English ) along with time-codes . This part is fairly straightforward , but you need to respect shot changes and other constraints . <p> Translation . This is my job . <p> Simulation . The subtitles are checked in the lab with a proofreader and the client . In the event of a theatrical release , the distributor will pick their own translator , whereas in the video world it is most often the subtitling company which will subcontract a subtitler and handle the job . <p> Translating a film is just a long series of solutions to be found and traps to be avoided . <p> As a French speaker , I work from English into my mother tongue . This is a basic rule . A subtitler needs to have great ability in writing dialogue in his own language . He will also have extensive knowledge of the language he s translating from with all cultural aspects that go with it . <p> As with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet does wonders , but I also like to have a range of specialists I can contact . This job takes us from politics to sports and through all sorts of fields in no time at all . <p> Obviously , we are provided with the image , but also with a spotted list which provides explanations of puns , special intents in dialogue , etc . This detailed list is common for Hollywood films , but unfortunately , it is very unusual for indie films , in which case we are just provided with a simple dialogue list . <h> What you meant to say <p> In the business , we say a good subtitling is the one you wont notice . <p> We do n't  want people to feel like they 're reading . They should be enjoying the work of a director and actors based on a screenplay . The subtitling must be such that they can forget that they had to put their glasses on to read the captions . <p> I like to watch the film a couple of times first to really get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit so I can sort of work on the language side . What kind of register will I be using for these characters and this particular film ? Sometimes the process is completely natural if its a modern film which resembles my own sort of speech patterns , and other times it is a totally different world or era . <p> In subtitling , you 're going from spoken to written language that will still need to read as dialogue . What 's more , the number of characters per line you are able to use is very limited . <p> Our goal is to express as much as we can in the fewest , shortest words possible . Its a bit like crosswords : you 've got a definition but you can only have one word for it . It can be quite frustrating sometimes , but also very satisfying when you find just the right phrase after trying so many different ways to express the same idea . <p> Subtitling a comedy , for instance , is always tricky as it is so culturally charged . What will provoke laughter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtitling a screwball comedy once which had a running gag on the misunderstanding of Kant &amp; the c-word . I first thought it would be impossible to render puns based on pronunciation . And I was so happy and relieved when I came up with funny lines in the end using the name Kant . Very often , you will get your ideas whenever you 're away from your desk so its good to always be able to take notes at any time , just like any type of writer . <p> We often have less than three weeks to subtitle a film and time is paramount to come up with the best solutions . The good news is I work with subtitling software , so captions show up directly on the film . This makes it much easier to write and rewrite so that its readable . Rules are strict , but fiddling around is part of the job . The end result needs to be fluid and faithful to the original version , but also feel lively and natural . <p> For cultural reasons , French Canadian distributors get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recorded : one in Quebec , one in France . <h> In other words <p> Dubbing is a completely separate process from subtitling , which may seem strange . After all , you 're still translating into a language . <p> Dialogue for dubbing needs to fit the mouths , so to speak , of the original version . This is very far away from the constraints that the subtitler has to deal with . There is no way the subtitles could be used for dubbing purposes , and you cant use the dub for subtitling either : the dialogue would be much too long for the captions . Therefore , a film will have two sets of new dialogue , one for the subtitled version , one for the dubbed . <p> In the end , many subtitlers are happier talking about their work as adaptation rather than translation . You 're creating a version of the work that hopefully reflects the original intent , but meets the needs of the audience and medium .

Like its really scene by scene **28;482;TOOLONG , complete with suggestion of what dialogue is . And its kind of a pain in the ass to write those things . <p> But , I will say when you 're actually writing the script , its really , really easy , because so much of that thinking has already happened . So you know kind of what the structure of that scene is before you get to it . And so its just a matter of fleshing it out and making it really be a scene rather than be suggestions . So , that 's been kind of cool . <p> Craig : Yeah . I put myself through that torture on movies because I find that the feeling of not knowing where you 're going or not knowing what a scene should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of a very thorough outline . So , when I 'm outlining feature scripts usually I 'll get up to 25 pages of outlining , scene by scene . I just need to know it . That 's my thing . <p> John : With TV I had anticipated that there would be so much discussion and feedback on the outline stage , and I get why they do it because its a lot easier to talk about things as an outline . Its a lot faster to read the outline . But ultimately on those phone calls at some point you do end up saying , " Well , this will be really good when its actually a scene and were not talking about one sentence in this paragraph . " <p> So , you have to balance that out . But on the whole its been kind of fun to try it this way . <p> The other new thing I 'm trying this time is Im writing the whole thing in Fountain . So rather than using Final Draft I 'm using this unannounced Fountain screen editor thing that 's really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is developing that 's really good .

But , people will often tweet me and say , " Oh , what do you use to read scripts ? " And I 'll answer , I 'll answer " my iPad " or whatever . But the fact is I do n't  read nearly as many scripts now as I used to . And I 'm curious whether you still read scripts ? <p> Craig : I do . But I , laughs so I read scripts when I 'm sent scripts to read . You know , " Would you like to rewrite this ? " Ill read that . Or , " Would you like to work on this ? " Ill read that . <p> And I will occasionally also read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his script for A Walk Among the Tombstones which he is currently prepping to shoot , I think , in the spring . <p> Then , beyond that , occasionally I 'll read a script from somebody that says , " Hey , can you help me out and tell me what I should do ? " But , I do n't  read them recreationally because I hate reading screenplays . <p> John : Why is that ? Why do you think that is ? <p> Craig : Because screenplays are n't  supposed to be read . Theyre supposed to be shot . laughs So , the problem is , its a weird thing : the screenplay is a literary tool to make a non-literary thing . An audio visual work . And so its kind of a bummer to read them . And it requires more mental exercise than reading a novel because prose is designed to help paint the picture for you . There is no expectation that there is going to be a movie afterwards . So , its more fun to read prose . <p> Reading scripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , the other issue is because so many of the scripts I read Im reading with a purpose , you know , " What would you do ? " " How would you fix this ? " that its work . And I guess maybe the last thing I would say is because I spend so much time writing them you know , you spend all day long cooking steak , you do n't  want to eat steak for dinner . <p> John : I would agree with you . Its like I know editors who will spend all day staring at screens cutting a movie and they go home and watch TV . I 'm like , " How can you do that ? How can you keep staring at screens ? " <p> For me its that I cant turn off that part of my brain that wants to fix what I 'm reading . And so if I 'm reading a screenplay , unless its absolutely perfect , I will be noticing all the things that I would want to change in it . Ill be making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading it which generally is n't that helpful , or that good . <p> So , even if I 'm reading a script that 's on the Black List that 's really , really good , its very hard for me to go into that and not find all the things that I would do differently . Its just the nature of being in here . The same way I think many professional athletes have a hard time watching sports on TV . Youre used to playing the game , not watching the game . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : So , when you do read scripts though , Craig , how are you reading them ? Are you printing them out ? Are you reading them on an iPad ? How do you read scripts usually ? <p> Craig : Lately Ive been doing a lot of iPad reading . The bummer about reading the scripts on the iPad and this is going to sound like such a lame-o complaint , you know . Louis C.K . does this great bit about people complaining that they cant get internet on their plane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . " And so , you know , I feel embarrassed about this , but the iPad is a little heavy , frankly , to read a script on . It starts to be annoying for me . <p> Now , I ordered the iPad Mini and that thing is awesome . So , maybe it will be more comfortable to read scripts there . But I 've been doing most of the reading on the iPad . I will read a little bit on my laptop . I do n't  print scripts out ever anymore . <p> John : Yeah . I do most of reading script reading on the iPad now . I got my mom an iPad Mini for Christmas , and so when she was here for Thanksgiving I gave her the iPad Mini . I gave her the whole tour and talked her through everything . And I hid all the apps on the third page that she would never need to touch and I sort of simplified it as much as I could . <p> I loaded it full of photos of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , even if she never used it again . But while I had the iPad Mini in the house I did pull up some scripts as PDFs and looked at them , and its actually a really good size for reading screenplays . Its sort of everything I hoped that the Kindle would be able to do , in that its just a right good size , except its fast and you can look at PDFs and everything looks really good . <p> And its the luxury of screenplays that are 12-point Courier that they 're actually big enough that you can read them nicely and naturally in their normal size . So , I think you 'll enjoy the iPad Mini . <p> But which application are you using to read them in ? Are you just opening them up in mail ? Are you going to GoodReader ? What are you using for that ? <p> Craig : Well , it depends on the format . If I get it in Final Draft then I read it in I have both your app and the official Final Draft app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . If its a PDF I usually read it in , usually its in GoodReader . <p> John : Yeah , I 've been sticking with GoodReader . Stu Maschwitz , who also helped develop Fountain , strongly recommends PDF Expert , which I 've also tried . And its been sitting on my iPad for a long time . It just had such a generic icon that I never thought to actually use it . Its a little bit better for annotations I found . <p> GoodReader actually works really pretty well , its just that its really ugly . To me its like the Movie Magic screenwriter of PDF readers in that like there are just so many things crammed into every little nook and cranny . Its like , " Oh , we can add this feature . Let 's put a big button here . " Its a little bit frustrating to use . So , PDF Expert seems to be a cleaner version of that same kind of thing . <p> Craig : Yeah , I agree . It is ugly . And , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's actually a nice interface . Its very clean . <p> John : It is . Yeah . iBooks does n't  let you annotate the way you might want to annotate , but if you 're just reading a script its really good for that . <p> Craig : Yeah , I never annotate . <p> John : Yeah , I do n't  really annotate either . I know people who love to do that . I 'm just not a big annotator . If I do feel like I need to make changes on a script I do like to print . I like to print my own scripts once before I send something in just so that I can catch the mistakes on paper that I never catch on screen . <p> I 'm a big fan of printing two up on a page . And so you print smaller size , so its two its a horizontal page and you 're printing two pages side-by-side . Its just a way of saving some paper . <p> Craig : Oh , that 's interesting . Oh , by the way , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script out is if its my script before I send it in , because you 're right , there 's something about visually looking at each page that you catch errors that you would n't catch on your screen . But when you do the sort of side-by-side version do you also double side print ? <p> John : I do n't  . I do n't  believe in double side print . If I get a script sent from the agency and its already bound that way I 'm fine with it , but otherwise I wo n't double side print . I 've just never found that useful or helpful . <p> Craig : Yeah . I do n't  do it when I 'm printing for editing and corrections , but I do n't  mind reading a double When I first saw them I was like , " Oh god , " mostly because I just get annoyed by these pointless <p> Here comes the umbrage . Umbrage Alert ! We should have like a signal , a siren , like drive-time DJs for umbrage . <p> I get so frustrated by pointless gestures towards greenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send everything out on double-sided paper now . " Well , you know , paper is n't really a problem anyway and you sent a guy here in a car . You had a guy drive in his un-smog-checked 98 Tercel to drop your double-sided script off at my house . Just email it . <p> It just makes me The sanctimony of pointless gestures makes me nuts . <p> John : I agree with you 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Yeah . I think the better reason for doing the two-sided is that if you 're carrying a bunch of scripts with you they 're a lot thinner , and so it saves space when you 're shoving ten scripts in your bag . And that is a big advantage to double-sided for me . <p> Craig : True . <p> John : Now , the actual process of reading a script , because most of the scripts I end up reading tend to be for Im going to be sitting down with this person and I need to be able to tell them what I thought . And so for instance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so Ive read their scripts and I need to be able to talk with them about sort of the movie they 're trying to make . <p> And usually in that situation I 'm meeting with five filmmakers over the course of a couple different days . And I 'll have read all the scripts like maybe a week ahead of time . And so I find like , well , I need to be able to remember what it is . And so as I first start reading the script , as characters are introduced I will flip back to the title page and I 'll write the characters names down . And I 'll write the relationships to who they are just so that when I go back to the script I can actually remember " this is who is in the script . " And as I pick up the script again I can feel , " Okay , I can talk myself through this . " <p> If I have major notes that are about the script overall I tend to write those on the title page . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fold down the pages and sort of scribble them on the page so I can talk to them about specific things that are happening in scenes . <p> So , that 's just some guidelines for reading scripts for your friends and reading scripts for people you 're going to need to give notes to . <p> John : Of course I 've done the Myers-Briggs . Come on ! A test that shows me why I am the way that I am ? Yes . <p> Craig : laughs Now , what did you come out as ? <p> John : I think I was an ENTJ . <p> Craig : ENTJ ? <p> John : Which at the time I would n't have guessed I was an extrovert , but the last 20 years Ive become much more extroverted . <p> Craig : Yeah , I would n't , I mean , its a funny thing , like , introvert/extrovert . I know this is a side topic . Because I used to qualify myself as an introvert but I think that was really a pose . Frankly , I 'm incredibly extroverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like : where do you get more jazzed from , interacting with people or being alone ? And while I love being along and I enjoy being alone , I definitely get more jazzed being with people . <p> And the only reason I ask is because you have such a very specific Your approach to the world is very process-oriented . You have a specificity of process that is remarkable . Because most people just do n't  have , laughs , they do n't  have such a like the fact that you 've got literally your folds and everything . And I was just wondering , like , where does that fit into that whole matrix ? <p> John : Yeah . I think there is some process in there that comes up . Its also just a matter , though , an experience of being in the meetings where I did n't  have those kind of notes and stumbling , like , " Argh . " And then you look over and you see Susan Shilliday who has all of these pages folded down and she 's having these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do what shes doing . " <p> So , really its observation and copying more than anything else . So , I picked up the meme of how you do those kinds of things . And a lot of what we do as screenwriters , I think , is observing , figuring out how it works , why it works , and then copying it in a way that is useful . <p> Craig : Oh , absolutely . In fact , I was talking about this with Todd Phillips the other day because the two of us are so , I mean , frankly were OCD , I think , about screenwriting . And because when were making changes on the set , you know , the guys who just come in , we block the scene out , we talk through some dialogue , we want to make some changes . When we make those changes we also change the action lines . <p> And that 's silly on one level because the guys have already come in and done it . There 's really no point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point because theyve already gone through the motions . They know what the motions are . They know where to stand , when to move , when to pick things up , and when to shoot a gun . <p> But we still fix it because we are obsessive and I actually feel like that level of obsession is important . I feel like if you do n't  have it , I do n't  know if you can be a good screenwriter . It seems part of the fabric of what we do . <p> John : Yeah . I do understand your point because really once you know what you 're going to do , you 're going to shoot it on film and the script is basically irrelevant at that point . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : Like , yes , the editor may see it , but no one is ever really going to notice or care about that , but you will notice and care about that and you want the script to accurately reflect what you shot . <p> Craig : Yeah . I mean , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill over onto an A page , because we hate that . Its just so weird . <p> John : laughs Yeah , but I get that , too . <p> So , for people who are n't  screenwriters whove gone through production , when you 're shooting a script you lock the pages . And by locking the pages that means if you need to change stuff you can just print out the new pages and they will slide in . And so page 88 will always be page 88 . <p> But if you add too much to page 88 that it would spill over to page 89 , instead of going to page 89 it goes to page 88A . And Craig and Todd do not want that to happen if they can possibly help it . And I completely understand . <p> Craig : Yeah , its annoying . <p> John : So , you will slightly cheat the margins on some dialogue blocks so that it wont pop that next eighth of a page . <p> Craig : Oh , and see , and the funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession is that we refuse to do that . So , then we start , I mean , there have been times where the two of us have looked at each other and said , " You realize were now making the script worse because we do n't  want an eighth of a page . " <p> John : Thats where you start removing the participle endings on verbs , so that things will shrink back down . <p> Craig : Or you start looking at your writing partner and you say things like , " Do we need this line ? You know what , yeah , let 's not make the page break that makes us get rid of a line . " But , I do n't  know , anyway , I 'm sorry ; Ive taken us off into a crazy direction , but there 's something about the specificity of the way you were describing that just made me think I 'm loopy today , anyway . So , there you are . <p> John : Yeah , on Big Fish it really is actually important because were continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in staging I have to immediately change it in the script , and we have to change it in the score because it has to always match exactly because we are doing it again night , after night , after night , and with completely different people . And so theoretically we are creating these two documents , a script and a score , that anyone should be able to take and mount the musical . <p> And so it has been really strange where , you know , I 'm like , " Well , I like the page the way it is , but I do need to change it now because it does n't  accurately reflect what Edward is doing at that moment . " Its been really interesting and strange to see how that works . <p> Craig : Yup . <p> John : And so when we were going through the workshop I was printing new pages all the time and every day we were having to put out revisions for things that were really trivial , like most people in the ensemble would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were changing it because it more accurately reflects what were actually doing . <p> Craig : Exactly . Yeah , OCD . <p> John : OCD . <p> The next thing I want to talk about is sort of an industry thing , which is one-step deals . And so , I can describe one-step deals , do you want to describe one-step deals ? I mean , I feel like <p> Craig : Yeah . Its a short a quickie description when we get hired by a studio to write a script they basically hire you to write a draft . And you 're commenced on the draft , you write the draft , you turn the draft in , and that 's called a step . <p> When I started working , when John started working , traditionally you were hired to do two steps , so that 's two guaranteed steps . You write a draft , you turn it in . They give you notes , you write another draft , you turn it in . And they must pay you for those two drafts . <p> Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still want you to work on stuff there is pre-negotiated fees and each one of those options is essentially the studio can or can not engage them . And they are also pending your availability . <p> What happened about , I would say six years ago it really started to crop up in a big way , was that the studios started doing away with the second guaranteed step . Suddenly they were doing one-step deals where you were hired and you only had one guaranteed step . So , after you turn your first draft in they can say , " Bye . And were not paying you for , " and the second step became optional suddenly . <p> And the Writers Guild Collective Bargaining Agreement does n't  guarantee you anything more than a minimum of one step . And so the studios went from this over-scale two-step guarantee down largely to a one-step thing . And that 's where we are today . <p> John : So , I will pretend to be the studio person who is defending or arguing for why one-step deals are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I will try to express it . <p> So , one-step deals are good because if a writer delivers a terrible draft were not stuck with that writer for a second draft . And we can move onto a new writer . Or , sometimes we just decide , " You know what , we do n't  really want to make this movie so were not wasting any more of our money or our time on this project that we do n't  even want anymore . " And so its a way for us to maximize our development budget by not spending any more for a script than we really want to spend . And maximizing our development time by focusing on projects we really want to make and not the projects that weve now lost interest in . <p> Craig : And , you know , that 's a perfectly good argument and I think it actually applies fairly well to writers who make a lot of money . I understand it . Where my rebuttal to you , studio executive guy , would turn on newer writers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these newer writers to one-step , first of all , you 're not saving that much money because they do n't  make that much money , and the second step is less than the first step normally . And also , I should add , that agencies typically add a little extra onto the one-step because its only one-step . <p> So , the amount of money you 're saving is trivial to you and your development budget is $100,000 for the first step and $60,000 for the second step . The $60,000 is not going to change your life . That 's about as cheap as a draft can be in this world . <p> The bigger problem for you when you limit everything to one-step is this , Mr. Studio Executive : You have ceded all control to your producers . The producer knowing now that they only have one shot because there 's only one draft that 's going to be turned in and they do n't  make money unless the movie gets made will grind that writer down to a nub . They wo n't just write one script . Theyll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is obsessive about polishing this thing to a shine before they turn it in , because they only get one shot . <p> And while you may say , " Who cares ? Not my problem . That 's the writers problem , " it is your problem . Because the producer is now overdeveloping this material , likely in a way you would n't even like . So , what you 're getting is an overworked , committee-ized piece of crap . Thats problem number one for you . <p> Problem number two and now Mr. Studio Executive I 'm going to ask you to do something that you do n't  like doing . I 'm going to ask you to look into the future and I 'm going to ask you to think long term now , not about today or tomorrow even though you 're worried you might not be in your job in a year , think about five or ten years from now . Part of the job of screenwriting is learning how to deal with studio notes . We write a draft , we turn it in . We get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we engage in a dialogue and hopefully come up with a synthesis that results in a second draft that everybody likes . <p> If you take that away as a routine part of our job , no one is going to really learn how to do that part of the job very well . There are writers out there who are suffering because your method of employing them does n't  let them learn how to do the job properly . Who will be the people writing your movies five or ten years from now if all you do is burn through a succession of people , giving them one step and yanking it away ? <p> My argument to you is : stick with one-step deals on people who are making a lot of money per step . I get it . But if you 're dealing with people who are making close to scale , its frankly unconscionable . They end up working on so many drafts that they 're far below scale per draft when all is said and done . And they do n't  even get a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just came up with another problem for you , Mr. Studio Executive . All the writers that are doing one-step deals , because its only one step , you know what they 're doing while they 're writing your script ? Looking for their next job . So , now you have an employee with divided attention . And you know how you guys have made it really , really hard to get jobs ? So while they 're writing your one draft they 're also doing pre-writes for their next potential job . <p> Its a big mess . <p> John : So , again , I 'm still a studio executive guy . So , here 's what I like about one-step deals . I know that writer is going to work his ass off because he only gets the one shot . I 'm sick of writers who are not delivering on the first draft . Well , you know what ? They better deliver because otherwise they 're not going to get their second step . So , when I gave these writers second steps , do you know what they would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time because they knew there was more money coming . <p> Now they do n't  know there is more money coming . They know that this is their one shot and they better write a damn good draft or else , tough , hit the road . <p> Now , listen , there are times where I am going to , you know , were going to read the script and like the script may be close it might not be exactly what we want but we can see what the movie is , and then well obviously go onto the writers second step . We do that all the time . <p> So , for you to say like , " Oh , the producer is grinding him down , " well maybe that 's good , and maybe the person is learning a lot from all that experience of working on the script . <p> But what you 're talking about , like the writers are going to be looking for their next job ? They 're doing that anyway . I get so sick of when I find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other pitches on stuff , when I know that I have them . They should be writing my movie . So , that 's already happening , Craig . <p> Craig : Thats happening , but not quite under the compressed time scale . I mean , you cant have it both ways , Mr. Studio Executive . I mean , either writers are working hard on your stuff in a compressed one-step manner , or they 're doing it in the same lollygagging pace as two steps . And if its compressed and they 're working really , really hard , then yeah , I do think then going out to find other things is going to impact their lives . <p> I should also point out that when you say they 're going to work really , really hard to give you a script that you like , what they 're going to do is work really , really hard to give you a script you like . They 're going to deliver the safest , most expected thing possible because they only have one shot . <p> What I guarantee you they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your expectations because they cant afford to . They 're going to have to deliver the safest possible thing . And if that 's what you want , that 's what you want . But I got to tell you : you look at the movies that do well , you 'll never be surprised by anything . You 'll never get that new franchise ; you 'll just get the expected old same old , same old . <p> John : You know who I like to work with ? I like to work with writer-producers . I like to work with the guys who , some of them came out of TV , they 're people who write but they also produce , because I can talk to them , and they have professionalism . And I can tell them what I need and they will tell me when they 're going to hand it in and its going to work . <p> Those are the people I like to work with . And I do n't  know why there are n't  more people like that . <p> Craig : I do n't  know why there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be that way myself . That 's how I view myself . Its possible Im just thinking about some of the writer-producers I know , that all of them came of age in the era of two-step deals , when they learned how to deal with things . laughs And they learned what was real . And they were allowed to fall , and stumble a little bit and get up , because they were trusted . Its hard to give trust when you do n't  have trust . <p> Its hard to work in an environment where you 're told ahead of time , " We do n't  think that you 're going to make it . " So , if you want to engender trust , and you want to have people that understand how the process works , perhaps let them engage in the process past the point of one mistake , or one failure , or one trip or stumble . Certainly they wo n't come back to you . <p> And when they do succeed other people will be knocking on their door . Why would they answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is saying , " Yeah , we always trusted you . Come stay here . " <p> John : So , I 'm going to resume being John August here again . My experience with one-step deals has not been great . I 've done very , very few of them . And when I took my first one I had sort of heard all the standard warnings . And I was like , " Oh no , it will be fine because I like the people involved ; its all going to work out great . " <p> And it did n't  work out great . And what ended up happening , which is I think what happens under most one-step deals , is its not really one step . You 're essentially writing , and you 're writing , and you 're writing , and you 're writing to please the person who you 're directly dealing with . And at a certain point you 're like , " Okay , you know , its done . " <p> And they would say , " No , no , but remember , we only get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keep working on it , let 's keep working on it . " Like , " Okay , I 'll do a little bit more , I 'll keep working , we 've got this one step . I want to make you happy . " Because writers , we want to make people happy . <p> But eventually it comes to this point where its like its been six months and so I 'm saying , and now my agent is on the phone with the producers , and were saying , " We have to turn this in . " It essentially becomes a situation where you just never deliver . And you 're pretty confident that the studio has actually kind of already seen it and they 're really sort of getting extra work out of you . <p> And what 's happened is you have poisoned this relationship that you had with these producers who you liked otherwise , but all your enthusiasm for the project has died because you 're writing to please this phantom studio who you do n't  even know what they actually really want . <p> If I 'd been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in that script we could have said like , " You know what , is this the movie that we all want to make ? If its not , let 's have a conversation and see if there 's another movie that we all want to make . " But because we never actually turn it in , it becomes this mess . <p> And so that 's my experience as an A-list writer . But its that way , I think , kind of for everyone working on these projects . You never deliver . <p> Craig : Yeah . That 's the point . I mean , that 's why they do it . They 're trying to game the system . And even in your very accurate impression of a studio executive you 're cutting right to what they 're saying , " We trying to game the system . Were figuring out a way where we can save money in the expectation of failure , " which is very corporate and classic risk management . And , you know , I do n't  begrudge them their risk management , except for this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game risk . This is Hollywood . Were not here to grind out 4% return on investment . <p> Its show business and were gambling . And were gambling to try and find those breakout hits that cost $30 million to make $500 million . Or even were gambling on the big budget that 's $200 million that we think is going to make $500 million . This is n't safe stuff where you 're , I do n't  know , you 're pre-selling foreign so you cover your negative costs and the rest is gravy . <p> Get out of the business if you cant handle a little bit of risk . And what they do is they try and eliminate risk by saying , " We presume you 'll fail . We do n't  like writers anyway . We do n't  trust any of you . You 're all lazy , so one step , and well yank it from you . But we wo n't really yank it from you because we know that the producer , who we may or may not even like , does n't  get paid a dime unless this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And well see what we get . And if we like it we like it , and if we do n't  we do n't  . Really all were doing is trying to get a star to sign on , and then a director , and then we have a movie , and then well hire a real writer to do it . " <p> John : Yup . And that rewriter <p> Craig : Its a recipe for disaster as far as Im concerned . <p> John : Yeah , and that rewriter might be the writer-producer or someone else who comes in , like the finisher . And when I hear that discussion I really do think TV showrunners , that that person that the studio trusts to be able to deliver them the thing that they need to deliver . And that 's why I keep coming back , I think we 've talked about this before : Its frustrating that there 's not a feature equivalent of like the showrunner training program that the WGA has that teaches TV writers who are about to take over and run their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is this uniquely weird thing . <p> And I feel like the feature screenwriters who are getting movies into production who are doing that big giant tent pole work , that is a unique special thing , and I think we need to find a way to sort of teach people how to do that job and how to do the best version of that . <p> Craig : Well , this is where I have to kind of be guilty because , you know , Todd Amorde , who is one of our excellent Member Services people at the Writers Guild , has talked to me and to Billy Ray about creating that very thing . And I 've been sort of after it for years . <p> And just the past few months I 've been incredibly busy and I just havent had the time , I do n't  know . And its been a little bit of a struggle to try and figure out how to structure it . So , maybe you and I can do this as a little side task and figure out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know its something the Guild wants to do . <p> And what I do do is every year <p> John : You said " dodo . " <p> Craig : I said " dodo ? " Yeah , I know . What I laughs You know , this is one of the most human moments from you . Its so unexpected when you 're immature . I love it . It makes me happy , it does . Because I always feel like I 'm the goof , you know . <p> So , what I do do is once a year I do a basically two-hour seminar on surviving and thriving in development and production as a screenwriter . And its really about strategies . Its not about the writing at all . Its about dealing with people , notes , process , doing it in such a way that you actually that your position as the writer improves through the process rather than when it normally degrades . <p> And that 's been very successful . I 'm going to do it again , I think , in March . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training program . <p> John : It occurs to me that the different thing about the TV showrunners program is its really clear , like , " is this person going to be running a show ? " and therefore like , " Okay , well then they 're in . " And the litmus test for sort of LONG ... is a little bit trickier . <p> My first thought , and I may reject this thought , is that you should actually just ask the studios , like , " Who do you want to see go through this program ? " Because in a weird way they kind of know who they feel like is going to be those writers who they want to sort of go through there . And those are the people they may want they may already have their eye on , like , " These are the young women and men who we feel are going to be the next batch of writers were going to be going to for this production work . And we want these people to go through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its not a bad thought . I think that <p> John : If you got studio buy-in I think it would be helpful . <p> Craig : The other challenge beyond the criteria for who participates is the television showrunner program has certain nuts and bolt stuff that really can be taught . How to hire a staff . How to deal with the fact that writers are now your employees . How do you fire them . How do you deal with assigning tasks to a room . How do you work as a go between . How do you deal with actor deals and casting . <p> There is so much going on . And for screenwriting there 's a bit less , but sometimes I feel like its almost trickier because we do n't  have that producing title , typically . And yet I believe that if a screenwriter does her job correct she could be as powerful as , if not more powerful than , the actual producer . <p> John : Yeah . Yeah . The topics are , you know , they are different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some of the other things that you would normally be going through . But its very much it tends to be more anecdotal . I think you 'd have to be bringing in a bunch of other screenwriters to talk through , " These are the scenarios I 've commonly found . This is how you deal with the situation where the big , the A-list actor has brought you in on the project but the director really does n't  want you there , and how do you negotiate that ? " <p> Or , " Theres a conflict between the studio and the director and you are supposed to somehow bridge this impossible divide . " 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : Thats the kind of stuff that you need to know how to deal . And while it ca n't be taught I think it can be shared . <p> Craig : Well , you know , that 's a great idea right off the bat for a portion of this training would be " man in the middle . " How do you deal with being because you are so right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very powerful thing to do . You become incredibly useful beyond the work that you 're doing . And frankly , I hate to say it , but its important . Its not enough to write well ; you need to be indispensable beyond that . <p> Because a lot of times nobody really knows what good writing is . Not always , but a lot of times . A lot of times what keeps you around , and what keeps you engaged in your primary mission which is to write the best movie you can , is to be indispensable in other ways as well . So , that 's a good idea for a class . <p> John : Great . Well , let 's move on and talk about a very big movie that John Logan wrote called Skyfall , which you just recently saw , and I saw like two weeks ago . <p> Craig : sings Let the Skyfall , when it crumbles <p> John : sings Let the Skyfall . <p> So , I really enjoyed the movie . Sam Mendes directed it . Sam Mendes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the Bond movie . I 'm like , " Well that 's a giant mistake because the Preacher movie is going to be awesome . " But you know what ? The Bond movie was really , really good . I really enjoyed it . Did you enjoy the movie , Craig ? <p> Craig : I did enjoy it . I guess I should ask first before I go into it : Are you a I 'm a big Bond fan . I love Bond movies . What about you ? <p> John : I 'm a big Bond fan , too . And I grew up with , especially the for whatever reason the Sunday night before school started in the fall there was always a Bond movie on ABC . And so that was really my exposure to Bond was watching the ABC cuts of them . <p> So , the Spy Who Loved Me is sort of my entryway to it . So , my first Bond movies were the Roger Moores but then I did go back through and got all my Sean Connerys and Lazenbys . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig : Yeah . As have I. And very typical for guys our age to have started with the Roger Moore and then go backwards to Sean Connery . <p> I thought that it was a very successful Bond movie . Ill talk about what I did n't  like , because its a smaller portion , and then I 'm going to talk about what I really liked . <p> John : And let 's just put a spoiler warning here . <p> Craig : Oh spoilers . Yes . <p> John : Were going to have some general spoilers here . So , do n't  you can skip ahead if you 've not seen the movie . <p> Craig : Yeah , I wont give away too much . I 'm just going to say I really enjoyed the character of the villain . It was a bit reminiscent of Sean Beans character from GoldenEye , the sort of disgraced former agent come back as a baddie . I did not like his plot . Even for Bond plots it was nonsensical . <p> I understood his goal . I understood his motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bizarre and it existed solely to service set pieces , which were very good set pieces . <p> John : Yeah . It was the problem of , like , somebody who has a nuclear device and they 're using it to rob a bank . It just does n't  the scale of what he was able to do did n't  make sense with what he was actually trying to do . And , granted , that 's actually kind of a trope of the Bond movies overall , but I felt like if he had this personal vendetta he had many better ways to enact his personal vendetta . And we did n't  need all the set pieces were kind of irrelevant for that . <p> That said , it was a Bond movie , so you cut it this giant bit of slack because that 's how these movies work . <p> Craig : I agree . I agree . There 's an element of camp to it and you forgive some of the Rube Goldbergian nonsense . <p> Heres what I loved about this Bond movie . First , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually Bond movies typically are theme-less . This is something that I 've got to tip my hat to Nolan , because I feel like Christopher Nolan has revived an interest in proper theme in big action movies . And the theme here is articulated by Albert Finney towards the end when he says , " Sometimes the old ways are best . " <p> And this movie was very much about the old ways and about the old Bond , and the notion that while we could sort of go on and chase the people that exist because of us , like say the Bourne franchise , which is sort of hyper-realistic , were not going to . You know what ? Were going to go be ridiculous Bond because that 's what we are . And ridiculous Bond is old school . He himself is dealing with aging issues . M is dealing with aging issues . The entire spirit of MI6 is called is called into question as being antiquated . <p> You have this new Q who is essentially putting down the entire thing as ridiculous and something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thematically the whole movie held together on a thematic level better than practically any Bond Ive ever seen . <p> There were some great retro set pieces . The Komodo Dragon fight was like right out of the 60s . I loved it . And the last scene where he walks into that classic office with the leather door and Ralph Fiennes now as M boy , really into spoilers here and Moneypenny . <p> And you know what I have to say , laughs , and again I always feel like I get in trouble by being sexist , I just somehow , I was , like , how brave of them oddly to just embrace and not worry about people going , " Oh , its sexist . " Yes , of course , Bond is sexist . Its a sexist franchise . Its porn for men without boobies . Sometimes it has boobies . <p> But , there 's a female secretary that 's hot for him . And there 's a man in stuffy leather office who gives him assignments . And he goes and does it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm very excited for the next one because of that . <p> John : I think the Christopher Nolan Batman movies is a good reference for it , because I think what it did , like the Nolan movies , is it took the irreducible elements of what James Bond is and rearranged them in a way that could make a new movie . And you 're not really aware of it through a lot of it . It just seemed like a really good , like a much better , more competent Bond movie . And then you get to that bizarre fourth act , which really is a fourth act . <p> The movie kind of should have stopped at London when the villains plot was foiled , and then we go onto Scotland and to all this new stuff , and all this back story which does n't  really exist , in the film canon at least . <p> And we have this completely different movie that 's happening there and yet it feels kind of right . And were burning down the right things . We 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying his car . Were destroying his mother , or his mother figure . Were introducing Albert Finney who is just some other person who is sort of representing Sean Connery , I think , from the original franchise . <p> Craig : They even thought about casting Sean Connery . <p> John : Yeah , so I just really enjoyed what they were able to do . And it was one of those rare situations where you leave a movie excited for where it puts you next . <p> Craig : Exactly . Exactly . In the way that by the way , Casino Royale excited me . Because I thought Daniel Craig did such a great job , and that movie was really good . It was a really good Bond movie and I loved the physicality of it and the way that it updated it without losing its connection to old Bond-ness . <p> And then because of the issues involving MGM , they just werent able to capitalize on that wonderful start that Casino Royale had . And I feel like with this one they 're back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie . <p> And by the way , one other thing I should mention about the canonical issues , there was an interesting essay and this is total Bond nerd stuff but there had been this kind of debate . The question is : Is James Bond actually James Bonds name ? Or is that a code name that agents use , and in part would explain why there continually are new James Bonds ? <p> And this movie sort of says , no , no , his name is James Bond . And you just are meant to understand that there are different people playing him . <p> John : Yeah . Its almost the " no one recognized Bruce Wayne is Batman . " <p> Craig : Right . You just go with it and that 's that . <p> John : Thats part of the premise . <p> Craig : Yeah . I really liked it . And I do think that Skyfall , the theme song , is a really good song . Its really good . And , you know , the wonderful tradition of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , we had lost it for so long . Bond songs were hits . And this is the first one in forever that 's a real hit . <p> John : So , I taught myself to play it on the piano . And its actually very simple , and it goes through the classic sort of its in A-minor , it goes through the classic sort of Bond chords in a very smart way to use it . But I did find it actually mashes in really well with For Your Eyes Only . Because For Your Eyes Only goes down to a single note , and if you transpose it so that single note is the sings " da-da-da-da , " and you can guild it back out to this . <p> So , its a really great song and it just made me happy for Bond themes again . <p> Craig : Yeah , it was great also in that moment where they pull the Aston Martin out to go back to the classic or actually I think it was the moment where they blew up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme , which I love , you know . And I love the way that Skyfall worked that theme in of the sings classic Bond theme , that little chromatic thing that they do . <p> And its a great song . And even the lyrics are terrific . <p> John : Yeah . Adeles , sort of marbles-in-her-mouth sometimes bugs me a little bit , more so than many other songs I sort of felt that , and yet I did kind of love it all the same . <p> Craig : I do n't  recognize that she has marble mouth . Give me an example of marble mouth . <p> John : Marble mouth is just so weird . There are some words where its like if you did n't  really kind of know what she was saying , its like , " What word are you making there ? " <p> Craig : Eh , yeah . Well , you know , singers sometimes change vowels to make it sound prettier . But , you know , I just like that Skyfall is where it starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poles apart . " And just the whole idea of the crumbling down and Skyfall is where we <p> John : Yeah . Its the romance of apocalypse , which is great . <p> So , from that exciting news , we should get to our One Cool Things . I know your One Cool Thing is not actually cool at all , but its <p> Craig : Well , there 's a cool part to it . <p> John : All right , so you go first . <p> Craig : Okay . Well , its One Tragic Thing . Don Rhymer died this morning at 3:30am . You know , when you guys listen to the podcast it will be probably a week later . <p> Don was a screenwriter and television writer . He worked from pretty much the second he landed foot in Los Angeles all up until maybe two months ago when he was just too sick to go on . He s written everything he wrote on , sitcoms like Evening Shade ; he wrote big huge hit movies like Rio . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my officemate . We shared an office for awhile and then I got the office next to his . <p> So , even now his office is next to me . Obviously the lights are out and he s not coming back . And he battled cancer for years . And I 'm saying this in part because he was my friend and I loved him and I miss him , and you want to talk about that when somebody that you care for dies . But there 's something instructive about it , too , and something good . And that is that Don lived a great screenwriting life , and if that sounds a little odd all I can say is he took the worst this town can dole out , and it doles out some tough stuff . <p> I mean , he was knocked around by some of the meanest and most ridiculous in this business , and he never fell down and he kept on coming . And he was the same way when he got cancer . Just indomitable and would n't back down and would n't quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And we sometimes feel as if we feel we have the right to be precious about what we do .

And Don never forgot that . And he was a professional a professionals professional . And I 'd like to think that I could have the kind of career and continue the way he did . <p> Never once did Don ever say , " This job is beneath me . " Never once did he ever say , " I 'm too good to work . " Never once did he question anything . You got the feeling that they could n't get rid of Don if they tried . And not that they ever did . <p> I will miss him greatly , and once I hear from his family I 'm sure there will be a charity that they 're going to ask donations to go to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I have that information I will get it to you and you can put it online . <p> John : I never had a chance to I think the only time I really had a chance to talk with him was at Christmas parties , and sort of like other sort of social gatherings of screenwriters . And when I found he had cancer , Don started a blog about his cancer treatments called Let 's Radiate Don . And so I 'll put a link up to that because its really funny . And you would n't think that going through lots of chemotherapy and different surgeries would be funny , but he managed to make it really funny . <p> And so over the time he was getting treatment we had several emails back and forth and I just talked about how much I dug what he was doing . And I kept wishing him the best . <p> Craig : Yeah . That blog is sort of an example . I mean , the guy was a writer . And when you 're a writer you will write through anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of understanding what 's even happening to you . And I guarantee you that there were days when Don was in pain or nauseated or in despair and he was taking his time in his OCD way , the way you and I are , to edit those posts before sending them out , just to polish them off . <p> John : To find the funny and make sure <p> Craig : Yeah . And that to me , that 's so honorable . Its just there 's an honor , I think , in doing this kind of work if you do the work . And he lived that way . And so my hats off to him . <p> John : Well , Craig , thank you very much for a good podcast . Sorry to end it on a sad but also kind of hopeful note . <p> Craig : Yeah . And hopefully no one else will die within the next week . <p> John : Yes , that would be a very good thing . So , thanks so much and I will talk to you next week . Bye . 
@@42311634 @2311634/ <p> Discover Magazine has a list of eleven Rules for Time Travelers , which seems pertinent given the double whammy of Lost and the new Star Trek . <p> I 'm largely on board with most of their recommendations , particularly the idea that there are no paradoxes . I 'm not talking scientifically here I honestly have no idea how to crunch the numbers to prove this point . But in terms of fiction , and screenwriting in particular , I 'd argue you need to actively crush any talk of paradoxes or impossible conundrums . They will grind your story to a halt . <p> I did a little work on Minority Report , a Scott Frank adaptation of a Philip K. Dick story which is enjoyable for its combined Frank-Dickness . Minority Report does n't  deal with time travel , but rather its pushy cousin called precognition knowledge of the future .

So for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were absolutely , unquestionably going to do it . Which seems impossible . <p> I argued that you could n't just answer those questions when they came up .

And that 's an understandable change : you want your hero to feel in command of the facts . ) <p> In any script , look for scenes in which characters answer questions , and try to find ways to take the questions away . Often , that means backing up five or ten pages , well before the audience has started to formulate their concerns , and finding a way to visualize ( or better yet , physicalize ) the problem . <p> The first Jurassic Park does this well , with the animated science lesson setting the ground rules and chopping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first acts of most horror movies are largely devoted to creating situations in which the characters cant simply escape or call for help .

Not so cool is that even with my new attitude , I still run into some pretty tough roadblocks . <p> One example : At a pitch meeting at the studio I previously sold something to , I pitched out literally every scene , every arc , every relationship , specific jokes and set pieces , acting out whole chunks of dialog .

@@42311652 @2311652/ <p> Like several million people worldwide , I saw Spider-Man 3 this past weekend . And like a substantial percentage of these viewers , I got frustrated by the number of unlikely coincidences in the movie . <p> There 's nothing wrong with coincidence , per se . Almost every movie is going to have some incidents where one character just happens to be in the right place at the right time . In fact , many movies are built around a " premise coincidence . " In Die Hard , John McClane just happens to be in the building when the villains attack . That 's okay . McClanes being there is part of the premise . Likewise , in the original Spider-Man , Peter Parker just happens to get bitten by the radioactive spider . No problem : it would n't be Spider-Man otherwise . <p> The premise coincidence is one flavor of what I 'll call a Fundamental Coincidence : an accidental confluence of time , place and motivation which greatly impacts the story . <p> In a romantic comedy , when The Guy would have proposed to The Girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted the wrong way , that 's a Fundamental Coincidence . In the first Spider-Man , Norman Osborn just happens to be transformed into The Goblin just as Peter is becoming Spider-Man . That 's a Fundamental Coincidence , but we accept it because it feels true to the genre . <p> Flint Marko happens to fall into the sand pit at exactly the moment the scientists test their billion-dollar Dyson vacuum.1 <p> Flint Marko happens to have been the man who killed Uncle Ben . ( A retcon . ) <p> Eddie Brock happens to be the only person in the church at the moment Peter tries to get rid of the black suit . <p> Any one ( or two ) of these Fundamental Coincidences would probably go unnoticed , particularly in a superhero movie , where credibility takes a back seat to spectacle . But put together , they make the plot feel rickety , particularly when you factor in the large number of what I 'll call Minor Coincidences things that do n't  fundamentally change the story , but feel convenient all the same . <p> The police chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he s known the details for some time , apparently . <p> Sandmans first attack just happens to coincide with Spider-Man getting the key to the city . <p> Eddie Brock is newly arrived at the Daily Bugle , and wants Peters job . <p> And Gwen happens to be at the fancy restaurant on the night Peter wants to propose . <p> Again , you could have several of these coincidences in any movie and no one would mind . Its largely expected that familiar faces will become imperiled in a summer action movie , so #5 feels right . Likewise , the eventual discovery of Venoms weakness is accidental , but that plays into the genre . No foul there . <p> My point is not to rip on Spider-Man 3 , but to urge readers to look at their own scripts with an eye towards coincidence . If you 've written a treatment , search for the following phrases : " at the same time , " " accidentally , " " luckily , " " unfortunately , " and " meanwhile . " They 're often a tip-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a better alternative . <h> Causality trumps everything <p> Given a choice , try to find cause and effect . One event happens because of something else we 've seen ideally , something the hero himself has done . <p> Instead of having the hero accidentally overhear a key conversation , get him actively trying to listen . Or have an interested third party steer him in that direction perhaps for his own reasons . At every juncture where a reader could ask " Why did that happen ? " , try to have an answer that is n't , " just because . " <p> Although there are some convenient twists in the Harry Osborn plot ( amnesia , for starters ) , the causality is clear : the New Goblin wants revenge on Spider-Man for killing his daddy in the first movie.3 It does n't  feel like coincidence that Harry is flying around on his hoverboard . With two other villains desperate for scenes , the timing might not be opportune , but its clear why its happening . <h> Look for correlation <p> Rather than ask an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them together . <p> In Heroes , imagine if each character had a completely unique origin story : Claire got her powers from a shaman ; Sylar is an alien ; Peter has a magic ring . Youd get frustrated pretty quickly , because a lot of screen time would go towards explaining why and how . Instead , the creators wisely decided the characters all had some mysterious gene mutation activated by an environmental change . The audience is willing to make that one big leap , 4 because they 're not asked to make similar leaps each time a new character is introduced.5 <p> For Spider-Man 3 , I do n't  have any magic answers on how to correlate these disparate threads other than trimming one out , which would n't be a bad place to start . But had the script dropped on my desk a month before shooting , here are a few thoughts I would have put out there in terms of the many coincidences : <p> Both Venom and Sandman are forms of disembodied consciousness that control their host subjects people and sand , respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while a meteor shower feels like an event that needs a superhero . <p> Could this meteor shower overlap with Markos transformation or escape ? Even if its just in the background , it makes them feel more united . <p> Could Spider-Man be pursuing Marko at the start ? <p> Could we see the symbiote choosing Peter , because he s the strongest creature around ? <h> Chop it out <p> Often , the best answer when faced with a nagging coincidence is just to remove it . <p> Do we really need the Uncle Ben retcon ? It does n't  have a lot to do with Markos sick-daughter motivation . <p> Couldnt Eddie Brock already be a stringer for the Daily Bugle ? If he and Peter already have history , great . <p> Does Gwen Stacy need to be Peters lab partner ? <p> Do we even need the police chief ? <p> Again , my point is n't to rag on Spidey , but to urge reader-writers take a hard look at the role of coincidence in their own scripts . <p> Some coincidence feels genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friends at the mall . And surprise in general is a good thing catching your reader off-balance is a worthy goal . But if a significant portion of your plot depends on chance , that 's a good indicator somethings not fully baked . The best time to tackle these problems is in the outline , asking yourself not only what happens next , but why . <p> Its never clear what they 're supposedly doing , or why they would n't have , say , a lid on the pit . Or a videocamera to monitor the experiment . ? <p> Revealing both of these points of information in one piece of dialogue was a particularly bold choice . ? <p> I kept waiting for Peter to point out that Harrys dad was a psychopath , but oh well . ? <p> Note that both the D.C. and Marvel universes do have multiple , often conflicting means of empowering their heroes and villains .

@@42311653 @2311653/ <p> My question concerns the use of character names in screenplays , specifically , should they be capitalized throughout the script wherein they are actually in a scene , or should they just be capitalized when they are first introduced ? <p> This is really driving me crazy as the screenplays I have read adhere to the capitalization throughout , the logic being that the actor can see at a glance that their character is in a scene if the name of the character is in capitals . Indeed I was taught this as well in a University Degree in screenwriting . But I have had feedback from some producers who say this is wrong . Brendan <p> In stage plays , the characters names are generally capitalized throughout . In screenplays , characters names in the scene description are capitalized only when a character first appears in the script . ( And by capitalized , I mean in all caps , like MIKE or BOB . ) <p> Yes , Ive seen exceptions to both rules , but I think the conventions make sense and should be followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DENTON is 29 , with a mullet haircut and pit stains . If your drink takes more than two kinds of liquid , Bobbys not your man . <p> Subsequent mentions of Bobby , in this scene or later , would not be capitalized . One possible exception ( which came up in BIG FISH ) is when a characters age changes so much that it obviously involves another actor . In that case , you might capitalize YOUNG BOBBY the first time the five-year old version is introduced . <p> I cant tell you with any certainty how stage plays and screenplays evolved to do things differently . One theory might be that in a stage play , its very important that an actor enter a scene at exactly the right time , thus the rampant capitalization to make it more apparent . ( In fact , stage plays often use " small caps , " which are a point size smaller than the regular typeface , just to make it more readable . ) <p> In movies , on the other hand , its often very important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly because scenes are often filmed out of sequence .

I 'll get to see the film for the first time on Monday , and really look forward to it . <p> With that clarification out of the way , let me explain a strange fact of my career : I 've not written Alice in Wonderland three times . Its a recurring motif . <h> 1995 <p> The story that became Go was originally envisioned as a retelling of Alice , substituting the underground rave scene for Wonderland . As it developed , I pretty thoroughly scotched those ambitions , but you can still see vestigial elements in the first section of the film : <p> Ronna , like Alice , charges boldly into unknown territory , and proves unexpectedly brave in the face of strange events . <p> She visits a smoking psychedelicist who talks in riddles but ultimately helps her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A talking ( telepathic ) cat offers advice . <p> Other than the cat , these are all extremely tenuous connections .

For example , the yellow Miata was for a long time a white Volkwagen Rabbit . <h> 2000 <p> Shortly after the release of Go , producer Paul Rosenberg brought me to E3 to introduce me to American McGee , who was working on a videogame adaptation of Alice . The world he had come up with was dark and spectacular . American and I hit it off so well that two hours later we were pitching a movie version to director Wes Craven . <p> Craven said yes , and Miramax bought it the next day .

I 'd always been aware of it as a potentially-competing project , but now my Alice would be going up against the guy who had directed my last three films . It did n't  matter that our takes were wildly different ; the world did n't  need or want two pricey Alice in Wonderland movies . <p> The day the strike ended , I called Sam Mendes , the studio , the producer , and my agent .

@@42311658 @2311658/ <p> Continuing my efforts to blog less about the profession of screenwriting and more about the craft , I thought I 'd offer up some thoughts on dialogue . As with my earlier post on How to Write a Scene , this is n't an exhaustive tutorial by any means . But its at least a guide for how I do it . <h> 1 . Listen to how actual people talk <p> We all watch movies and television , which is chock full of dialogue : good , bad and inane . One might think it helpful to listen to great actors speaking great words . Its not . In fact , it will probably screw you up . <p> Its like trying to paint landscapes based on how other artists paint landscapes . The best you can do is a crude approximation . In order to paint a great landscape , you need to get your butt out in the cornfield and paint what you see . There 's really no alternative . <p> Fortunately , the world is full of dialogue cornfields . Sitting at Fatburger for lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two women in their 60s clucking about how small the hamburgers were . Far more important than the content of the conversations was the flow , the back-and-forth . We tend to think of dialogue as a tennis volley , with the subject being hit back and forth between speakers . But when you really listen , you realize that people talk over each other constantly , and rarely finish a complete thought . <p> To get a sense of this flow , you need to stop paying attention to the actual words being spoken . Its the auditory equivalent of un-focusing your eyes . Listen for which speaker is dominating the conversation , and how often the other party chimes in to acknowledge he s still paying attention . ( " Uh-huh . " " Yeah . " " Really ? " ) Questions are often not phrased as questions , and in real life , no one speaks with exclamation points . <p> How often should you eavesdrop ? Pretty much constantly , with particular focus on finding interesting speakers . Some people are inherently funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can recreate them on the page fairly faithfully . But even the annoying woman ahead of you at the checkout line deserves a listen . You never know when she might come in handy . <h> 2 . Figure out the flow of your dialogue <p> Generally , before I put pen to paper , I let the scene loop in my head 10 or 40 times . Those first cycles are silent , but eventually characters begin to talk . Based on what needs to happen in the scene , its often pretty clear wholl be saying what . But figuring out the flow the how , the when , the why takes time . You can rush it , but you 'll often end up with too many words in the wrong order . Or worse , you 'll end up with characters talking at each other rather than with each other . <p> So imagine watching your scene , but in a foreign language with the subtitles turned off . What does the talking feel like ? What 's the emotion behind the words ? Whos in control ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage a scene speaking only faux-Chinese . That 's what you 're looking for at this stage . Not the words , but the texture . <h> 3 . Pattern out the information <p> Conversations in real life are often empty ( " these burgers are too small " ) , but movie conversations almost always involve an exchange of information ( " the fingerprints do n't  match " or " I 'm not sure I ever loved you " ) . Your job as a writer is figuring out how your characters would tell each other the information . <p> Let 's say Bob needs to tell Mary that her dog has been eaten by a python . As the writer , you need to decide not only what facts Bob knows , but how he s anticipating Mary will react to the news . This will determine not only how he starts the conversation ( " Say , you were talking about how you wanted to get a new dog , right ? " ) but every subsequent decision along the way . <p> Of course , as the screenwriter you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ; your primary focus is getting that information to the audience . The challenge is to do the latter while pretending to the former . So if its slipping a bit of exposition in a joke , or staging an altercation to reveal a piece of backstory , find a way . <p> Bad dialogue tends to spray out information in every direction , whereas smart dialogue sneaks the facts in while you 're otherwise entertained . <h> 4 . Write the scribble version <p> The scribble version is the very rough draft of a scene , devoid of formatting , punctuation and other garnishes . My scribble versions tend to be largely dialogue , with an emphasis on the overall flow rather than finding le mot juste. <h> 5 . Write the nice version <p> Once you have the blueprint for the scene , its time to go back and start worrying about getting each word right . Great dialogue has a melody to it , and achieving that is probably unteachable . But you can write pretty good dialogue simply by reading each line aloud , over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different composition . <p> Movie dialogue is how characters would speak if they had a few extra seconds to compose their thoughts between lines . Its just slightly optimized . But its very easy to overshoot and end up in soap opera land . Keeping dialogue real but efficient is one of the hardest challenges in screenwriting. <h> 6 . Ask : Are characters listening , or just speaking ? <p> Once you have the scene finished , take a look back and make sure your characters are n't  just speaking because its their turn . That 's a common problem , perpetuated ( I believe ) by the prevalence of exposition-heavy crime dramas . <p> BOOTHE <p> Two campers found the body in a culvert five miles down river . <p> GARMAN <p> Toxicology shows arsenic in the well . <p> BOOTHE <p> Looks like we got ourselves a serial killer . <p> While actors could probably pull this off as a conversation ( with a lot of head nodding ) , its not hard to get Garman listening and responding : <p> BOOTHE <p> Two campers found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get the toxicology back <p> GARMAN <p> Just came . Arsenic in the well . <p> BOOTHE <p> Looks like we got ourselves a serial killer . <h> 7 . Ask : Is there a shorter version that works as well ? <p> Many times , the best way to improve dialogue is to cut it . Once youve let a scene sit for a while , revisit it with a red pen and look for what could be cut . If a piece of information is n't essential , it should probably go . And a joke is n't worth it if you 've had to break the scene to achieve it .

" When it happens , its because some directors ( 1 ) believe they can write and ( 2 ) believe they can fix the perceived problems in the script . They may say they want to " make it their own . " But underlying that is the fact that there 's something about the script that bugs them , and you have n't been willing or able to address it . <p> Youve been ( much ) more than generous by doing a ton of free work backed by a $1 option . 1 Based on the option agreement you signed , she may already have the right to bring in another writer , including herself . If so , you 're not going to improve the situation by creating a fuss . Be as supportive and constructive as you can . <p> Maybe shell surprise you and make some great changes . Remember : directing is a performance . Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some directors cant make sense of certain scenes . If she can recognize and correct for her weak spots , the movie will ultimately benefit . <p> If you 're not happy with her revisions , let her know why . Be specific and non-defensive . If you feel the script is really going off the rails , you may just have to hope she does n't  get the movie made and you 'll have the chance to let the option lapse . <p> At that budget level , you do have some potential protections . It may be a little late to insist on one of the WGAs Low Budget Agreements , but keep them in mind for next time ; it could help protect your credit and back-end money . And with the dollar figures so low , you 're right to insist on greater creative controls . Do n't  agree to further option extensions without both a conversation and a contract specifying how its going to work going forward . <p> Bill can do this free work because he s presumably not a WGA member , and the producer is n't a WGA signatory . ?

This has the potential to make you very popular with sound men ( or editors , or cinematographers , etc ) , something you 'll need when your only currency is good will. - Second , when you begin producing your own work , this renaissance approach to filmmaking will allow you to start before anyone else signs on. - Knowing you can finish in a pinch , if you have to , will lend you a confident relentlessness that makes others want to get involved . <p> This went on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could never stay settled for long. - Two years was my maximum. - <p> I took some of my films to film festivals. - I won some awards , lost a lot more , but did n't  find much use in festivals , except once , early on , when one of the festival programmers took me aside and said , " Your film was not quite good enough , but I fought for it anyway , because I think you 've got something. - Its not there yet , but there 's something .

@@42311664 @2311664/ <p> Over the weekend , my friend Rawson came to visit the bambina , and we talked about the script he s writing . He said he was about to start his next draft , which was mostly character tweaks . He was unsure how to go about it . <p> I said , " Decide out what you want to accomplish , then figure out which scenes would need to change . " <p> He seemed to think that was pretty good advice . And the more I thought about it , the more I agreed . <p> The biggest problem with most rewrites is that you start at page one , which is already probably the best-written page in the script . You tweak as you go , page after page , moving commas and enjoying your cleverness all the while forgetting why youre rewriting the script . <p> Instead , you need to stop thinking of words and pages , and focus on goals . Are you trying to increase the rivalry between Helen and Chip ? Then look through the script actual printed script , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen and Chip .

It does n't  have the same flow as writing the first draft . But fixing your script is n't that different than fixing your car . If the stereo was busted , you would n't start at the tailpipe and work your way forward until you got to the dashboard . Youd rip out the stereo , figure out what was wrong , and replace it if you could n't get it working . Then you 'd do the same for the headlights , the shocks , and the windshield wipers .

If you do n't  know what you 're doing when you try to fix your car , you might be stuck taking the bus . With a screenplay , you always have the old version saved on disk .

@@42311667 @2311667/ <p> I 'm at the stage where I 'll hopefully be meeting with managers , agents , and producers . As a writer/director , what should I expect from these initial meetings and do you have any advice , or pitfalls to avoid ? <p> SamLos Angeles <p> Meetings are a crucial part of a professional screenwriters job . Even when you 're not pitching a specific project , you 're basically pitching yourself as someone worth hiring in the future . So you 're right to be thinking about what you should say , do , and wear . ( In fact , I 've already addressed that last point . ) <p> Let me briefly lay out the structure of every first meeting I 've had in Hollywood . <p> The meeting is set for 10 a.m . You get there at 9:55 . An assistant asks you if you 'd like anything to drink . The proper answer is , " A water would be great . " 1 This phrasing makes it clear that her request has been heard and appreciated , and that you have n't mistaken her for a waitress . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that the agent/executive/producer is running a few minutes late . This is completely expected . Entertain yourself with your iPhone or copies of Variety laying nearby . If the assistant is nearby and does n't  seem particularly busy with some other task , engage in conversation . There 's a pretty good chance this assistant will run Hollywood someday , so it never hurts to be friendly . <p> When the Big Man calls you in to his office , try to figure out which seat he likes to sit in . Generally , you 're safe sitting on the couch . If its a two-chair situation , you might as well ask , " Do you have a favorite chair ? " Because if you sit in his spot , you 're just starting the meeting off on the wrong foot.2 <p> While engaged in this conversation , listen for the word which signals the end of the period : " So . " <p> As in , " So , tell me about the kinds of things you write , " or " So , let me tell you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make . " At this point , judging begins . If its mostly a listening exercise , be ready to restate his points in different words , preferably with insightful analogies to successful movies.4 <p> If he s asking you to talk , say three smart things . Then get him talking again . <p> EXEC <p> So , is that the kind of thing you mostly want to write , is thrillers ? <p> YOU <p> Thanks . Yeah , I love thrillers . I mean , I love all genres , but what 's great about thrillers is you get to do the **character work setting up motivations , ** you get the **puzzle aspect of plotting , ** and **real stakes. ** With comedies and dramas , you get one or two of those , but thrillers are the whole package . <p> EXEC <p> I had n't  thought of it that way . <p> YOU <p> You take a movie like Collateral , and it can be funny and tight and dangerous . <p> EXEC <p> I worked on Collateral . <p> YOU <p> I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a book ? <p> This process will continue for ten to 20 minutes , at which point he may pull out a buck slip5 listing all of the companys open writing assignments . ( Or in the case of agent/managers , a list of studios and development companies . ) After a little more discussion , he thanks you for coming in . <p> This is your signal to stand , shake his hand , and leave . Say goodbye to the assistant . Remember to ask if you need to validate . <p> If there 's any specific project you talked about , follow up the next day with an email . If you do n't  have his email address , its fair to call the assistant and ask if you can email her ( the assistant ) something for the boss .

By the time I was taking meetings for Go , I was pretty unflappable , even in the face of egregious behavior . <p> My overall advice is to not freak out over any given meeting . Pretend its just having coffee with somebody who went to your same school . Unless you 're pitching a specific project , do n't  approach it with any particular expectation , and its likely to go fine . <p> You may also ask for a Diet Coke . These are the only beverages you can be reasonably assured will be on the premises , and not a hassle leading to frustration or extra work . Back in the day ( say , 1999 ) , you could also ask for a " Snapple-type beverage . " But no one drinks Snapple anymore . ? <p> Meeting with multiple executives is an extra-credit situation , and generally necessitates asking about who sits where . ? <p> Only appropriate if the meeting is on Monday , and the movie did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points if you can include movies he s worked on . Box-office disappointments are okay , particularly if there are praiseworthy aspects . ? <p> A buck slip is a piece of heavy paper cut down to roughly 4+10 inches , which is often attached to a script in lieu of a typed letter .

Videocassettes were initially expensive , beyond what an average consumer would pay , so they sold mostly to mom-and-pop video rental stores and chains like Blockbuster . Videocassettes became cheaper to produce and DVDs cheaper yet which led to a market for sales rather than just rentals . <p> Studios love selling movies on DVD and Blu-ray . Their libraries become valuable assets , waiting to be tapped . With each new technology , and each new directors cut , they can reissue and resell old titles . <p> One problem , though : rentals are still around . <p> Rentals have always relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charlies Angels , they can rent it as many times as they want . Obviously , Blockbuster would prefer to buy that copy for $5 rather than $100 , but the price is n't what makes it legal or illegal . <p> The studios , like the novelists , would rather have buyers than borrowers . When Warners seeks to create a 56-day window between when a movie becomes available for purchase on DVD and when its available for rental at Redbox , that 's a studio talking about their goals and policies , but not necessarily reality . <p> First-sale doctrine means that Redbox/Netflix/whoever can simply buy a DVD and rent it out . They may not be able to buy it directly from Warners , or at the price theyd like , but theyll be able to get it . Theyll buy them at Wal-Mart if they have to . <h> Where it gets murky <p> When talking about DVDs , were talking about atoms are n't  we ? <p> Its easy to argue that the digital information on a DVD is essentially software , and anyone who 's installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may constrain what were allowed to do with it . The laws regarding these clickwrap contracts are head-spinning , but most of us just click Accept and move on . <p> So far ( at least to my reading ) , none of the Hollywood studios have been able to convince the courts that a DVD is an analogous to a " license to watch " a movie . DVDs are treated like books , available to lend or rent or re-sell . <p> I do n't  think first-sale doctrine is going anywhere , at least for physical media . Try telling Americans that the DVD they bought at Target ca n't be loaned to their brother . Its a non-starter . <p> Many DVDs sold in 2012 will include a bonus UltraViolet copy . Does first-sale doctrine apply here ? To the degree any consumer understands UltraViolet , I doubt theyll think of " ownership " in the same way they do with physical media . Its a practical issue as much as a legal one ; if users can barely figure out how to get the movie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to lend it . <p> Its not hard to think of other legally-murky situations regarding first-use doctrine : <p> In an effort to combat Chinese piracy , let 's say Paramount floods the Chinese market with low-cost Transformers 2 DVDs . Could an American retailer simply buy them up and bring them back to the U.S. , dramatically undercutting the price ? ( This is a major reason for DVD region encoding . ) <p> As screenwriters , what would we like to see ? <p> Like I said at the outset , if the film industry ca n't make money , were out of job . The same holds true for grips and gaffers and wardrobe PAs . <p> But for screenwriters , home video matters even more directly : our residuals for home video are simply a percentage of the distributors income . Bluntly , the more they make , the more we make . <p> From this observation , we can derive some principles : <p> We make more from DVD sales than DVD rentals . If Redbox buys one copy of The Hangover 2 and rents it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one copy sold . <p> Netflix streaming is worth more than disc-by-mail Netflix . Traditional Netflix buys just enough DVDs to meet its users needs , then mails them around forever . On the other hand , when studios license movies to Netflix ( or Amazon , or other online streaming outlets ) , screenwriters take home a small percentage of that money in residuals . <p> In digital , rental is n't a bad thing . When someone rents a movie through iTunes , that transaction generates residuals . Because the price point is fairly low , the money were bringing in is fairly low compared to selling a DVD but its more than the $0 we would have gotten if that same person had rented the same movie at Redbox . <p> We make no money on pirated copies . <p> This last point is important . My hunch is that a 56-day window will just push more users towards illegal downloads . <p> First-sale doctrine will seem like a luxury when you 're making zero sales .

Of those that fail , 40% of never get a single dollar . Across all categories , more than 7,000 projects ( of all types ) have been funded . <p> In terms of film , some rough numbers : <p> 1,700 successfully funded projects . <p> $15 million in pledges so far . <p> 3,000 live projects on the site as of this posting . <p> 12 projects have raised more than $100k , six of them films . ( Four of those were docs . ) <h> How can I succeed in fundraising on Kickstarter ? <p> Of the projects that are funded : <p> 1 ) Most have a great video . <p> For a good example , check out I Am I. If you ca n't manage that level of entertainment , keep it short 60% of people stop watching videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to expectations . <p> For example , if you 're offering a DVD , ask for an amount close to what a DVD costs . No $125 tote bags . Aim to foster emotional connections to your project by offering personalized art or experiences associated with the film . Screenings , posters , credits , background roles , etc <p> 3 ) Filmmakers have strong communities . <p> The bulk of support will come from those who know and love you . That support will spur on those that follow you online and the size and reach of that support will determine how many stumblers you get . In most cases , there is very little support from strangers to strangers on Kickstarter . Count on people you know or sorta know . <p> 4 ) They reach out in the right ways . <p> Direct email ( and definitely not mass email ) is by far the most effective way to secure backing . Facebook comes in distant second with Twitter barely registering . It 's too noisy . Tone matters ! You 're not asking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're offering participation in the process of making it and in many cases something tangible , too . <p> 5 ) Keep the fundraising time window short . <p> Thirty days is the sweet spot . Longer does not mean more . Longer means procrastination . Urgency leads to action . <h> How much should I ask for ? <p> Be realistic based on the size of the community you have access to and what you 're able to offer them in return for their participation . Make your goal the floor of what you need to get your project up and running . Most projects that get funded get 125% of the ask . <p> The average pledge is $70 . The most common pledge is $25 . Factor in costs of incentives into your budget and make sure you fulfill the experience by producing everything you promise . <h> What if I do n't reach my goal ? <p> You do n't get any of the pledged money . BUT ! If you think you 're not going to make it you can ask people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entice more or bigger participation . <p> You can always try again . <h> What about taxes ? <p> Kickstarter does n't advise individuals on how to handle their tax responsibilities and does n't report financial information to the IRS of the backers or the askers . <p> This is pretty much the extent of Matts notes from the meeting . If you have further questions about Kickstarter and indies , ask . Well try to get answers for you . <p> UPDATE 4/21/11 : Yancey Strickler wrote in to correct numbers about how many projects have hit $100K , and the average pledge amount .

In fact , you can easily schwa the yer at the end : FYE-uh . <p> In a song built with a lot of soft rhymes1 ( e.g. UP/DUST , UP/ENOUGH , BREATH/MESS ) you could choose to match up THE FIRE with almost anything ending with an EYE-uh pattern , including PARIAH , MESSIAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , but they 're options . <p> In fact , Perry is already using THE FIRE as a soft internal rhyme with THE TIGER . And she soft-rhymes LION with I AM . ( Blurred Lines does the same thing with LUCKY/HUG ME . ) <p> My point is that there are actually a lot more choices for matching -IRE than you might realize . So <h> Let 's find some rhymes <p> When you eliminate words that would never make sense ( FRIAR , BRIER ) or already contain FIRE ( MISFIRE , DEFIER , PACIFIER ) , RhymeBrain gives us 20 interesting choices for making this work : <p> DESIRE is the only perfect rhyme , but I like the other choices better . <p> If we want to replace FIRE in the second line , were looking for six syllables , so well need to create a phrase that ends with our rhyme : <p> THE FIGHT AND DESIRE <p> EACH DAY FLYING HIGHER <p> STRONGER AND WISER <p> THAT LIGHT GROWIN BRIGHTER <p> AND ILL NEVER TIRE <p> SINGING WITH THE CHOIR <p> IN BATTLE ATTIRE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> FOREVER OUTSIDER <p> Let 's also consider the rhythm of the line .

But I think they fit the hole just fine . <p> I 'm not claiming any of these suggestions are the right choice . But most of them are better than saying FIRE twice . <h> Why it matters ( if it matters ) <p> Look , Katy Perry has a bunch of Grammys , while I only have one Grammy nomination for a ridiculous ( but catchy ! ) jingle sung by melting animatronic puppets . So I get that its presumptuous for me to be offering to fix perceived flaws in her tremendously successful song . <p> here 's the thing : Katy Perry will never see this post , but other songwriters might .

I was blatantly ripping off another site called The Setup , where they talked to people mostly creative , geeky people , technology people about what computer programs they use , what hardware they use , and what they like and what they do n't  like . <p> I did the same thing for my daily work habits , which is where I write , when I write , the hardware I use , the software I use . I get a lot of those questions piecemeal , and so I decided I would put them all in one post and put them all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is how I 'm putting together my daily work . <p> I thought I 'd go through the audio version of that with you right now . I 'm going to start interviewing some other screenwriters about their workflow , and I have three of them lined up already . I have you here on the speaker , so I thought I might ask you about the stuff that you 're working on . <p> So : what is your daily workflow ? When do you start work and when do you stop work ? <p> Craig : It depends on what the task of the day is . If I 'm in the mode of breaking a story , then I 'm kind of I 'm pretty loosey-goosey about it . If I 'm working with somebody , then it really is an external imposition . Be here at this time , let 's sit down for two or three hours , and work it through . <p> If I 'm on my own , I just wait until that moment happens where I feel the level of procrastination has gotten insufferable , and then I try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jam in a days work in two hours , which often works . If I 'm struggling at my desk , I 'll go take a walk , and if I 'm struggling on the walk , I 'll go take a long shower . Whatever it takes to solve the story problems , I will do in a very fluid way . <p> John : I know you have an office , which we talked about in previous podcasts as an important way to get out of your house and to get focused on work , but do you travel ? In my post , I was talking about barricading . And I 'll often go to some city a lot of times its Vegas , but this last time , last week , it was Boston and lock myself in a hotel room and just generate pages . Is that something that 's helpful for you ? <p> Craig : I 've never done it . But it sounds cool . Anything , I mean , the value of that , it would seem to me , is that it jars you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of ask a writer , " What is your routine ? " when so often , routine is the enemy of creativity . So , I love that you kind of do that . And I try and find my own ways of jarring myself out of it . Sometimes I will join the rest of the ranks of struggling screenwriters out there and go sit in a coffee shop and let the white noise of the chatter force me to kind of get going . <p> Anything that works , I guess , is my philosophy . And it seems like you kind of have to change it up every now and then . I mean , even you , even if you have a set pattern of " I go somewhere and barricade myself in a hotel room , " its a different place . So , you know , its not always the same place . I think that 's smart . <p> John : Well , with the advent of the iPad and with laptops and that stuff , its just , its so easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last trip , I took my laptop just in case there was , like , a huge disaster on the website that I needed to address , but I ended up never opening it at all . And I saved the iPad for only doing Facetime to call home . <p> And so , my structures I set for myself is , I can only be writing or I could be reading on my Kindle . And I 've got , like , the $79 cheapest Kindle that cant do anything other than , like , show you a book . And it ended up being a good combination of bouncing back and forth , because I was either focused on this specific scene , or was reading this book that I kind of wanted to read for a long time , but when I got tired of reading that book . I was back to doing the actual writing that I needed to write . <p> Craig : Yeah , you know , you 're talking about this incredibly important aspect of the solo writer , which discipline . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing that is difficult , annoying , psychologically taxing at times . <p> Inevitably , once you get going , the momentum takes over . And there is a real momentum to this . There is a momentum to not writing , just as there is to writing . But to jar yourself out of one state into another requires some kind of traumatic intervention . And part of that is eliminating all those things that keep you from not writing . <p> People who have partners , of course , they do n't  really have this problem . I mean , I like working with other people as much as I can , because it relieves the burden of the self-discipline . <p> John : The nice thing about Big Fish , the musical that were working on , is that Andrew Lippa , the composer , he and I have to get things done at a certain time . And hell be depending on me to write the scene that the song goes in , and I 'll be depending on him to write the song that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a social pressure to actually get stuff finished . Which , as a solo writer , you just do n't  have as much . <p> So , we end up having to set either artificial deadlines for " I will not go to sleep until I 've written five pages , " or if we end up promising things to producers or studio heads or whoever else , that we will turn in a draft by a certain date , even if its an unrealistic date , so that we will feel pressure to get stuff finished . <p> Craig : Yeah , you need something like that . I mean , one of the things I 'm doing right now is producing an animated film , and talk about all hands on deck . I mean , that 's such a bigin animation , development really is production . So , there 's already scores of people working on this thing . And knowing that , you really ca n't mess around . A lot of people are sitting around waiting . <p> That 's why writing during productions the most fun on live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that in about 10 minutes , they 're going to be rolling . And the adrenaline does wonders for writing , so its like , somehow or another , you have to make your own adrenaline when there is no external pressure on you . <p> John : I like to pretend that I 'm actually writing not a feature but a TV show and that its a pilot that 's going to be shooting in three weeks . And that is , sometimes , its a good kind of pressure , because it forces me to be a little less precious about it . " This scene must be perfect in every way , that has to be the best version of this scene that could possibly ever exist . " No , it actually has to be shootable . And as long as its shootable , I should go on and write the next scene . Thats sometimes a luxury . <p> Let 's talk about hardware . What are you writing on these days ? <p> Craig : A MacBook Pro . That 's my axe . 15-inch screen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why not have the biggest possible screen ? " But then , you 're like , the things like an airplane tray , its just too big . So , 15-inch is great . And then , when I 'm in my office , I plug it into a cinema display and an external keyboard and a track pad . So , that 's my tool . <p> John : Now , have you gotten used to Lions use of track pads and , like , the scrolling in reverse and all that ? <p> Craig : You know , its funny , I was just thinking about that today , because I have . It took , they said , " Thisll take two days for you to realign your brain . " No , it took a month . But I am definitely realigned . And , its funny , I was watching Todd today , because he s not on Lion and he s scrolling the other way and his , it was freaking me out . <p> So , its true , your brain does finally switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  because , for a month , I would go the wrong way , and then go , " Oh yes , right . " And then go the right way . But now , yeah , I 'm totally good . <p> John : When I got back from a trip in Boston , I 've been using both my MacBook Air which has a track pad in there for the Lion scrolling which makes a lot of sense because a track pad and that kind of scrolling makes very good sense . It feels like you 're pushing the paper around but my main computer is a MacBook Pro tower and I use a special , bizarre , vertical mouse that has the little track wheel and for that its always felt completely wrong to be doing the Lion-style scrolling . But for whatever reason I got back from Boston and I had n't  used the computer in a week and it felt right to use the Lion scrolling , and so suddenly I can do it . <p> Craig : Its an amazing thing how we can retrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freaks they 're like , " Look , people are moving their hands one way on an iPad and they 're moving them another on a computer and that 's a problem for us . Were just OCD and we need everybody to be moving their fingers always one way . " I do n't  necessarily buy into the whole " Its better this way ! " Its not , its just a direction . But once again Apple wins . <p> John : They basically did it to confuse my mom . My mom will probably call me in tears at some point because they 've changed and ruined and broken something . <p> Craig : " John , the pages are moving the wrong way every time ! " <p> John : If I could only get her to just give up her computer and go to an iPad I think life would be so much happier but they scare her too . Were all basically tech support for our parents at some stage . <p> Craig : Yeah , my father-in-law is the best . My father-in-law famouslyI got him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and years ago . I think it was in the pre-Jobs phase . I think it was in the Performa era and they had these little reset buttons on them in case things would go wrong . He told me they had a problem with the computer , it was n't working anymore , and I had to fix it . <p> So I came in and basically what I discovered was that he had somehow , this was back on System 9 , he had managed to create He had a system folder , of course , but inside the system folder was another system folder and inside that one was yet another system folder . <p> So he had nested system folders , which I 'd never seen before , and obviously I 'm booting off of another disk at this point , and also his reset button had been jammed in to the point where I had to physically pry it out because it was constantly resetting the computer . <p> I said , " Bill , how did this reset button get jammed in violently ? " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Well , I know . " laughs <p> John : I remember there was one era of Macintosh where the reset button was actually a clip-on thing on the outside of it . It fit into the little grooves on the track . <p> Craig : I remember it well . <p> John : Wow . Things are so different now . <p> Craig : So different . <p> John : Now , software-wise were doing very different things because I 'm mostly using Final Draft and you 're mostly using Screenwriter , or at least you have been . <p> Craig : Yeah . At this point I 'm almost completely bilingual both mentally and in practice because Philips uses Final Draft and this animated movie uses Final Draft , so I 'm Final Draft with those projects . Then this thing I 'm writing for Universal is just I 'm on my own so I 'm using Movie Magic . <p> Although I have to say I got a tweet the other day from this guy in Toronto who built this new screenwriting app called Fade In which I think it looks fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some features I thought would be easy enough to add . I 'm actually going to get on the phone with him because I love this thing . I just think , " Wow , here 's a chance where I could actually get in literally on the ground floor and help a guy get a third better way out there . " <p> John : Now , I believe I 've tried every screenwriting app out there . If I remember Fade In correctly its probably based on Adobe Air . Is it both on PC and Mac simultaneously or is it just a Macintosh program ? <p> Craig : There is an app for PC and also an app for Mac . <p> John : So I think my objection to it was that because its using Adobe Air there 's a little bit of a typing lag and the typing lag drove me crazy . <p> Craig : I did not notice that . Ill check with him and see if that is the software you were looking at . It did n't  appear to have any lag at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . What I loved about it , at least at first blush , was that it presented you with a gray background and then the page sort of floated on that background . <p> So immediately a lot of distractions just went away . It was very elegant looking and it was laid out in a very modern way . Final Draft really suffers from being a legacy application . I used Final Draft back when you had to drive over to Santa Monica and pick it up from <p> John : The Writers Store ? <p> Craig : Yeah . Actually even before The Writers Store . I picked it up from this bungalow where I think his name is Marc Madnick , the initial author of the program , he and his buddies were in a bungalow in Santa Monica and I bought the two floppy disk set . I think it was Final Draft 2 . <p> And the truth is that Final Draft has that problem that legacy software has . Its just a city that 's been built over and on top of itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movie Magic , when I went over to Movie Magic I thought , " Okay , well , this is a little bit less of that . It feels like it started a little bit more advanced . " <p> Now with this Fade In I 'm looking at it thinking , " Well , this is how you should do it . Just start fresh and really write code for the way computers work and look now . " <p> So I 'm going to talk to this guy and see about getting involved with his program because I also just love that he s a guy and not a big , huge company . <p> John : I actually had lunch with Marc Madnick several weeks ago . As you know , my company makes FDX Reader , which is the Final Draft reader for the iPad , because we want to be able to read Final Draft files , and we can . <p> We have had conversations before this about the FDR format , which is the old Final Draft format . We would love to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **31;634;TOOLONG , technologically advanced version explanation of why you cant do that is that we just cant . Its not even that its a special , magic proprietary thing . Its that its basically impossible to separate the old file format out from how Final Draft worked . <p> Really what it comes down to is that the programs were so old that they needed to fit files and make them really small on floppy disks . So they would do these crazy compression things to them . They were reading the file directly to the screen , and it was a very different way of working than how we think about files right now . So basically we will never be able to support FDR files . That was the upshot of that lunch . <p> Craig : Yeah , its interesting . When I was talking to the developer of Fade In , one of the first questions I asked was how easy is it to import . He said that , for FDX files , which are the Final Draft 8 file formats , just open it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " FDR files ? Forget it . Its a nightmare . " <p> John : Yeah . So we are working on some magic that we will be able to announce pretty soon that I think will be interesting to people who are dealing with legacy files . But I cant quite announce that yet . <p> Craig : Alright . That 's exciting . <p> John : I 'm actually trying out something new for this script . It is my 40th script and in celebration of the 40th script , 40th complete screenplay , I am trying Scrivener , which is a pretty elaborate program , which I have always been daunted by because it can do so much . Its not just a screenwriting program ; it would really be good for any long form fiction . <p> But it actually works in a way that is very nice for my workflow , in that when I went off to Boston and I barricaded myself in the room , I am writing individual scenes , and I am handwriting them . I 'm taking pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is typing them up . So they just sit in a file in Dropbox as individual scenes . The really nice thing about Scrivener is that with Scrivener you can drag those individual files into a folder in Scrivener and look at them individually or stream them together . So , scenes are both individual and all pasted together , depending on how you want to look at them . <p> Craig : Thats interesting . <p> John : So , it has been pretty good to work with . I found that the formatting on the page looks pretty good . Its attractive . It does a very nice full-screen version . The moving from dialogue to character name to action to transitions is pretty natural and pretty logical . Rarely am I getting stuck in the wrong formatting template . <p> Craig : Does it use a standard sort of return-tab method ? <p> John : Yes . So its nice to try something new and find that it is mostly working . The thing I have enjoyed most about Scrivener and the thing that got me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With some of these older programs you worry that they are not going to come out with the next version or you worry that it is a tiny company that might not exist three months from now . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : This feels like its the right balance of young but growing . <p> Craig : Yeah , I tried Scrivener once . I fell into the initial trap that you were in , which is it seems like there is a lot going on here ; my needs are actually fairly narrow . I do n't  really use , for instance , Final Draft and Movie Magic have made big deals about their scene navigator and outlining . I do n't  use any of that . I just get rid of that window . Not interested , do n't  care . I just want a good writing experience . <p> The other thing that I think is of great value to me is software that can best handle production . Production has so many specific demands . If I can easily satisfy the requirements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just makes everything so much easier . They are always very appreciative of a screenwriter that just even knows how to do it . <p> John : Yeah . I fully anticipate that , at some point I will probably export this and bring it into Final Draft and do that last cleanup in Final Draft and make sure that everything is just the way I want it to be . <p> When I talked to Marc Madnick , I said , " Hey , why do n't  you make a cheap version of Final Draft that is $99 , that 's for everybody ? Put all the pro features in the Final Draft Pro and make that the $299 version , because I would pay $299 for all the pro features of that . " <p> And his point , which I think is a very good point , is that then he has four products to support , rather than two . He would have the Mac and the PC versions of the low-end and the high-end . It becomes exponentially more work to make any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah . My whole issue with Final Draft and the reason that I left them publicly was that I did think that , when it came to support , they had just fallen apart . <p> And I understand why to some extent . They became the default screenwriting application . And while there are maybe 2000 or 3000 people in the world that write screenplays professionally , there are tens and maybe hundreds of thousands of people that are trying . And those people have lots of questions and get confused and also , frankly , Final Draft has a history of releasing buggy product . So suddenly they were charging for tech support and it was frustrating to me . <p> One thing I will say about Movie Magic is for an application that is just as feature rich as Final Draft their tech support has been outstanding and remains entirely free . So that 's a big deal for me . <p> And I do n't  really need tech support , but tech support is one of those things that when you need it you really need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this week is Final Draft is now in the Mac App Store . So well see how it does there . Its there at its full price . As were recording this its $199 , which is a lot for apps in the app store . <p> Craig : Its so much . To me there 's a big opening , I think , for a new app that is reasonably priced , that has been built fresh from the ground up for this generation of operating systems . <p> John : What would you change about how you do your work ? That was the last question in the blog post I did and I 'm curious what you would do differently . <p> Craig : laughs I do n't  know . I do a lot of stuff differently . <p> Look , I could tell you what I wish but that 's kind of a self-denial . I wish I were more regular in the hours I kept . I wish that I were more workman-like in the way I approach the writing . There are guys out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they write until noon , they have their lunch , then they write until 4:30 , and then they go home . <p> I would love to be that guy . I think it would make my life easier , my familys life easier , but its not me . So there 's nothing I can do to change the way I do it other than to accept it , so I accept it . <p> John : Screenwriting is very much peaks and valleys . I wish they were all peaks and there were no valleys and I was always at an amazing flow , generating tons of pages , and loving everything I did . But I would recognize that that 's just not the way it really normally works in the real world . <p> I would try to use Freedom more . Freedom is the utility that turns off your Internet and its just a godsend . <p> Craig : Love that . <p> John : And I would just get away from my computer more . You were talking about sprinting and I do find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprints rather than the slog sessions of staring at the computer . <p> Craig : Yeah . You just have to sort of be honest to your own self . Everybodys got their own writing fingerprint . Its a little difficult when you start out because you 're not quite sure what your fingerprint is and you , frankly , should make an effort to dispel the most odious habits because you might land in a better place and that becomes your method . <p> But you have to temper that with acknowledging who you are and how you work best . Try not to lend any great meaning to those moments where you are in despair . Its inevitable and it does n't  mean you 're bad , it means you 're in one of those valleys . <p> John : Yep . Good . Well that 's a nice conversation about some peaks and some valleys and some adult film stars who may have been writing in with questions and managers who have fallen off the grid . <p> Craig : Youve got to find out where that guy went . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him is because someone asked , " Hey , whatever happened to insert-name-of-manager ? " And I 'm like , " Oh , that 's a really good question . " Google , google , google . He had a common enough name that I had to weed through some possibilities and do some minus in Google to take out certain categories of people , but strangely he disappeared . <p> Craig : Not even Facebook ? <p> John : Not even Facebook . I 'm always a little suspicious of people who are not on Facebook at all or you cant find an image of them . I do find that generally if I 'm stalking somebody Google image search ends up becoming the crucial thing because you can look for their face and that will lead you to some sort of clue of how to find them in other places . <p> Craig : For sure . Its always frustrating when you 're looking for people in our business and maybe they 're not all that prominent and all Google will do is spit out posters of their one movie or something .

@@42311698 @2311698/ <h> How we got here <p> Novels were once written by hand . So were plays and poems and speeches . As readers , we do n't  see the original scrawl because they 've been typeset along the way , transformed into something easier to read . <p> Screenwriting began in the era of typewriters , and its always been served raw . What the screenwriter pulls out of the typewriter is n't a manuscript to be sent to the publisher its the final product . <p> Over the years , the tools have changed , with the advent of computers and printers and PDFs . But we still expect scripts to look like they came out of a typewriter . <p> Specifically , we want screenplays to be twelve-point Courier . <p> The Courier typeface was designed in 1955 by Howard " Bud " Kettler for IBM . Its classified as a monospaced slab serif , with each character taking up the same space and constructed with even stroke widths . IBM deliberately chose not to seek any copyright , trademark , or design patent protection on Courier , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typeface on IBMs best-selling Selectric II typewriter , and soon became the default typeface in Hollywood . <p> By standardizing around one typeface set at a specific size , we can take advantage of some rules-of-thumb . <p> For example , one page of screenplay ( roughly , sometimes ) equals one minute of screen time . More importantly , producers can be assured that a 119-page draft really is shorter than a 140-page draft . Unlike college freshmen , screenwriters cant fiddle with the font to change the page count . <p> The biggest problem with Courier is that it often reveals its low-res heritage . Designed for an era of steel hitting ribbon , Courier can look blobby , particularly at higher resolutions . <p> But it does n't  have to . <h> Its Courier , just better . <p> In July 2012 , I asked type designer Alan Dague-Greene to come up with a new typeface that matched the metrics of Courier thus protecting line breaks and page counts while addressing some of its weak spots . <p> I wanted a font that could be substituted letter-for-letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-screen and printed . I wanted a bolder bold and real italics , not just slanted glyphs . <p> Alan rose to the challenge , creating a typeface that is unmistakably Courier , but subtly improved in ways you would n't necessarily notice at first . here 's a primer . <p> The serifs are crisper and less rounded . They 're also less blobby where the serif connects particularly in the lower-case c . <p> Look at the spaces inside the b and d . Theyve been opened up slightly , and the surrounding stroke tapered . <p> Still , you might occasionally wonder if you 're looking at regular Courier or Courier Prime . The quickest giveaway is the lowercase y , which loses its " foot " in Courier Prime . <p> We ultimately went through 25 builds for Courier Prime . <p> With each new version , I 'd prepare three sample screenplay pages the same text but in three different fonts ( standard Mac Courier , Courier Final Draft , and Courier Prime ) . The samples were given codenames ( e.g. Fish , Dog , Bird ) then shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing which was which . <p> The early results were Not Good . <p> Screenwriters consistently preferred standard Mac Courier to our custom face . But we soon realized why : the standard Mac Courier is fairly heavy . Screenplays have a lot of white space , which makes thin Couriers look even thinner . As we gradually nudged up the stroke weight , we found the Goldilocks spot which was just right . <p> I want to thank all the screenwriters who participated in both the voting and the beta tests , and of course Alan Dague-Greene and Ryan Nelson for all their work getting the typeface out the door . <p> Courier Prime is available today , free , for Mac and Windows . Its released under a very liberal license so developers can use it for iOS and Android apps . We hope screenwriters get a lot of use out of it . 
@@42311699 @2311699/ <p> Highland let 's you convert files between PDF , Final Draft ( . fdx ) and Fountain . It works in all directions . <p> ? It creates perfectly-formatted PDFs from Fountain or FDX files . <p> ? It creates future-proof Fountain files you can edit in any text editor . <p> ? It melts PDFs , making them editable . <p> That last part is basically magic . Highland can take almost any screenplay PDF and convert it back to an editable file in seconds . <p> here 's a quick walk-through video I made to show how it works : <p> Highland is a Mac app . Well be selling it through the Mac App Store . But before we do that , we need screenwriters to beta test it . <h> This changes everything ( into everything else ) <p> Screenwriters generally work with two kinds of files . <p> Native files like . fdx are for writing and editing . You need specific applications to use these files . Theyre prone to obsolescence . If you have any old WriteNow files on your computer , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal , and can be opened on nearly any device . Like digital paper , they 're basically frozen versions of the screenplay . Theyre difficult to edit , in part because all the semantic information has been lost . <p> Last week , we introduced Fountain files , which split the difference between native files and PDFs . Because they 're plain text , they 're both universal and highly editable , since they can work with any text editor and should for decades to come . <p> Highland is a quick way to move between these three formats . <p> Obviously , Highland is extremely useful for screenwriters who want to work in Fountain , or want to open a Final Draft file but do n't  have the app . But its ability to convert PDFs is probably going to be its most-discussed feature . <h> Melting PDFs <p> Its standard practice for screenwriters to deliver PDFs . Readers can easily read and print PDFs , but its onerous to change them so they do n't  . <p> As screenwriters , we 've relied on security through difficulty : producers , directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a script because its just too much hassle . <p> Fountain takes away the hassle , for better or worse . <p> I fully expect some pitchforks : How dare we assist the meddlers ? <p> I 'd argue that there 's nothing inherently " safe " about turning in a PDF . Producers have always been able to muck around with scripts it was just a lot of work . Relying on laziness is really no security at all . <p> With Highland , were going to respect the basic safeguards a screenwriter might take : <p> If you password-protect your PDF , Highland wont convert it . <p> If your PDF is just a bunch of images , Highland wont convert it . ( For example , you could print your script then scan it , or use a feature like Bronson Watermarkers " Deep Burn . " ) <p> Could a meddling producer work around these safeguards ? Absolutely . But she could also just have her assistant retype your script . That happens every day . <h> Highland and Fountain <p> LA-based screenwriters will have already guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a major north-south artery through Hollywood , just as Fountain is the famous east-west shortcut . <p> Much like how the real streets intersect , Highland and Fountain work well together but they 're not the only ways to get somewhere . <p> Just as you can take many routes to drive through Hollywood , you should have lots of alternatives for working with your screenplay . <p> Fountain is an open-source markup scheme . Were happy to see a lot of other developers embracing it . Some of them will come up with apps that are better than Highland , either by doing more or doing it smarter . <p> That 's the goal . Thats success . <p> But for today , Highland makes working with Fountain a lot easier . After this beta test , we hope to have an app that makes it effortless to move between formats and platforms . <p> If you want to help , were accepting beta-testers now .

@@42311704 @2311704/ <p> Todays First Person article comes from the open call . Jay Faerber is trying to transition from writing comics to writing TV , and is doing so with the help of the Warner Bros TV Writers Workshop . <p> My names Jay Faerber . <p> I 'm 38 years old and I 've been writing comic books professionally for the past 13 years . <p> Its a great , fun job and incredibly fulfilling . But in addition to comics , I 've got a great love for television , so I 'm finally taking the plunge and becoming a TV writer . <p> This was n't a decision I made lightly . In fact , I spent considerable time coming up with reasons not to try my hand at TV writing . I guess I was a little afraid that working in TV could destroy my enjoyment of TV as a viewer . Because despite writing comic books , I read very few comic books these days . The late Robert B. Parker explained it well when he said , " I tend to look at books the way carpenters look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  want to ruin my love of TV by writing TV , I was content to let my manager shop around my comic books as movie and TV properties , and attach other writers . One of these writers was a baby feature writer who was adapting one of my comics as a feature spec . <p> Some writer friends of mine asked why I was n't writing the spec myself . After all , they were my characters and this baby writer was n't bringing a huge reputation to the table . So why not just do it myself ? <p> And that 's what got me started . I remember very clearly the conversation that ensued , and by the end of it I was incredibly energized about trying to transition from comic books into features and TV . So I wrote a feature spec of my comic , Dynamo 5 . Adapting my own work was a great way to make the jump into screenwriting . I was kind of intimidated by the format and " rules " of a screenplay , but the pressure was less because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever came of it , but it was a great exercise . <p> The more I thought about it , the more I realized my real interest was in TV , not features . I liked the chance to spend a lot of time maybe years with a set group of characters . I also liked that in TV , writers write . Feature writers take a lot more meetings and tinker with the same script for a huge chunk of time . With TV , you got ta get stuff done fast so it can be filmed a couple weeks later . Im used to that kind of pace because of my comic book background , so it was more appealing to me . <p> Over the next summer I wrote a pilot that my manager showed to a few producers . We got good feedback on the writing , but we were told nobody would be interested in the premise . What was the premise , you may be asking ? It was about Internal Affairs cops . And shortly after we decided to shelve it and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall , and it was about Internal Affairs cops . Which proved that at least my instincts werent terrible . <h> Getting on the playing field <p> The following spring I decided to try to get into one of the TV writing programs . Most networks and TV studios have them , including <p> I applied to the first three , because the CBS program is very diversity driven , and as a white guy , I did n't  see the point in applying . <p> I wrote a Burn Notice spec , just because its a show that 's been around long enough that most people at least have some familiarity with it , and it fits in with my sensibilities . <p> All three programs I applied to required not only a spec , but also some sort of essay question about my background , and what I 'd bring to a writers room . <p> I leaned pretty heavily on my experience as a comic book writer , since there 's a lot of crossover between the two mediums . Both , for instance , involve telling stories visually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two characters simply stand around talking . Its much more visual if they 're doing something while they 're talking . <p> That 's why all those old Chris Claremont X-Men stories featured so many scenes of the X-Men in the Danger Room . Most of those scenes were really just exposition scenes , but they were much easier to swallow when the X-Men delivered them while fighting big robots or whatever . And while comics use caption boxes and , to a lesser extent these days , thought balloons , they 're still mainly dialogue driven just like TV . <p> In fact , I find certain aspects of screenwriting to be easier than comics . With a comic book script , you have to be constantly mindful of how much an artist can fit into a single panel , or a single page . With a screenplay , you do n't  have those constraints . <p> But you have others . In comics , it does n't  cost any more to show a planet exploding than it does to show two people talking . ( In fact , your artist will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film and TV , there 's a huge difference between the two . <p> Honestly , I kind of thought if I got into any of the programs , it would be the NBC/Universal Writers on the Verge . Two reasons : One , I wrote a Burn Notice , which is an NBC/Universal show . And two , one of my comics ( Noble Causes ) was optioned by NBC/Universal a few years ago . But the NBC/Universal notification period came and went and I never heard a peep . <p> A few weeks later , I was completely surprised by a phone call from Warner Bros , asking me to come in for an interview . I was living in Seattle at the time , so I hopped on a plane to LA , where I had an interview with Chris Mack , the head of the workshop . A WB Current Executive was also present in the interview . We talked for awhile about my background , and why I like TV , and what shows I watch , that kind of thing . All in all it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I flew back to Seattle the next day and spent the next two weeks ticking days off the calendar , since Chris had said to expect an answer in two weeks . And it was exactly two weeks later when he called to said I 'd been accepted . <p> I then had another two weeks to get myself relocated to LA in time for the first workshop . I know John has had entire blog entries devoted to moving to LA , so I 'll keep this brief . <p> I think having such a time constraint actually helped in this case . I just threw my two cats in my car , packed a few things , and drove south . I jotted down a few addresses from Craigslist and literally took the second apartment I looked at on the day I arrived in LA . I settled in Sherman Oaks , since I have friends in the area and its an easy commute to Burbank . I attended the first workshop , then flew back up to Seattle the next morning , packed up the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moving truck and was back here in time for the following weeks workshop . <h> How the workshop works <p> The workshop meets once a week , on Wednesday evenings , for about three hours . There are nine of us in this years group , although there are really only eight spots ( since two guys work as a writing team ) . There are seven men and two women , and we range in age from mid-20s to late 30s . Were all white , except for one African-American . <p> In terms of backgrounds , its much more diverse . We have one former child actor . A few people have worked ( or are working ) as writers assistants on various shows . One has previously written and acted in a cable show . One is a playwright . Two people work as copywriters at an ad agency . One works as a producer on a reality TV show . <p> I 'd say the one thing we all have in common , aside from our love of TV , is some sort of previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that 's a coincidence . While the workshop does n't  require previous experience , it sure looks like its helpful . <p> Ill also point out that I 'm the only one in the workshop who relocated from another part of the country . I do n't  know how many applicants they received from across the country , and I do n't  know if Im considered an exception or not . But I made it abundantly clear in both my application materials and the interview that I was ready and willing to relocate . <p> Once the program got under way , each of us wrote a new spec in a simulated writers room-type environment . We got notes from everyone in the group , plus our instructors , and had to hit deadlines for our beat sheets , outlines , first draft , second draft , etc . <p> Writing our specs took up about half the time of the program . The other half has been lectures on all aspects of the TV industry , from various guest lecturers with firsthand experience . <p> Were encouraged to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group . And we really have bonded . <p> As I write this , were at the tail end of the program . It started the first week of November and ends the first week of April . Were starting to get sent around on meetings ( which are arranged by the head of the workshop ) . <p> One of my classmates has already been staffed , and I 've been sent on one showrunner meeting and one general meeting so far . Its an incredibly exciting time . <p> Sometimes I need to pinch myself when I think of how much my life has changed in the past four months . I went from sitting in my home office in cold , rainy Seattle , writing comic books , to driving onto the Warner Bros lot each week , where I get to talk TV with some amazingly talented writers . 
@@42311705 @2311705/ <p> John : Its 7 oclock in the evening here . Its still light out . But my work is done for the day . We were working from 10 to 6 , and so I got to walk home and stop at the grocery store on the way . It is all very New York and civilized . <p> Craig : I envy you . I get to work on what I am working on and then I also have to help my son with his science fair project . <p> John : Always good . <p> Now , I have specific ideas about science fair projects , and so let me see if we are in the same mind space about what a science fair project is : A science fair project is not , " Hey , I looked something up on Wikipedia and here is what I looked up on Wikipedia . " A science fair project Science involves a hypothesis and an experiment and results . <p> Craig : Correct . <p> John : If there are not those things , its not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to start with your problem , then your hypothesis , then your results your procedure , your results , and your conclusion . There must be an experiment with recorded data , otherwise it is not a science fair project , it is just a science fair report . <p> John : Yeah . Its a diorama of some kind . <p> Craig : Yeah . Totally agree with you on that one . This year Jack and I did an experiment about viscosity . And we made a homemade viscometer . And watched literally laughs watched molasses slowly drain out of a container into another container for 35 minutes . It was pretty good . <p> John : That sounds pretty amazing . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Now , of course you got into the complicated calculus behind one container emptying and sort of how that all worked , right ? <p> Craig : Well there is a start line and stop line . So we have a We sort of approximated a constant volume . But we did heat the liquid , then we did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated them and did it again to see the difference that heat creates on viscosity . And , I 'm sorry to say , we did not report any findings contrary to the natural laws of science . <p> John : Oh , but would n't it be awesome if you did ? <p> Craig : It would have been pretty exciting if we had discovered something new . We did n't  as it turns out . <p> John : You were confirming previous observations , and that is an important part of science , too . <p> Craig : Yeah . We like to call it " standing on the shoulders of giants . " <p> John : Yeah , that 's good . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Today , Craig , I thought we might talk about something that we are both involved in right now which is , it is not just that you have written the script , but now the script is going to a stage where it is entering production . And there are decisions being made about what stays , and what goes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are generating a lot of new material . <p> And you have become not just a screenwriter , but you have also become the script department . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : You are the person who is responsible for the screenplay that is in front of peoples eyes . And if the pages are changing in there , you are the person who is responsible for making sure the right pages are going into the script and not going into the script . <p> So I thought we would talk about that , because it is not just a produced/published " big screenwriter " kind of problem ; even if you are making like an indie film with three friends , if the script is going through changes , you are responsible for making sure that everyone is shooting the same script , and that literally everybody is on the same page . So I thought we would talk about that . <p> Craig : Its a great topic because it is one of the areas where screenwriters can actually screw up production in a massive way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the other nice thing about this topic is that unlike so many screenwriting topics , this one is n't gray , or ambiguous , or a question of taste . There is a best practices way to go about this . And we should walk through everything that is involved in script management for production . <p> John : Great . So , at a certain point , a screenplay becomes not just , " Okay , I 'm printing out a whole new thing , or sending over a whole new PDF that someone is going to read over the weekend and you are going to talk about things . " At some point you say , " This is the script . " 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : " This is the production script . This is what we are going to base everything off of . " And at that point , the script is locked . And it will be a mutual decision based on the people involved , like when you are going to lock the script . So the producer , and the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say , " Okay , I think we are locked . " <p> And from that point forward , if you are in Final Draft you go to " Lock Pages . " There is an equivalent thing in Movie Magic . If you are trying to do it in some other way , just God bless you , its harder . <p> Craig : No . There 's only one way to do it . Yeah . There is one way . <p> The first draft of the production is the one that they base their initial schedule off of . And everybody , like you said , everybody sort of agrees , " Okay , this is the one . " That is called the " White Draft . " Everything is by color from this point forward , and the first color is white . <p> And you lock the pages , and you also Typically the AD will then number the scenes . And at this point they may say to you , " Hey , you know how in one scene where you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time passing , each one of those we really would like to call a scene , " because production manages scenes by numbers , not by page . <p> So he might make those into slug lines , but at that point they number everything . The scene numbers never change . They are locked into place . And the page breaks , in theory , do n't  change . They are also locked into place . <p> John : So , you and the AD will Basically the AD will come with the script and say , and number the script , and may actually just write hand numbers on the sides of things . You will go into Final Draft or Movie Magic and you apply those scene numbers to the individual scenes . And everyone will agree on what those scene numbers are , because your scene numbers need to match what their schedule says . <p> Craig : Correct . <p> John : And this is very , very important . At the same time that they are sending this through , you should also ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breakdown is that they are working on , just to make sure that you are agreeing on what you are calling things . Like are you calling this " the restaurant , " or are you calling this " the diner , " because that can lead to confusion , too . <p> And in the schedule , oftentimes , there is a one line synopsis of what happens in the scene . You , as the screenwriter , are probably better than the AD at describing what happens in that scene . And you might volunteer to change that if that is the kind of relationship that you have . <p> Craig : I have never bothered doing it , only because I feel like it would just take up so much time . It would take a lot of my time . And in the end , it is really just for their internal use , you know . <p> John : Here is the reason why I do it on some projects , especially projects that I know I am going to be around a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming up later in the week and go , " Oh , I 'm not ready for that , " but they are not really understanding what is happening in the scene . <p> Craig : Hmm . <p> John : So like the AD will have written something that says , like , " Jack confronts Karen about something . " That is not really what the scene is about . And , so , they are in this head space of like , " Oh , this is that big moment , " but actually they are confusing one scene with another scene . I find it helpful to do that , but I am also kind of anal retentive . <p> Craig : Yeah . That goes above and beyond the normal call of duty . <p> John : So , let 's go back to the actual screenplay then . In a feature it is 120 pages . In a TV pilot it is going to be fewer pages than that . If you are doing a regular TV show , an episode of a TV show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility is giving those pages out to people , so we are sort of not talking about that . <p> In features , or in a Broadway musical , you generally are that whole department . And so you are responsible for making sure that stuff is matching up . <p> Craig : Yeah . Sometimes there is a script coordinator who is different than the script supervisor . And the script coordinator is somebody on staff who manages the script processing , distribution , and changes , and so forth . And as a screenwriter , it is important for you to work with that person to make sure that everybody is a good partner about this sort of thing . Because ultimately their job is on the line if there is a mistake . <p> John : Exactly . So , that script coordinator would often be part of the production office staff . <p> Craig : Correct . <p> John : And so it is a bridge between sort of you as one of the creative people and the back office staff , and who is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your script . It is the " White " script that has now scene numbers applied to it . And from that point forward the pages are locked , which means that if you are adding something to a scene that would cause it to generate would case pages to move after that It is hard to describeIm using my hands a lot which is really helpful in a podcast . <p> Craig : laughs <p> John : If you were adding something into a scene , like let 's say you are adding three new lines of dialogue , those can potentially push everything else in the script later . So , instead it is going to kick and create an A or a B page . So , if you are on page 99 , and you need to add half a page to it , that half page will automatically break and form page 99A . <p> Craig : Yeah . The idea here is everybody on the production gets a printed out white draft . They all have it in their binders . Everybody needs one because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a script in a different way . Grips look at it one way , and camera looks at it in a different way , and obviously wardrobe , but everybody needs the whole script . <p> Every time you make If you make a change on page 1 to your script that adds five lines , that is going to change every page break over the course of the script , which would mean you would have to hand out 300 more scripts . Its insane . You do n't  want to do that . <p> All you want to really do is hand people the pages that changed . So , the way we do that is we lock all the page breaks . And then if on page 1 you need to add half a page , Final Draft and Movie Magic will automatically insert a new page between 1 and 2 called 1A . And it will proceed along 1B , 1C so that pages 2 through 120 do n't  change . And this way And everything is by Revision Draft . <p> So , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Now you need , they call you up and they say , " We need changes to the first scene . " You write those changes and those changes will be " Blue " pages . Everybody roughly goes in the same order of color . And then you <p> John : But you should ask the first AD or line producer , or whoever seems to be the person who makes those decisions what color schedule we are going to go through . <p> Craig : Yeah . Get the color schedule . I mean , usually the studios have a set thing . And then so you make your changes . Every change is an asterisk which is automatic in Final Draft or Movie Magic , and when you are in revision mode , so they can see what exactly changed on the page . <p> And then , when you are done with that , and everybody agrees that it should be released and distributed to crew , the office will print out just the changed pages on blue paper . So what they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a page to page 1 , they would get a new page 1 , and a page 1A , and asterisks showing what changed . <p> And same thing , by the way , when you take out . If I take out everything on page 3 through 6 , what will happen is everybody will get a new changed page that says " Page 3-6 " and then the scenes that were omitted . And we should probably talk about what happens when you omit a scene . <p> John : Yeah . The best practices for omitting a scene is basically instead of where the Interior/Exterior scene header is , you have the word " Omit " and you keep the scene number there . So it is clear to everyone that that scene has been omitted . <p> If you are omitting a lot of scenes , sometimes you will just do a dash/hyphen to show all of these scenes were omitted and that this happened . <p> Craig : Right . A range of scenes , yeah . <p> John : A range of scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sequence , and you decide to move that sequence later on in the script . What you are basically going to do is delete that sequence out of where it was . So that whole range would be deleted . It would be omitted ; " omit " is usually what you use . <p> And then you are going to be generating new pages to stick it into where it properly fits in the script now . <p> Craig : Thats right . And the other reason we use omit is just like we need to keep the page count from flowing , expanding , and contracting as we make changes ; we need the scene numbers to always stay rigid as well . Scene 15 will always be Scene 15 . And Scene 17 will always be Scene 17 . If you take out Scene 16 , everything else has to stay where it is . So it is best to just keep that placeholder there Scene 16 , Omit . <p> And on Final Draft and Movie Magic , you can also use The proper way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slug line to say , " Omit , " but to actually use the Omit Scene tool , because it will retain all of the stuff that you wrote . It will just hide it and just keep a little thing that says , " Omit . " So you can always bring it back . <p> John : Yeah . I have never done that . But , if a software tool exists to do that , use it . A lot of times I wont end up doing that , but that is probably best practices . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : What I will say is you always have to think of the person who is going to be receiving these pages . And , so , a lot of times you are going to be generating maybe 12 pages at a time . And you , as the screenwriter , are responsible . You print them out . You look at them with your actual script , with the script that they should have , and make sure that they actually make sense in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , if I took out this page and I insert this page , will it make sense in every persons script ? " <p> I always generate a new title page with those that says the date , the color of the revisions the color and the date of the revisions so it is clear . I also almost always put a memo on the top of a set of revisions that says , " To whatever production team , from me these are the actual page numbers that have changed . " And a quick description of why , basically what is different about them . <p> So a person who picks this up , their packet of pages , he is like , " Oh okay , this is to move this sequence to here , this does that , this affects these things . " I like to put the list of what pages have changed so they can actually flip through it and make sure that they have got all the right pages . <p> Craig : I do n't  do that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concert with the director , when I send the file I will write that sort of if I feel the need write that summary for the director and the producer who are getting it directly . Ultimately , I think , the crew my suspicion is they just want their pages to put in their book , and then the asterisks will theoretically guide the way . <p> And it is really up to the I actually do n't  like getting in the way . I do n't  like talking to the crew directly . I feel like I would rather have the director do that . That is my whole thing . <p> John : I love talking to the crew directly , and it is one of my few opportunities to do so . <p> Craig : That is true . That is true . <p> John : So , and the other thing in defense of the top page memo is sometimes it gets complicated . There are times where On Charlie and the Chocolate Factory this happened in a couple of places , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 100 , went through it like three times . So there were times when it went to A and B pages , or it went to AA pages . The page numbering got strange . <p> So on the cover page I could say , " This range , this should be the sequence . " And I would list " 99 White , " " 99A Blue , " just so people could actually understand , " Okay , I 've got my script together right . " So once they put all of their pages in they could see , " Oh okay , I did the right thing . This does reflect how the script should be . " <p> Craig : Right . And that is an important thing to kind of get on the same base with production with your AD , because they all have different numbering schemes , but it is a good thing to raise . If you have page 1 and page 1A , and you need to stick something between page 1 and page 1A , a lot of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different way of doing that , and similarly with scene numbers , people have a different way of doing that because lettering scene number is fine that is the normal move . <p> Let 's say I want to put a scene between 15 and 16 , it is going to be scene 15A . But it is also important to remember that when they are shooting , each scene number is on the slate . And then there are also additional letters that are added to describe the shot of that scene . So , the master shot is Shot A. And then a single on Jim is Shot B. So there are a lot of letters all of a sudden . <p> So , some guys , a lot of times I have noticed this is a foreign thing . They like the scene letter to go first <p> John : Letter to go first . <p> Craig : So instead of 15A it would be A15 . <p> John : I think it is a really good practice . And so ask your AD how they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . And so between Scene 15 and Scene 16 would be A16 . <p> Craig : Well that depends . <p> John : That depends . So make sure to check how they are going to do it . <p> Craig : Exactly . And you can force , you know , Movie Magic or Final Draft to do it whichever way you want . But , here is an important thing to keep in mind . This is a basic workflow of how I do this when I am doing revisions . <p> I have my White draft . Now it is time to do revisions . The first thing I do is I save the white draft as blue draft . So the white draft is now pristine , untouched , over there . Now I have a blue draft that I can do anything to it I want . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : When I start , the first thing I do is I go into Revision Mode . I make sure I am in the proper color revision of blue , because I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is what . I make sure Auto Revision works are turned on , and now I start making my changes . If I delete scenes , I make sure to omit them . If I add scenes , I just add them . I do n't  worry about the numbers just yet , because I may take it out . <p> Remember , when you are revising , the stuff you are revising is sort of free . You can take it in and out and not be penalized . Once you keep it there , that is when the changes happen . <p> So , I go through all of that . I 'm done . Next thing I do is I scene number the new scenes to fit properly . And Final Draft kind of automatically does it . Make sure that you select " Keep Current Scene Numbers Fixed " so that you do n't  mess that up . You do n't  want to renumber everything . That is a disaster . <p> John : Oh god . That is why you save first . <p> Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I save it . Okay , terrific . I send it off . Everyone is happy . <p> Then they call me up and say , " We want to change another scene and we need " <p> John : Here is where you skipped a crucial step . <p> Craig : Oh , I did ? <p> John : You are not sending them the Final Draft file . You are sending them a PDF generated from Final Draft . <p> Craig : Here is why . It depends . If I am working with a director closely , and I almost often am , who is proficient with this , or at the office , and also for an AD , I like to send the Final Draft file because the truth of the matter is sometimes as they are rushing to get pages out , let 's say I send these off at 5 oclock . They have to get these pages out for the next days shooting . <p> If they catch a typo or something , I want them to have the freedom to fix that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no , no , I actually do n't  want this to be a slug line ; I want it to be an action line here , " I want him to have the freedom to do that . It is a production tool . <p> Obviously I do n't  want them changing my work , but I do n't  work with people that change my work like that . They never do . Everybody is respectful . <p> When I am sending initial drafts to studios and things like that its a different story . But once I am deep into production , I feel like unless I am working with people I do n't  trust , and I have been lucky enough I guess that I have n't had that problem , I send the Final Draft file , or the Movie Magic file . <p> John : Its a matter of how comfortable you are with that . I just feel like most of the people I have worked with , its not a matter of trust . I do n't  think they are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something evil or wrong , or try to change words that they should n't . I just think they are going to make a mistake , and I do n't  want them to be able to make a mistake . <p> So , a PDF , they are not going to make a mistake . <p> Craig : Thats true . That is true . <p> John : They are going to print it . <p> Craig : You have to kind of gauge , I guess . There you go . You have a slightly different style . <p> Alright . So , we have sent my blue pages off . They have distributed them to the crew . And then they call and say , " We want to make a change to this other scene , " and it is time for pink pages . So , what do I do ? <p> I open up my blue draft , I " Save As " pink draft . The next thing I do is So the blue draft is pristine and saved forever on its own . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Select All , Clear All Revision Marks . Because you do n't  want to show the old revision marks . Those pages already got handed out . You do n't  want to re-hand them out again . <p> John : Now Craig , this is a different workflow thing . Final Draft can only show the current set of revisions . So , I have more faith in Final Draft more recently than I will I will always save a file , just so I can have a clean saved file , but I will just add a new revision , which would be pink , and I will say , " Show only current revision , " and it will hide all of the previous revisions , and only show the new stuff that I do . <p> Craig : That is an option . I just , my quirk is that I like to know that each file just has its own revisions . So that if I need to go through and say , well somebody says , " Well wait was that changed in blue or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just open that file . It is really up to you . I mean , either way we end up with the same work . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : And then you start again , and you do it again , and you will start to discover things . By the way , not a bad idea to play around with a sample script to see how this all works . But you will notice , for instance , if you <p> John : I 'm sorry . But a great idea is to start doing it before you absolutely have to do it , because the first time you are figuring out how to use these tools is when you have a script that is shooting in a week , you could be panic-induced , and you could make mistakes . <p> Craig : Oh yeah . And if you incorrectly change page breaks or scene numbers , it is a disaster . It is an actual disaster because if you spend time on a set what you will notice first thing off is that the scene number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They talk about scenes . <p> They will say to you something like , they might walk up to you and say , " Hey , just a quick question in Scene 78 you said that you were talking about a truck . Is it a truck ? What kind of truck ? " And you will immediately say , " I have no idea what Scene 78 is . " And you do n't  . But they do . <p> And you do n't  have to know . You can look at your script , but everything is scene number . If you mess those scene numbers up , oh boy . <p> John : Boy . <p> Craig : Bad . <p> John : Yeah . Then you are spending an hour or two going back through and going back to the hard copy . And that is why I love to have a PDF that I can say , " Okay , this is what this was . This is what this set of revisions was , " so you can sort of backtrack through . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , I can backtrack through my Final Draft files . But , you will notice as you work with the drafts that things happen that make sense . For instance , Page 80-86 , all of those scenes , everybody decided we just do n't  need that in this movie . So , you omit all of those scenes . And what the program will do is issue one changed page . And on that changed page , the page range will be 80-86 . And then on it it will just say Scenes 113-121 Omitted . <p> And so everybody gets them and they go , " Okay , I am taking all of these pages form my current script , and replacing them with this one delete page . " <p> John : Yup . <p> Craig : So you learn . You learn how it works . <p> John : The other thing I will tell you from experience is sometimes as you get through complicated situations where you start having A and B pages , and you start to have one-eighth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good what I will often do is go through and copy , and basically cut and paste all of those things together onto a new page that can replace all of those other pages . <p> So , instead of having 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : if it ended up being on-eighth of a page on a couple different things in a row , get those all down to one page and create one new page that replaces all those other pages . <p> Craig : Exactly . <p> John : It makes your life happier . And it is a little scary to do , and that is why you " Save As " and make sure it works before you try to do it , but that can make life a lot easier , especially when you are trying to do sides for actors and stuff , that you have enough on a page that it really makes sense . <p> Craig : Right . Yeah . The concept there is when you lop out three-quarters of a page in a locked script , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just going to leave blank space on the page . Well you might have five pages in a row that just have , like John is saying , little bits . And so you may want to copy and paste them all into one page . <p> And what he is saying about sides is important . " Sides " is the production term for the script pages that are handed out at the beginning of every production day to everyone , the crew , the actors , the director . They are little tiny pages , I do n't  know the exact measurement , but they are mini-pages . <p> John : Well , they are a quarter of an 8.5 x 11 sheet . So , if you fold an 8.5 x 11 sheet twice , it is that size . <p> Craig : That size . Okay . <p> John : Ah , itsthats fine . <p> Craig : Yeah , they are bigger than that . <p> John : Yeah . They are a little bit bigger than that . They are . <p> Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they have the script printed in kind of tiny words . And it is your script pages . And what they will do is they will put Xs , big marker Xs through the stuff that they are not shooting that day . They are just about the stuff they are shooting . <p> And if over the course of eight pages , there is really one page of material , that actually is kind of annoying to constantly be flipping through sides to see what your next line is . So , that is a good theory to sort of collapse that down if it is getting really quadricated . Polyfurcated . <p> John : Yeah . I like that you make these new words . <p> Craig : Polyfurcated should be a word . <p> John : It totally should be a word . We are making it now . <p> Craig : Yeah . Polyfurcated . Oh , and then there is this other thing that happens where and this tends to occur very early on . You lock the white draft . Everybody does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director sit down and make like 50 changes . And they are all tiny little changes because of what is happening in production . <p> Well , the location actually is now really more like a bar that is next to the hotel instead of inside the hotel . A lot of little stupid , tiny little changes , but suddenly you have 50 pages that have an asterisk on them . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : So what they will say then is everybody will get together and decide , " You know what , with this many changed pages , unlock the pages " <p> John : New white . <p> Craig : No , not new white . " Issue a blue draft . " <p> John : Oh , that 's true . <p> Craig : Exactly . So , we will say , " Okay , for this one we are going to unlock the pages so that we do n't  have a gazillion little pages , and we are just going to issue a whole new script to everybody that is all blue . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But the scene numbers never change . <p> John : Scene numbers never change . <p> Craig : Never . Never . Never . <p> John : I should also say , what I am doing right now is essentially like being in production . And there are cases where you are trying to reflect what was actually done versus what you are planning to shoot . <p> So , sometimes during rehearsal , and movies sometimes have rehearsal , too , you will see some changes that sort of come up along the way . And it is a good idea if you can to reflect what you are actually going to do . So , if something comes up during rehearsal for your thing , during preproduction , like location changes for your movie . As you are debating , " Oh , should I actually change it in the script , or will we remember that . Like it says gas station , but now it is at a rest area . Should I really make that change ? " <p> Yes . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always . <p> John : Otherwise people are going to get confused down the road , or , you have to think down the road . Because it may be three months before they are shooting that thing . People are going to say , " What happened here ; what changed ? " 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : Now you wo n't necessarily You are not responsible for , usually as a screenwriter , responsible for the small little blocking things they did differently , or like you actually had the actor enter two lines later . For movies , you are not going to worry about that . For musicals , you do worry about that . For the movie , you may not really worry about that kind of continuity . <p> Craig : No . I mean , the stuff on the day is on the day . And you do n't  have to change the script to reflect that . But in advance of the script , yes ; things like locations , and anything really that you think people should know about has to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very closely . And the one sort of judgment call that sometimes you have to make is whether or not to , if you are changing a scene location should you delete and then create a new scene number . Usually I do n't  . <p> Usually if the bulk of the scene is the same , I will keep the scene and just change the slug line . <p> John : Yeah . And , again , that is a conversation with your AD <p> Craig : Correct . <p> John : and figure out what style is going to make sense , because they are the person who is responsible for the schedule and figuring out everything else , how stuff is going to work . <p> Craig : Correctamundo . <p> John : What is dispiriting about being a screenwriter , well it is exciting to be in production . It is like seeing that all of these that were potential are actually finished . The minute they are done with a scene , everyone will sort of they will throw away their sides and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : No one will think about that scene again . It will be done , and it will move on . And the script becomes not especially important the minute One minute after it is shot , the script is kind of forgotten . <p> Craig : I know . I love that . <p> John : Yes and no . Sometimes I get a little bit sad when I go into the editing room and I see , like , " Oh , they assembled the scene based on what was shot , but it is actually " I do n't  know . There is no recognition that , like , oh , it was actually <p> Craig : Well , but you know , listen . Good editors always have that big script book with them with all of the script supervisors reports . And they do I mean , good editors will look back to the script . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : I mean , they should at least . Although it is a tricky thing because ultimately they also know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the director . But I would <p> John : I would say the first responsibility should always be towards the movie <p> Craig : Well , that is not the way it works with editors . <p> John : Ah , yes . But you can be a little bit sad . Although I will say some of the new editing programs , I think Avid does this now ; they have a thing where you can actually load the script in and it can do voice recognition to match up lines in takes with the actually shooting script . <p> Craig : Oh really ? <p> John : Which is pretty amazing . <p> Craig : Thats pretty cool . <p> John : It is great for documentaries with a transcript ; it is fantastic for that , too . But it wont be long before many shows , you can sort of like look at a script and sort of pick your favorite takes from things that have it auto-assemble . <p> Craig : Oh my god . That would be so cool . <p> John : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get rid of editors because , you know . I mean , ultimately it is just going to come down to screenwriters and teams of robots . <p> John : Yeah , will actors will be the first thing we have . <p> Craig : No . The actors are going to ultimatelywe are just going to scan them . <p> John : Totally . <p> Craig : And robots . <p> John : Robots . All robots . Factory . <p> Craig : Robots . Yeah , like a factory . Exactly . <p> But that is a pretty good tutorial on how this all works , I think . <p> John : Yeah . Yeah . You are responsible for making sure that the script you wrote can be shot by the people who need to shoot the movie . And sometimes that is you ; sometimes you are the writer-director , you are going to make revisions . Sometimes it is other people . And sometimes you are not going to be all that crazily involved . <p> In the animated things I have done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft , but then it sort of just kind of goes away . And they have their own weird numbering systems , and it really becomes much about their boards and everything else . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Sometimes you give it up and go to God , and that is fine , too . <p> Craig : Yeah . But in live action , this is really a chance for you to channel your inner how would I describe ? I just remember being in third grade and there was as certain kind of girl that her penmanship was excellent , and her sense of scheduling and paperwork was really good , whereas I was a disaster , you know . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Find that girl inside of you , because you need to be really fastidious about this kind of thing . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : If you blow it , they will come find you . And my whole thing is , please , as a screenwriter , do n't  embarrass us ; do n't  embarrass the rest of us by not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One last tip I will share , which is something I learned from this project , is First of all , binders are just amazing . And I was always a person who printed scripts and had the little brads in them , or I would print the two pages side by side for my little reading purposes . But the best thing about printing out full size with three holes and putting it in a binder is as you are going through scenes , if here is something you need to fix on a page , I put a red , plastic Post-it flag at the top . <p> If there is a note I have to talk to the director about , or to talk to an actor about , I use a yellow Post-it tab over on the right hand side . And so then every day as I need to sit down to do changes and do work , I can look at all the red tabs across the top and those are the pages I need to fix . <p> And I go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Post-it flag off . If it is a note I have for an actor or for a director , I can see it there , and when it is done I can take it off . It has been really helpful . <p> Craig : I just use the internal Script Note function on Final Draft and Movie Magic . <p> John : Oh , I hate those . <p> Craig : You do n't  like those ? <p> John : I hate them . <p> Craig : Oh , I love them . <p> John : I 'm such a digital person , but I really do n't  like the internal <p> Craig : You know <p> John : besides , it is a very physical process for me . I very much want to have my book open and be able to talk to people . <p> Craig : Listen , grandma , here is the deal : you are not that digital . You write your scripts on legal pads . <p> John : I do . <p> Craig : Yeah . You write your scripts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know for a fact you use an abacus . <p> John : Often . Only . <p> Craig : You use a Charles Babbage machine to record this podcast . <p> John : Yeah . I just think it adds a certain authenticity . <p> Craig : laughs <p> John : Stuart has to do a lot of careful audio suppression to get around the click-click-clacking of it all . But it really does help a lot . <p> Craig : Correct . And then the rest of his time he spends carefully greasing the gears . <p> John : Well , and I do ride to work on my old tiny bike with the giant front wheel . <p> Craig : Thats right . I have seen you . <p> John : I do n't  believe in steam irons . I think a proper iron is heated on the stove , and when it is nice and hot you pick it up with a rag and you rub it over . <p> Craig : Oh , you have rags now ? <p> John : I have rags Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Craig : Got it . <p> John : When it has gotten too thin to really be worn anymore , that is what I do . <p> John : Although I will say one digital thing I am involved with , which very much pertains to this , we just released our new Bronson Watermarker 1.5 . <p> Craig : Thats right . Very good . <p> John : And I developed Bronson for exactly the production I am working on right now , because the producers required that we watermark every script that went out . So we have like 40 things that need to get sent out . <p> And when you try to watermark things one by one , it was a giant pain in the ass . So we made this app that can watermark . You can give it a list of names , and it generates all the PDFs all at once . <p> We did have to decide at a certain point when are we going to stop watermarking , because are we going to watermark every revision that comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photocopier . We actually have to print . <p> And so we decided that revisions along the way are not going to get watermarked . But , today we realized that more than half of the script is no longer watermarked because of so many revisions . <p> Craig : Well then that is a chance for you to maybe issue a whole new script that is watermarked . <p> John : We could . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Ah , see ! Its intriguing . <p> Craig : Yup , think about that one . <p> John : The other tip I will add , just to talk about my physical notebooks , and people who like things on paper . If you are putting stuff in a binder , the other great thing that Post-it , its actually not Post-it , but you can get them at Office Depot and places like that , are these adhesive folder labels . And you use those for sequences . <p> And so if you were doing a musical , you would have one of those little tabs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have one for each sort of sequence , like a big action sequence , or sort of a new chunk of your script . And it makes it so lovely to be able to flip through to , " Oh , let 's talk about this section . Let 's talk about this section . " I highly recommend it . <p> Craig : Feh . <p> John : Feh ? <p> Craig : Feh. laughs <p> John : They work so much better than like normal dividers that would go into a three-ring binder , because they actually adhere to the page , so you do n't  have extra stuff to flip . <p> Craig : I do n't  print . I print my scripts when I do a revision , you know , when I am going through with pen . And that is it . The next time I see my printed script is at a table read . And then from there on , the only printed stuff I see are sides on the set . I do n't  do all of this binder <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant get past it . <p> Craig : Alright . <p> John : To the point where we actually printed out all of my sort of current , and sort of semi-archival scripts , and have them in binders now on the shelf there . And its so good I will have a question on something , I will pick it up off the shelf . It is printed here . <p> Craig : Stuart , if you came and worked for me , nothing would happen . You would n't even have to go to work . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> Craig : Yeah . The easiest job . <p> John : Maybe he could watch all the TV shows and the movies that you do n't  watch . <p> Craig : He could just fill me in every morning . Call me up and Its like TV Guide when they used to have those little synopses . That is where " Wackiness ensues " came from . <p> John : I like that . One of Stuarts functions is he goes through and checks like a lot of the blogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs I would n't look at , because he looks at other blogs , and sort of puts up a list of articles of possible blog interest which has been so helpful , so like things that I might want to blog about . He has little links there for me . <p> Craig : Wow . <p> John : He is a curator for me . <p> Craig : He really is. laughs He is a curator . Its amazing . I do n't  have that . But I do n't  need curation . <p> John : No . Yeah , you are already perfect , so <p> Craig : No , you know what it is ? Honestly , I really do , while you are watching Glam and Smash , are those shows ? I just made them up . laughs <p> John : Glee and Smash , yes . <p> Craig : When you are watching Glee and Smash , I am just spidering my way through the Internet like a Web-bot , just following links , and reading . <p> One of my favorite sites is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Its great . <p> John : Thats curated , yeah . <p> Craig : But I also love Arts and Letters Daily . I do n't  know if you read that one . aldaily.com . <p> John : No , but I will . <p> Craig : Arts and Letters Daily . Great thing to promote on the podcast . Each day they have links to three things , usually an essay , a review , and some kind of article . And they are always from really interesting and very literate sources . Online magazines you would never otherwise even know existed . Drama periodicals . Policy journals . City Journal . Its a really great thing . <p> Its like incredibly smart people writing about really interesting things , and completely off the beaten path of mainstream Internet . And I go there every day . Its fantastic . <p> John : My last closing thing I love that I will rave about , which I am reading on Kindle right now , is The Great Big Book of Horrible Things . I do n't  know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Definitive Chronicle of Historys 100 Worst Atrocities . <p> So , it is military history , largely . It is basically all of the wars that killed millions of people throughout history . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : And there 's a lot of them , man . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : People are kind of terrible to each other quite frequently . <p> Craig : And they have been sort of increasingly less so ; even though we think the world is getting worse , it is actually getting better . <p> John : Yeah . The tradeoff though is that we have the capacity to kill a lot more people at once . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : So before , it was hard to kill a bunch of people with swords . We did it , but it was really hard to do . And then we developed newer ways to do a lot of those things . <p> What is fascinating is we always think about sort of the despot or the tyrant who killed a bunch of people , and there are certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at killing a bunch of people . But it tends to be the situations where governmental structures fall apart . It is where there is a power vacuum ended up being much more dangerous for people , because then it was a bunch of different groups all fighting each other and it would n't stop for like 100 years . <p> Craig : I think Mao still is the winner . He gets the medal , right , for killing the most people ? <p> John : I have n't seen I did n't  cheat . So I did n't  look through to figure out who the winners are . So I am actually going through . Its a long <p> Craig : I bet you the Great Leap Forward is way high up the list . <p> John : Its got to be . <p> Craig : And then the Writers Strike of 2007 is probablymy guess is that is like number 4 or 5 . <p> John : laughs What is so fascinating , as I pull this up on Amazon , because I want to say how many pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Kindle , and I know it is super long , but I did n't  have a good sense of how long it was . 668 pages . <p> Craig : Oh man ! They should have just trimmed two pages and been cool . <p> John : Yeah . But that is the other weird thing about Kindle books is I have no idea how long they are . <p> Craig : I know . Its weird . I wish that they would fix that . <p> John : Yeah . So Justin Cronin wrote this book called The Passage . And I started reading it . I was like , " Oh , I 'm enjoying this ; this is really good . I must be just about through . " And then I pulled up the little counter thing , and I was less than an eighth of the way through .

@@42311707 @2311707/ <p> If you 're writing the pilot episode of a TV series , you have a choice to make : will this episode be more-or-less typical for the series , or will it be The Beginning ? <p> The latter are called premise pilots , because they establish the underlying premise of the series how it all came to be . In screenplay-speak , premise pilots contain the inciting incident of the entire series . Without this event , the series would be fundamentally different . <p> Many of the pilots you remember were premise pilots : <p> Lost : The plane crashes on the island . <p> Moonlighting : Dave meets Maddie . <p> Remington Steele : Con-man assumes role of fictional detective . <p> Buffy : Buffy moves to Sunnydale , meets friends . <p> Angel : Angel moves to Los Angeles . <p> Six Feet Under : Father dies , leaving funeral business to his sons . <p> Frasier : Dad moves in . <p> Heroes : An eclipse reveals people with superpowers . <p> Arrested Development : Father arrested . <p> 30 Rock : Liz meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . <p> Desperate Housewives : The narrator kills herself . <p> Star Trek ( TNG ) : Characters meet for first time . <p> Star Trek ( DS9 ) : Sisko takes over as commander . <p> Star Trek ( Voyager ) : Ship stranded in the Delta Quadrant . <p> Other shows start with non-premise pilots that could have just as easily been episode four : <p> Star Trek ( TOS ) ( Both the Kirk and Pike versions ) . <p> South Park <p> The Office ( British and U.S. ) <p> Mad About You <p> The Simpsons <p> Gilmore Girls <p> Seinfeld <p> Law &amp; Order <p> Remember : a premise pilot does n't  mean introducing the setup to the audience . A premise pilot is about what 's new inside the world of the show . Its the big thing that 's changed which marks this The Beginning . <p> For shows that last several seasons , it may become easier to argue that the events of the pilot werent fundamental to the premise . For example , if you only watch the first season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it is the first time Sam and Diane meet . But several seasons in , its clear that Sam and Dianes relationship is n't fundamental to the show . 1 <p> By the same logic , True Blood feels like a premise pilot now Bill and Sookie meet but as the show has evolved , its easy to see other moments that could have been the starting point . <h> Why this matters <p> Networks hate premise pilots . Studios , too . They will flatly tell you that they do n't  want to make premise pilots . They may offer a few reasons why , but one stands above rest : <p> Premise pilots do n't  feel like the show . Its often hard to get a sense how a " normal " episode of the show will function based on a premise pilot . Watching fifteen pilots , the network wants to pick the shows it feels it understands . They want to know what episode eight will be like . That 's hard to do with a premise pilot . <p> So studios and networks will insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do : roughly half the new shows every fall begin with a premise pilot . The Good Wife is a premise pilot . Same with Glee , Mike and Molly , Undercovers , The Event , Vampire Diaries , Outsourced , Hawaii 5-0 and $#* ! My Dad Says . <p> In fact , outside of true procedurals ( body-of-the-week like CSI ) and family shows , its rare to find a series that does n't  start with something of a premise pilot . The trick may be to do it less overtly , introducing one small-but-important change in the world rather declaring this day one . <p> In the pilot episode of Friends , Rachel arrives at Central Perk in a wedding dress , having bailed on her nuptials . If this was called The Jennifer Aniston Show , it would clearly be a premise pilot . But because the six primary characters already had relationships Ross and Monica already knew Rachel I 'd argue that it falls in a middle ground I 'll call One New Guy . You 're introducing a new member to an existing group . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daughter Lily to the rest of the extended family , but if she had been introduced in episode four or ten or twenty , the basic dynamics of the show would have been the same . Everyone already knew each other . The arrival of Lily made a good starting point for the audience , but it was n't the start of the family . <p> Similarly , Adam Scott joins the catering company in the pilot of Party Down . Structurally , the episode works like any other , just that characters are introducing themselves to him . <p> Both of these are examples of One New Guy . In Party Down , the newbie is more central to the action , but its not his show . You could do an episode without him , but you probably would n't do an episode that focused on him but not the rest of the cast . <p> I 've written one pilot of each type . D.C. is clearly a premise pilot : the gang meets and moves into the house . Alaska is a One New Guy , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ordinary episode , with the company already up and running . <p> If you take away nothing else from this , let me stress again that a premise pilot is n't about setting up the characters or world every pilot has to let the audience figure out who 's who and what 's what . A premise pilot is about Something Happening that marks the pilot as the beginning .

I took jobs that paid less but had better hours , had more flexible vacation days , were closer to my house , or had any other factor that would give me more time to write . I would write during lunch breaks , and save up my vacation time to work on scripts . I also wanted to become familiar with the production process , so I took classes in directing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time writing , I was painfully aware of the opportunity cost of what I was n't doing .

I knew the odds were ridiculous " less than 1 in a 1000 " but actually knowing someone who succeeded made it seem within the realm of possibility . I decided to apply . <h> Rocky , I &amp; II <p> In order to apply to the writing programs , you need a television spec script . I had written several shorts and a couple features , but never a spec . So I read some books on TV writing , and wrote an episode of The Office . <p> In the fall , I heard I was a semifinalist for the Nick Fellowship . I had a phone interview , an in-person interview , and ended up as one of four finalists . That brought three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creators . <p> Only three fellows were chosen that year , and I was the only finalist who did not make it . I had gotten too nervous in some of the interviews . During those interviews , they do n't  even look at your writing ; they look at your personality , and at how well you sell yourself . I was horrible at selling myself ; writing ability alone is n't enough . <p> When Rocky fought Apollo Creed the first time he did n't  win , but he did n't  lose either . Just getting to that point was a personal victory for me . It was validation that I was on the right track , and that all of the hours spent writing had n't been a complete waste . If I could have another shot , I could make it . <p> Cue the music for a Rocky training sequence . <p> I immediately went to work on another spec , this time for 30 Rock , and applied again . I took an improv class , a TV writing class , and made another short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was prepared for all those interviews this time . <p> In Rocky II , ( spoiler alert ) Rocky wins .

We usually have six weeks to write a script , which includes researching a show , pitching premises , outlining , and doing multiple drafts , and we 're usually working on several scripts at once . <p> I was used to writing in short bursts at nights and on weekends , not for eight hours a day , and I used to write scripts leisurely over the course of several months , not in six weeks . My writing muscles were quickly whipped into shape . <p> After writing several specs for network shows , each of us was given the opportunity work with the EIC ( Executive in Charge ) and write a spec of a Nickelodeon show .

I had seen some of the character art and was given the show bible and a bunch of scripts , but I did n't know how the characters would look or sound , or what the shows timing and rhythm would be like . It was a challenge , but the EIC provided guidance along the way . <p> Besides just paying us to write , the Fellowship opens doors by setting up meetings with people at the studio , including current and development execs , line producers , coordinators , writers , and Fellowship alumni . We 're working on more specs as well as a pilot , and I 'm about to sit in on the writers ' rooms for Robot &amp; Monster . <p> Ideally , I would love to get staffed on a Nickelodeon show before the Fellowship ends , and then at some point , I 'd like to put my art school education to use and pitch my own animated show . Were halfway done with the Fellowship , and it has already been a life changing experience .

While we 've worked in the industry for years and have written a lot of work , were still fighting to get represented or to make a sale . here 's where the question comes in : <p> About a year ago we got hooked up with a producer from a major studio who was willing to read our work and develop scripts with us . Hed read some work of ours and said that he liked the writing . That 's great ! After bouncing around some of our ideas we began working on an original idea of his . <p> We spent hours upon hours putting together draft after draft and adjusting to an onslaught of notes that we would get back . Every time would be , " this is good but " and then he would ask us to change the whole story . We would oblige ( because were nobodies and he s a working producer ) and then start from scratch , re-build the story and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were things that we did n't  agree with and felt that they took the script in a direction we did n't  like . This was an endless cycle . But we dealt with it in hopes that it would matter . <p> Eventually we finally got a story that he " liked " ( because he apparently no longer liked the story he pitched us originally ) and we thought we were ready for him to show it around to other producers or to agents/managers but instead he s asked that we sit with him and go through the script line by line so that he can correct it . Line . By . Line . <p> We know that notes are part of the process and were very receptive to constructive criticism but seeing as how were not getting paid for this work and he s basically asking us to transcribe his every thought into Final Draft ( thoughts we do n't  even see eye to eye on ) at what point are we just being abused and wasting our time ? <p> Seeing as this is the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far to have any sort of " break-in " were desperately holding on to it but it keeps feeling more and more demeaning and pointless . Thoughts ? <p> Brandon and Gabriel Los Angeles , CA <p> Your suspicions are correct : this wo n't stop until you make it stop . <p> You 're essentially doing spec work writing without getting paid . While you own the words you 've written , the producer can ( reasonably ) claim some ownership of the story . Hell be attached to whatever screenplay you end up with . <p> But take comfort : you 're not alone . <p> This is a very common situation for screenwriters at the beginning of their careers . In fact , I 'd guess that most working screenwriters have an anecdote similar to yours . <p> I spent six months rewriting a draft of my first screenplay with a former development executive who I later realized had few connections and zero ability to actually get a movie made . She pinned all my hopes on getting one agent at CAA to read my script . We waited two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience was , I can also look at it from her perspective : she invested many hours reading and meeting with me . She truly believed in my script , and wanted to make it better . The worst I can fault her for is over-estimating her abilities as a producer . <p> I suspect the situation is similar with your producer . He sees himself as a Good Guy , and does n't  hear your groans of annoyance . <p> Your challenge now is to find a way out of this bad situation while maintaining a good relationship . Before starting on any new work , you need to have a conversation with him about exactly what the next steps will be . <p> For starters , you need an agent or a manager . Conveniently , he deals with agents and managers all the time , so he needs to pick up the phone and call a few on your behalf . <p> He may balk at first , not wanting to send out the script you 're writing for him . That 's fine . You have other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You also need to set some mutual deadlines . " So , well get you these changes on Tuesday . Then were going to send it to ( appropriate director ) to read for the weekend , right ? " <p> Just so you know , these situations never really end . Producer notes will always grow to fill the amount of time you have and then bleed past the edges . Even with an agent or manager to play bad cop , screenwriters are constantly balancing the need to keep producers happy and keep the process moving along . Thats part of the job .

If you 're from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that second language may be the default . <p> But beyond what you pick up from your family or neighbors , your first non-English language should be Spanish or Mandarin . <h> My logic and biases <p> I was born in the U.S. Im fluent in English . I 'm competent in Spanish , less so in French . I can ask directions in German , Portuguese , Japanese and Mandarin , with declining likelihood of being able to understand the answer given . I live at the edge of Koreatown , and while I can read Hangul well enough to decipher transliterated signs , I do n't  speak the language at all . <p> I learned Spanish starting in second grade , part of a bilingual project in my elementary school in Colorado . Obviously , part of the reason I admire the language is that its the first one I learned . <p> There is a misperception that one " needs " to speak Spanish in Southern California . In 17 years here , I can count on one hand the number of times in which my Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think people should speak several languages , not only for the opportunities it presents for international business and travel , but the broader global and literary perspective it provides . You 're going to learn one language first . Pick wisely . <p> My criteria were , roughly : <p> Number of people who speak it worldwide <p> Usefulness in daily life <p> Usefulness in international business or travel <p> Availability of media in that language <p> Applicability to future language learning <p> Economic power of native speakers <h> The contenders <p> Hindi ( #3 ) and Arabic ( #5 ) both have vast numbers on their side . With satellite , access to media in both languages has increased worldwide . They are clearly useful languages for business and travel . But I cant make a compelling case for learning either of these before Spanish or Mandarin . I 'm happy to be convinced otherwise ; my American bias may be coming through . <p> Portuguese ( #6 ) , Russian ( #8 ) , Japanese ( #9 ) are each spoken mostly in their respective economically-powerful countries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you intend to do business in those countries , but its hard to argue that they should be general-case choices . <p> German ( #10 ) shares roots with English , though that does n't  necessarily make it easy to learn . English is widely taught in Germany , which makes learning German less essential for native English speakers than it might be otherwise . <p> French ( #12 ) has a tremendous amount of literature and Western Civilization in its favor . While the total number of French speakers is n't that high , there is fairly wide distribution given the languages role in international diplomacy . As a romance language , it shares a lot of structure with Spanish . I found it quick to learn given what I already knew . <p> I 'm omitting Cantonese just based on numbers . More people speak all of the languages listed above . Learning Mandarin would put an English speaker on a path towards learning Cantonese later . I 'm guessing familiarity with a tonal language like Mandarin could be a help for other Asian languages in general . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special place in my heart . <h> The case for Mandarin or Spanish <p> Mandarin is the most commonly spoken language in the world , 1 and Chinas influence will only grow in the years ahead . China is an active investor worldwide , including Africa and South America , yet distribution of Mandarin speakers is relatively sparse outside of Asia . Fluency in English and Mandarin could be a tremendous asset . <p> Cons for Mandarin : Its a more challenging language for native English speakers . Learning its rhythms , tones and phonemes and writing system would take a lot of work . But getting that practice early in life would be a boon . Currently , there are limited outlets for Mandarin media in the U.S. Ones ability to actively use the language may be limited based on location . <p> Spanish is the fourth most common language after English and Hindi . Its tremendously useful in the Western hemisphere spoken in almost all of Central and South America with the notable exception of Brazil . 2 In the U.S. , one finds an abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Spanish on a daily basis without ever leaving the country . <p> While it has a daunting number of conjugations , Spanish is grammatically straightforward and remarkably consistent with pronunciation and sound rules , which makes it well-suited for school-based study . With its Latin roots , it has tremendous vocabulary overlap with English and most European languages . Learning Spanish early may increase overall English vocabulary as well.3 <p> Cons for Spanish : While the number of Spanish speakers will probably continue to grow , there is no reason to anticipate its reach expanding beyond its current borders . Its certainly more useful in the U.S. than in the U.K. or Australia . Fluency in Spanish is so common in the U.S. that its not a particularly unique or marketable asset . <h> Should we bother teaching other languages ? <p> In high school , yes . In college , absolutely . You need to reward motivated students who want to learn languages . But I 'd argue that in grade school and junior high , we would serve students better by offering them either Spanish or Mandarin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. native speakers ) to teach Spanish . I 'm not sure we have the capacity for Mandarin . <p> So have at it . Can you make a compelling case for something other than Spanish or Mandarin as a first foreign language for a native English speaker ? <p> The exact numbers vary based on what degree you differentiate native languages from secondary languages , and how much you assume dialects are mutually intelligible . Regardless , the big four stay on top . ? <p> Like French , Spanish has many recognizable cognates with English . Dormir : : dormitory , blanco : : blanch . This does n't  mean the words came from Spanish , but rather than the words reveal common roots , which is so very helpful come SAT time . ?

In this case , Rebecca : <p> I 've always wondered why the movie Lars and the Real Girl was n't released more widely . I only read rave reviews about it and everyone I know who saw it loved it . I thoroughly enjoyed it . They did n't even release it widely enough to make a profit , the dumbasses . <p> The Proposal opened this past weekend in 3056 theaters and grossed $33,627,598 for an average of $11,004 per theater . <p> At 5 weeks , Lars and the Real Girl averaged $2,456 per theater after the number of theaters was reduced from its peak the week before . <p> The latest Night at the Museum , just averaged $2,636 this week , its 5th . <p> It looks to me like decent marketing in various markets , in conjunction with a much wider release , could have made this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a LOT more money . Can you explain why it would not have made sense to release it into more than 321 theaters during its entire run ? Other than thinking that challenging , quirky and maddening = noncommercial , I mean ? <p> Apples , meet oranges . <p> Per-screen average is simply math : a given films box office divided by the number of screens it plays on.1 As a pure number , it tells you nothing about the size of theater , the percentage of seats sold , or what would be typical for that theater on that night . <p> Bringing in $2,300 over a weekend might be a great haul at a tiny theater in Des Moines , but would be a disaster at Graumans Chinese . <p> The number is only useful when comparing movies in fairly similar situations . If The Happy Harpist made $44,000 at four theaters , and My Third Elbow made $10,000 at three , its fair to say that Harpist is outperforming Elbow with an $11,000 per-screen average . <p> But drill deeper , and you might find reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible Harpist made $34,000 on one of its screens , and only $10,000 on the other three . Maybe its a hometown director , or other special circumstance.2 Take away that one theater , and Harpist and Elbow are now a dead heat . <p> More importantly , if you 're one of the low-performing theaters for Harpist , your per-screen average is only $3,333 . You will make your decisions about whether to keep playing the movie based on that number . Never forget that distributors do n't  ultimately decide which movies stick around in theaters ; the exhibitors do . They look at their internal numbers to decide which movies will make them the most money . <p> With a small number of screens , per-screen average is hugely affected by variations between individual venues . The denominator which screens , and where matters a lot . <p> Conversely <p> With a big number of screens , per-screen average is relatively unaffected by variations between individual venues . If you 're playing in 4,000+ screens , it does n't  matter nearly as much which screens those are . You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Distributors desperately scramble to get as many good screens as they can , simply so they can generate as much money as they can .

But if you look at Junos weekend boxoffice breakdown , you 'll see that it never came close to its opening weekend $59,124 per-screen average again . As it climbed to 2,000 screens , the per-screen average plummeted because the denominator had gotten so big . Trust me : Fox Searchlight did n't  care . They were too busy making gobs of money . <p> Same for The Proposal . Same for Night at the Museum 2 . Unlike the makers of Lars and the Real Girl , who carefully selected each of the seven venues it debuted upon like Goldilocks , not too big , not too small the studios releasing blockbusters want as many seats as possible .

She conveniently omits that on that weekend it earned $7.8 million . Money is money . Per-screen average is just a figure . <h> Back to Lars <p> While its absolutely fair to play Monday morning quarterback on a movie you love and believe could have made more money , the folks who released Lars and the Real Girl are not dumbasses . You can disagree with their marketing and perhaps their release date . I would n't be surprised if the filmmakers feel disappointed . But they clearly tried to platform the movie much like Juno , and it did n't  work . <p> Both Juno and Lars started in three theaters , then expanded to 300 in their third week . But Juno far out-earned Lars at every step . By the time it went wide , Juno also had the advantage of the Christmas holiday . <p> As you 're looking at the Lars chart , rather than focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the % Change column . Starting with Nov 2-4 , it was making less each week . It was on a decline .

Many indies would love to reach that number . <p> Could Lars have made more money ? Perhaps with a different combination of marketing and luck . But per-screen average has nothing to do with it , and using that figure to compare it to wide releases is specious . Limited releases have high per-screen averages because they 're on so few screens , not despite it . <p> And even then , its a messy measurement .

We should really be in there a little longer . Keep that in mind when your newborn does nothing but sleep , eat and cry that first month or two . Like bullying , It Gets Better . <p> Babies want to be alive . The first few weeks with a newborn are mostly about not killing it . A little paranoia is healthy .

But you do n't  need to lock them away . In fact , getting out of the house with them will help restore your sanity . <p> Newborns are highly portable . Its easier to travel with a newborn than a two-year old . You can take them to restaurants , or to friends houses for dinner . They can sleep in pack-and-plays . So take advantage of these easy , early months . You 're not supposed to get them around little kids germs for the first bit , but breakfast out is a great idea . <p> Everyone will have an opinion . Particularly about things related to sleep : swings , swaddling , binkies , etc . I say , if these things help your kid sleep , they help you be a less-stressed parent , and everyone wins . I found the five ss from The Happiest Baby to be damn-near miraculous , but every kid is different . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't  have a strong opinion about co-sleeping , but from my observation of other families , the transition from sleeping in the parents bed to the kids own bed is torturous . Like any habit , if you never start , you never have to stop . <p> Teach your kid the difference between day and night . Its the only way you 'll ever get a good nights sleep . Part of it is light . Do n't  darken the room too much during daytime naps , and keep the lights dim during overnight feedings . <p> But your activity level is just as important . Daytime Parent is happy and smiling , chatting and playing . Nighttime Parent is a robot who feeds and changes . Once the kid understands that waking up at night is n't fun , theyll stop . <p> Breastfeeding is great . If you have milk-filled boobs , use them . But do n't  feel guilty if its impossible or impractical . Lost in all the praise for breastfeeding is the fact that baby formula is also pretty damn good . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad one . <p> Diapers are always on sale somewhere . You should almost never need to pay full price . Find coupons . Its worth it . <p> Do n't  buy too much .

By any normal standard , it was way too many people to have on a stage , but we managed to make it work . My thanks to the panelists , the WGA and the Writers Guild Foundation for putting it all together . <p> The organizers had already decided there would n't be a Q&amp;A afterwards , but I wanted to give the audience a chance to participate a little . So I told them to tweet their best question to @johnaugust . I would pick one to ask before the end of the session . <p> I chose one by @oHaiZZ : <p> Lawrence Turman suggests asking random people for their opinions of your concept . Any panelists do this or is mums the word ? <p> Aaron Sorkin cautioned that talking about what you 're planning to write can easily sap your enthusiasm for it . Stuart Blumberg agreed , noting that even one meh response might scare you off your dream project . <p> Lisa Cholodenko said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had n't  talked to many folks about the plot . Only after the movie was finished did an executive mention that shed read a couple of scripts with similar storylines over the years . Had Cholodenko known there were competing projects , she might have had second thoughts , worried that someone would beat her to the screen . <p> I largely agree with these opinions , but I also agree with Turman . I think the difference is that Larry Turman is a producer , not a writer . <p> A producer serves several functions , but one of the most important is pitchman . He needs to convince directors , actors , studios and ultimately audiences to invest their time and money in a movie . So he s constantly testing and refining his message . He does n't  have to write " Wuthering Heights with mummies " he just has to gauge if there 's interest . If no one sparks to it , he has very little at stake . <p> The writer , on the other hand , has spent days , weeks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derailed and never finish . So my advice depends on your job title : <p> Producer pitch constantly . <p> Screenwriter zip it and write . <h> The 20-page threshold <p> Several panelists mentioned how valuable they found it to get feedback from trusted colleagues at around the 20-page mark . By that point , you 're far enough into the script to feel you have a handle on it . You hopefully like what you 've written . But you 're wondering if its actually any good . <p> That 's a good time to get feedback . <p> It does n't  have to be 20 pages . For Monsterpocalypse , I shared the first act . For Preacher , it was 45 pages . In both cases , enthusiastic feedback gave me a nice bounce of energy to help me finish . <p> Yes , you 're taking a risk that you 'll get a bad reaction . But if its not working at this stage , its unlikely the problems would magically resolve themselves by page 120 . Very few good movies have bad first acts . Its worth stopping forward progress to get the beginning right .

I competed in solo at state . <p> I was good but certainly not a prodigy , which made clarinet much easier to give up in high school . I was only sacrificing the time I 'd invested , rather than my future career as a clarinet superstar.2 <h> Piano or guitar <p> Clarinet was actually my second instrument . <p> I took piano first , which is how I learned to read music and the basics like counting beats and time signatures another reason I was far ahead when I started clarinet . <p> I dropped piano in fifth grade because clarinet demanded more of my time ( band practice and lessons ) and because of simple peer assessment : I was only average at piano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at clarinet . <p> The problem is , success at clarinet does n't  translate to music as a whole . I never learned chord progression , because clarinet plays one note at a time . I forgot how to read bass clef , because clarinet is written in treble .

Every genre , every era , every song written . Sure : Some things are better suited for the piano than others , but its the all-purpose instrument . The five years we 've been working on the Broadway version of Big Fish have been spent singing at a piano .

And theyll have a good musical background if they spent years on piano or guitar . <h> Great , so how do you teach every kid piano and/or guitar ? <p> I have no idea . <p> Look : I get why we have grade school bands . The simple instruments play one note at a time , and require less hands-on instruction by the teacher . We have a publishing industry that creates sheet music so that twenty-five kids can lurch through a patriotic medley . While I think teaching kids trombone is misguided , I have nothing but respect for music teachers sticking it out in times of shrinking budgets and quantitative academic obsession . <p> I do n't  know what twenty-five kids on piano looks like , or sounds like .

Parents decide what kind of musical education a child receives , and on this smaller scale , my point is much easier to make : <p> Skip band and get your kid started on piano or guitar . <p> Ideally , find a music teacher , relative or other adult to provide instruction .

But I 'm here and handy , so I can least talk you through the exceptions . <p> There are some studios and production companies that are not signatories to the WGA . They can only hire non-WGA writers . I know some fledgling writers whove written entire scripts for $5,000 which might be okay given their needs and goals . Likewise , feature animation is not typically covered by the guild , including the animated projects Ive written ( Titan A.E . and Corpse Bride ) .

Many of the films at Sundance are written by writers with no connection to Hollywood or the WGA . The Guild has indie contracts that can offer some protections , but they 're optional . Likewise , international productions are largely outside the auspices of guilds and unions . But in my experience , when I meet international screenwriters they 're always wishing they could have an organization with the clout of the WGA .

@@42311752 @2311752/ <p> Craig Mazin and Alex Epstein both recently tackled a topic that was on my to-blog list . Yes , I keep a list of things I intend to blog . And yes , I tend to just write whatever strikes me at the moment anyway . But since Alex and Craig got to it first , I might as well say what I was going to say . <p> At issue is whether its a good idea for the screenwriter to specify ethnicities for various characters . Alex believes in doing the " diversity pass " to keep his script from being lily-white . Craig feels this is absurd and racist . <p> Craig is wrong . <p> But not for the reasons youd expect . While Craig and I tend to be on different wavelengths politically , he tends to come down on the side of common sense . And I think there 's a very practical matter that 's being overlooked . <p> Unless its important for understanding a story point , I rarely specify a race for a character . But that 's not to say I wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant GONZALEZ rather than GOODMAN . The internist is more likely to end up DR . CHO than DR . CHASE . The schoolteacher will be PATEL rather than PETERS . <p> Is it liberal guilt ? No . Its readability . <p> Screenplays are read quickly . Unlike a novel , you do n't  linger for a few paragraphs getting to know minor characters , setting up their memorable quirks . Rather , you meet them on page 20 , then see them again on page 64 . As a screenwriter , you want the reader to instantly recall that theyve encountered a certain character before . <p> A reader is much more likely to remember an international banker named Abebayehu Tegene than Abe Thompson . <p> You can debate why this is . Maybe its just that the name is more interesting . But in most cases , I think its because were hard-wired to match race to surnames . We see Abebayehu Tegene and we think , " This character is black . Not only that , he s probably African . " We form a mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With Abe Thompson , the reader has nothing to latch onto . Abe Thompson is just a name . <p> Note that giving a character an African surname does n't  remove the burden of actually making this character interesting . If he says more than a few lines , there better be something notable about him independent of race . Both Tegene and Thompson might be condescending snobs who openly mock our hero . <p> But come page 64 , you 'll still remember Tegene over Thompson . <p> In the real world , what are the implications of implying ethnicities for these characters ? As I 've noted earlier , when casting , the assumption tends to be " white unless otherwise specified . " But if you write " Judge Fujimoro " rather than " Judge Foster , " there 's a pretty good chance you 'll end up with a Japanese judge . <p> You might find that stereotypical , or an example of blatant tokenism , such as the " black lieutenant syndrome " which hit cop shows in the 90s .

To me , its time well spent . <p> Obviously , there 's a lot more that can be written about race and screenwriting . As I noted in an earlier post , the role of Ronna in Go was written as African-American . We ended up casting Sarah Polley , perhaps the whitest Canadian you could find . So was I right to write " Black " in the script ?

Its probably helpful to include a " ( singing ) " parenthetical the first time you do it , because some readers may not catch it otherwise . And yes , dialogue in italics can also be used for foreign languages , so you 'll need to make sure its clear in context . <p> here 's where the former graphic designer in me resurfaces .

Verdana Italic , because I needed to send those scripts in as . pdf files , and you can safely count on just about any computer having Verdana installed . <p> Why 11 pt. , when the main text is set at 12 pt. ?

@@42311761 @2311761/ <p> So , I 'm watching " Gosford Park " and I notice that the film is " based upon an idea by Robert Altman and Bob Balaban . " <p> My question is : How does one get that credit ? Do you have to do some actual writing for it or is it some sort of a vanity credit ? ( I assume it is n't , because otherwise every producer or executive type would have a whole stack of those on their record . ) <p> SteffenNuremberg , Germany <p> Craig Mazin is on the screen credits committee , so he can likely answer this more thoroughly . But I can at least give you my take on it . <p> For feature films , the official WGA credits are " Story by " and " Screenplay by , " which can be combined to make " Written by . " 1 When something is based on preexisting source material , like a book or a play , that original writer gets a " based on a novel/play by Original Writer . " 2 <p> Your instincts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely do they get a specific , additional credit for it . However , if they wrote those ideas down , even in prose form , they could very likely get " story " or " source material " credit . <p> Source material is all material , other than story as hereinafter defined , upon which the story and/or screenplay is based . <p> This means that source material is material assigned to the writer which was previously published or exploited and upon which the writers work is to be based ( e.g. , a novel , a produced play or series of published articles ) , or any other material written outside of the Guilds jurisdiction ( e.g. , literary material purchased from a non-professional writer ) . Illustrative examples of source material credits are : " From a Play by " , " From a Novel by " , " Based upon a Story by " , " From a series of articles by " , " Based upon a Screenplay by " or other appropriate wording indicating the form in which such source material is acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) Story <p> The term " story " means all writing covered by the provisions of the Minimum Basic Agreement representing a contribution " distinct from screenplay and consisting of basic narrative , idea , theme or outline indicating character development and action . " <p> It is appropriate to award a " Story by " credit when : 1 ) the story was written under employment under Guild jurisdiction ; 2 ) the story was purchased by a signatory company from a professional writer , as defined in the Minimum Basic Agreement ; or 3 ) when the screenplay is based upon a sequel story written under the Guilds jurisdiction . If the story is based upon source material of a story nature , see " screen story " below . <p> When you see a credit like " based on an idea by , " that 's clearly a " source material " type of credit . In the case of Gosford Park , it may have been the strange way Robert Altman shoots . Apparently , rather than a complete screenplay , they had a framework upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to help shape the scenes . <p> Regardless of the specific situation , I 'm not a fan of the " based on an idea by " credit , and would like to see it stay rare . It over-emphasizes the vague conception of a movie , at the expense of the distinctions provided by characters , narrative , theme and action ( that is , story ) . <p> For example , " a movie about the Civil War " is an idea . Gone With The Wind is a story . For them to have rough equivalence is absurd . <p> There is also a very rare " Adaptation by " credit , which is only given in specific , complicated situations . ? <p> Where it gets weird is when a movie is based on an earlier movies screenplay , such as a remake of a foreign film .

@@42311762 @2311762/ <p> I am interested in becoming an assistant to a TV or Film writer . I have experience in the industry as an assistant to a Producer/CEO of a Production company , but I 'm not sure what the qualifications are to be a writers assistant or how to apply for the job . <p> Beth <p> I 'm passing off the question to my own very capable assistant , Rawson Thurber , who is an aspiring writer/director in his own right . He first started working with me on the TV show DC ; and continued on with me since . <p> The qualifications to be a writers assistant are by no means Herculean . As long as you have basic assistant skills ( answering the phone without hurting yourself , computer literacy and a working knowledge of the film &amp; TV industry ) you 're already there , especially if you 've already assisted a producer/CEO of a production company . <p> The more important question you should ask yourself is : why do you want to be a writers assistant ? Generally speaking , if your answer is anything other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself " , then you shouldnt be one . There are other Hollywood jobs that pay better and have better chance for advancement . <p> That said , there is a big difference between being an assistant to a TV writer versus a feature writer . If you work for a TV writer , you 'll usually be working for the show-runner , the main voice/architect behind the show , in addition to doing the **29;667;TOOLONG for all the other staff writers . You 'll sit in on all the writers meetings , taking notes : jokes , storylines , plot points , etc . <p> Working on a television show , especially a sitcom , can keep you up until all hours of the night . When its crunch-time , several of my writers assistant friends do n't  get home until 2 or 3 in the morning for several days in a row ( weekends included ) . It can be exhausting and exhilarating ( you learn how a writers room is run and how a television show is produced from politics to post-production ) . But it is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows promote from within , and occasionally farm-out an episode or two to promising assistants you just cant say that about CAA . <p> Working as an assistant to a feature writer is generally less demanding , but just as educational . Of course you learn the tricks of the trade : what works and what does n't  work in a two hour movie , how to deal with studio executives and how to ignore or embrace notes ( sometimes contradictory or just plain wrong ) given from all sides . This is , of course , on top of the usual assistant duties of research , faxing , and scheduling lunches , meetings , pitches , parties and premieres . <p> The only words of warning I would offer , before jumping headfirst into this breed of assistant-hood , is to understand that writing is a solitary process . Whomever you work for will spend most of his or her time behind closed doors creating . This leaves you with a lot of time to spend doing what you 're there to do , which is write . <p> Additionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production company . There 's usually only one or two projects going on at a time , not fifteen , and its just you and your writer , usually in separate rooms there is n't much " office culture " to be had , so if you 're looking for football pools or water cooler gossip , best look elsewhere . Lastly , and this is the most important one , only work for a writer whose writing you respect . There are plenty of millionaire screenwriting hacks out there and life is too short to begrudge your boss his or her success . <p> Being a writers assistant can be a wonderful apprenticeship , just be sure you want the job when you finally earn your stripes . <p> John would like to add : For the record , not all that many feature screenwriters have assistants . Partly that 's because the workday life of a feature writer is generally less hectic fewer meetings and less to stay on top of and partly its because many feature writers work in their homes .

@@42311763 @2311763/ <p> My Pencils Down article got a lot of links , which led many first-time readers to the site . Most had little experience with screenwriting or the entertainment industry , so its no surprise that the concept of residuals was , frankly , odd . <p> My friend Jeff often jokes ( half-jokes , I think ) that he wishes he got residuals on spreadsheets he made in 2003 . He s articulating a familiar frustration : Why should screenwriters get paid extra money years after they finish their work ? After all , plumbers do n't  get residuals . Neither do teachers , secretaries or auto workers . <p> So I want to explain why writers in film and television get residuals , and why they 're at the heart of the ongoing WGA strike . <h> The standard analogies <p> Let 's say you 're a Nashville songwriter . You write a song that Carrie Underwood records and takes to number one . You get paid royalties for writing that song : albums sold , radio plays , the generic Christmas Muzak version . A hit song is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth a moderate amount of money . <p> Or let 's assume you 're a novelist . Youre John Grisham , and you write a legal thriller that half the folks on a given flight are reading . You get paid a royalty for every book sold . Like a hit song , a best-seller is worth a lot of money . A book that does n't  sell as well earns the author less . <p> In both examples , the way an artist makes money is not necessarily upfront ( writing the book or song ) but over the course of years . These creative works are annuities that keep generating money , for both the writer and the publisher . Every year , copies are sold . Every year , writer and publisher make money.1 <p> Ill stop here to say that if you do n't  think songwriters or novelists deserve royalties , I 've lost you . Everything else I 'm about to say is predicated on the belief that a creator ( i.e. songwriter , novelist ) is entitled to profit from the success of his or her work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes a check , all bets are off thanks for reading this far . Were done . <p> If you 're still with me , let 's play hypotheticals . What would happen if songwriters and novelists did n't  receive royalties ? <p> It would be a lot harder to make a career in either field . <p> Most songs do n't  become hits . Most novels do n't  become best-sellers . Songwriters and novelists may only create new , money-generating work every few years . Royalties are what pay the bills in the meantime . Without royalties , very few people could afford to write songs or books for a living . These pursuits would become hobbies for the rich , or patrons of the rich . ( And in fact , Western literature was largely written by the people who could afford to write . ) <p> ? Royalties allow for a middle class . <p> Publishers are n't  interested in financing the American dream , however . They simply want books and songs to sell to the world . They have a straightforward and related interest in keeping royalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talent . <p> Without royalties , there would be fewer people who could maintain a career as a songwriter or novelist . There would be fewer songs and books to publish . Its in the industries best interest to keep writers writing , generating new work to make the publishers money . <h> Residuals are royalties with special sauce <p> Writing a screenplay is a lot like writing a song or a novel . The writer goes off and struggles to compose something that is a perfect combination of fresh and familiar , which will hopefully appeal to a large enough proportion of the intended audience . Just like songs and books , most screenplays never make a cent for their creators . Books sit unpublished ; songs go unrecorded ; screenplays remain unproduced locked forever in 12 pt . Courier . <p> But a few make it . A few become movies . <p> And in the process of converting written words to filmed entertainment , a bit of legal sleight-of-hand takes place . I 'm going to oversimplify it to make it comprehensible , but the longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain . <p> Whether you write a song , a book or a screenplay , you 're protected by copyright . More than that , you 're acknowledged as the Author of the work , which has important ( but eye-glazingly complicated ) implications under international law , including certain inalienable creative rights . When movie studios read your screenplay and decide theyd like to make it into a film , they hit a few snags . Two examples : <p> As the Author and copyright-holder , you the writer control the ability to make derivative works , such as a movie . Or a sequel . Or a videogame . <p> Some of your inalienable2 creative rights as Author ( e.g. " no one can mutilate or distort the work in such as way as to be prejudicial to the honor or reputation of the author " ) are potential nightmares for a company about to spend $100 million on a movie distributed worldwide . <p> So a compromise was made . <p> Screenwriters would sell the " authorship " of their screenplays to the studios , 3 and allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus become works-made-for-hire . <p> In exchange , screenwriters would get a host of benefits and protections covered by the Writers Guild of America ( the WGA ) , which as a labor union can only represent employees . <p> The WGA would also collect royalties on behalf of screenwriters . Royalties were renamed " residuals , " since only " authors " collect royalties. 4 <p> If this strikes you as a kludge , you 're not alone . Its graceless and awkward and weird . Its completely unlike what happens in playwriting , even though playwriting and screenwriting are close cousins.5 <p> I 've described the process in terms of a screenwriter working on an original script by herself , but the same basic machinery applies to adaptations or television shows . Staff writers sign contracts which perform similar legal judo , making their words the companys words . <p> In exchange for higher guaranteed payments ( " minimums " ) , residuals do n't  start accruing in a works initial window ( theatrical release for a movie , first broadcast for a TV show ) , but rather down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video . <p> That 's what the current WGA strike is a largely about : the residual rate for home video , and especially work distributed through the internet.6 <p> You 'll note that the studios are n't  talking about eliminating residuals altogether . Even in one of their earlier proposals for " profit-based residuals , " they were acknowledging that writers are entitled to them . Without some form of residuals , the charade of authorship-transference ceases to be mutually beneficial . <p> What 's more , I suspect that the wiser members of the entertainment industry recognize what publishers have long understood : you want to keep a lot of writers on hand . You never know which one is going to create the next Desperate Housewives . <p> Residuals are like the research and development fund for the industry . <h> Why you do n't  get residuals for old spreadsheets <p> Coming back to my friend Jeff , let 's look at why that spreadsheet he made in 2003 does n't  earn him residuals . <p> When he created it for his boss , he was an employee of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work-for-hire . They owned it outright . <p> When a screenwriter writes a script , she 's transferring this bundle of authorship rights to a corporation . In exchange for these legal and creative rights , she gets paid an upfront fee and royalties ( called residuals ) . <p> Readers from the technology and medical fields might recognize an analogous situation with patents and intellectual property . Its not uncommon for an inventor to get paid per unit for the right to use some proprietary innovation . So it may help to think of screenplays as " literary inventions , " subject to a strange but industry-standardized procedure to protect both creators and corporations . Its not pretty , but it gets the job done . <h> Why gaffers do n't  get residuals <p> While the process of making a movie begins with the screenwriter , it ultimately involves dozens sometimes hundreds of professionals , from grips to gaffers to art directors to truck drivers . Most of the people working on a movie receive no residuals.7 Is that fair ? After all , these people work long hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to the finished film . Why do n't  they get residuals ? <p> Because residuals are royalties paid to an author . They 're not a bonus . They 're a guaranteed payment to the writer in exchange for giving up copyright and authorship claims . <p> In the heated rhetoric surrounding the strike , both sides have made misleading claims about the economic status of writers in Hollywood . The studios like to portray writers as greedy millionaires , while the WGA holds them up as middle-class victims of corporate fat-catting . Neither is accurate . Most writers are n't  millionaires yet the Hollywood middle-class would be the envy of most of America . <p> The reductionism to " the rich fighting the super-rich " misses the real issue : the internet will replace television , and the industry needs to come to terms with what that entails . The WGA strike will end with compromises over the residual rates . The eventual IATSE strike will be about the definition of what a " program made for the internet " means , how much their members must be paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to your buddy Brooks <p> The take-home lesson , in case you need to explain to a friend who blames " greedy writers " for why The Daily Show is in repeats : <p> Writers get royalties : for books , for songs , for literary works . <p> For legal reasons , studios want to be considered the " author " of a movie . So screenwriters transfer " authorship " to the studios , in exchange for a bunch of rights , and residuals . <p> The studios and the WGA disagree about what rate is fair for work distributed over the internet . <p> Since internet distribution will eventually replace DVDs , a bad rate would result in a pay cut for writers . <p> If you 've ever stayed through to the end of movie credits , that 's the reason behind that block of text reading , " For the purposes of international law , Big Movie Studio is the author of this film ( motion picture ) . " ? <p> There 's another history behind the term " residuals , " referring to the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a partial answer to the question , " But wait , why do actors get residuals ? " ? <p> Playwrights retain copyright . If screenwriters were to hold on to copyright and " license " the movie rights to the studios , the whole thing would become incredibly problematic for reasons Craig Mazin has explained LONG ... ? <p> The current DVD residual rate is 0.3% . The studios proposed residual rate for the internet iszero . Because work on the internet is defined as " promotional .

@@42311769 @2311769/ <p> I know the ultimate answer to every quitting question tends to veer towards , " If you can quit it then it was n't meant to be . " But I think there are many people out there who have yet to find some singular passion . The best Ive been able to muster is finding things I really enjoy doing and I 'm 40 . <p> Which brings me back to your opinion on quitting writing . Or should I say , quitting trying to become a paid writer . In my case Ive been writing screenplays for about four years . None great . One almost optioned ( the first , since then manager pretty much lamed out on me ) . <p> So its years later and I 'm pretty much still at square one in terms of contacts . Age being an issue are n't  the chances seriously evaporating +- la a woman over 35 trying to get pregnant ? Isnt it more a 20-something game ? Am I asking too many questions ? <p> Anyway , would love any thoughts you might have on the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that 's pretty controversial advice , and I feel uncomfortable typing it . After all , this is a blog about the wonders and challenges of screenwriting , full of hope and sunshine except for off days when I rip on Parade magazine . <p> But there 's hope , and there 's false hope . And the latter is harmful . It keeps people locked in a cycle of unmet expectation , passing up other opportunities in pursuit of an elusive , often impossible dream . So I want to be honest with you , and explain how I came up with my answer . <p> Let 's start with the positives , and address your age concern . Apparently , the median age of a new WGA member is about 35 , which means there are plenty of screenwriters just getting started in their late-30s and early 40s . You 're not too late by any means . <p> Also , youve only been doing this for four years it took me longer than that to get Go made . Granted , they were a very different four years of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor of a studio apartment and abused my student I 'd for discount movie tickets . Striving and struggling is exciting romantic , even in your 20s . You hit 30 , then 40 , and the appeal fades . Particularly if what you 're striving and struggling for is n't your singular passion . <p> That 's the heart of the age question : Its not harder for an older writer to start . Its just easier to quit . <p> I often fall back on my basketball analogy , but forgive me if I dust it off again . Its relevant . <p> Let 's say you 're good at basketball . In fact , of all the people you play with , you 're the best . Should you pursue a career in it ? Let 's assume you 're willing to do the hard work you 'll train every day , work with coaches on specific skills , and do everything in your power to make it . What are the odds you 'll end up in the NBA ? <p> The answer has a lot to do with where you 're at in your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . That 's not ageism . That 's just reflecting the fact that most basketball careers are established in their 20s ( or earlier ) . That 's when your natural talents are developed enough that its obvious whether you 're cut out for it . You may become a better basketball player in your 30s , but you wo n't suddenly become one when you werent before . <p> While there are limits to the analogy , 1 a good writer is like a good basketball player in that there 's some inherent and unobtainable aptitude required . Either you 're good at it , or you 're not , and no workshop is going to change that . Until my senior year of high school , I did n't  know screenwriting existed , but I always knew I would be a writer . It was the one thing I could consistently do better than my peers , and once I recognized that , I ran with it . <p> The weird thing with screenwriting is that many people try their hand at it without any prior background ( or demonstrable skill ) in writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the basketball analogy holds up : being a fan of the Pistons does n't  mean you can play for the Pistons.2 <p> Coming back to you , Marc , if you 've been trying for a couple of years , and have started to seriously question whether you 're cut out for it ( " none great " ) , maybe its time to look for another field . I think you wrote in asking permission to quit considering yourself an aspiring screenwriter . You have my blessing . <p> But keep in mind : I may be completely wrong , and you may be deluded . Here are some signs that you should ignore my advice and keep at it : <p> Smart people genuinely love your scripts , and want to keep talking about them after the obligatory period has passed . <p> You can pull one of your older scripts off the shelf , reading it for the first time in years , and be more impressed than embarrassed . <p> At least once a week , you write something that sends you to bed happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it as a screenwriter . But they 're indications that writing ( of some form ) is probably a net positive in your life , so do n't  stop doing just because I told you to quit . <p> Most notably , basketball has many purely quantitative measurements to let you compare yourself to your peers , while screenwriting is fundamentally qualitative . " Number of produced credits " reflects a combination of consensus opinion and good fortune . ? <p> I chose that team at random . I do n't  follow the game at all , which makes it awkward to use basketball in this analogy . But I 'm sticking with it . ? 
@@42311771 @2311771/ <p> Some very funny movies have a lot of ad-libbing , which can give the viewer the impression that there was n't really a script the actors just showed up and decided what they were going to do and say .

The script may have been terrible , but something about it was good enough to attract the actors and director in the first place . <p> If you happened to watch the second season of HBOs " Project Greenlight " and if you 're reading this column , there 's a pretty good chance you 're enough of a film masochist to watch it you saw directors Kyle and Efram defend their approach to an upcoming scene by saying , " We were just planning on letting the actors improvise .

In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps your Dispatcher ) , or a character we do meet who happens to be on a speakerphone or similarly off-screen . <p> Putting the parenthetical as part of the character name helps reinforce that the person wont be seen .

There 's probably no perfect definition , but to me it involves pointing out inconsistency ( or worse , hypocrisy ) in a persons statements or actions .

Now if you actually look in real film criticism , it has fallen prey to what much of modern literary criticism has fallen prey to . Its really steeped in identity politics and sort of its all post-modern . And academia is still swooning from Foucault and Derrida .

So , I would n't worry about them . <p> If this really was written by the network executive and not , like , they found a writer who did this , it may very well be that this person was trying to put together a pitch document to sort of show what they thought the movie was . And they 're not really a writer . And so maybe you really could step in and help that be the document that really shows what the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're risking much by trying . If its really that bad , step up . <p> Craig : That 's a better answer . I like your answer better . I agree . <p> John : Thanks . But well keep yours just so people can compare and contrast . <p> Craig : Yeah . Well , I mean they should . They should see what a not-as-good answer sounds like . <p> John : Good . So , let 's move onto our main topics . This is the WGA election season . So every year we get to pick some new candidates for the Board of Directors . And every two years we also swap out our officers . Correct me when I make mistakes because you know this better than I do . <p> Craig : I shall . <p> John : But this is a cycle in which were not electing President and Secretary and Treasurer that kind of stuff . Were simply electing people to be on the Board of Directors . And its not as I do n't  want to say its not as crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election , because this wont be the people who are heading in to right away a new WGA contract . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> John : So you want people who are going to be good stewards of the Guild , who are going to bring up the other topics that need to be talked about , but you do n't  necessarily need your big guns on this one , because this is a building year rather than a fighting year . <p> Craig : Not exactly . I mean , the thing is even thought its what they call an " off election year , " the Board , there are 16 board members . And every year 8 of them are up for election . So , half of them are up for election along with the officers and half are n't  . This is one of those are n't  years , like you said , but they serve for two years . And two years from now I think our deal will be up and in advance , about a year in advance of our deal expiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is formed . <p> I wish I could say that there 's any one year where it actually does n't  matter . Every year actually kind of does matter if you 're looking at it in that context . <p> John : I would agree . <p> So this year I actually had the privilege of being on the nominating committee to help find these candidates . And so we met three different times and did interviews with all of these candidates , so I actually met I think all of these people who are running . And they 're all terrific . <p> So , I can talk a little bit about the nominating committee . I had the impression that we had to like , you know , give them our stamp of approval . It really was just a " you 're not a crazy person . " That 's basically our whole job was to make sure that no one who 's coming in the door was crazy , and hopefully get some really good people to run . <p> And so I took it upon myself to convince some people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner , who are both great , great candidates . And I got to listen to what these people thought were concerns that the Guild to do a better job of addressing . We could help them sort of figure out how they might want to present themselves to WGA when they present in their candidate statement in the packet . <p> So , I thought wed talk through just who the candidates are and give some quick impressions , if that sounds good to you . <p> Craig : Let 's do it . <p> John : I do n't  want to pronounce her name wrong . Its Katherine Fugate ? <p> Craig : Its Fugate. pronounced Fu-jay <p> John : Is it really Fu-jay ? <p> Craig : Yeah . I think she 's , well , she 's from New Orleans and I think its some kind of Cajun/Frenchy kind of name . <p> John : Well I 'm apologizing for mispronouncing her name . Its so hard when its a name you 've seen a zillion times written down but youve never had to say aloud . <p> Craig : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> John : No one would . But I had one of those unpronounceable names , too , and it did n't  make it easier that everyone pronounced it wrong , too . <p> Craig : Thats true . That is true . <p> John : So Katherine is running again . David Goodman . Kathy Kiernan . David Shore . So these are all people who are currently serving on the board . They were elected in 2010 and they are running again . I have nothing particular to say about them . <p> Craig : Well , Ive known Katherine for a long , long time . A very lovely , lovely woman . And I guess Pam is going to be angry with me , because I called her lovely . Sorry . Shes neither lovely nor cute . Shes formidable . laughs Shes a formidable , strong woman , and a screenwriter , and Katherine is very empathetic towards other writers as opposed to me . Im , of course , cranky . Shes probably moreI mean , I hesitate to use really left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more moderate and want to try and seek a compromise to advance their goals . There are people that are a little more confrontational with the companies . Shes probably more confrontational than I am which is no surprise , most people are . <p> But she 's good . And she 's been around awhile . And I think sometimes just having served is valuable in and of itself . It means that you have a certain amount of understanding about what works and what does n't  work . Youve tried all the goofy crazy ideas . Its a very common thing when people enter governance for the first time . They 're like , " Ugh , why do n't  these idiots just do A , B , and C. " And then you get into the position and you realize , " Oh , because A is illegal , B is crazy , and C has been tried a million times and did n't  work . " There 's very few like , " Oh , why did n't  we think of that idea " when it comes to union governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and have some institutional wisdom ; so she 's one of them . <p> David Goodman , very nice guy . Family Guy writer , I think . He is really one of the few unreformed Patric Verrone guys left in there . He is all the way like what I consider to be part of a broken , proven-to-fail philosophy . So , I wont be voting for him , but he s a nice guy . <p> And who was the other one ? <p> John : Kathy Kiernan and David Shore . <p> Craig : David Shore , I do n't  know personally , but I hear great things about him . He is respected by almost everyone . And , I 'm sorry , I missed the other name . <p> John : Kathy Kiernan . <p> Craig : Oh , Kathy Kiernan . So , Kathy Kiernan is actually a news writer . A lot of people do n't  know that the Writers Guild West represents television and screenwriters , but it actually also represents a small amount of news writers , most of whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news radio writers , I believe KNX . So were talking really a very small amount of people . Most news writers are represented by the Writers Guild America East . Most news radio people are represented by the East because that 's just the way it worked out . <p> Kathys very nice . Look , because we represent so few news radio writers , I 'm always torn . Well , so much of what we do is about the 95% of the membership that we comprise , and not , I do n't  know what it is , maybe like 50 news writers , but maybe fewer news radio writers . But , then again , its probably not a bad idea to have somebody like that there who is sort of representing the minority . So I think that 's a good thing . <p> John : That was really what I was looking at as we were interviewing these candidates , and I always have looked at it as I 've gone through the book and sort of figured out who I was going to be voting for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives and what people are going to be able to bring to the table . <p> One of my big concerns is that feature screenwriters tend to be underrepresented in the Board . And feature screenwriters needs are in some ways unique and different than TV writers . Its just the way , like daytime writers needs are unique . And so you want to make sure you have at least somebody on the Board who can bring that perspective , because if you do n't  maybe that perspective is going to get overlooked altogether . And so finding the balance there is tricky . But I think we actually have some good candidates across the board for that . <p> Theres 8 other names here , so I do n't  want to sort of go through each one of them because you wo n't know a lot of these people . <p> Craig : I wont . <p> John : I did want to single out Jordan Mechner who is a friend of mine who I asked to run . Jordan Mechner is best known as a video game designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Karateka . I 've worked with him as a screenwriter on a Fox pilot and we worked on Prince of Persia together . He s fantastic . <p> And one of the reasons why I really wanted Jordan to run is that he comes from a background of actually owning intellectual property . And so as WGA members , the WGA represents employees . So we represent people who are hired to adapt things , or hired to create stuff for corporations . Jordan is from a world of creating stuff for himself and owning that intellectual property . And I think the way forward is going to be a balance between those entrepreneurial instincts of creating your own stuff , creating your comic books and graphic novels like he s also done , and all that stuff that you own yourself that you are completely in control of , and working for other people . <p> And Jordan sort of balances that , and I think he brings some good perspective in sort of that part of the business . <p> Craig : Yeah . I think , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the things that happens pretty quickly is whatever you bring to it that you think qualifies you becomes subsumed a bit by what the tasks are that the union presents to you . <p> You may have a bunch of things that you think you 're good at or that you want to accomplish . The union says , " Yay , that 's great . But here 's what 's going on right now . And we need you to deal with this . " And so the most valuable trait is intelligence . And Jordan is very , very smart . So , on those grounds alone hell have my vote . <p> John : So here 's my advice to you : This next week you 'll be getting your packet if you 're a WGA member . If you 're not a WGA member you 've probably fast-forwarded through this because this is not very interesting to you . But as you get your packet , I always like to look through and read the candidates statements . I kind of score them , because I 'm a scorer . I like to rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at sort of who 's endorsing them , who else I sort of agree with and sort of why they 're endorsing them , and make my decisions on that . <p> One of the things we talked about last year when we did this god , that was a year ago , was n't it ? 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : Weve been doing this podcast a year . Was that you do n't  actually have to vote for 8 empty spots . You do n't  have to vote for 8 people . So if there 's 6 people you really want to be in and you do n't  really care about the other 2 , you 're better off looking for 6 . <p> Craig : Thats called bulleting your votes . You can vote for one person if you want . <p> John : Yeah . Do it . So , enough on that . This is sort of our big meaty topic and this came up a couple of weeks ago . We said , " We should do a podcast about that , " and let 's do a podcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because screenwriters as a career , as a group , as a cohort , tend to be larger members of the Hollywood community . <p> Craig : laughs Youve already blown it by saying fat . So you do n't  have to think the euphemisms . <p> Like , if you took a screenwriter and put him on a plane and he got off in Ohio , hed be one of the thinner people there . <p> Craig : Well , for some of them , sure . I mean , in general really what Ive noticed when I 'm around other screenwriters is its not so much that were an obese lot . I mean , this is n't like going to a Walmart in Mississippi . Its that were out of shape . Were out of shape . Some of us are very fat . Some of us are just <p> There are screenwriters who are skinny-fat , which is one of my favorite new terms . They 're not probably weight-wise overweight ; they just have no muscle tone whatsoever . Its as if they were sculpted from a goo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense , because our jobs are completely sedentary . And more than that , I think , they 're very internal . We prize and are rewarded for what goes on in our brain and not at all for what we do with our bodies . Not even one iota . So its only natural that taking care of our bodies would drop into second , or third , or fourth place on our list of things to do in a given day . <p> John : As we dig into this , I do want to stress that I understand how strange it seems to be getting advice on being fit from screenwriters . Its like asking an actor for financial advice . <p> Craig : laughs <p> John : But , weve both been there . And you were a heavier person . 10557 @qwx420557 <p> John : And I 've managed to maintain relatively good health throughout my career , but it has n't  always been easy and it has n't  always been obvious what the best choices were . So , and I see people making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of reaching for a magic bullet . Like theyll focus on one thing , like , " If I stop eating canned foods that will change everything because there 's like a chemical in cans that 's really bad for you so you should n't eat canned foods . " <p> Craig : Oh god . <p> John : Its like , yeah , you also should n't eat chocolate donuts for breakfast . People who sort of over-fixate on one little thing and do n't  look at the big picture of how not to get giant . <p> Craig : That 's a very LA phenomenon . Maybe its bigger than this . But I have noticed that there is a bizarre and completely misdirected obsession with food . So , I see people who are not in good shape or who are not taking care of themselves , but they become obsessed with trendy nonsense , gluten and so forth . <p> I mean , there 's a great article : some people legitimately have an issue with gluten . A lot of people just do n't  , but they think they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with freshness , you know , organic as opposed to inorganic . I guarantee you if all you did all day was eat the " inorganic , " because all foods organic , but " inorganic " fruits and vegetables and lean meats and proteins you would be in better shape than somebody who ate nothing but pure , organic , gluten-free cupcakes , donuts , bread , cake . <p> John : And a similar situation , too , like vegetarianism or veganism . I was a vegetarian for seven years . I 'm not a vegetarian now , but I 'm much healthier for not being a vegetarian . And its because in fixating on that one thing , like , " Oh , I do n't  eat meat , so therefore I can eat everything else , " I made horrible choices . I was eating ice cream rather than chicken , and that was never a good choice . <p> Craig : Its just not a great idea . And you can be a very smart vegetarian , there 's no question about it . But were getting pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would say about ten years ago . The diet industry had always concentrated on a certain way of approaching things and then along came this Atkins guy . And , boy , was he beaten up . <p> But it turns out he was right . <p> John : He was largely right . <p> Craig : He was n't completely right in the way maybe he was expressing it . And he got a little cuckoo about it . But the general theory there turned out to be right . So , what we know is in general I 'm not talking even about losing weight . I 'm just talking about general , okay , you 're fine , you 're in shape , you 're in a good place . Generally speaking , eating fewer processed carbohydrates , eating fewer simple carbohydrates , and eating more lean protein , and not being fat-phobic in terms of what you ingest there are good fats , healthy fats is a better way to eat than what you and I were taught in the 70s with the food pyramid , which turns out to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  help you lose weight . <p> John : For the last 18 months I 've been doing basically a slow carb diet . I 'm a little reluctant to talk about it because it all started with this book I read called The 4-Hour Body by a guy named Tim Ferriss . And Tim Ferriss , he s , I do n't  know , he s sort of the Ryan Lochte of book writers . And like Ryan Lochte , its like , wow Ryan Lochte , you 're a really good swimmer . Congratulations on being a really good swimmer . But I 'm not sure I 'd want to hang out with him . That 's the same way I kind of feel about Tim Ferriss is that what he s saying actually works and makes sense , but that does n't  mean I 'm not vouching for him as like " here is the go to guru that you should trust with everything in your life . " <p> But the 4-Hour Body , I 've been on it for 18 months , and it works really , really well . I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes the basic ideas of like an Atkins or a South Beach , which is largely what you 're describing , like you 're cutting out your simple carbohydrates and going for lean proteins . It does that with it also cuts out dairy and it allows you to sort of have the longer burning carbs like beans so that you actually can stay full . <p> And its been the easiest thing Ive ever done diet-wise , largely because of one extra exception it makes , is that you have one cheat day a week where you can just blow it out and you can eat anything you possibly would want to eat . And that 's been its savior , because when Ive done South Beach or other kind of diety things , you just get so angry and crazy and you look at stuff , like I will never be able to eat a brownie again . <p> And on this its like , well , yeah , I can eat a brownie on Saturday . And , in fact , I can eat two brownies on Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . And its been a godsend . Its been really easy . And you do n't  have to count calories . You do n't  have to worry about anything because you just say , like , " These are the things I can eat . For six days a week these are the things I eat . On the seventh day I rest and I can eat anything . " <p> Craig : Right . Well its important for me to point out that there 's two ways of approaching this depending on what group you 're in . If you are somebody that is trying to be more fit but you 're not obese , then I think there are reasonable approaches that are all essentially the same that are going to be good for you : Increasing your exercise level in some way that does n't  make you crazy ; and shifting gradually away from the simple carb/sugary way of eating to a more Atkins/South Beach/Ferriss kind of way , which is complex carbohydrates , proteins . <p> I mean , dairy for instance is a great thing to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy or the protein in dairy but because of the inevitable sugars that come along with dairy . But , that 's for people who are n't  obese . <p> For people who are obese I think , in my experience , there is a different approach that is required . And the reason why is we now know that fat makes you fatter . How ? Fat cells actually release hormones . And the hormones that fat cells release stimulate your appetite and your hunger . You 're already in a bad place because you are likely eating a kind of sugar-heavy diet . And so your insulin levels are getting goofy and your blood sugar is going down which makes you hungry . That 's going on already . But , on top of that , there is this added level of what the fat that you already have accumulated is doing to your brain . <p> In order to get to a place where you can have some sort of reasonable diet that works , because here you 're saying , " Okay , I 'll lose ten pounds . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are people who need to lose 200 pounds . What do you do ? <p> You could do Tim Ferriss for 12 years . Its not going to do it for you . For those people there are basically two options . Theres surgery . Sorry , there 's two options I see as being reasonable . <p> John : All right . <p> Craig : There is surgery . And then there is what they call very low calorie diets , which have been shown to work and , in fact , its what I did . And it worked amazingly well . Surgery we all know about . I 'm not going to go into it , although I 'm not against it . But the very low calorie diet is pretty simple . You 're going to eat something like 850 calories a day , which is not a lot at all . And it is essentially going to comprise nothing more than lean proteins , a very small amount of complex carbohydrate , a very small amount of fruit , and that 's that . And the first week or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body realizes that its got all this fat that it can burn and it burns it amazingly efficiently . <p> And once your body converts over into this fat-burning mode , because its nowhere near the calorie level it needs from food intake , you stop being hungry because you 're essentially eating yourself . And the fat loss is quite rapid . And I will say this : When it comes to losing weight for very heavy people , the only way to really maintain it is to get rid of it completely . Like you 've got to go all the way . If you 're 300 pounds and you 're 511 " , you cant go down to 225 pounds and celebrate . You 're still overweight . The fat is still there playing tricks on your brain . <p> Youve got to go down , down to 170 , down to 175 or 180 , whatever is right for you . And then you can start to <p> By the way , at that point then exercise becomes a reality . Do n't  tell 300-puond people that they have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , what do you weight , 170 pounds ? <p> John : Yeah , exactly . <p> Craig : Okay . I 'm pretty good at this . <p> So , if I said to you I need you to go out and exercise but for the next week I need you to strap on 130 pounds , for all of your exercise . Weightlifting , there 's 130 pounds on top of your body . Running , jogging , stretching , yoga , everything 130 pounds . You would n't last a minute . You cant say to these people exercise . They cant . No one can . <p> I mean , well , some people , like Olympic people . But my point is you 've got to lose the weight to exercise . So when people say , " Well , you know , this guy needs to do a pushup " you do a pushup with 130 pounds on top of your back . Good luck . <p> So , my advice is to think about a very low calorie diet . However , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to do it under a doctors supervision . And you had a doctor supervise when you did this ? <p> Craig : Yes . Because its a fairly extreme thing to do . And there are some side effects that they know about . They 're certainly not universal . There 's a percentage , there 's an elevated risk of gallstones when you do something like this . And you have to watch your nutrition . You have take vitamins and you have to make sure that you supplement in that regard . And you need somebody taking your blood essentially every couple of weeks to make sure that something is n't gong incredibly wrong . But , if you are doing this as part of a physician-monitored program , its quite extraordinary . What happens to your body on the outside is impressive . What happens on the inside is even more impressive . <p> I mean , you can essentially create the same state in your liver that alcoholics create through overeating . Its pretty remarkable . And when you look at our country and all the problems we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them the chronic , widespread epidemic ones back to weight . <p> John : You would n't have nearly as many people on CPAP machines if weight was lower . <p> Craig : I mean , you 'd have almost no one on CPAP machines . I mean , very few people have congenital throat structural sinus issues that require CPAP machines . Depression . Sleep apnea . Back problems . Joint problems . Anxiety . Sexual dysfunction . I mean , what else ? Skin problems . So many of these issues you can track back to just being overweight . <p> And we , as screenwriters , I think just have to be really aware that our job is sitting and thinking , and that means if you are really overweight its time to get extreme about it . And if you 're not really overweight its time to exercise . <p> John : Yeah , so let 's talk about exercise because one of the challenges I think as screenwriters is were often working alone . If you have n't exercised before , if you have n't been to the gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the problem I really faced when I first moved out to Los Angeles is that I was going to USC and I knew that , okay , I should probably start working out because its the kind of thing a person should do when they 're in their early 20s . But I did n't  sort of know how to do it . <p> So , I could go to classes and stuff like that , but if you 're actually lifting weights or doing other stuff , having someone there to show upits like having a writing partner . Having someone who you 're responsible for on a social level , showing up and actually doing the work was hugely helpful . <p> Later on , you know , as I had some money and my schedule got more busy , I had a real trainer . And that 's like kind of a friend you pay . But it was helpful . And because I knew I was paying for those sessions , I would show up and I would do what the trainer said so I would not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , look , there are all sorts of ways to approach exercise . And I 'm a very my attitude is its all good . All exercise is good , at any level . Walking up the street for ten minutes is good . I will say that , right now , so I 'm doing P90X . And P90X is a fairly intense its a very intense program . I 'm early on it . And I almost never get to the end of the session . I just fall apart . <p> But I know then , okay , that 's good . laughs If I 've gotten to the place where I literally am just gasping <p> John : Youve actually done the work . <p> Craig : and drenched in sweat . And cant go any further . I 've done a hell of a job that day . And so I just presume that its going to get easier and better , and that 's the key . When we start exercising there 's a tape that runs in our head . " I 'm exercising now for the first time because Im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm **25;726;TOOLONG very good at it/cant finish it/not like the people on the tape/not like the people next to me in the gym/not like the people on TV . " <p> Yes , of course you 're going to be weak and ungainly and clumsy and in pain for awhile . And then you wont be . And you will not be able to get to the wont be until you get through the will be . Just like writing a script . laughs Youve got to look at it that way . " Okay , page one . Big empty script . Oh god , this is gon na suck for awhile . " But you will get to a place where its flowing and its easy . And exercise leads to more exercise . <p> John : Yeah . And I do feel sometimes people in their diet , they try to take too either they try to go too far and they try to get on something so crazy that they cant possibly maintain . I see them doing the same kind of things with exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm going to run ten miles today . " And like , well , that 's not going to work out well for anybody . <p> Craig : Thats right . <p> John : So that is one of the things you can sort of ease your way into . I mean , as far as diet , just start with breakfast . Just do n't  eat a terrible breakfast . Do n't  eat Eggo Waffles for breakfast . East scrambled eggs and black beans . That 's what I have for breakfast almost every morning . And everyone is like , " God , do n't  you get bored of scrambled eggs and black beans ? " <p> Yeah , well kind of . But its breakfast . Who cares ? You 're going to be eating the same thing for breakfast most days in your life anyway . So rather than cereal you 're eating scrambled eggs and black beans . Its fine . <p> If I 'm in New York I 'll go to one of the deli places and have them make an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . And I do n't  get that crazy hunger two hours later . The same thing with exercise . You 're doing the P90X which is awesome . And if you can keep it up for the time that you 're supposed to be doing it , that 's great . But if a person just wants to start like hiking at Runyon Canyon a couple times a week , that 's going to be a much better and more realistic start . <p> Craig : For sure . Yeah . Because I 'm already kind of in shape . You know , I 've been going to a trainer for awhile . I know what it means to work out . I know what it means to do pushups . I know what it means to weight train . But when I first started I was fat and I could n't do anything . <p> And right now where I am , its funny , because Todd Phillips did P90X . He s the one that sort of said , " You should do this . " And he showed me a picture and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I 've known the guy for awhile . And you do n't  really see what 's going underneath peoples shirts . And he showed me a picture of what he looked like without his shirt on . I 'm like , " Geez , look at that . " Its amazing actually . <p> So , I started doing it . And every day I would just send him an email and say , " I cant believe you did this . I cant believe you did this for 90 days . " But he did do it for 90 days . And the point is he could n't , I mean , when he started he could n't believe it either . You just have to so youre always , you know , its like when we talked about Jiro and sushi . You 're not oh , god , I cant believe I do n't  remember the name of the guy who just won the Decathlon . He s the most in shape , fit guy in the world ; were never going to be that guy . There 's always going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just do what you can do . <p> John : Yeah . Be a better version of who you can be . And I think Todd Phillips is a good example because its a guy who does n't  have to be in great shape . He s not going to be an athlete . I 'm not going to be an athlete . You just want to be in good enough shape so that you 're able to chase your kids around and not be tired walking up a hill . <p> John : laughs Youre always chasing something . I want to live for a really long time . 10556 @qwx420556 <p> John : I do n't  want to die . I want to live a super , super long time . I 'd love to the singularity but if I do n't  make it there I want to at least live to grandkids . And so this is helpful ways to get you closer to that . <p> Craig : Well , I 'll tell you , I do n't  even want to live a long time . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of my life to be awesome while I 'm here . And its very difficult to have a good quality of life when you 're fat and tired and grumpy and depressed . So , to me its all about quality as opposed to quantity . <p> John : Yeah . And one of the things I will stress about sort of the people who go gung-ho into something so hardcore and then the danger of going so gung-ho into something is that when it does n't  work , when it fails , you feel like a failure . And it just sets up that whole cycle again . So , making smaller changes that keep stacking up is going to be a better solution for most people . <p> What you said before about the medical weight loss , that I can see because you have somebody backing you up . You 're on this program . You 're clearly in or you 're out of this program . But for most people I think if you 're trying to lose 10 pounds or 15 pounds that you 've stacked on in your 30s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to drop them all at once is going to be a better experience . <p> Craig : Totally . Yeah . Completely . <p> John : The last thing I want to get to is really a screenwriter problem , and also an editor problem , too . We are people who sit a tremendous amount of time in chairs looking at screens . And the old advice used to be you need to get a better chair . And I strongly suspect now the better advice is do n't  get a better chair , just stand up . I think were going to keep getting data that show that sitting in chairs for long periods of time is terrible no matter what else you do . <p> And so screenwriting is one of those things were like , yes , sometimes you really do have to buckle down and maybe sit down and actually type . But when you 're not actually typing , stand up . <p> And so like I 'm recording this podcast standing up . If you 're taking phone calls stand up . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick your laptop on the counter . Try to not be down in that chair so much because I think it slows your body down and it changes how your body works . <p> I 've noticed I 've slept much better since I 've started standing up . <p> Craig : Yeah . That is good advice . My posture is awful . I do everything wrong in a chair . I slump . I slouch . I curve . And the only thing I can say is then I get up and I walk around and I stretch . But , you know , I should stand more , its true . <p> John : And get a dog . That will also help . <p> Craig : Yeah . I have a dog . Shes lovely . <p> John : Yeah , walking dogs is always good . Because it helps you work through second act problems . <p> Craig : Uh , I still maintain that a shower is the best thing you can do . <p> John : Showers are good too . <p> So , hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx420556 <p> John : How about I go first , Craig , because I actually know what mine is ? <p> Craig : Uh-huh . <p> John : My One Cool Thing this week is the Jambox by Jawbone . And what this is is a really small little Bluetooth speaker . And it actually comes in two sizes . There 's a really small one that 's about the size of , I do n't  know , two candy bars . And you can use it for both a speaker and as a speakerphone . I 've actually never used the speakerphone function , but I find it to be great as travel speakers . And so if I 'm in a hotel room in New York City and I want to listen to music , I can play music off my phone and it plays on the Jambox and it sounds actually good . <p> I used it this last week because I was meeting with a composer and I needed to play a bunch of songs for him . And its always like , " Oh , do you play it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this actually sounds much better . " So from my phone I can play the songs I wanted to play him and it worked really well . <p> For the house we ended up getting a bigger one that can plug in or we can sort of stick on the kitchen counter when we want to . And that 's what we listen to podcasts on a lot . And so as you 're cleaning the kitchen you fire it up , you listen to stuff , it sounds really good , and its always there when you need it . So I strongly recommend both of these . Theyve worked really great for us . <p> Theyre rechargeable so you do n't  have to keep them plugged in . And they 're terrific . <p> John : Actually , there are two , there 's a bigger and smaller one , so you can pick which one you want to be your Cool Thing . <p> Craig : Bigger ! Bigger . <p> John : Bigger . Always better . <p> And , Craig , I think we are now safely over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big acoustic set . <p> Craig : Yeah . I got new strings on the way . I 'm going to restring my guitar so it sounds nice and bright and pleasant . And I 've got a little thing so I can actually record the vocals and the guitar on two separate tracks into GarageBand so I can make it all nice and pretty . <p> John : Its going to be amazing . So , everything we talked about on the podcast today is going to be on johnaugust.com with this podcast title . 
@@42311778 @2311778/ <p> JOHN : And here we are recording another podcast . The topic of Scriptnotes is really things that would be interesting to screenwriters , so screenwriting , for example , film making , the film industry . What else are we going to talk about ? <p> CRAIG : Napping , video games , procrastination , substance abuse . laughs Just running down the stuff that I think of when I think of screenwriters . <p> JOHN : At some point I think we need to have a podcast that talks about why you always see screenwriters careers falling off after 40 , and its because of children . <p> JOHN : Yeah , its a very sad thing . You always wonder why do writers have such great careers in their 20s , and they really achieve stuff in their 30s , and then at 40 , its just a wall . Its not really ageism , its children . <p> CRAIG : Children . And I have two of them , John . Two . <p> JOHN : I have one child . Kids are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they really do sap it out of you . <p> CRAIG : They do . Its amazing how nature creates them to be so lovable and sweet so you almost do n't  even mind it as they dig your soul out and your energy with a spoon and just eat it in front of you , and slowly choke your life out . <p> laughter <p> Just kind of love them for it . <p> JOHN : Its the sunken costs . You spend the first three years of their life trying to keep them alive and afterwards you 're like , " Oh , I 've kept them alive , " and you 've built this love for them , so therefore you forgive them of everything that they have taken from you . You also forget all the things you used to have when you did n't  have children . <p> CRAIG : Its amazing , I 'm tired all the time . 10559 @qwx420559 <p> CRAIG : I honestly feel like I need Geritol or whatever the modern Geritol is laughs because <p> JOHN : Wasnt Geritol actually just alcohol or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , laughs but that 's a funny idea . Geritol was iron supplements . I always remember Geritol because the famous , or not really famous , Australian tennis player Evonne Goolagong would flack for Geritol and she would talk about her iron poor blood . Evonne Goolagong , I think she was half aboriginal and she had this funky accent . I just thought the name Goolagong plus iron poor blood was the funniest thing I 'd ever heard as a kid . <p> JOHN : Yeah . You realize though that men do n't  need more iron . Its only women who need iron because they lose blood every month . <p> CRAIG : Yeah , and by the way , this podcast , I think we should regularly talk about menstruation . <p> JOHN : laughs <p> CRAIG : We should always talk five minutes to just get into any kind of gynecological issues . <p> JOHN : Yeah , because if there 's one thing we know even more than screenwriting , its womens reproductive health . <p> CRAIG : I am so uterine . I 'm uterine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something we do know a lot about . Were going to rip off the band-aid this week and were going to talk about something that in six years of running the blog , I 've never actually written a post about this because its just such a dreadful morass of something to talk about . <p> CRAIG : Its the worst , its the worst . <p> JOHN : Its the worst , and at least 80 percent of the questions that come into the site are basically this question . You 're ready ? I 'm going to paraphrase the one question that I 've heard my entire blogging career . <p> CRAIG : Just do it , do it fast . <p> JOHN : " How do I get an agent and/or manager ? " <p> CRAIG : Oh , God . Now , let me just say , just so that anyone out there who is struggling to get an agent or manager does n't  think that we are mocking your pain . <p> JOHN : No , not at all . <p> CRAIG : Were not . Really what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because here 's what 's difficult , guys . If you really get down to what John and I know about getting an agent or a manager , what we know is how we got an agent in 1995. laughs That 's what we specifically know . <p> Some of the pain of this question is its like a 15-year-old boy coming to you and saying , " How do I lose my virginity ? " I could tell you how I lost my virginity laughs in 1986 . I just do n't  know if its going to be applicable to you . <p> JOHN : I think I do have a little bit more experience just because I 've gone through generations of assistants who have become writers themselves and have gotten agents , so Ive seen their process . <p> CRAIG : Good point . <p> JOHN : Yeah . Its not identical to what my process was and a crucial thing for framing this whole discussion is that there 's not one way it happens . Just like everyone does lose their virginity in a slightly different way 10555 @qwx420555 <p> JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly different way . We can only talk about general systems for success that people tend to find when they 're looking for agents and managers . I think we need to start by talking about what the hell an agent or a manager really is because they 're used interchangeably and they 're actually different things . <p> CRAIG : Very , very different , yes . There 's something called the Talent Representation Act or Talent Agency Act , I cant remember quite the exact name , but its California state law . Basically , the law says if you want to represent artists of any kind as an agent and procure them employment that 's the big one you are regulated . You have to be licensed by the state , you can not charge more than 10% of what they earn and you also cant own any of it . For screenwriters what that translates into actually is that agents can not produce your material because producing is a kind of an investment in the material itself . <p> That was the way it was for a long , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not beholden to that law and they can , in fact , charge any percentage they want , and they can also produce your material . Technically , however , they are not allowed to procure you employment . <p> JOHN : Now , procure sounds like a very legal term and I assume that , obviously I know that there 's a lot of overlap between what an agent does and what a manager does , but what is the difference between procure ? So the manager is not allowed to say , " Pay us this amount of money ? " <p> CRAIG : The manager I do not believe is allowed to directly negotiate the terms of employment , I think . Ill have to check on that one . By the way , as a general note , if there 's anything like this where I 'm not quite sure , I can always lob a clarification on your blog when you put up the link . I know for sure that managers legally cant seek employment . In other words , they ca n't field requests for employment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client is available . Do you have anything that they might be interested in ? " <p> Essentially , the manager is supposed to manage . Again , this is all the technical side of it and then there 's the real side . Managers are supposed to handle your day-to-day life . They help you develop material if that 's the way you want to use them . They help take care of your day-to-day needs when you 're working on a project . Let 's say you 're out of town working on something and they help facilitate your life . They 're not supposed to actually go out and get your a job . <p> JOHN : Right . Now , its not an either/or situation . Many writers will find they have both a manager and an agent , and in many cases theyll have a manager a year before they have an agent . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> JOHN : It feels like there are many more managers in the business and that they 're easier to gain access to than an agent . <p> CRAIG : I agree . <p> JOHN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful agencies . There are certainly smaller boutique agencies that represent writers . Managers tend to be in smaller shops where they 're representing a smaller group of writers , or directors or other talented people and focusing on them . Managers , in general , might read every draft and an agent very likely would not read every draft . A manager might give you notes . An agent would be much less likely to give you notes . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> JOHN : I approach the conversation with a dim view of managers , and this is just my generational bias . Ive been called out for my generational bias because when I started in this business , the writers who had managers werent getting a lot out of their managers and they were just looking for the excuse to fire their managers . Now more writers who are working regularly are talking about having success with their managers and keeping their managers as an active part of their career even after they 've had a few features produced . <p> CRAIG : Yeah , I 'm with you in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a manager for a long time , and in many ways it was a good thing and in a number of ways it was n't , and it did n't  end particularly well . <p> I think that there are basically three reasons that writers gravitate towardsIm going to give myself a fourth reason . One is , as you pointed out , sometimes they 're the easier representation to get just to start with . Two , managers are much more willing to help you develop your material . If you 're the kind of writer who actually wants to bounce material off of somebody who is n't a writer or a producer , a manager can help with that . Three , I think some writers feel like look , " I cant have two agents at once . I ca n't be represented by CAA and UTA , but I can be represented by CAA and Three Arts . That 's twice the bang for the buck . " <p> I wish I could remember what the fourth one was but that was probably the most important one of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounce off your third point there , being represented by two different people gets you exposure to more people who you could potentially be working with . 10555 @qwx420555 <p> JOHN : And so even though the managers are n't  supposed to be out there giving you employment , they may be sending you out to meet with somebody and that someone they have you meet with ends up becoming an important link for future employment . <p> CRAIG : Yeah , that 's absolutely true . I do n't  have a huge problem with it , and if you love your manager , awesome . New writers who are seeking desperately for representation , and understandably so , I think can actually benefit a lot from a manager . But just be aware this is the great currency problem -- " when you are a new writer without a track record and limited earning potential , you 're going to get a certain kind of manager . As your career advances , you owe it to yourself to fairly evaluate whether or not your manager laughs is appropriate for where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah . Let 's start the next part about what is an agent or a manager actually looking for . Let 's stop looking at it from the writers point of view . I need someone to represent me , to take me in and introduce me to all the right people and get me jobs . What does an agent want ? <p> CRAIG : They want to make money . Bottom line . <p> JOHN : Theyre there to make money for themselves , for their agency . They 're there to try to get their clients hired and working continuously in the business . From that perspective if they 're looking at a range of possible writers who they could represent they 're going to look at the ones they believe are talented , the ones they believe will work really hard , the ones that they believe can actually land the job which means going in there to the meetings for the nine meetings and convincing a bunch of people that they are the right person to be hired for the job . <p> The ones who are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land a job but then wo n't actually turn in the script or finish the script or will turn in a really substandard version of what the script should be , that 's going to hurt . The agent has a limitation of time . The agent can only represent so many clients . There 's only so many hours in the day . <p> They can only put up so many clients for jobs . Taking on a new person is bringing a new person into the fold , someone they have to introduce to everybody , someone they have to try to keep employed , someone they have to be talking on the phone all the time and trying to get them hired . <p> CRAIG : Also , just as an extension of that , too , when an agent takes on a client that client is an extension of their reputation . I 'm vouching that if I 'm an agent I have a brand just the way that you and I have a brand . Were known for writing certain kinds of things . Agents are known for representing certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and that person craps out , that 's an uncomfortable phone call for that agent . That damages their standing and that 's going to hurt them . There 's a ripple effect . When writers approach getting an agent and they look at this incredibly steep wall and the barrier to entry and they go why ? Why is this so hard to do ? Its because of that . <p> JOHN : Yeah . Its important to remember screenwriting is about pushing those words around on the paper and its being able to write a really good script . Screenwriting , the career screenwriting , is also the ability to land a job and to get paid for what you are doing . <p> An agent is excited to read a really good script . They 're not going to sign a writer , in general , without sitting in a room with that writer and making the judgment call , " Could I send this person out on a job and get them hired to do something ? " They are measuring the social skills of a person who they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah . That 's right . You can definitely be a complete Aspergers weirdo if you are just killing it on the page . If you are a conventional screenwriter writing conventional material and you 're just a zero in the room , its going to be tough . I have to say that part of the business is unfair , but its real . <p> We cant deny the fact that part of what were offering the people who hire us is a sense of comfort that were going to deliver and everythings going to be okay . They 're just as scared as we are . Everybodys scared . <p> JOHN : Its very much a business of trust . As the person hiring you , I am trusting that you will actually be able to deliver me this script . I base that trust on the things Ive read on the paper but also looking you in the eye and seeing " Okay , he gets it . He gets what it is were trying to do here . " <p> Yes , its incredibly important when you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the script that 's about to go into production , but its also important just that the scale job that you 're trying to get made . Every step for one of us executives is important . <p> CRAIG : All right . here 's the big question as we hit the midpoint of our podcast and everybodys been really patient . Theyve listened to us talk about uteruses and the law . John , how do these people get a manager or an agent ? laughs We ripped the Band-Aid off that 15 minutes ago . Were still dancing around it are n't  we ? <p> JOHN : I think you get an agent or manager throughI can think of three ways . The first is recommendation . So someone has read your work , has met you , and said , " This guy is awesome . This guy should be writing movies for Hollywood and I 'm going to take this script and I 'm going to take you , introduce you to this agent or manager , and say you should represent this person because this person is great . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent or manager and there 's already trust and taste being established between them that agent or manager will read your material , say yes or no , and be interested and excited about possibly representing you . That 's how I got an agent , is a friend took the script I had written to his boss . <p> He was interning at a small production company . The boss liked it , wanted to take it to the studio . I said , " I really need an agent , can you help me get an agent ? " He said yes and he took it to an agent he had a relationship with . The agent read it because this guy who he trusted said that it was worth his time reading . He took it , read it , met with me , and he signed it . <p> That 's a very , very common story for how writers get represented . Second way , I would say , is agents read material that they found through some sort of pre-filtering mechanism . A pre-filtering mechanism could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a top film school and you were the star screenwriter of a USC graduate film school program , some junior agent at an agency is likely reading those scripts and saying , " Oh this is actually a really good writer . This is a person we should consider . " <p> Even without that writer hunting down that agent the agent was looking for who are the best writers coming out of these programs or the best writers coming out of a competition . These are the Nicholls finalists . Those scripts get read and those people will be having meetings with the people they think are potentially really good clients . <p> CRAIG : Makes sense . What 's the third one ? <p> JOHN : Just scouring the world to find interesting voices . I do n't  know how much of this story is really accurate , but the apocryphal story of Diablo Cody is here 's a young woman who 's writing a funny blog . An agent reads the blog and says , " This woman can really , really write . Shes funny , she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I do n't  think all those details are quite accurate , but there 's always those writers who they were doing standup and they 're clearly very funny and someone sees their act and says , " I think that person is a performer but I also think that person is a writer and there 's something there that 's worth pursuing . " <p> CRAIG : I like those . Of course , all of them are predicated on you being a good writer and writing a good script , as is always the case , but those all make sense . I actually asked an agent at CAA named Bill Zotti , I gave him a call earlier today and I asked him the question . Of course , he groaned because it was that question , but he had a couple of pieces of really good advice that I figured I should pass along . <p> One is to make sure that , if you are specifically pursuing an agent , to really know who they represent and ask , " Is this agent appropriate for my material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when hell get query letters or log lines for the kind of movies that his clients just do n't  write . <p> Right now there are a lot of resources out there that are relatively inexpensive , like IMDb Pro for instance , where you can actually see , " OK , let 's say I write movies like Judd Apatow . Who represents Judd Apatow ? Let me see . I write movies like John August . Who represents John August ? Let me see . " <p> If I send that person a query letter and say , " Listen , I 'm a huge fan of John August , I 'm aspiring to write like John August , here 's my log line , " you might actually have a shot . Whereas , if you send it to a guy that represents writers who write rated R broad comedies , that persons going to go , " Well what do I care ? Its not for me . " <p> Do your homework . If you 're going to go through the effort of trying to break the rocks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other advice that he gave that I thought was pretty smart was to get a job in the business , which seems so blindingly obvious , but yet so many people resist it . I know why because its hard and it involves a commitment that you may not be willing to make . <p> He said listen , 80 percent of the people in the mailroom at one of the big talent agencies are not really interested in being agents . They 're there to learn the business because they want to do other things . They want to produce . They want to write . They want to direct . When you work in that business and you work in that place you get to know the other people there . <p> You work next to a guy who suddenly is now an assistant to an agent . You say to him , " Listen , Ive written a script and I 'm going to tell you what the idea is . " If he loves it he s got a chance now to impress his boss with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it . These personal connections are invaluable . <p> Its nearly impossible to do that kind of thing from Rhode Island . <p> JOHN : Yeah . I would also say what your example stresses is the horizontal networking . Everyone always thinks , " Oh to become successful you have to meet more powerful people and get more powerful people to love you . " Its really not that case at all . Its been my experience , but its also been the experience of all my assistants , the way they got to their next step was by helping out everyone else at their same level . <p> They were reading other peoples scripts and giving them notes . Those same friends were reading their scripts . Eventually they wrote that thing that was , " You know what ? This is the script Ive been waiting for you to write and I think I know the right person to take this to . " Its always been those people who were doing exactly the same stuff you were doing who were the next step . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think people should think , as they are horizontally networking , about how they should market themselves . The funny thing is Hollywood , with one hand is saying , " Get out , stay out , " and with the other hand , is saying , " Please , somebody show up , " because they 're hungry for new talent , they 're desperate for new talent . <p> Nothing makes them happier than a writer who 's better than a guy who makes a million dollars that they do n't  have to pay a million dollars to . <p> They 're actually looking , believe it or not . If you can market yourself properly ; for instance we have a couple of friends who wrote a pretty crazy script and just put it out on the Internet and marketed it as this insane thing . It caught on . <p> JOHN : Youre talking about the Robotard 8000 ? <p> CRAIG : I 'm talking about the Robotard 8000 . You may say , " Why would you put your screenplay on the Internet , and why would say it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they have agents at CAA and they 're working . It really got them a lot of attention . <p> Also , it did n't  hurt that other writers that people trusted were saying , " We read this script . This was really funny . " <p> Similarly , I 'll tell you , if I were 22 again and I were in a writers group , I would sayYou and I did n't  have this in the 90s . Let 's get a web page for our writers group , and let 's just start blogging about the experience of our writers group . Let 's track the progress of our scripts and the log lines and the rest of it . If one of us catches somebodys attention , suddenly our writers group has a little bit of buzz to it . " What will this writers group come up with next ? " That 's why that Fempire thing was so cool , with Diablo <p> JOHN : Dana and Lorena . <p> CRAIG : Dana and Lorena . It was like , Okay . There 's a group . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write their own scripts . But something about it , there 's a little bit of sparkly dust to it . Its interesting . <p> How do you make yourself interesting ? Maybe then somebody will be attracted to your script . <p> JOHN : We talked about marketing , but its really almost positioning . People need to know how to consider you , or what to consider you as . here 's a terrible way to go into your first meeting : You wrote a really good comedy script that people liked , so they brought you in , a manager and agent sat down to meet with you . They say , " I really liked your script ; it was really funny . What do you want to write ? " <p> Its like , " Well , I mostly want to write period detective stories with monsters . " The manager is going to hem and haw and make conversation for about another 10 minutes , but they 're not going to want to sign you because they were thinking about you as a comedy person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually get something going . They need to know how are they going to make the next phone call to somebody else , saying , " This guy has a really funny comedy script , but he s exactly the right person to hire for your period action movie . " That just does n't  make sense . <p> CRAIG : It does n't  . Listen , these guys , what is their training in ? Managers and agents are not there to tell you what to be . Their expertise is watching trends and patterns and pulling people out that fit what they believe is going to generate cash . They cant tell you who to be . What they can do is see who you are and say , " That looks like money . " <p> So know who you are . Go in there and be who you are . <p> It does n't  mean that you have to go in there as Michael Bay . Not everybody has to make $200 million movies ; not everybody has to sell $3 million scripts . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I could walk into an agents office and say , " I will never make more than $200,000 a year , but I will make $200,000 every year for the next 20 years and I wont bother you a lot , " that 's an instant signing . Why not ? That 's great . <p> Its not about how much you 're going to do , but just will you do . If you walk into an office and you say , " Look . I wrote this script and this is how I want to come off . These are the movies I love ; this is the niche I want to fill . " If they feel like that 's a real niche and that niche needs filling , that 's a big deal . But they cant tell you who to be . <p> JOHN : Exactly . You have to be able to come to them with material that shows what your talent is , and a story , or at least a way of presenting yourself that leads them to believe , " Yeah , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can achieve that . " <p> CRAIG : People have to understand that agents and managers areLets call them representation . They 're never going to be your mommy or your daddy . They 're not your savior ; they 're not Superman . What they are , essentially , are the vanguard of the endless decision process that leads to a writer being hired . They 're the first people in line to say , " OK , I 'm willing to take a shot on you . " You still have n't made a dollar when you get an agent . But it all is driven by you . <p> JOHN : I always get the question of , how do I get an agent or manager ? Generally , its the person who 's like , " I just finished my first script . How do I get an agent or manager ? " <p> CRAIG : laughs <p> JOHN : OK , you wrote a script , that 's great . After your second script , then I 'll believe you actually can write a second script . Or they 're like , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get a manager ? " Its acknowledging that part of the process is the ability to prove that you can actually do this repeatedly . <p> I think well probably say endlessly in the series of this podcast is that the career of being a screenwriter is not about one script . Its about being able to write 50 scripts . While there may be one script that really gets representations attention , they 're really signing you for the next 30 things you 're going to write . They would love to be able to sell this one script . They mostly want to be able to sell you every year to different producers , different studios , to continue generating cash flow and continue making movies . <p> Then if you think that way , you realize , " Well , I 'd better have something worth getting .

@@42311782 @2311782/ <p> I might begin with the excellent Wikipedia article on the issue , which provides a nice introduction to its usage in English and other Indo-European languages . <p> I 'm a native English speaker , but the first language I studied was Spanish , which I think accounts for my fascination with the subjunctive mood . Its much more commonly heard in Spanish , partly because its usage in English disappears amid polysemy : <p> Cynics have been predicting the death of the subjunctive for years , arguing that it is mostly confined to archaic phrases . I disagree . While there are many shaky grammatical constructs I could easily see collapsing ( who/whom , lay/lie ) , I think the subjunctive has several points in its favor : <p> Most native speakers do n't  know they 're using it . While we notice when its omitted ( " If I was president " ) , the majority of people get it right without knowing why . ( " I demand my account be reactivated immediately . " ) <p> While there are alternatives , they 're rarely better . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactivate my account " or " Reactivate my account , you idiot ! " But neither achieves the same effect as the subjunctive . English thrives on having many ways of saying similar-but-different things . <p> Its really common in religious material . The U.S. is very church-y , so Americans get a weekly dosage of subjunctive in their sermons and prayers . ( " The Lord bless thee and keep thee . The Lord make his face to shine upon thee . The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace . " ) <p> Remember that the subjunctive is invoked by the semantics , not just the words leading up to it : <p> ? If I were correct with my answer , I would have won Jeopardy.but ? If I was correct in my calculations , we should hear a boom in three seconds . <p> Now that I 've expressed my deep affection for the subjunctive , let me urge discretion when using it in screenwriting . Many times , your characters will speak ungrammatically . Your knowledge of the subjunctive should never trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , I 'd say he demanded Sonny kills that other fella lest he rats him out to Bubba . <p> Thats three missed opportunities to use the subjunctive , but it may be the right choice for Pappy .

@@42311783 @2311783/ <p> I 'm a produced screenwriter , repped at a big agency . I work regularly , just had a movie released to good reviews , and am fairly confident when talking about the craft . And so it is with some professional embarrassment ( and using a pseudonymhe he ) that I admit I am plagued by what seems like a rather rudimentary question . <p> Long ago someone I trust read a script of mine . Something was missing from this script , I knew it , I felt it , I could n't quite figure out what it was . I read it and re-read it . Structurally it seemed fine , scene by scene it felt like it was working , the dialogue was tight , the characters well drawn . I took it apart and put it back to together again a couple of times . That missing thing was still missing . <p> So I gave the script to this trusted person and this trusted person read it and gave me this advice : WRITE FROM THEME . Okay . Now , that sounds very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But I do n't  seem capable of integrating this approach into my writing . And the reason , I 've decided , is because I do n't  really know what it means at least in any practical sense . <p> Complicating matters further , a friend of mine , a better writer than I will ever be , the late novelist Lucy Grealy , shrugged off the notion of writing from theme . We were sitting in an airport bar drinking beer and I said , hey , so , do you write from theme ? No , said she without hesitation , tell the story honestly and its theme will emerge . Trying to impose theme on story gives the story an agenda . She accented the word agenda with a dubious little rise in her voice . <p> Ten years later , as I sit down to write , wishing I were better than I am , hoping the next script will be the one where everything finally clicks and art is achieved , I hear a voice in my head saying , Write from Theme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word screenwriters use without defining it clearly , so yes , its bound to be frustrating . But I 'm not sure we should be using it at all . <p> In high school , we were taught that a theme is usually about opposing forces , e.g. " man vs. nature " or " the struggle for independence . " I do n't  know that this kind of analysis is all that useful when you 're talking about a screenplay , however . Its helpful for writing an essay about a movie , not for writing the movie itself . <p> I suspect what your pro-theme writer friends were talking about was some essence that permeates every moment of a good film . Something that 's in its DNA . You feel it when its there , and notice it when its missing even when the script otherwise seems solid . <p> Think back to one of your favorite movies . Chances are , you could pick any moment in it , and it would " feel like " the movie . That is , you could take that little slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would grow into something resembling the original . <p> My favorite movie is Aliens , and it meets this test easily . Pull out any sequence even before Ripley has agreed to join the mission and it would grow into a story that fits its universe . <p> I do n't  know that " theme " is really the best word for this DNA quality I 'm describing . But I think its what we mean when we say it . <h> Theme as the essential idea <p> At the Austin Film Festival this year , I 'll be doing a detailed breakdown of Big Fish and my process writing it . Back in 1998 , while trying to convince Sony to buy the book rights for me , I had a lot of conversations about " what it was about . " Not the plot , really , but what the point of it all was . I talked about the difference between what is true and what is real . <p> I do n't  know that I ever articulated it quite that way , but this was definitely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the script . And for most of my projects , I can point to the DNA ideas : <p> Charlies Angels : Three princesses must save their father , the King . <p> Charlie and the Chocolate Factory : Charlie Bucket was lucky even without the ticket , because he was surrounded by family who loved him . <p> The Remnants : The end of the world is n't so bad . <p> Snake People : Mother is a monster . <p> The Variant : You are still your younger self . <p> The Nines : A creators responsibility to his creations . <p> Go : You cross a line , then your only way out is to accelerate . <p> For the first four projects , I remember saying these things aloud before I started writing . For the others , I probably did n't  . But I could definitely feel the edges of their core ideas before I put pen to paper . I wo n't start writing until I know it . <p> When you really understand a projects DNA , its much easier to write and rewrite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of dialogue belong in your movie , and which do n't  . <p> Every scene in your screenplay can change , but it still feels like the movie . <p> I think one reason movies with multiple writers often feel disjointed is because the writers are n't  working from the same DNA . They might agree on " what its about , " but they 're never going to emotionally approach it the same way . They cant . <p> TV series , which by necessity have a bunch of writers , benefit from having a few filmed and finished episodes to create a baseline . We all know what an episode of Friends is supposed to feel like . But those first few scripts ? Those can be brutal , and it often takes a lot of rewriting from the showrunner . <p> From that point on , " theme " is often what drives a given episode storylines will radiate out from an abstract idea like " hope " or " false promises . " All shows work differently , but if you peek in a writers room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiteboard , circled a few times . <h> Theme as a shibboleth <p> Like " structure , " I see theme thrown around as a term meant to separate artists from hacks . So my eyes generally narrow when someone uses it , because I 'm not sure exactly what they mean , or why they 're using it . <p> One screenwriting teacher made us state the theme of our scripts as a question . Which was difficult and , in my opinion , pointless . <p> The alternate version I 'm positing above the core idea or DNA is practical and actionable . Once you feel confident what your unwritten movie wants to be , you make sure every scene and character and line of dialogue services that ideal . That 's the work of screenwriting , and its hard , to be sure . <p> But if you do n't  pick a target , you 're unlikely to hit anything worthwhile .

That 's pretty common . Contracts would need to clarify who owns the new writing performed on the script in the event the option lapses . The most hard-core version might say that the producer owns any-and-all-revisions , while the more moderate version might allow the screenwriter to claim any work he or she did during the option period . <p> What if Arturo decides he needs to bring in another screenwriter for a rewrite ? Well , unless he s signed something stating otherwise , he can . He s pretty much free to change anything he wants .

Before she signs you , the agent has to believe that ( A ) enough people will be willing to pay you good money to write movies for them , and ( B ) you 'll be able to make those people happy . <p> Most beginning writers worry about agents way too much . After fantasy-casting their script and practicing their acceptance speech , a newbie writer spends 20 minutes a day fretting about an agent . Its wasted time .

Every day when I came home from work ( I was interning at Universal ) , I checked the answering machine , hoping to hear that CAA loved it and wanted to sign me . For more than a month , nothing .

@@42311797 @2311797/ <p> When writing a narrative that jumps back and forth throughout time and events ( ie. PULP FICTION , THE KILLING ) is it standard operating procedure to write the story in a more traditional straight ahead format then re-arrange the script ; or is the script written in a non-linear format as we see it in the movie ? <p> Matt Higgins <p> While there have been cases where a films timeline was juggled after-the-fact ( HEAVEN AND EARTH was one ) , the vast majority of scripts are written with the non-linear elements in place .

@@42311803 @2311803/ <p> I have noticed that many films seem to depend on voice-overs , especially films adapted from novels , I worry about overusing voice over in my own script writing because it seems like a kind of compensation when one cant write the action of a scene , or translate a characters thoughts into a compelling visual . What guidelines would you suggest for writing voice-overs ? <p> CIM <p> Voice-overs have a bad reputation for exactly the reasons you cite . Often , one senses that that writer did n't  do a good job finding visuals and dialogue to tell the story , and thus fell back on the voice-over as a crutch . And its an especially pervasive problem with movies based on books , because the voice-over is often the easiest way to translate prose to the screen . <p> My advice nothing revolutionary is to do everything you can to plan out your story without using any voice-over at all . That means creating scenes that give the important information while moving the story forward , and using images and moments in place of explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appropriate . BIG FISH , which I adapted from a novel by Daniel Wallace , uses voice-over extensively , because the movie is about unraveling the elaborate stories that a man tells . Since storytelling is at the center of the movie , it makes sense that characters will be narrating these tales , both on-camera and off . <p> What 's important is that voice-over should never replace actual scenes , nor should it be redundant to what we do see . If a character opens a box and finds a gun inside , the voice-over should n't say , " When I opened the box , I found a gun inside . " That voice-over adds nothing , except an explanation for the blind . But if the voice-over had said , " My uncle had many ways of keeping us in check , " then you would have changed the dynamic of the scene in an interesting way . <p> Another important factor is which character is doing the voice-over . Whoever you pick will automatically get elevated to Most Important Character status unless you deliberately state otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a character outside of the world ) . Just make sure that whoever gets voice-over power is worth the investment . <p> Finally , a pet peeve . In my opinion , movies should either use voice-over throughout or not at all . If a movie starts with a voice-over , then never uses it again , I get frustrated waiting for it to come back . Similarly , a voice-over that just kicks in at the end is bewildering , because it seems to break the rules of the movie I just watched .

Calling and setting up a meeting ? <p> Josh Caldwell New York <p> It always starts with a meeting , and generally these are set up by an agent or manager .

That 's a pitch . <p> Now usually , before you even go into a pitch meeting , some of the groundwork has been laid . For instance , before I pitched BIG FISH , the executives at Sony read the book , so they had some idea what the project was about . Even in the case of a completely original idea , its good if the recipient has been told what kind of movie you 're pitching a thriller , a comedy , a futuristic prison romance , whatever .

There are a lot of people who say camera angles do n't  belong in a spec . But if you read scripts written by the writers who do sell , they nearly ALWAYS have camera angles.What I see all over the net is a large subculture of new writers excluding camera angles and not selling , while those who have advised them to take this route ARE using them and selling . One professional writer who suggests they be used goes as far as to say that these other pros suggesting they not be used are doing so to deliberately misguide the younger writers positioned to take their jobs . <p> ZD <p> Youre uncovered a vast screenwriting conspiracy , ZD .

Since camera position is a crucial element in the cinematic experience , there are times when its appropriate to mention it , just as it can be necessary to point out costuming , or music , or effects in order to let the reader know what 's what . <p> That said , I almost never use the words " camera " or " angle " in my scripts , because I think those words do tend to disrupt the flow . Rather than write <p> ANGLE ON : The truck SLAMS into the gunman .

@@42311812 @2311812/ <p> One of the more common challenges faced by a screenwriter is how to explain a difficult concept that 's important to your plot .

You can get away with that in a book . If a reader becomes bored , she can skim ahead a few paragraphs until the story begins again . But the movie viewer is hostage , 1 forced to endure whatever information is presented , whether interesting or not . <p> Since the boring bits of a movie are generally the first things to get trimmed out in an edit , these crucial explanatory moments are likely to get dropped unless they 're written extremely carefully , in the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring information .

Just avoid mustache-twirling , and " before I kill you , let me just explain " <p> When possible , let the hero pursue the Answer Man , rather than vice-versa . Nothing screams exposition more than a character showing up simply to explain something . If getting an answer is an explicit goal for your hero , we at least have a sense of forward progress . <h> or just let the characters figure it out for themselves <p> No one teaches Spider-Man how to use his powers . A large chunk of the first movie is spent watching Peter Parker explore his strength and web-shooting prowess . Similarly but less successfully the hero of Jumper finds he s able to teleport , and receives no training or guidance until quite late in the movie.3 <p> If characters need to learn something for themselves , try to build situations that are both organic and progressive : you want to build upon simple , relatable discoveries .

The first Narnia movie would have played very differently if the children had landed in the snowy woods without any sense of how to get back ; the quest to return home would have felt obligatory . By letting them cross back and forth , the movie silently sets up its rule system , and let 's the story chart a different path . <h> Take away the questions <p> Often , the best way to answer questions is to remove them from consideration .

Unless I want a character to explicitly state what a story element represents , there will always be different interpretations .

@@42311838 @2311838/ <p> I love books . I always have . More than just the words and stories , I love books as physical objects : the cloth ribbon of the spine , the sound of pages turning , the smell of the paper . <p> Like most writers Ive met , I was an early and voracious reader . At first , I got my fix from the public library , but once I started being able to buy my own books Scholastic books from the school flyer , or the complete Three Investigators series I quickly filled my shelves . <p> Over the years , my collection grew . A lot . <p> Transporting them was always a pain , of course . During my first few years in Los Angeles , I moved into a new apartment every summmer , which meant boxing up everything again and again . But I felt sure it was worth the hassle . I knew that someday I 'd own a house with a proper library , and I 'd have a permanent place for all these books I 'd accumulated over the years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can hold roughly 2,000 books . And since I honestly do n't  ever want to move again , I think I finally have library I always wanted . <p> Except I do n't  really want the books anymore . <h> What changed <p> Most of the books Ive read in the last few years have been on the Kindle . E-books obviously have pros and cons , both for readers and authors . As a consumer , I mostly value their convenience : my book is always there , ready to read when I want it . <p> But its not just the experience of reading that 's changed . The notion of " owning " a book on Kindle is very different than owning a physical book . An e-book does n't  sit half-read on a table , mocking you for not finishing it . There 's never a question of where to store it when you 're done . E-books are the clever butlers of literature : there when you want them , absent when you do n't  . <p> Over time , e-books have become my default choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , I 'll pick bits over atoms . <p> And the same holds true for books I already own . Until quite recently , if I wanted to re-read Candide , I 'd find the paperback copy on my shelf . But now , honestly , I 'm more likely to read it on my Kindle , or my iPad or my iPhone . <p> So why keep all these printed books ? <p> I can think of a few reasons : <p> To show off . For most of human history , vast personal libraries meant you had money and culture . Even now , I 'll confess to gawking at library porn . But something about huge private libraries makes me queasy , the same as when someone has a giant swimming pool or double tennis courts . How much can you actually use those ? Why not share them ? <p> To remember . With some books , I remember exactly when I read them . I can feel the plastic-y beanbag chair upon which I read The Mists of Avalon . The physical book helps ground the experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stared at those pages . <p> To have a backup , just in case . An electromagnetic pulse could theoretically wipe out all the data in North America . But if that were to happen , I think I 'd have bigger concerns than wanting to re-read Tess of the DUrbervilles . <p> So , for the last year , I 've been casting a hard eye on my books . Every few weeks , I pick a new shelf . Taking each book in hand , I force myself to choose between three options : Keep , Donate or Recycle . <p> Recycle is for books that do n't  have value for me , and probably do n't  have value for anyone else . In this category go old software manuals and how-to books , " modern " science books more than 10 years old , and outdated travel guides . My test is n't " might this book be useful for someone , " but rather , " is it likely that someone wants this physical copy ? " If the answer is no , it goes in the blue recycling bin . 
@@42311839 @2311839/ <p> You knowing a lot about screenwriting and the law , I 've got a question about ethics and rights ; When is a screenplay an homage , as opposed to an illegal rip-off/unauthorized remake ? <p> Let 's take Seven Samurai for instance .

An " idea " is essentially unprotectable , so seven guys defending a village can be done any number of times without owing a dime ( or a tip of the hat ) to Mr. Kurosawa .

@@42311841 @2311841/ <p> These terms deal with different forms or stages of a screenwriters work . A " spec script " is a completed screenplay , probably about 120 pages long , that a writer wrote on his own . That 's the " spec " part , meaning that no one paid the writer in advance to write it , just like a house built on spec does n't  have a buyer until its finished . Most writers first screenplays would be considered specs , because its rare for someone to hire a writer without reading his or her work first . <p> " Treatment " and " outline " mean different things to different people , and one writers treatment might be anothers outline . Regardless , treatments and outlines map out a movie story , often as a precursor to writing the full screenplay .

When you 're ready for formatting , helper apps do the work of adding margins and page breaks . <p> Screenwriters can use Fountain for writing scripts , but its also ideal for archiving . <p> Because they 're just text , Fountain files are basically future-proof . Youll be able to open and edit them 100 years from now . You cant say the same for . fdr , . mmsw or most of the other proprietary formats . And while . pdfs maintain formatting , they 're nearly impossible to edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fountain Ave. , the famous Hollywood shortcut.1 <p> We see Fountain as a path rather than a destination . Its not an app . Its not even really a file format . Its a way of getting from a jumble of words to a screenplay . <p> If you 're familiar with Markdown , this is the screenwriting equivalent . That 's no coincidence ; I actually exchanged my first emails with Markdowns creator , John Gruber , way back in 2004 . <p> I wrote : <p> I 'd like to have a Markdown-like syntax for formatting text documents into screenplay form . This way , writers who wanted to use their favorite text editor could still generate well-formatted scripts . <p> Good ideas sometimes sit around for a while . <p> In 2008 , Nima Yousefi and I built a modest implementation called Scrippets , which we released as a plug-in for WordPress and other platforms . Scrippets made it easy to insert small bits of screenplay-like material in blog posts and forums , but it was never intended for full-length screenplays. 2 <p> Credit for the full spec goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Screenplay Markdown ) . Recognizing that duplicated effort is wasted effort , we 've spent the past few months merging the standards to what it is today . <p> Fountain shares a lot of its syntax with Scrippets , 3 but we really rethought everything in order to accommodate a range of writing situations and styles . Its been a process of balancing philosophical consistency ( no symbols ) with practical concerns ( centering titles ) . Through it all , Stus vision and vigilance moved this from being a good idea to an actual thing . <h> Using Fountain <p> You can write Fountain in any text editor on nearly any device , from an iPad to a Commodore-64 . If you can get a text file out of it even an email you 're Fountain-ready . <p> In its raw state , Fountain is great for first drafts .

We want to see an ecosystem of apps and services that handle Fountain . <h> The road ahead <p> Back when we announced FDX Reader , I got a lot of emails asking , " When are you going to make a screenwriting app ? " <p> Answer : Today . My hope is that we just made a thousand . Fountain turns every text editor into a screenwriting app . <p> To me , calls for a " Final Draft killer " are hugely misguided .

I became a corporation shortly after Go . <p> The idea is that the studios do n't  hire you directly . Rather , the studio makes a deal to " borrow " your services from a corporation that you 've created . These one-person corporations are called " loan-outs , " because loaning out your time and talent is all they really do . <p> What 's the point ? Well , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the studio is paying you as a corporation , rather than as an individual , its easier to deduct business expenses , such as office space , assistants and computers . Your corporation can set up a pension plan for its sole employee : you . You can also avoid paying personal income tax on the money for a longer period of time . ( Though you do eventually have to pay it . ) <p> The second advantage is liability . Let me first invoke my Im Not a Lawyer Disclaimer so do n't  bank on what I 'm saying . But the corporation can help shield your personal assets ( your house , your car , your toothbrush ) from lawsuits that might come up relating to your screenwriting career . If I 'm a bit fuzzy on the details , its because I never , ever want to be sued . <p> The only real drawbacks of incorporating is the expense and the additional paperwork quarterly statements and such .

But that was 1999 , so who knows what the current figure is . <p> My suggestion would be to talk with your attorney , and get his advice . He s the one who would actually be filing the paperwork with the state to get it all set up . <p> Also , if you 're living outside the U.S. , all bets are off . You 'll need to find someone familiar with the specific rules of your country . For instance , Ireland has amazing tax breaks for writers .

@@42311849 @2311849/ <p> I have a question about your upcoming film , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory .

Charlie only bring Grandpa Joe , for reasons that are never entirely clear . According to the rules on the Golden Ticket , he s allowed to bring two parents , but he does n't  . <p> When Tim Burton and I first sat down to talk about how we were going to adapt Dahls book for the screen , the two-parent issue was one of my first questions . In addition to being a little unfair to Charlie , having each of the rotten kids bring both parents presented a lot of problems . <p> With a book , the reader can conveniently forget that Mrs. Teavee has n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that character is always going to be on-screen . Which means she needs to be doing something , saying something . She has to interact with all the other characters in the scene , who in turn have to interact with each other , which steals focus from Charlie , Willy Wonka , and the rotten kids . <p> Basically , twice the parents means everyone gets half as much to say and do . <p> So we quickly decided that the rule on the Golden Ticket would be that every kid gets to bring one parent or guardian . No fuss , no muss . <p> Then the question becomes , which parent goes with which kid ? <p> In my mind , piggy Augustus got that way because he had a mother who equated food with love . So Mrs. Gloop would be the first parent . We do n't  learn much about her except that she and her husband own a sausage shop in Germany . <p> Violet Beauregarde claimed to be the world record-holder in chewing gum , so we decided to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauregarde , herself a former baton champion . We never say anything about Violets father . <p> Veruca Salt is a daddys girl gone wicked , manipulative and bossy . So it only made sense for her to bring her father , a British nut baron . <p> Finally , there 's Mike Teavee . In Dahls book , he s obsessed with TV westerns and shoot-em-up cop shows . Updating it a bit , we gave him violent videogames and a well-meaning but completely over-his-head father , who is literally bullied by his son . <p> Even with just these four characters , it took work to find enough for everyone to do and say . In the Chocolate Room , for instance , we have to keep track of Willy Wonka , Charlie , Grandpa Joe , Augustus , Mrs. Gloop , Violet , Ms. Beauregarde , Veruca , Mr. Salt , Mike and Mr. Teavee . Thats eleven characters , not counting the Oompa-Loompas . If wed added four more parents to the scene , we 'd probably still be shooting it .

I did n't  have any particularly good advice for her what she describes is hardly unique . In fact , the situation is so much the norm that I asked if she would write up a post about her experiences , since Ive never really discussed it on the blog . <p> Some background info might help readers brand-new to the industry : <p> When a screenwriter is hired to write for a studio , the contract is negotiated between her lawyer/representatives and the studios . Even when the basic terms are figured out , it still takes a few rounds of back and forth to generate the actual paper contracts you sign . <p> Screenwriters are paid half up front . If a writer is being paid $100K for a rewrite , its delivered in two chunks : $50K at commencement , and $50K when the draft is delivered . <p> Much of what were talking about here relates only to features . Because of time pressures , TV works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post for my favorite screenwriting blog , but have decided to do so anonymously for fear of studio retribution . I 'd like to note , though , that its ridiculous we writers are scared to talk about what is a contractual right being paid on time . <p> I have gotten paid late for every project Ive written in my somewhat nascent career . Often I find myself holding a script hostage for the commencement check . Not even for the delivery check . My agent and lawyer have said they are frustrated , but it is normal . I started to wonder does it have to be ? <p> I tried to read what the MBA1 says on the topic , but because it is 452 pages long and contains so much legal jargon , I almost went blind on the first page . So instead of losing my valuable eyesight , I thought it prudent to attend the Late Pay Seminar recently held at the WGA headquarters . <p> Some of what I learned was very , very obvious and also surprisingly helpful . <p> Heres what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all understand ) : <p> 1 ) " Commencement " for a project begins when there is a signed and dated contract .

When the producer says , " The studio told us to get started ! " it does n't  count . It does n't  even count when the studio exec in charge calls you herself to tell you . <p> A signed and dated contract is the only thing that means you 're commenced . This may seem obvious , but most writers are starting without a signed contract . I have . Every time . It almost burned me on two projects this year alone when , after I had already completed first drafts , there were contractual conditions that had not been met ( underlying rights had n't  been untangled , producer deals had n't  been completed ) and I could n't get paid until they were . <p> 2 ) We the writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed copies of our contracts to the Guilds " contracts " department as soon as they are signed .

Often a writers agent does this , and if they do , the writer should request to be CCd . <p> 6 ) The Company is then supposed to pay the writer ( again ) within seven calendar days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest accrues . <p> Excuse me a second while I drag this little soap box out of my closet : <p> When writers do n't  follow these steps , most especially when they start writing without a contract , they make it nearly impossible for the WGA to arbitrate and get them paid . <p> Now that I am armed with this information , I need to have a difficult conversation with my agent about refraining from starting a project until everything is signed . <p> In theory , agents and lawyers should be all for this . In fact , they should be encouraging writers not to get started until the contracts are signed and the check clears , because that 's when they get paid , too , right ? Wrong . <h> Sympathy for agents <p> Agents and lawyers deal with the same executives all day long on various projects . If an executive they deal with frequently wants a writer to start on a project because the contract wont be done for months , it makes the agents/lawyers lives easier to say " sure " so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new deal and a different client , goes smoothly . <p> That 's not a criticism of the excellent job agents and lawyers often do , its just the reality of the business ( hell , if I was in their position , I 'd probably do the same thing ) . What it means is that writers have to be the ones to firmly convey to our representatives that we can not start work until those contracts are signed . <p> The MBA also apparently states that the Company must make a good faith effort to have a contract to the writer within 10 days of agreeing on the major deal points . In my experience , that has never come close to happening . So , adhering to this rule is n't always feasible . <p> One writer at the seminar talked about landing a big project based on a well-known property and the studio demanded he start writing because there was a start date already scheduled for the movie . Had he waited for a signed contract , by the time they sorted out the underlying property rights , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fired him , taken his best ideas , and hired someone else who was willing to start writing before the contracts were signed . <p> And frankly , I 've always been so grateful to be working that Ive been reluctant to say , " Sorry , I cant write without a contract . " But I left the seminar thinking : If we all tried to adhere to the commencement rule a little more firmly , and actually followed the steps listed above per the MBA , would the companies miraculously be able to turn the contracts and checks around faster ? At 1.5% interest/month , we 'd make it much more expensive for the studios to pay us late , and would probably be able to at least decrease the frequency of the practice . <p> Its not that I think the Companies , or the executives , or the producers are out to get us . They are simply doing their jobs in a bad economy holding onto their money ( which accrues interest for them ! ) as long as they can while getting projects turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is their bottom line . <p> But we writers are the presidents , secretaries , development executives and janitors of our own little businesses . And money has to be our bottom line too so that we can pay for things like rent and food and overpriced holiday egg nog lattes , and free our minds to be creative , which is what they are hiring us for in the first place . <p> If we do n't  advocate for ourselves , nobody else is going to do it for us . <p> Here is where I 'll disagree with the writer a bit . While I understand WGA policy , I 'm okay writing without signed contracts . Just pay me commencement . <p> Studios are n't  eager to do this , obviously . When I ask , I rarely succeed .

" <p> If you think the dialogue would probably be subtitled in the movie , italicize it in the script . <p> If characters are speaking in a foreign language for the duration of a scene or scenes , put a parenthical like " ( in Russian ; subtitled ) " for the first speaking character , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scenes . <p> This is more of a pet peeve , but a lot of words that are technically foreign are pretty common in Engish too , so do n't  italicize things like gringo , taco , samurai or vis-a-vis .

@@42311860 @2311860/ <p> Todays question is n't really a question at all , but rather an investigation into how many lines of type should fit on a standard screenwriting page . While this may seem frivolous a little like " How Many Angels Can Dance on the Head of a Pin " almost every screenwriter has tweaked and shuffled , nipped and tucked to get a draft a few pages shorter . <p> Lines-per-page translates into lines-per-script , which is arguably a better metric than page count for how long a script " really " is . So I applaud Jeff trying to figure it out . <p> I have a seemingly simple formatting question that I can not find the answer to anywhere : How many lines should fit on a page ? <p> I do n't  ask for help with out trying to help myself first , but believe me , this one has got me stumped . My research yields vastly different results and even an interesting ( disturbing ? ) modern trend . ( I know its a long read for an e-mail , but I 've done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I know all about setting margins and screenwriting software , but even following those suggestions , there appears to be a large discrepancy in the actual number of lines per page from script to script . here 's how I have counted lines per page for purposes of this research : <p> Open a screenplay up to any page , start at the first line of screenplay on that page ( a scene heading , character name , dialogue , action ; not white space or a page number ) and count that as ONE . Then , count every line after that ( including white space ) all the way to the last line of screenplay on that page ( not including bottom CONTINUEDs if the script has them ) . The number you end up with is what I call Screenplay Lines per Page . <p> I have checked dozens of screenwriting books and asked various professionals that I can manage to speak with . Not one book mentioned anything about the number of lines that should fit on a page . One producer told me that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into 1/8ths of a page , each 1/8th being seven lines long . Eight times seven is fifty-six . Sounds logical . <p> So I checked scripts . While I did n't  count every page of a screenplay , I sampled a few pages to get the general feel for the average lines per page . What I found was interesting : <p> While I figured that page length would vary within a script , I found that most scripts were pretty consistent , with few pages outside plus/minus one off the average . ( That is , a script that usually had 56 lines per page , would mostly have pages with lengths from 55-57 lines . ) <p> Older scripts tend to have more lines per page . A completely random sample : Apocalypse Now has about 57 lines per page . Body Heat , also about 57 . Aliens has many pages pushing 60 . This corresponds to the info from the producer . Fifty-six lines per page seemed to be a good number to shoot for . <p> However , more modern scripts tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Big Fish and Go look to be in the 52-53 line range . Bruce Almighty is about 52 . Even Saving Private Ryan with its 162 pages and four inch dialogue margins falls about 52 lines per page . <p> here 's the issue : The old 120 page average has become the 120 page maximum . The average now looking like 110 pages , some sources even saying 100 pages is n't too short . But on top of that , we seem to have " lost " about 4 or 5 lines per page . Those five lines account for almost 10 additional pages . So , in reality , a 110 page script of today is really 20 pages shorter than a 120 page script of say , twenty years ago . <p> Obviously , executives have chopped about 10 pages off the old 120 because they do n't  want to read , want the movie to be cheaper ( shorter ) , and want it to have more screenings per day ( shorter ) . But have writers also cut another 10 pages ( consciously or subconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a side note , does n't  this say something about the old one minute per page rule ? If you really want to mess with that , look at Schindlers List : 155 pages , a mere 41 lines per page , and a run time of 194 minutes ! <p> With all the strict rules on formatting and the adherence to the one page equals one minute concept it seems that having a standard number of lines per page would be a clear way to reinforce appropriate screenplay length . However , just the opposite has occurred no one talks about lines per page . I realize that no one is going to toss out a script because they notice ( which they wo n't ) that the script has about 56 lines per page rather than 52 . <p> So , the question remains : How many lines should fit on a page ? Is there a rule ? If not , why does it seem that modern scripts have fewer lines than in the past ? Something had to happen to lessen not just the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ask because I want to get the most out of my pages while keeping the format correct and in touch with modern trends . This is no small matter : there are 10 pages hidden in the difference between 56 lines per page and 52 lines per page . Any insight is appreciated . <p> Jeff Los Angeles <p> So what 's the real answer ? Obviously , there is n't any hard and fast rule . I can only offer one more example : <p> Warner Bros. is the only studio that still has a script processing department . I 've never met the people who work there , but based on terrible experiences I 've had , my minds eye sees them as four women in their 60s who smoke , watch soaps , and make fun of these dumb screenwriters and their high-fallutin words . True typists who average 80 words per minute , they clack away on vintage IBMs terminals with burnt-in amber monitors , grateful to whatever union keeps them employed despite complete irrelevance . <p> But I digress . <p> When you 're hired to write a script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dug mine out for Barbarella . According to it , there should be 60 lines per page . Right above that figure , however , they list the font as being Prestige Pica or Courier ( 12 point , 10 pitch ) , which tells you immediately that they really have n't adjusted for modern times . While point sizes are still used , pitch is a vestige of typewriters . <p> Incidentally , even if you follow Warner Bros. formatting guidelines , they retype your script anyway . This undermines any authority of Warner Bros. formatting guidelines : the scripts they produce are without question some of the ugliest and least-readable screenplays Ive read .

Every time they hear your clever dialogue , you want them to fall more and more in love with your show , so theyll give it a plum spot on the fall schedule . <p> But in many ways , you really do n't  want to use your best scenes in the sides , because of one horrible truth : you will hear the exact same scene 5,000 times .

@@42311865 @2311865/ <p> How would you go about writing two scenes in a script that run at the same time in split screen , but do n't  necessarily have anything to do with each other ? Basically like a scene from the movie TIMECODE . <p> John <p> That 's a real challenge to do in standard screenplay format . While someone watching a movie can follow the action happening in multiple sections of the screen at once , the reader simply cant . Reading is a left-to-right , top-to-bottom process . So you 're going to have to figure out another way to communicate the same idea . <p> Your approach depends on how crucial the split-screen timing becomes . For instance , in an earlier draft of the first CHARLIES ANGELS , there was a chase sequence between Alex ( Lucy Liu ) and the Thin Man ( Crispin Glover ) , in which they were both trying to get to the roof of the building in order to reach the satellite dish that Eric Knox was using . The chase started with the two characters on opposite sides of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the screen . We then followed each character on separate , sometimes overlapping paths , as they fought their way to the roof . Finally , Alex kicked the Thin Man " through " the center dividing line . <p> In this example , the exact timing of who-is-where-when was important , so I chose to write the action as two parallel columns on a horizontal page . It was a pain in the ass to format , because Final Draft couldnt handle it , so each time I printed out the script I had to make sure to leave blank " filler " pages in which to insert the properly-formatted side-by-side pages . Still , it was a fun challenge . <p> Ultimately , the split-screen stuff was dropped and the sequence became about Alex and the Thin Man kicking the crap out of each other . For TIMECODE , Mike Figgis apparently did n't  work off a traditional screenplay at all . The entire movie was rehearsed and reshot more than a dozen times .

East and west are considered " cross-town , " a term which is most often used with the observation that its often a pain in the ass getting cross-town . <p> Streets run cross-town , while avenues run uptown/downtown .

So will most Kindle readers . But its your call . You can override it by setting the text-align property for your paragraph tags . <p> In books , you often leave a blank line or two between sections of text . Its best if that 's not indented , so add a CSS rule to do that . Following Joshua Tallents lead , I used a CSS class . noind with text indent set to 0 , and applied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text to start a little lower on the first page , so I added &lt;p height= " 40 " &gt;&amp;nbsp ; &lt;/p&gt; .

@@42311886 @2311886/ <p> I originally posted this as a reply in a screenwriting forum , but its pretty relevant here . <p> When I bought my first LaserWriter printer ( probably 1993 ) , I freaked out because Courier was suddenly ghastly thin . On my old StyleWriter inkjet , it had looked properly typewriter-like , but coming out of the laser printer , it was a shadow of its former self . <p> It bothered me enough that I used Fontographer to pull the Type 1 Courier outlines from the printer , then chunk-ify them a bit and save them as a Type 3 font , which I called Dorphic . ( I have no idea why I picked that name , but it seemed to fit . ) <p> So for many years , I happily used Dorphic on all my scripts . GO , for example , was in Dorphic . I would probably still be using that face , but the shift to OS X made Type 3 fonts impossible . I scoured the net for new options , and settled on Courier Ragged , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new problem came up . Up until about 2003 , when I needed to turn in a script to a producer or studio executive , I would print it out and call for a messenger . I could be certain the script would look right , because I was printing it myself . But once executives ( and their assistants ) became more internet-savvy , it made a lot more sense to turn in scripts in . pdf form . So , while I could use Courier Ragged , there was no guarantee it would look right when they printed it out . <p> All of which leads me back full-circle to plain old Courier . Of the natural alternatives ( Courier New , or Courier Final Draft ) , its the best-looking to me , both on-screen and printed . <p> A side-note : Before I became a screenwriter , I made a meager living in graphic design . So the cruelest irony is that Ive now spent a decade using nothing but 12-pt Courier , or its imitators. 
@@42311887 @2311887/ <p> Less IMDb , our browser extension for de-cluttering the otherwise useful movie site , seems to have achieved good traction . In its first month , it was installed more than 8,000 times , and made it to the main page of Apples Safari Extensions Gallery . <p> It is now available for Safari , Chrome and Firefox . A quick break down by the numbers : 1 <p> Safari : 6,118 <p> Chrome : 849 <p> Firefox : 1,088 <p> I 'm not surprised the Safari version is way ahead of the others ; it came first , and got a big boost from the Apple-centric Daring Fireball site . But I would have expected more love from Chrome , honestly . <p> I 've asked Ryan Nelson , who did all the design and coding , to give a walk-through of our process building and deploying the extension . This recap has a fairly high geek factor , but you may find some of the decision points interesting even if the details whoosh over your head . <p> Per Twitter , most people hated the newly-redesigned IMDb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Safari extension , his direction was minimal and straightforward : move credits from below-the-fold to up near the top . <p> He even provided a mockup of how it should look . When working on a new design , its fairly typical for John to create a wireframe or rough as a starting point : <p> And how would the user control the extension ? Johns original suggestion : <p> John essentially decided what content Less IMDb would show , and what it would hide . But how would it deal with other bits of the interface , like IMDbs ability to expand or collapse filmography listings ? <p> The " less features is a feature " attitude informed the rest of the choices made when stripping IMDb to its bare bones . <h> Nuts and Bolts <p> To start , I worked from a locally-saved copy of IMDbs movie and bio page HTML. - This way I could experiment with the IMDbs markup without an extension to inject my javascript or CSS files on the actual IMDb.com . I learned along the way more about how Safari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yousefi , 2 as this was my first one . <p> Using a combination of CSS and the ubiquitous jQuery javascript library , I rearranged and hid content . <p> This bit moves things to the sidebar . <p> I did n't  approve of IMDbs use of tables for layout since tables are intended for tabular data . Its not 1994 anymore . <p> Since the original extension was only intended to run on Safari , I was free to use nifty CSS3 effects like drop-shadows , rounded corners , and gradient backgrounds , and one other in a well-hidden Easter egg . <p> But I was careful not to overwhelm the design with these goodies . In fact , I removed some that IMDb was already using . For example , every container div in IMDbs main column had gray rounded borders . Outlining every block of content with rounded gray borders is a trap every designer has been caught in . Ive been there . Were they needed ? <p> No . I lost them . Much cleaner look . <p> The first prototype simply moved - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pages heading went along with it . That got things out of the way instantly , and moved the credits closer to the top . Form a design perspective , it did n't  quite make sense for the page heading to be on the right , since English is read from left-to-right . <p> I needed to move the heading on the left above the credits . <p> But since the objective was to move the credits higher on the page , and the filmography navigation was already pushing those down , I opted to move the entire sidebar to the left , simply to keep the heading in its proper place . <p> The final arrangement seemed to work well . <h> The Control <p> Because Safari extensions support custom browser toolbar buttons ( up in the area with the address bar and arrows ) , I was keen on trying out that feature . But it was unneeded . Johns suggestion of including controls in the page itself made more sense . <p> Sometimes bells and whistles sound best unplayed . <p> While designing the control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and challenged myself to create a nifty-looking controller using no images . The borders , lines , gradients , shadows , and circles in Less IMDbs on/off control are all generated using CSS3 . <p> I eventually used a graphic for the " Less IMDb " label , which is the only image included in the extension . <p> In fact , this is a rare occasion where I did all the design purely in CSS , rather than mocking it up in photoshop beforehand , then duplicating it in CSS . The controls found on the Less IMDb page at Quote-Unquote Apps are actually images I recreated in photoshop for browser-compatibility purposes . <p> Oh Joan , you 're such a pill . <p> Here is my original design . I was happy with how the CSS3 was looking , but the design took up more space than it needed , and would cover part of the page when the browser window is resized smaller than 1000px wide . Back to the drawing board . <p> In an effort to save space , I moved the control flush to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one corner , and used webkits support for the CSS3 transition property to slide the control in and out of view when moused-over . I added more attention to detail by changing the opacity and added a slight delay before the controller hides itself again to prevent it from jumping in and out of view wildly . <p> The Icon <p> Creating the icon was a quick process . I showed John a few options , and away we went . <p> A few losers . I still like the yellow ones . <h> Assistants , Utilities , Keys , Certificates , and Manifests <p> Although there are some hoops to jump through , Apple makes developing extensions for Safari fairly straightforward . The tools to create a new one are included in the browser itself ( " Develop " &gt; " Show Extension Builder " ) . <p> Before any extension can be run , however , you 'll need to install a developer certificate . <p> Registering as a Safari developer is free . After a few forms and an email verification , you 'll be all set . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Log into your new developer account and enter the Developer Certificate Utility . Itll walk you through the process . <p> Keep the Safari window open , and launch Keychain ( " Applications " &gt; " Utilities " &gt; " Keychain " ) . The certificate assistant walks you through the process of being walked through the process . <p> The assistant will ask for some information . Enter the email address you created the developer account with , label your key with a " Common Name " and choose " save for disk . " <p> Go back to your Safari window , where the certificate utility should be asking to upload the key you just created . Find that newly-saved file and upload it . <p> A couple clicks later you 'll be able to download your developer certificate . <p> Almost done , but you 're not out of the woods yet . <p> Find the certificate Safari downloaded and double-click it . Keychain will install the certificate. - With a developer certificate installed , you 'll now be able to install and test Safari extensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; " Show Extension Builder " ) . <p> Heres what ours looks like with is dotted and ts crossed . <p> When the extension is ready for distribution or testing , " Build Package " will create an installable . safariextz file . Anyone with a developer account is free to submit an extension to Apple 's Extension Gallery at LONG ... but do n't expect this to be a quick process . It took almost two months before Apple listed Less IMDb . <p> And remember that Apple does n't host any files so you 'll need a reliable web host for the extension and update manifest ( the file that let 's Safari know when the extension is ready to be updated ) . <h> Porting it <p> When the Safari extension was first released , the most common responses ( other than universal praise and brief world peace ) were requests to port the extension to other browsers . Chrome supports its flavor of browser extensions which , because of their shared webkit rendering engine under the hood , are very similar . <p> The easiest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the widely-used- Firefox add-on that allows users to customize websites by installing bits of code . A little digging revealed that Chrome also features some built-in support for Greasemonkey user scripts . <p> Great news , right ? Simply create one user script , and it would take care of both Chrome and Firefox . My remaining work was just cut in half ! <p> This would be a poor choice on my part . <h> Auto-Update Asphyxiation <p> One great feature of Safari is its ability to automatically update installed extensions . Chrome supports identical functionality but its only available to proper Chrome extensions , not Greasemonkey user scripts . Even though Chrome installs and displays the user scripts alongside other proper extensions , they are second-class citizens . <p> Since all versions of Less IMDb needed an auto-update feature to keep up with future adjustments or bug-fixes , we needed a method that could work on both Firefox and Chrome . <p> There are a handful of user script auto-updaters out there , but most are clunky or rely on someone elsee web server to function . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Some worked ok , but none worked in Chrome . <p> I attempted to write my own simple auto-updater which would communicate with an XML file on quoteunquoteapps.com using AJAX . I attributed my failures to my lack of AJAX prowess before eventually discovering that cross-domain requests are not allowed in Chrome user scripts.3 <p> Less IMDb simply was n't allowed to talk to the outside world . Attempting to combine the two versions into one was severely crippling the Chrome version . <p> After re-grouping , it was obvious that the Safari extension needed to be ported more-or-less directly to Chrome . That was relatively straightforward , and was finished in about a day . The attempt to combine both Chrome/Firefox versions was n't a total failure , though . The legwork to get Less IMDb to run in Firefox was already done . Prestothree versions of Less IMDb . <p> Well continue to update Less IMDb to address changes on IMDbs side , but for the most part we consider it done . Ryans projects for the next few months include some bona fide iOS apps and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give props to another Safari extension I found incredibly useful in the process : Coda Notes by Panic . As Ryan sent over demo links , Coda Notes made it simple to make scribbly changes . I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to offer feedback to web designers . <p> These stats reflect downloads from our site , not any direct installs via the Safari Extension Gallery . As the extension updates , we should be able to pull more precise figures . ? <p> A righteous dude who is helping us with some other projects as well . ? <p> They were allowed in Firefox user scripts , but only by using the GMxmlhttprequest function , which Chrome does not support . ?

@@42311895 @2311895/ <p> While wasting time on Scriptsales.com , I came across a sci-fi/thriller you sold to Columbia back in 2000 .

Any chance well ever get to see it produced ? <p> Dan Los Angeles <p> The real question is if I 'll ever write it . <p> I sold this project as a pitch . Basically , I had a good idea for a scary , expensive tent-pole summer movie , so I met with Amy Pascal ( who runs Columbia Pictures ) and she liked it . Deals were made . Contracts were signed . <p> But then things got busy with the second Charlies Angels , Big Fish , and a half-dozen other movies I worked on . In the meantime , a long-dormant project at another studio came roaring back to life , and it was clear that I 'd have to make some big changes to avoid overlapping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say what that other movie is , but it is being made . ) <p> So , as often happens , my project was put on a back burner . I never typed so much as a " FADE IN : " , nor have I been paid anything . Still , I may get around to writing it one day , because there 's some very intriguing stuff in the concept , which is n't obvious in the press release . <p> One thing to bear in mind when reading about any project in the trades is that filmmakers will often be a little disingenous about the actual plot , for fear of spoiling the surprise . That 's certainly the case here . Suffice to say the movie is much less Jurassic Park-y than you 'd think . 
@@42311897 @2311897/ <p> How does someone go about adapting a written story to film format ? Thanks . <p> Sam Ruin <p> Probably half the movies made are adaptations of one sort or another . The original source material might have been a novel , a short story , an article or even a 1970s TV show ( such as " Charlies Angels , " coming to a theater near you November 3 ) . <p> Sorry for the blatant plug . Back to the question . <p> The first issue you face with any adaptation is rights . The author of the original material generally holds the copyright , which means he or she has say over whether or not a movie can be made based on the material , and for what price . So if you 're serious about adapting the work , you 'll want to check with the original authors publisher ( in the " sub-rights " department ) and get contact information so you can start the process of buying or optioning these rights . ( " Optioning " is something like " leasing-to-buy , " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a promise to pay more later if the movie gets made . ) <p> Its important to note that copyright expires , so if you 're looking at adapting something originally written in the 1800s , there 's a good chance the work is considered to be " in the public domain , " which means you wont have to secure any rights at all . <p> Of course , there 's a big difference between having the rights to a story and actually having a movie to make . Adapting a story into movie form is a lot harder than it might seem at first . <p> The basic problem is that movies work so differently than most fiction or other prose . <p> In novels or short stories , the prose is the final product . Screenplays , on the other hand , are blueprints . They 're a plan for making a movie , but not the movie itself . While the author of a novel has the final say about everything that happens in a story , the screenwriter is by default only one of many hands in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project will change it in one way or another . Thus the screenplay has to communicate the overall vision for the movie , above and beyond all the details of character , plot and theme . In short , a book is just a book , but a screenplay has to be a story , a plan , a sales tool and a mission statement all in one . <p> Fiction can ramble . Screenplays have to be ruthlessly efficient . <p> In fiction , the author can say what a character is thinking . In movies , a screenwriter does n't  have that option , without resorting to some device like a voice-over or flashback . <p> The reader of a book can put a book down and think about it , or flip back a few pages if something was confusing . Sitting in the theater , the audience does n't  have that opportunity . The movie keeps going , 24 frames per second , no matter what . Therefore , the screenwriter has to be extra attentive to make certain the audience will be able to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fundamentally a visual medium , so the screenwriter has to be able to tell the story with images . Yes , there 's sound and dialogue , but the picture is king . In a book , the author can say what a character tastses or smells or feels . In a movie , all the audience can experience is sight and sound , so the screenwriter needs to communicate everything through only these two senses . <p> Given these challenges , it becomes clear why adapting a book into a movie is n't a matter of feeding the pages into a projector . It also explains why so many bad movies are made from good books . <p> So how do you begin an adaptation ? The most important thing is to approach the project as a movie , with all the strengths and limitations of the medium , rather than as a novel or short story . Focus on the primary characters , their goals and obstacles . Rather than trying to winnow down the source material to fit into 120 pages , try to invite in only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than strip down . <p> And most importantly , remember that adaptation is n't any easier than writing a screenplay from scratch . So do n't  beat yourself when certain aspect worked in the novel but not in your script . Theyre different beasts . 
@@42311898 @2311898/ <p> In an earlier question about finding confidence as a writer , you stated : " Most good writers werent popular growing up . " While this is true in my case ( that I was n't popular growing up ) , do you think also being an unpopular adult ( which I am as well ) could make a GREAT writer ? Or just a whiny , self-obsessed loser who writes nothing but whiny , self-obsessed drivel ( which I 'm starting to suspect I do ) ? <p> Dave Albany , NY <p> Just to be clear , I do n't  think childhood unpopularity is a golden ticket to success as a screenwriter . I would never give my child a bad haircut , or rub him with cat litter , just in the hope that hell win the Oscar when he s 40 . There are many , many unpopular children who grow up to be terrible writers . Maybe , Dave , you 're one of them . <p> Or maybe not . The simple fact is , one cant judge a writers talent based on how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in terms of screenwriting , being extremely unpopular is a detriment . Unlike , say , a novelist , the screenwriter has to put on a clean shirt and meet with executives , humoring them when they offer insipid notes and feigning interest in their personal lives . These delicate social skills are hard to pick up if you frighten small children and annoy the elderly . <p> Its this social component of screenwriting that explains why some less-talented writers ( the proper term is " hacks " ) seem to have undeserved success . Theyre good at being screenwriters , if not particularly good at screenwriting . <p> My advice to you , Dave , is contrary to what I 'd tell most writers . Do n't  write about what you know , since that seems to be limited to whiny self-obsession . Instead , write like the kind of writer you wish you were : bold , courageous , unafraid to piss people off . Think Hemmingway , but with marketable good-looks.

@@42311900 @2311900/ <p> First off , this is not a film review . If it were , I 'd write about the performances , production design , music and all all the other factors that make or break a movie . Also , I 've met the director and co-screenwriter , Joel Schumacher , who is every bit as nice as his reputation . So I do n't  want it to be weird next time I say hello to him at some event . Rather , I just want to point out some story issues that stuck out to me things I 'd want to tackle if I 'd gotten the script before it went into production . <p> I saw Phantom of the Opera last night . This was my first exposure to it I never saw the stage musical , nor read the book . I can say I 'm glad I saw it . There were things that really worked , and things that did n't  . What was interesting , and frustrating , is that a lot of the films biggest issues were on the page . <p> Be advised that everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phantom is essentially a love triangle . You have Christine , the gifted chorus girl . Raoul , the unaccountably hot viscount . And The Phantom , a deformed genius who lurks around the Paris opera house where the story is set . <p> Christine is an orphan , natch , who was raised by Madame Giry in the opera dormitory . Before he died , Christines father promised an Angel of Music would watch over her . And in fact , that 's what the Phantom has been doing . He s the voice in the darkness who 's been giving her singing lessons . So far , it feels like Beauty and the Beast . <p> here 's where the movie gets into some very un-Disney territory . The Phantom has been essentially a surrogate father to this girl , and in fact pretends to be the spirit of her father at times and yet he wants to marry her and , well , ravage her . Do n't  get me wrong : I love that its kind of sick and twisted . But the movie never really does anything with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or points out that Madame Giry has essentially been pimping out Christine to an evil lech who lives in the sewers . <p> I can understand the urge to downplay the Lustful Father angle it makes the Phantom less sympathetic . But by letting it dangle there , you leave the audience frustrated that no one on-screen is acknowledging just how creepy it is that the Phantom wants to bone his pupil . <p> Half-Developed Idea #2 is the darkness in Christines soul . In " Music of the Night , " the Phantom presents his case for living in the shadows , and how shell be living there with him . Christine becomes less innocent girl and more slutty vixen during this and a few other moments : you see it in her performance , and her eye make-up ( I swear ) . <p> This is quite a good idea , to look at how the sweet and chaste virgin maybe does n't  want to be sweet and chaste , but Christines never given anything to say , or sing , that let 's the audience get inside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the sunny life theyll lead together , but we do n't  know if she 's conflicted or not . <p> In fact , Christine never really has to choose between her suitors . Whenever she 's with the Phantom , she 's a captive . <p> Obviously , these are pretty significant things to address , and are probably evident to some degree in all versions of the story , on stage and screen . But there were also some smaller things that clunked in this version which would n't have been difficult to address : <p> A. Time Lapses <p> Its really unclear how long Christine stays underground with the Phantom when she first visits his lair . It feels like only one night , but when we meet up with the opera managers , enough time has passed for them to open an entirely different show and woo back their former diva . <p> Likewise , there 's a three-month gap between the rooftop number and the masquerade ball . The Phantom has evidently been writing his Don Juan opera during this hiatus , and Christine has become secretly engaged to Raoul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we learn that things have been inexplicably peachy for the past 90 days . <p> B. Convenient exposition <p> Yes , sometimes a character has to explain something just so the audience knows it . Thats exposition , and as a writer , you do everything you can to make it feel natural . Christine is saddled with an impossible burden when she has to quickly explain how she knows Raoul in the opening scene . Shes given two or three lines to spurt out to a friend we 've never met . <p> Later in the story , Madame Giry explains to Raoul how the Phantom came to reside at the opera house . The story itself is interesting , and does a lot to explain various characters motivations . The timing , unfortunately , feels forced . Madame Giry has spent twenty years hiding this secret , but shell gladly tell a near-stranger who asks . ( One can imagine a better version in which Madame Giry tries to reason with the Phantom to back off , and that becomes the impetus for the flashback . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Near the end of the second act , Raoul defeats the Phantom in a graveyard sword fight , but spares his life at Christines pleading . Fine . Its a movie . But instead of , say , tying him up , the happy couple simply rides off on their white horse . <p> Yet in the very next scene , Raoul plots with the opera house managers to trap the Phantom . The very same Phantom he could have caught , say , thirty seconds ago . Grrr . What 's worse , Raouls ingenious plan to trap him is to stage the Phantoms Don Juan opera , with Christine in the lead role . That 's like trying to catch an arsonist by dousing your house with gasoline . <p> Sigh . <p> There are certainly other nits one could pick . Horseback rides ? Romantic . Underground horseback rides that go twenty feet , before climbing off to board a gondola ? Less romantic . But a fair amount of this stuff just comes with the territory . If you believe a guy with a mask and cape can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dismal splendor beneath it , you have to take the short horse rides that come with it . <p> Again , this is n't meant to be a proper review of the movie , which had many good points Ive neglected to mention .

@@42311910 @2311910/ <p> Reader and fellow screenwriter-blogger David Anaxagoras is taking a class from the estimable Mike Werb , who recently brought in David Lubliner and Ken Friemann of the William Morris Agency to talk about agents , managers , and the business of representation . <p> Mr. Anaxagoras was generous enough to share his notes from class . Since " How Do I Get an Agent " is my number-one most avoided question to answer on this site , I thought I 'd take this chance to comment upon some generally excellent advice : <p> Ken stressed that you should get as many pair of eyes to look at your script as you can , and that the eyes you want are in LA so move out to LA . Search out managers , lawyers , assistants , creative execs , young directors anyone who might have a connection and can pass your script along . <p> Two good points rolled into one . First , never be afraid of showing your work . Put it in the hands of everyone you meet , no matter what their job in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you at the moment , one day they will be . Or theyll know somebody who knows somebody . <p> Second , move to L.A. Yes , technically its possible to become a working screenwriter while living in Boise , but it is n't likely . L.A. is film what Nashville is to country-western music . You just cant avoid that . <p> Often , a good script will not sell . That 's the norm . New writers will get meetings off their script , and should look at it as an opportunity to open doors and build relationships . <p> I 'd amend that to say " most good scripts will not sell . " Do n't  look at screenwriting as a lottery ticket . You 're trying to build a career that will last decades . Building relationships with people who love your writing is much more important than a six-figure sale . <p> New screenwriters should expect to sign up with junior agents . In fact , Ken says it is imperative to sign up with a junior agent . Find someone who is passionate about you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your career and thus their own . An established agent with high-powered clients has little at stake in your ultimate success or failure . Find someone you can grow with . <p> Yes . You want to grow up with an agent . An agent in his mid-40s with top-tier clients is n't going to hustle for you the same way a junior agent in her early 20s will . More importantly , that agent wont be having drinks with all the junior execs around town the guys who ought a be reading your script . <p> Writers are often asked " what else do you have " in meetings . Ken recommends writers stick to the same genre or something similar until they are established . Its just too much for Hollywood people to wrap their head around a romantic comedy , a period drama , and a horror pitch all in a short space of time . Remain relatable and help the agent to help you . Earn the right to write different . <p> Do n't  worry about being pigeon-holed until you actually have a career . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got sent a lot of other kids books . It was annoying . But I was working , which is a lot . <p> Ken let us know that a screenplay has a short window of opportunity once it goes out , and that if it does n't  sell , writers need to learn to let go and move on . They ca n't live off the hope of that one script forever . Instead , they need to keep producing new material . Keep writing do n't  sit around and wait for the sale or the next assignment . <p> Amen . This is very hard advice to take , because you 've no doubt poured your heart and soul into those 120 unsold pages . Hopefully , you 'll get great meetings off that script . But do n't  expect that one day someone will say , " Hey , we should really buy this old script that 's been sitting on the shelf . " From experience , I can tell you that it does n't  happen . 
@@42311911 @2311911/ <p> In film production , As and Bs are used to squeeze extra scenes or pages between two pre-existing numbers . Otherwise , you would have to renumber and redistribute all of the relevant scenes or pages , which would be confusing for everyone , and mean a lot more photocopying . <p> If you need to insert a page between 95 and 96 , the new page is labeled 95A . If you need to insert three pages , they would be labeled 95A , 95B and 95C . The tricky part comes when you need to insert a second round of new pages , for instance , two new pages between 95 and 95A . Technically , the new sequence would go 95 , 95AA , 95AB , 95A , 95B . In practice , however , this gets too confusing for everyone . In my opinion , you 're better off just generating new pages to replace the current 95A and 95B , which means the sequence would run 95 , 95A , 95B , 95C , 95D . <p> As a kindness to the production team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any production revisions , listing which pages have changed , and clarifying page order in case there 's any possible confusion . <p> I learned to do scene numbers the same way as page numbers , so scene 47A would come between scenes 47 and 48 . Katterli Frauenfelder , the 1st AD on Big Fish and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , prefers to do it differently : 47 , A48 , 48 . I chafed at first , but it makes sense . <p> During production , each new camera setup is given a sequential letter . For instance , the master shot might be labeled Sc . 47 , while the first closeup is labeled Sc . 47A . Subsequent angles become 47B , 47C , etc . If the scene itself were numbered 47A , this would obviously get confusing . But Sc . A47A is unambiguous . <p> In my experience , Final Draft does a pretty good job handling both scene and page revisions , but do n't  let it make the decisions for you . By thinking ahead , you can almost always simplify the process and keep your screenplay more reader-friendly.

@@42311915 @2311915/ <p> One of my most frequent pieces of advice to would-be writer/directors is to make a short film . After all , with the wonders of digital technology , any monkey with a good idea and a long weekend should be able come up with something watchable . Right ? <p> The next step is getting someone to see your miniature masterpiece . That 's where my knowledge comes up a little lacking . Fortunately , my assistant Chad Creasey has just been through the process . He and director Dara Resnik recently made a charming short film called " Great Lengths . " You can read all about it at their website . <p> Pretty much every weekend this spring , either he or Dara were flying to some festival across the country . With this in mind , I asked Chad to write up advice about short films and festivals . He was gracious enough to reply at , well , great length : <p> Take it , Chad : <p> You did it ! Maybe you had to destroy your great aunts guest cottage and illegally tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generator . Maybe you had to bribe the local sheriff to NOT make his 3:00am rounds in order to get that awesome explosion shot . And maybe you subjected your body to experimentation to cover the cost of the final audio layback . But dammit you are now the proud owner of a completed short film ! <p> So what do you do with it ? <p> Chances are , you want people to see it . Although the internet offers venues like IFILM with which to showcase your work , nothing beats the rush of the live audience screening . You can always rent a screen at the local multiplex ( costly ) , but most filmmakers prefer to show their work at a variety of film festivals . <p> The festival circuit <p> The past five years have seen a tremendous surge in the number of festivals . It seems like every city from Ashland , Oregon to Dubrovnik , Croatia has one now . What 's fantastic is you have literally thousands of places to submit to but the overall quality of these festivals varies greatly . Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A-list celebrities , and others that made me buy tickets to my own screening . <p> After going through it , I have a couple of recommendations . ( 1 ) Use a registration service <p> While applying to festivals used to mean filling out application after lengthy application , the amateur filmmaker has found a new ally in Withoutabox . This website is a great tool . Basically , it partners up with over a thousand festivals to simplify the application process . <p> For around $75 a year , you can input all your film specs to a custom account . ( For a few dollars more , you also even add trailers , more pictures , and an online press kit ) . With a few mouse clicks , you then apply to any of their partner festivals and they will send out all the necessary information . All you need to do is mail each festival a receipt , along with the hardcopy of your film . You can even pay the application fee through the website . <p> What 's even better , since the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they usually offer a discount ( $5-10 ) on applications received through Withoutabox . You 'll cover the sign-up fee in no time . <p> ( 2 ) Know thy film and choose your festivals wisely . <p> Everyone wants to be accepted to Sundance , Cannes , Tribeca or perhaps Slamdance . These and others make up the " biggies " and they receive thousands of submissions each year . <p> Even if you have a brilliant short , the odds are not in your favor . Festivals have programming needs ( which often change year to year ) and they have to fill a specific slate . <p> Some festivals simply wo n't accept shorts over 30-minutes long . Some wont accept films with gratuitous language , sex or violence , while others ( horror-themed fests ) thrive on that kind of product . A lot of times , however , you have little to no idea what festival programmers are looking for . Great Lengths , the short I wrote and co-produced in grad school , is a teen comedy that ended up being screened with similar films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You 'll see this at many festivals where programmers discover they have several quality ( or decent enough ) submissions that can be packaged together under a catchy name . <p> ( 3 ) Know your goals and choose festivals accordingly . <p> Do you simply want the live audience experience ? Then apply to local festivals within a few hundred miles of where you live so you can easily make the drive . Is your short a calling card to try and land you a Hollywood agent ? Then apply to festivals in and around the Los Angeles area because ( except for Sundance and the biggies ) agents and managers do n't  have time to attend screenings halfway across the country . <p> ( 4 ) Know your budget . <p> Even with the Withoutabox discount , it costs ( on average ) $30-$50 to apply to each festival . Toss in $3.85 to mail your submission , another $100 shipping fee ( if you shot on film ) , and untold hundreds of dollars for airfare and hotel ( if you 're actually accepted ) and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds for a year can easily put you in the hole , so unless you really think you have a good shot at Sundance , why not save the fifty bucks and apply to two other local festivals instead ? <p> ( 5 ) Finally , know that its not you . <p> Your film will be pre-screened by two , maybe three people who will then toss your baby into the " consider " or " reject " pile . Assuming your film is at least worthy of consideration , who knows what goes through these screeners minds when they watch your film ? <p> Maybe your film is a romantic comedy and Screener #1 was dumped the night before and is bitter . Maybe Screener #2 had a double-bacon cheeseburger at lunch and is distracted by his acid reflux . Great Lengths was rejected by two tiny , Podunk festivals that I thought we were shoo-ins for . But then we went on to be selected for the 2004 Tribeca Film Festival . What made us right for one and wrong for the other ? Nothing , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film festival gods will sometimes shower you with sun , but more often than not , it will be with rain .

Why not just put down the full purchase price at the start ? <p> Because its a risk . Lots of things can and will go wrong in the process of trying to make a movie , and the less a producer has to put down up front , the safer it is .

In most cases , you 're better served by having a d.p. you trust . <p> We all see the world in 3-D . The difference between really being witness to an event vs. seeing it as a stereo image is that when you 're really there , your eye can adjust its convergence as it roves over subjects at different distancesIn a filmed image , the convergence was baked in at the moment of photography , so you cant adjust it . <p> In order to cut naturally and rapidly from one subject to another , its necessary for the filmmaker ( actually his/her camera team ) to put the convergence at the place in the shot where the audience is most likely to look . This sounds complicated but in fact we do it all the time , in every shot , and have since the beginning of cinema . Its called focus . We focus where we think people are most likely to look . <p> Cameron is slaving convergence to focus , even pulling it as necessary throughout a scene . This makes sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new cameras allow complete control over the stereospace . You should think of interocular like volume . You can turn the 3-D up or down , and do it smoothly on the fly during a shot . So if you know you 're in a scene which will require very fast cuts , you turn the stereo down ( reduce the interocular distance ) and you can cut fast and smoothly . The point here is that just because you 're making a stereo movie does n't  mean that stereo is the most important thing in every shot or sequence . If you choose to do rapid cutting , then the motion of the subject from shot to shot to shot is more important than the perception of stereospace at that moment in the film . So sacrifice the stereospace and enjoy the fast cutting . <p> In front of U2:3D , there was a 3-D trailer for Journey to the Center of The Earth 3D , which I 'm sad to say looked like ass . Actually , it kind of looked like nothing , because it was blurry in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to process it . <p> I think this is exactly what Cameron is talking about . The 3-D shots in the Journey 3D trailer were probably composed for the movie , where they play much longer . But cut into a conventional trailer , it just did n't  work . ( link ) <p> You do n't  need to be in 3-D at every step of the way . And as long as your work will be viewed in 2-D as well as 3-D , whether in a hybrid theatrical release or later on DVD , it is probably healthy to do a lot of the work in 2-D along the way . I cut on a normal Avid , and only when the scene is fine-cut do we output left and right eye video tracks to the server in the screening room and check the cut for stereo . Nine times out of 10 we do n't  change anything for 3-D . <p> I spoke with a writer-director during the strike who had the opposite experience . To get the cutting to work right in 3-D , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version . " And that 's a not newbie predilection for Zodiac , David Fincher cut in HD with a giant screen . <p> No matter how advanced the technology gets , while you 're in the editing room , you 're still working with a rough approximation of what the final film will look and sound like . Just as with color timing , music and FX , anticipating the depth effect is something you 'll need to remember and forget while cutting . <p> For three-fourths of a century of 2-D cinema , we have grown accustomed to the strobing effect produced by the 24 frame per second display rate . When we see the same thing in 3-D , it stands out more , not because it is intrinsically worse , but because all other things have gotten better . Suddenly the image looks so real its like you 're standing there in the room with the characters , but when the camera pans , there is this strange motion artifact . Its like you never saw it before , when in fact its been hiding in plain sight the whole time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . They have been so focused on resolution , and counting pixels and lines , that they have forgotten about frame rate . Perceived resolution = pixels x replacement rate . A 2K image at 48 frames per second looks as sharp as a 4K image at 24 frames per second with one fundamental difference : the 4K/24 image will judder miserably during a panning shot , and the 2K/48 wont . Higher pixel counts only preserve motion artifacts like strobing with greater fidelity . They do n't  solve them at all . <p> An example of why James Cameron is the Steve Jobs of filmmakers : he understands that what matters is the user experience , not the hard numbers . He also sees how important it is to control the entire process , from shooting through exhibition . The best camera technology is worthless if you cant get the results you want in a theater . <p> The good news is that the next generation of moviegoers seems ready to forget that 24fps is how movies are " supposed to " look . And changes within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switchover from our current , analog system . <p> I know it seems like I 've quoted a lot here , but the interview is long , and there 's a lot more in it about other aspects of the technology which will be interesting to anyone geeky enough to click through .

So let me do that . Congratulations , you 're done ! Now , go out and do your best work in the years ahead ! <p> Now that that 's done , I want to talk for a few minutes about what the hell you 've gotten yourself into . I mean , a film degree . Now ? In this economy ? A lot of you have friends and family in the audience , and I know they 're really happy for you . But secretly , they 're thinking , Jesus . <p> So what I 'm going to say is as much for them as it is for you . <p> We call this " film school , " but really , that 's only for lack of a better term . You do n't  really shoot much film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely touch it . Rather , what you do in a school like this is learn how to tell stories with words , pictures and sound . <p> And quite luckily , that 's what the world needs . Two examples . <p> A friend of mine writes for a major newspaper . And when she was done covering the presidential election , her bosses handed her a videocamera and told her that every piece she delivered now had to include a video component for the website . She needed to be able to shoot it , edit it and deliver it . <p> Another friend writes for a major magazine . In addition to her story assignments , she 's now required to come up with web features , like little Flash slideshows that can be easily monetized . She also finds herself suddenly on-camera , hosting arrivals at movie premieres , and dealing with all the requisite technical stuff . <p> There 's not a word for the kind of school that teaches you how to do all this . But the word that 's missing is probably a lot like film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a specialist , a cardiothoracic surgeon , but rather to be a generalist , a media MacGuyver . <p> You may think you 're going to be a screenwriter , a director or an editor , but the odds are you 'll be all of those things on different projects at different times . <p> The one thing you wont be is an amateur . I want you to banish that word , because you need to treat everything you do from the moment you walk out the door as a professional . This is now your job . <p> That means doing your best work at all times , even when it does n't  seem to matter . You may feel like you 're not getting graded . You are . Its just that no one is telling you what score you got . <p> And let 's talk about your classmates . You probably have some good friends and some people you kind of hope to never see again . While you were in the program here , you had to rely on them . Your professors put you in teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't  stop . No one makes a movie by himself . So if by next weekend , you 're not reading one of their scripts , or helping on something they 're shooting , somethings wrong . Trust me that five years from now , the most successful person in this class will be the one who worked the hardest for other people . <p> My last piece of advice is probably the one most likely to induce insomnia . Every night when you go to bed , ask yourself : What did you do today to get closer to your goals ? That 's a hard question to ask . Feel free to beat yourself up , because no one else will anymore . That 's the best and worst thing about graduating its the end of the systematic evaluation of your progress . <p> You need to stop wondering what you 're going to do , and focus on what you 're going to do next .

@@42311924 @2311924/ <p> I 'm in the planning stages of my next project , which is honestly my favorite part of the writing process . There 's no emotional cost to killing unwritten scenes , no niggling logic flaws , no exhaustion at page 72 . <p> Plotting a movie is mostly figuring out who the characters are , and what obstacles theyll face . In film school , we were taught to look at character motivation as the combination of two questions:1 <p> What does the character want ? <p> What does the character need ? <p> The implication is that your characters should be able to articulate what they want ( true love , the championship , revenge ) at or near the start of the movie , but remain clueless to what they truly need ( self-respect , forgiveness , literacy ) until quite late in the story . <p> Like most screenwriting hackery , this want-vs-need concept works just often enough to seem useful . You can trot out the familiar examples . Every character in The Wizard of Oz can be addressed this way ( the Scarecrow wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ) . Ditto for The Sound of Music , though it gets a bit vague amid the younger Von Trapps . <p> Of my films , Big Fish and Charlie and Chocolate Factory come closest to fitting this template , though it requires a bit of hammering to get there . In Big Fish , Will Bloom begins the movie wanting to find the truth in his fathers tales , but he ultimately needs to accept that his father is contained within these tales . In Charlie , Willy Wonka wants an heir , but needs a family.2 <p> Bolstered by these two examples , I spent a few hours this week looking at the characters in my project through the want-vs-need lens , before finally concluding it is complete and utter bullshit . Trying to distinguish between characters wants and needs is generally frustrating and almost universally pointless . The fact that I can answer the question for Big Fish and Charlie after the fact does n't  make it a meaningful planning tool . <p> I 've written about character motivation a fewtimes , but had n't  thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be simplified down to a single question : <p> Why is the character doing what he s doing ? <p> Heres what I like about this definition : <p> It scales well . You can ask this question about a character in a specific scene ( " Why is he trying to get in the bank vault ? " ) or the entire movie ( " Why is he racing in the Iditarod ? " ) <p> It implies visible action . Characters in movies need to do something . That sounds obvious , but you 'd be surprised how many scripts slather motivation on like spackle to fill the holes . ( " He has OCD because his father abandoned him . " Umm , okay , so why is he robbing a bank ? ) <p> It can be both concrete and psychological . In Go , why is Ronna trying to make the drug deal with Todd Gaines ? ( A ) Because she 's about to be evicted . ( B ) To prove to her friends ( and herself ) that she can . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of my concerns with the project Im writing slipped away . The problem was n't character motivation , but how I was looking for it . <p> That said , you need to be careful not to stop at the first easy answer : Why is he racing in the Iditarod ? " To win the prize money . " The better answer will likely lead to a better story . Why is he racing in the Iditarod ? " To beat his ex-wife , the five-time champion . " " To catch the man who killed his brother . " " Because the ghost of his childhood dog is haunting him . " <p> For the record , I 'm not writing Snow Dogs 4 . <p> My recollection is that these ideas are featured in Syd Field , but I 'm not inclined to look it up , for fear of sparking of an enraged tangent about how damaging I think most screenwriting books are . ? <p> Charlie Bucket *wants* a Golden Ticket , but *needs*well , Charlie does n't  really need anything , which is another argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonist . ?

Do you think a screenwriter has to take big money projects whenever they come along , just to survive in the business ? <p> L.M. Dix <p> First off , no one is going to offer me a lot of money to write a sequel to GO , because barring a bizarre change of circumstances , there will never be a sequel . While the movie was moderately successful given its small budget , it was never the kind of breakout hit that merits a roman numeral after the title . <p> Which is kind of a shame , because I had a sequel plotted out in my head while we were still in production on the first one .

But alas no . <p> As for your second question , no . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive , any more than an actor has to take multi-million dollar roles . Its all about the choices you make for your career and your quality of life . <p> Screenwriters can work three ways . The first is when you write " on spec .

While that does n't  make for much economic stability , you have complete artistic freedom , because you answer only to yourself . GO was written on spec . <p> The second way a writer can work is " on assignment . " That 's where a producer or a studio pays you a certain amount of money to write a script , generally based upon a property they own , be it another script , a novel or a TV series . CHARLIES ANGELS was written on assignment . <p> The third way for a writer to work is " on weekly . " Usually , this only occurs when a movie is coming close to production , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer is paid every week , rather than every draft , and is working mostly as a craftsman , fixing problems rather than reshaping the story .

I worked on weekly for MINORITY REPORT . <p> To make a broad generalization , prominent screenwriters can make more more working on weekly than on assignment or on spec . That 's because if a movie is close enough to production to merit a writer working week-by-week , the studio is often willing to pay a higher rate . <p> But working on a weekly basis is exhausting and ultimately a little unfulfilling , because you do n't  have a strong relationship with any of the scripts you work on .

We want to see bad things happen to terrible children . <p> Cocoa is a synonym for hot chocolate , so it seems reasonable that youd make chocolate from cocoa beans . For the movie version , changing " cacao " to " cocoa " made it easier to focus on the point of the scene ( a flashback to Wonka meeting the Oompa-Loompas ) , and concentrate on finding things that were actually funny .

If you 're making a thriller set in the world of international espionage , you cant have the computer expert " dial in " to something .

For a medical drama , we 've come to accept a certain amount of time compression , allowing characters to recover from surgery in much less time than they actually would . But if a character became pregnant and gave birth in the same day , we 'd protest .

That is , they can put the fish under the broiler , then go off and work on something else , and return at exactly the moment the fish is perfectly cooked . <p> This " knowing when its done " sense only develops with experience . Beginning chefs are all too likely to pull something out a little too raw or overcooked and flavorless . <p> And the same is true with screenwriting . When I was first starting out , I was really unsure about when a draft was finished . I now have a pretty good sense of when something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the first draft . That is , I 've generally hand-written scenes , typed them up , assembled them into one big draft ( called , cleverly , the " first assembly " ) .

( " Did you mean for the hero to leave in a helicopter but land in a private jet ? " ) A few quick fixes , and its ready to be seen by whoever the point person is on the project , generally the producer or executive who hired me . <p> Should you , Daniel , hand in a draft this early ? Probably not . I 'm a better writer now than when I first began , and do n't  make the same mistakes I used to . To continue the cooking analogy , one way to make sure something is done is to check the temperature . Use your trusted friends and colleagues as your thermometer .

It depends on the script and the market , and even then you 'll get conflicting answers . <p> By targeting a few select producers , you hopefully put the script in the hands of the people who are most likely to ( a ) love it and ( b ) get it set up at a given studio . For a script that deals with challenging subject material , or which lacks obvious commercial appeal , this might be a smart move . <p> For instance , say you 've written a sophisticated romantic comedy with leads in their 60s , maybe a blue-collar version of Somethings Got ta Give .

Target them first , so that they can take it to the studio with themselves attached . <p> On the other hand , if a script is just flat-out commercial , you can sometimes sell it for a lot of money by going to all ( or most ) of the studios at once . That was the case with The Island , a thriller that 's now in production . <p> The downside of going wide is that if your script does n't  receive a great reception , its over pretty quickly .
