This report presents an analysis of the data from 13 consecutive census administrations on the long-run path of racial segregation across American cities . This report extends our previous work on segregation , by incorporating information from the 2010 census , made available to the public in early 2011 ( Cutler , Glaeser , and Vigdor , 1999 ; and Glaeser and Vigdor , 2003 ) .

The remaining neighborhoods are mostly in remote rural areas or in cities with very little black population . <p> Gentrification and immigration have made a dent in segregation . While these phenomena are clearly important in some areas , the rise of black suburbanization explains much more of the decline in segregation . <p> Ghetto neighborhoods persist , but most are in decline . For every diversifying ghetto neighborhood , many more house a dwindling population of black residents . <p> At its mid-century peak , segregation reflected the operation of both government and market forces . Beginning in the 1930s , federal regulations disfavored the extension of mortgage credit to homeowners in mixed-race neighborhoods . Restrictive covenants prohibited integration in some areas ( until the Supreme Court ruled them unenforceable in 1948 ) .

The OSP is a federally sponsored school voucher program that provides vouchers worth up to $7,500 for an estimated 1,800 to 2,000 students in the District of Columbia . Students can use the scholarships to pay tuition at participating private schools in the District . The pilot program is designed to last for five years . <p> The authors measure whether a public school 's test-score gains are related to its distance to the nearest voucher-accepting private school or the number of voucher schools within a one-mile radius of a public school .

This proposal is flawed . Affordability is not the main obstacle to getting a degree . There is also a risk that a tuition-free system for public institutions would leave them solely dependent on taxpayer dollars . If public budgets fail to keep pace with the increased demand and rising costs , colleges will be forced to limit the number of students they can accept , or sacrifice the quality of instruction , or both . Heightened competition for spaces could crowd out lower-income students from higher-quality public institutions . <h> Key Findings <p> International comparisons render as dubious the assumption that free tuition in the U.S. would lead to higher numbers of college graduates . Within the G-7 , the four countries that charge college tuition have higher education attainment rates ( Japan , 59% ; Canada , 58% ; United Kingdom , 48% ; United States , 46% ) than those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Italy , 24% ) . <p> Low tuition price caps forced colleges in England to ration the available spaces . When the caps were lifted , institutions raised tuition fees by 87% between 2006 and 2012 " yet college enrollment grew by 20% , and applicants from the most disadvantaged backgrounds grew by 53% . By contrast , when Scotland eliminated tuition fees in 2007 , low-income enrollment rates grew only one-tenth as quickly as in England . <p> In the U.S. federal grants already make tuition free , on average , for low-income students at community colleges . Yet just one-third of students from the bottom quartile of the income distribution who started at a community college in 2003 had finished a degree or certificate by 2009.

More than two thirds of us live on the 3 percent of land that contains our cities . Yet cities get a bad rap : they 're dirty , poor , unhealthy , crime ridden , expensive , environmentally unfriendly . . . . Or are they ? <p> As Edward Glaeser proves in this myth-shattering book , cities are actually the healthiest , greenest , and richest ( in cultural and economic terms ) places to live . New Yorkers , for instance , live longer than other Americans . More than half of America 's income is earned in twenty-two metropolitan areas . And city dwellers use , on average , 40 percent less energy than suburbanites . <p> Glaeser travels through history and around the globe to reveal the hidden workings of cities and how they bring out the best in humankind .

Glaeser visits Bangalore and Silicon Valley , whose strangely similar histories prove how essential education is to urban success and how new technology actually encourages people to gather together physically . He discovers why Detroit is dying while other old industrial cities " Chicago , Boston , New York " thrive .

He explains how West Coast environmentalists have harmed the environment and how struggling cities from Youngstown to New Orleans can " shrink to greatness .

Hymowitz is the author of " Ready or Not : Why Treating Children as Small Adults Endangers Their Future and Ours . " This is adapted from her article in the spring issue of City Journal . <p> The recent arrest of two 8-year-old Irvington , N.J. , boys accused of making " terroristic threats " for pointing paper guns at their classmates have led many people to add " zero tolerance " to the list of things that the schools ca n't get right . A wave of these kinds of suspensions and arrests seems all the clumsier since , as experts are quick to remind us , the numbers show that school violence is on the wane . <p> Yet while events during the past month since 15-year-old Charles " Andy " Williams killed two classmates and wounded 13 other people in a shooting spree at Santana High School in Santee , Calif. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , " they do suggest that the decline in school violence may have more to do with students being quicker to report suspicious classmates and authorities taking those reports seriously than any lack of budding Klebolds and Harrises , the Columbine High School killers . In Santana 's aftermath , a raft of students in communities ranging from New Canaan , Conn. , to inner -city Houston threatened to follow Williams . <p> Sure , some of these kids , like the New Jersey boys , were harmless playground jokesters and braggarts . But it 's not so easy to distinguish the prankster from the wild-eyed adolescent with a plan when lives are at stake . <p> Last week in a San Antonio high school , two vice principals received e-mails saying , " Watch the Sniper . You 'll never know when we 'll get you . We 're coming behind you . You 'll never know when the bullet hits . " The 18-year-old accused of sending the e-mails insisted they were a " joke . " Should authorities believe him ? The day before Andy Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only joking about pulling a Columbine . <p> In a staggering number of cases over this month , students appear to have been deadly serious . Right after the Santana shooting , at Twentynine Palms , Calif. -where Andy Williams lived until moving to Santee six months before the shooting-police nabbed two high school kids with a .22-caliber rifle and a hit list . And in El Cajon , Calif. , just seven miles from Santee , an 18-year-old loner known as " the Rock " for his intimidating physique nearly succeeded in killing some of his classmates , opening fire with a shotgun in his high school , wounding three students and two teachers before police stopped him . <p> And the mayhem has continued . In the last few weeks , threats disrupted schools in Charlotte , Cincinnati , Newport News , Providence , Milwaukee , Minneapolis , Louisville , several California counties and Omaha . Bomb threats closed schools in Westfield Township , Ohio , and close to home in Nyack in Rockland County , and Greenburgh , Harrison and Armonk in Westchester . On Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month when a combination of fights , false fire alarms and bomb threats had rocked the town 's junior-senior high school . <p> Administrators can not comfort themselves by chalking these post-Santana incidents up to copy-cat behavior . There were five near-misses in the six weeks before Santana , none of which received national press coverage at the time . In those cases , the potential for carnage was huge : Police discovered guns , bombs , hit lists and school floor plans in the homes of the student suspects in Elmira , N.Y. ; Palm Harbor , Fla. ; Fort Collins , Col. ; Hoyt , Kansas ; and Cupertino , Calif . <p> From the point of view of teachers , administrators are hardly the zealous disciplinarians that some reports suggest . One study from the Texas Public Policy Foundation showed that nearly two-thirds of Texas public school teachers thought that teacher morale was worsening in their schools , and 40 percent of them cited " student attitudes and behavior " and administrative failure to address them as the principal reasons . " There are no serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teachers by students , " one teacher lamented . " The students run our school , " another wrote . In Boston , after a rash of attacks on teachers this year , the teachers ' union did a survey showing that 58 percent of high school teachers and 40 percent of middle school teachers were dissatisfied with administrators ' efforts to control school discipline . <p> And the problem is likely to get worse . The Connecticut Department of Education released a summary of disciplinary offenses in its public schools that included 2,000 or so first-graders , kindergartners and even preschoolers . <p> More zero-tolerance policies run amok ? It does n't seem like it . Jeanne Milstein , child advocate for the State of Connecticut , says that her office had received many reports about " out of control " tots hitting , biting and throwing things in inner-city and suburban schools . Though there 's little solid data , Kristie Kauerz , an official at the Education Commission of the States , claims that there 's enough anecdotal evidence to conclude that a growing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , zero tolerance may be more symptom than cure for the uneasy disciplinary climate of our schools .

Wriston Lecture and are honored that she chose the occasion to make this significant speech on national security policy at this important time in national affairs . <h> Event Transcript <p> I am honored to deliver this year 's Wriston Lecture . And happy to be in New York . It is important for government officials to venture beyond Washington , to get out , talk to " and listen to " Americans from every corner of our vast , great country . The President said it best when talking about the National Security Strategy that he sent to Congress ten days ago . He was very clear that he wanted the document written in plain English , not academic jargon . He said , " This is the ... Security Strategy of the entire United States . The boys in Lubbock ought to be able to read it . " Manhattan is not Lubbock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight to speak plainly about some of the great issues facing our country . <p> Wriston Lecturers are an eclectic group , but this is the first time you 've ever had a National Security Advisor , and it may seem like an odd fit . The Manhattan Institute 's expertise is not foreign policy , but domestic policy , with a special emphasis on America 's great cities . Yet there is a crucial intersection between what you do and what I do . <p> Foreign policy is ultimately about security " about defending our people , our society , and our values , such as freedom , tolerance , openness , and diversity . No place evokes these values better than our cities . Here in New York , about a third of the population was born abroad . Across the street from here is St. Bartholomew 's , a Protestant church . Go three blocks to the east from here and there 's the Sutton Place Synagogue . Go a couple of blocks to the west , and you 'll come to St. Patrick 's Cathedral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindu temple . Go uptown a few blocks from where we are and you will come to the Manhattan Won Buddhist Temple on East 57th . Keep going north and you will run into the Islamic Cultural Center on East 96th . <p> Go further up and into the Bronx and you will come to a neighborhood that used to be called " Banana Kelly " because it was a mix of immigrants from the Caribbean and Ireland . And there , a Jamaican-American family raised the boy who became the man who is now our Secretary of State . <p> These facts stand as living rebukes to the extremism of our enemies , and the mindset that prevails in too many parts of the world that difference is a reason to hate and a license to kill . America is proof that pluralism and tolerance are the foundations of true national greatness . And today " 385 days after September 11 , 2001 " it is clear that our commitment to our ideals is stronger than ever . <p> The fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition period . During that period those of us who think about foreign policy for a living searched for an overarching , explanatory theory or framework that would describe the new threats and the proper response to them . Some said that nations and their militaries were no longer relevant , only global markets knitted together by new technologies . Others foresaw a future dominated by ethnic conflict . And some even thought that in the future the primary energies of America 's Armed Forces would be devoted to managing civil conflict and humanitarian assistance . <p> It will take years to understand the long-term effects of September 11th . But there are certain verities that the tragedy brought home to us in the most vivid way . <p> Perhaps most fundamentally , 9/11 crystallized our vulnerability . It also threw into sharp relief the nature of the threats we face today . Today 's threats come less from massing armies than from small , shadowy bands of terrorists " less from strong states than from weak or failed states . And after 9/11 , there is no longer any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security " a threat as great as any we faced during the Civil War , the so-called " Good War " , or the Cold War . <p> President Bush 's new National Security Strategy offers a bold vision for protecting our Nation that captures today 's new realities and new opportunities . <p> It calls on America to use our position of unparalleled strength and influence to create a balance of power that favors freedom . As the President says in the cover letter : we seek to create the " conditions in which all nations and all societies can chose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty . " <p> This strategy has three pillars : <p> We will defend the peace by opposing and preventing violence by terrorists and outlaw regimes . <p> We will preserve the peace by fostering an era of good relations among the world 's great powers . <p> And we will extend the peace by seeking to extend the benefits of freedom and prosperity across the globe . <p> Defending our Nation from its enemies is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's most powerful nation , the United States has a special responsibility to help make the world more secure . <p> In fighting global terror , we will work with coalition partners on every continent , using every tool in our arsenal " from diplomacy and better defenses to law enforcement , intelligence , cutting off terrorist financing , and , if needed , military power . <p> We will break up terror networks , hold to account nations that harbor terrorists , and confront aggressive tyrants holding or seeking nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons that might be passed to terrorist allies . These are different faces of the same evil . Terrorists need a place to plot , train , and organize . Tyrants allied with terrorists can greatly extend the reach of their deadly mischief . Terrorists allied with tyrants can acquire technologies allowing them to murder on an ever more massive scale . Each threat magnifies the danger of the other . And the only path to safety is to effectively confront both terrorists and tyrants . <p> For these reasons , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has defied the just demands of the world for over a decade . We are on notice . The danger from Saddam Hussein 's arsenal is far more clear than anything we could have foreseen prior to September 11th . And history will judge harshly any leader or nation that saw this dark cloud and sat by in complacency or indecision . <p> The Iraqi regime 's violation of every condition set forth by the UN Security Council for the 1991 cease-fire fully justifies " legally and morally " the enforcement of those conditions . <p> It is also true that since 9/11 , our Nation is properly focused as never before on preventing attacks against us before they happen . <p> The National Security Strategy does not overturn five decades of doctrine and jettison either containment or deterrence . These strategic concepts can and will continue to be employed where appropriate . But some threats are so potentially catastrophic " and can arrive with so little warning , by means that are untraceable " that they can not be contained . Extremists who seem to view suicide as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology requires new thinking about when a threat actually becomes " imminent . " So as a matter of common sense , the United States must be prepared to take action , when necessary , before threats have fully materialized . <p> Preemption is not a new concept . There has never been a moral or legal requirement that a country wait to be attacked before it can address existential threats . As George Shultz recently wrote , " If there is a rattlesnake in the yard , you do n't wait for it to strike before you take action in self-defense . " The United States has long affirmed the right to anticipatory self-defense " from the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to the crisis on the Korean Peninsula in 1994 . <p> But this approach must be treated with great caution . The number of cases in which it might be justified will always be small . It does not give a green light " to the United States or any other nation " to act first without exhausting other means , including diplomacy . Preemptive action does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . The threat must be very grave . And the risks of waiting must far outweigh the risks of action . <p> To support all these means of defending the peace , the United States will build and maintain 21st century military forces that are beyond challenge . <p> We will seek to dissuade any potential adversary from pursuing a military build-up in the hope of surpassing , or equaling , the power of the United States and our allies . <p> Some have criticized this frankness as impolitic . But surely clarity is a virtue here . Dissuading military competition can prevent potential conflict and costly global arms races . And the United States invites " indeed , we exhort " our freedom loving allies , such as those in Europe , to increase their military capabilities . <p> The burden of maintaining a balance of power that favors freedom should be shouldered by all nations that favor freedom . What none of us should want is the emergence of a militarily powerful adversary who does not share our common values . <p> Thankfully , this possibility seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have an historic opportunity to break the destructive pattern of great power rivalry that has bedeviled the world since rise of the nation state in the 17th century . Today , the world 's great centers of power are united by common interests , common dangers , and " increasingly " common values . The United States will make this a key strategy for preserving the peace for many decades to come . <p> There is an old argument between the so-called " realistic " school of foreign affairs and the " idealistic " school . To oversimplify , realists downplay the importance of values and the internal structures of states , emphasizing instead the balance of power as the key to stability and peace . Idealists emphasize the primacy of values , such as freedom and democracy and human rights in ensuring that just political order is obtained . As a professor , I recognize that this debate has won tenure for and sustained the careers of many generations of scholars . As a policymaker , I can tell you that these categories obscure reality . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Power matters in the conduct of world affairs . Great powers matter a great deal " they have the ability to influence the lives of millions and change history . And the values of great powers matter as well . If the Soviet Union had won the Cold War , the world would look very different today " Germany today might look like the old German Democratic Republic , or Latin America like Cuba . <p> Today , there is an increasing awareness " on every continent " of a paradigm of progress , founded on political and economic liberty . The United States , our NATO allies , our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere , Japan , and our other friends and allies in Asia and Africa all share a broad commitment to democracy , the rule of law , a market-based economy , and open trade . <p> In addition , since September 11th all the world 's great powers see themselves as falling on the same side of a profound divide between the forces of chaos and order , and they are acting accordingly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also now understand that being the target of trained killers is a powerful tonic that makes disputes over other important issues look like the policy differences they are , instead of fundamental clashes of values . <p> The United States is also cooperating with India across a range of issues " even as we work closely with Pakistan . <p> Russia is an important partner in the war on terror and is reaching towards a future of greater democracy and economic freedom . As it does so , our relationship will continue to broaden and deepen . The passing of the ABM Treaty and the signing of the Moscow Treaty reducing strategic arms by two-thirds make clear that the days of Russian military confrontation with the West are over . <p> China and the United States are cooperating on issues ranging from the fight against terror to maintaining stability on the Korean peninsula . And China 's transition continues . Admittedly , in some areas , its leaders still follow practices that are abhorrent . Yet China 's leaders have said that their main goal is to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reaching that goal in today 's world will depend more on developing China 's human capital than it will on China 's natural resources or territorial possessions . <p> And as China 's populace become more educated , more free to think , and more entrepreneurial , we believe this will inevitably lead to greater political freedom . You can not expect people to think on the job , but not at home . <p> This confluence of common interests and increasingly common values creates a moment of enormous opportunities . Instead of repeating the historic pattern where great power rivalry exacerbates local conflicts , we can use great power cooperation to solve conflicts , from the Middle East to Kashmir , Congo , and beyond . Great power cooperation also creates an opportunity for multilateral institutions " such as the UN , NATO , and the WTO " to prove their worth . That 's the challenge set forth by the President three weeks ago to the UN concerning Iraq . And great power cooperation can be the basis for moving forward on problems that require multilateral solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance of power that favors freedom , we must also extend the peace by extending the benefits of liberty and prosperity as broadly as possible . As the President has said , we have a responsibility to build a world that is not only safer , but better . <p> The United States will fight poverty , disease , and oppression because it is the right thing to do " and the smart thing to do . We have seen how poor states can become weak or even failed states , vulnerable to hijacking by terrorist networks " with potentially catastrophic consequences . And in societies where legal avenues for political dissent are stifled , the temptation to speak through violence grows . <p> We will lead efforts to build a global trading system that is growing and more free . Here in our own hemisphere , for example , we are committed to completing a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005 . We are also starting negotiations on a free trade agreement with the Southern African Customs Union . Expanding trade is essential to the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nations . <p> We will continue to lead the world in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS " a pandemic which challenges our humanity and threatens whole societies . <p> We will seek to bring every nation into an expanding circle of development . Earlier this year the President proposed a 50 percent increase in U.S. development assistance . But he also made clear that new money means new terms . The new resources will only be available to countries that work to govern justly , invest in the health and education of their people , and encourage economic liberty . <p> We know from experience that corruption , bad policies , and bad practices can make aid money worse than useless . In such environments , aid props up bad policy , chasing out investment and perpetuating misery . Good policy , on the other hand , attracts private capital and expands trade . In a sound policy environment , development aid is a catalyst , not a crutch . <p> At the core of America 's foreign policy is our resolve to stand on the side of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has called the " non-negotiable demands of human dignity " " free speech , equal justice , respect for women , religious tolerance , and limits on the power of the state . <p> These principles are universal " and President Bush has made them part of the debate in regions where many thought that merely to raise them was imprudent or impossible . <p> From Cairo and Ramallah to Tehran and Tashkent , the President has made clear that values must be a vital part of our relationships with other countries . In our development aid , our diplomacy , our international broadcasting , and in our educational assistance , the United States will promote moderation , tolerance , and human rights . And we look forward to one day standing for these aspirations in a free and unified Iraq . <p> We reject the condescending view that freedom will not grow in the soil of the Middle East " or that Muslims somehow do not share in the desire to be free . The celebrations we saw on the streets of Kabul last year proved otherwise . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab intellectuals recognized that for their nations to fully join in the progress of our times will require greater political and economic freedom , the empowerment of women , and better , more modern education . <p> We do not seek to impose democracy on others , we seek only to help create conditions in which people can claim a freer future for themselves .

In this paper , we find that the main culprit is the high cost of Phase III clinical trials , which are required for FDA approval of most drugs . We examined drug development in four major public health areas and discovered that for any given drug on the market , typically 90 percent or more of that drug 's development costs are incurred in Phase III trials . These costs have skyrocketed in recent years , exacerbating an already serious problem . <p> The enormous cost and risk of Phase III trials create incentives for researchers and investors to avoid work on medications for the chronic conditions and illnesses that pose the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the number of people affected .

We also examined the less burdensome regulatory situation in drugs for rare diseases , as an opportunity for contrast . We find that the current Phase III trial system forces pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to take enormous financial risks and burdens them with needless and unpredictable regulatory delays . The current system has , in particular , prevented start-up biotech companies , mostly based in the United States , from challenging the dominance of large , multinational pharmaceutical concerns . It also , perversely , encourages more innovation in drugs for very rare diseases than it does in drugs for common conditions that afflict hundreds of millions of Americans . <p> As a result of our analysis , we recommend replacing the current - all or nothing - FDA approval system with one that reflects the realities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a reform would allow drugs that have been found safe and promising ( in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials ) to win approval for limited marketing to patients .

For this reason , we believe that Congress must create clear standards for such a pathway . Congressional action would allow regulators and companies to develop new tools that are better suited to the realities of modern drug development .

Marcellus gas resides far below these deposits and any aquifers . More stringent design standards should be adopted , and more active regulatory oversight should be exercised . These steps would reduce the incidence of such problems . <p> Our findings suggest that the current shale gas drilling moratorium imposes a significant and needless burden on the New York State economy .

This paper describes the link between economic growth and immigration , the need for policy change , the misguided history of America 's political opposition to immigration , and a rational immigration policy . <p> Immigrants increase economic efficiency by reducing labor shortages in low- and high-skilled markets because their educational backgrounds fill holes in the native-born labor market . However , the share of immigrants in the U.S. workforce has declined since its 1991 peak . Increased immigration would expand the American work-force , and encourage more business start-ups .

American anti-immigrant groups have long feared the possibility that immigrants drive nativeborn workers out of jobs . However , this occurs only in the negligible proportion of occupations where native-born and immigrant skill sets overlap . Many economists have shown that immigration increases the wages of native-born Americans . <p> A growth-oriented immigration policy would allow a greater number of immigrants to legally enter , stay , and work in the United States .

Three hundred thousand H-1B visa holders would also have remained in the U.S. labor force , earning $23 billion in 2008 and generating $34-$47 billion in tax revenue over the next decade . <p> An immigration policy focused on increasing economic growth would seek ways to admit more immigrants with the advanced education levels desired by domestic employers . One approach to increasing legal immigration in a growth-oriented way , suggested by economists Pia Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny , is to auction permits to employers with demand-based minimum prices . This would raise public revenues while creating a market for permits and guaranteeing that immigrants would arrive with employment .

This would be followed by a series of steps toward legalization " including payment of back taxes , a mandatory fine , employment and background checks , and a citizenship-type test for those wanting to remain in America . These steps were the basis of the 2005 and 2007 McCain-Kennedy comprehensive immigration proposals , and form the core of the Senate bipartisan agreement announced in January .

Tax reform is long overdue given our high tax rates , countless loopholes , and archaic international tax system that is driving corporations and income out of the country . At the same time , tax reform has not happened since 1986 ( and has occurred only three times since World War II ) because it is extraordinarily complicated , and creates a politically perilous number of winners and losers . <p> Congress has been quietly negotiating tax reform for the past six years . Having participated in some of these negotiations while working in the Senate , I see four major issues that must be resolved to get tax reform over the finish line . <p> The largest issue is whether to stop at corporate tax reform , or to also overhaul the individual tax code . Conservatives recognize that both sides of the tax code require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforming the individual income tax can bring families into the reform constituency . <p> Additionally , reducing both the corporate and individual tax rates together can ensure much-needed tax rate parity . By contrast , cutting the corporate tax rate to 25 percent while leaving the individual income tax rate as high as 39.6 percent would face suffocating opposition from the millions of small businesses that file through the individual income tax code . One proposed solution " creating a separate , lower small business tax rate " has been criticized because families could simply redefine themselves as small businesses . <p> The challenge for Republicans is that , while most Democrats broadly accept the corporate tax reform framework of lower rates and fewer deductions , they absolutely reject any reduction in the 39.6 percent top tax rate on the individual side ( especially after spending a decade fighting to restore that rate after President George W. Bush cut it to 35 percent ) . Such proposals would turn tax reform into a more partisan exercise that , like ObamaCare reform , could be held hostage by any House or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals . Republican unity would be key . <p> The second issue is cost . Democrats insist that tax reform be revenue-neutral " or even revenue-raising " while Republican plans likely reduce revenues . Today 's corporate tax code provides the worst of both worlds by strangling jobs and incomes with the second-highest tax rate in the world , yet raising just 9 percent of all federal revenues . Thus , lower rates could increase economic growth that would in turn minimize any revenue loss ( which should be accounted for with dynamic scoring ) . <p> There is also the practical challenge that lower tax rates are quite popular , yet nearly all tax offsets are extraordinarily unpopular ( and in some cases economically damaging ) . <p> On the other hand , voters may sympathize with Democratic opposition to reducing tax revenues while budget deficits head back towards $1 trillion ( never mind the stream of Democrat spending proposals that also are not paid for ) . It is worth noting that the entire coming deficit increase will result from- soaring- entitlement spending that will outpace even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spending problem . <p> Still , even a small revenue loss could poison the well for entitlement reform . Voters will never accept balance-budget demands to cut Medicare or Food Stamps from lawmakers who had recently added red ink with business tax cuts . <p> The third issue is the international corporate tax code . The U.S remains one of the last remaining countries that taxes active profits abroad . So while American , German , and French subsidiaries each pay the 19 percent British corporate tax rate on goods sold in Great Britain , the United States uniquely charges its British subsidiary an additional 16 percent tax . Disadvantaged American companies have responded by either keeping these profits abroad indefinitely ( to escape the second tax ) , or inverting and moving to another country with lower tax rates . <p> The obvious solution is to join the 21st- century and implement a territorial tax system , combined with base erosion reforms that prevent companies from moving money across countries to game the system . Here , Congressional Republicans are mostly united for reform while Democrats are split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , while publicly pummeling Republicans for wanting to " give tax breaks to multinationals who send jobs abroad . " Although the anti-abuse negotiations have been challenging , the ease with which this issue can be demagogued may be the main barrier to a bipartisan consensus . <p> Speaking of international implications , the House 's proposed border adjustment tax ( which would tax imports but not exports ) has received substantial attention . However , its outlook is bleak given likely World Trade Organization ( WTO ) challenges as well as the potentially catastrophic effect it could have on importers such as retailers , car-makers , and oil refiners if consumer prices jump because exchange rates do not fully adjust to the new system . The concept is too unpredictable , and creates too many potential losers to be politically viable . <p> The final issue is politics . Americans will support tax reform that is portrayed as promoting competitiveness , simplification , and job growth " not as a deficit-busting giveaway to the rich . Bipartisanship , for all its questionable policy compromises , can build legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more likely to endure . Can the parties cooperate in good faith ?

Using hard data on high school students from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , one of the most comprehensive and rigorous studies of the behavior of American high school students , it finds that suburban public high school students have sex , drink , smoke , use illegal drugs , and engage in delinquent behavior as often as urban public high school students .

At that time there was only one choice program , in Milwaukee , and the data from that program had already been withheld from examination by the research community for five years with little sign that it would become available soon.1+- Researchers wishing to examine the effects of school choice were limited to collecting evidence from public and private schools and extrapolating to what would happen under a choice system . A leading researcher following this approach , James Coleman , consistently found that private school students performed better academically than public schools students after controlling for a host of observed background differences.2+- Coleman and others also found that private schools , while educating a lower proportion of minority students , more evenly distributed minority students , producing better racial integration than that found in public schools . From these findings Coleman and others suggested that providing vouchers or tax credits for families to select the school of their choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve racial integration in schools . <p> Many education researchers remained unconvinced . Unobserved and difficult to measure differences between families that select public and private schools might account for the apparent academic edge that private school students displayed , these researchers argued . Unfortunately , there was no way to respond to this objection fully as long as one was comparing families that chose a private school to those that did not . No matter how many controls were introduced for background differences , it was always possible that some other unobserved factors really explained the differences in outcomes . Many education researchers also remained unpersuaded that school choice would help promote integration . The lower percentage of minority students in private school , critics argued , was a more telling indicator of the effect of choice on integration than was the distribution of those students within the private sector . <p> In the absence of new sources of data , research on the effects of school choice remained deadlocked along these lines for many years . To be sure , innovative arguments were advanced by John Chubb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theory of how school governance related to organization efficiency than it was a source of direct evidence on the consequences of school choice . And various articles and books were authored by critics of school choice , such as Henry Levin , Amy Stuart Welles , and Peter Cookson , but their arguments were largely based on theoretical assumptions , analogies to foreign systems , or their particular reading of the debate over Coleman+GGs work.3 <p> +- <p> But starting in 1996 a flood of new data became available , greatly expanding what we know about the effects of school choice . First , John Witte released to other researchers the data he had obtained on the Milwaukee school choice program . Second , Cleveland began operating the second publicly funded school choice program and made at least some information available to different researchers . And third , several privately funded school choice programs were specifically designed to allow for rigorous examination of their effects . As a result of all of these new programs and studies we now know quite a lot about the effects of school choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as addressing three questions : 1 ) What are the academic effects of school choice on the families that choose their school ? 2 ) What are the academic effects of school choice on the public school system ? And 3 ) What are the effects of school choice on the civic values and integration that we wish schools to promote ? The evidence that addresses the first question , the academic effects of choice on the choosers , is now fairly strong . Our knowledge about the later two questions is still limited but growing stronger . Of course , much can still be learned on all three questions , and some people will never be satisfied with the quality or quantity of evidence produced . But it is fair to say that incredible progress has been made in the last several years in developing a solid empirical understanding of the effects of school choice programs . <p> It is also important to note that despite some well-publicized disagreements over research findings in recent years , there is a remarkable amount of consensus among the researchers who have collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the effects of school choice . These researchers largely differ on the confidence with which conclusions can be drawn and the inferences that can reasonably be made for shaping public policy , but they do not differ on their general assessments of the programs they have examined . That is , all of the researchers who have served as evaluators of the publicly-funded choice programs in Milwaukee and Cleveland , as well as the privately-funded programs in Washington , D.C. , Dayton , New York , and San Antonio , agree that these programs have been generally positive developments and have supported their continuation , if not expansion . If one only examined the competing interest group and research community spin on the various evaluations instead of reading the evaluations themselves one might easily miss the level of positive consensus that exists . This positive consensus is all the more remarkable given the politically contentious nature of the issue and the rewards scholars have for highlighting disagreements with one another .

" It is precisely when a claim reaches this status that it must be questioned firmly , with clear eyes . <p> We simply do n't have enough data to evaluate the effects of discipline changes in most American school districts . <p> The case for an aggressive approach to reducing suspensions rests on three assertions : ( 1 ) The disparate impact of school suspensions is evidence that they are racially motivated ; ( 2 ) Suspensions do significant harm to students ; ( 3 ) " Restorative justice " is a viable and more humane alternative , so we can reduce suspensions safely . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing suspensions is a moral imperative rather than a matter of policy tradeoffs . But these claims are only true- up to a point , and accepting them without qualification can lead to tradeoffs that may do much greater harm than good to students and schools . Let 's examine each assertion in turn : <p> The disparity in suspensions is due to racial bias. - There is a dramatic difference in the rate of suspensions by race . According to one- study , 1 in 6 African-American students were suspended at least once , compared to 1 in 14 Latinos , 1 in 20 Whites , and 1 in 50 Asians . The University of Pennsylvania 's Shaun Harper conducted a- major study- of suspensions in southern states that showed some disparities far too striking to be explicable without racial bias . Another- study- showed that white teachers tend to view black student behavior more negatively than black teachers . So evidence supports the claim that the disparity in suspension rates is attributable to racial bias " up to a point . <p> The question is " just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 percent ? 75 ? 50 ? 30 ? Studies like these can point us to a problem , but they ca n't truly take us inside the issue . If we really think that , say , 75 percent of the disparity is due to teachers ' racial bias , then it would make sense to invest a lot in professional development to re-educate educators. - <p> But if we pursue wholesale policy changes on the assumption racial bias is- solely- responsible for the disparity ( the assumption behind the Department of Education 's " Dear Colleague " guidance on discipline ) then we run a strong risk of overcorrecting . Rapid overhauls of the entire system might well breed rampant disorder in schools " and in places where that approach has been taken , the results are n't looking pretty ( but more on that in a moment ) . <p> Suspensions do great harm to students. - Another oft-heard claim is that school suspensions place students in the " school-to-prison pipeline . " One landmark- study- out of UCLA showed that students who were suspended were dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes , and take public assistance . This study was rigorous , matching students across several observable variables , and should be taken seriously " up to a point . <p> While a study like this can prove that suspensions are- associated- with those outcomes , it ca n't truly support the claim that suspensions- caused- these outcomes . There are differences between , say , a kid who punches someone else and one who does n't , which controlling for race , class , and family composition does n't account for . You would rather expect long-term differences between a troublemaker and a well-behaved student of a similar background ; you would n't necessarily conclude that the suspension- caused- the differences . So , policymakers should be extremely wary of making any claim of causality from a study like this . <p> There are also two sides to this ledger : while claims of the benefits of not suspending disruptive students are likely oversold , the harm done to students by disruptive peers is certainly underappreciated . A- study- by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary school reduces earnings at age 26 by 3 to 4 percent ... and removing one disruptive peer from a classroom for one year would raise the present discounted value of classmates ' future earnings by $100,000 . " <p> It 's fair to question whether suspensions are truly the best tool to maintain classroom order . But it 's important to recognize that any major policy change is likely to have tradeoffs , harming some students even as it helps others . <p> We can reduce suspensions safely. - Of the three claims , this is the most dubious . There certainly are- case studies- of schools that have successfully adopted a " restorative justice " model . And I have no doubt that it can work " again , - up to a point . <p> Unfortunately , that point does n't take us very far . Much of the reliable evidence on the effects of- rapid , large-scale- school discipline reform in major urban districts is pretty grim. - <p> In Chicago , where a thorough- study- of the effects of shortening suspension length found a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We do n't , for example , have great data on St. Paul , where superintendent Valeria Silva was recently ousted over her discipline reforms . In an- incisive postmortem , the Center for the American Experiment 's Katherine Kersten quotes St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders saying that fights that " might have been between two individuals ... now become melees involving 40 or 50 people . " Kersten also relates the story of a teacher who , after being crushed into a shelf by a student , asks her students to use a secret knock before she 'll open the door to her classroom . Denise Rodriguez , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and staff deserve to come to work every day and not expect to be assaulted ? " <p> By pushing reckless , large-scale , administrative overhauls of school discipline , reformers may well be hurting the kids they 're trying to help . <p> Maybe not , given the way things are headed . The Department of Education might well have applauded St. Paul for following its " Dear Colleague " - guidance- by trying to narrow the racial suspension gap , and no one could have made a data-driven case against it .

In doing so , it should be wary of a movement that would use the Securities and Exchange Commission to add to the regulatory burden in all those areas and more by infusing corporate accounting with environmental advocacy . <p> There is good reason to believe the SEC during the Obama years was hospitable to such " sustainability " reporting . Jay Clayton , Trump 's pick to lead the SEC , should be asked about the subject in his confirmation hearings . <p> The idea of sustainability reporting is being championed by the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board ( SASB ) , a group well-financed by benefactors such as the Ford Foundation and former New York mayor ( and billionaire ) Michael Bloomberg . <p> SASB 's acronym is a riff on that of the Financial Standards Accounting Board ( FASB ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated to set generally accepted accounting principles since 1973 . SASB 's goal is to add its criteria for environmental , social and governance concerns ( " ESG " ) to the list of financial metrics required in publicly traded companies ' SEC-mandated disclosures . <p> SASB and its supporters argue that social and policy concerns matter to many investors and that a range of nonfinancial dimensions are material to the long-term prospects of publicly traded firms . In a July 2016 letter to the SEC , SASB founder and President Jean Rogers argued : " Internationalization of manufacturing and supply chains has generated concomitant concerns about how U.S. companies are managing environmental , human rights and governance issues abroad . " <p> Rogers offered these comments in response to an SEC request for proposals as to how to " modernize " Regulation S-K , which provides criteria for public company disclosure . The potential that the Obama-era SEC was interested in sustainability in that context should stand as a warning to the agency 's new chairman as he gets to know the staff . <p> SASB has developed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries in 10 economic sectors . Such standards include requiring airlines to report the " environmental footprint of fuel use " ; automobile makers to report " materials efficiency and recycling " ; and oil and gas firms to report their impact on " security , human rights , and rights of indigenous people . " <p> By no means are all the sustainability standards related to environmental issues. - Automobile companies are also asked to report on the " percentage of active workforce covered by collective-bargaining agreements , broken down by U.S. and foreign employees . " The standards , in other words , are extremely detailed , and SASB 's definition of sustainability reaches into virtually every type of business decision . <p> Of course , SASB has every right to try to persuade companies to agree voluntarily to make some or all of its preferred disclosures , as well as to offer investors its type of analysis . If investors agree with SASB that its disclosures are financially relevant " or if investors are committed to prioritizing nonfinancial goals in their investing " they can buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the securities of those that fail to do so . <p> But the dangers in using government as a tool to enforce such standards " - and to designate SASB standards as the right set of reporting measures " are multiple . <p> The most obvious is the direct cost burden of such increased reporting . Reporting and compliance costs for publicly traded companies have already increased substantially in recent years . Such increased burdens implicitly favor larger firms " and thus increasing industry concentration " by favoring those who already have large legal and regulatory compliance staffs . <p> The more significant costs of mandatory SASB-style disclosures , however , are those flowing from the leverage that such mandated disclosures would necessarily give to politicized enforcement agents at the SEC and Department of Justice , to politically ambitious state attorneys general , and to class-action plaintiffs ' lawyers seeking to pounce on alleged misstatements . <p> To be sure , state AGs and plaintiffs ' lawyers may be able to harass or sue companies for voluntary disclosures using old-fashioned tort claims or overly broad state statutes like New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEC disclosure rule , the potential for regulation through litigation or prosecution outside the normal legislative lawmaking process would be greatly multiplied . <p> Most investors understand these risks , and they have already considered and rejected hosts of SASB-type disclosure ideas . According to the Manhattan Institute 's Proxy Monitor database , Fortune 250 companies have faced more than 1,500 shareholder proposals since 2006 that sought environmental , political , or other social or policy goals , most seeking new disclosures . <p> Only one of these proposals has received majority shareholder support over board opposition " a compelling indicator that most market participants bound by fiduciary duties oriented around shareholder wealth maximization do not find SASB-type disclosures material . <p> There is no harm in SASB building a sustainability index , but throwing the government 's weight behind it risks driving even more companies from America 's publicly traded stock markets , which have fewer corporate listings today than in 1975 .

The goal is generally to return the agency to its core transportation mission by divesting real-estate assets and taking a more businesslike approach to its transportation assets . <p> These changes are worthwhile but fail to address the way the agency finances its system .

The mechanism to do so is long-term public-private partnerships ( P3s ) , which today mobilize hundreds of billions in new capital for infrastructure around the world . <p> The endgame is that the PA would no longer own or operate transportation infrastructure . Instead , it would plan and regulate an array of concession companies that would be held accountable for performance through bond covenants and terms embedded in their long-term concession agreements . Public pension funds should be a key investor in the new P3 concessions . <p> P3s would produce major benefits . These include added runway capacity at Kennedy and Newark Airports ; the reconstruction and expansion of aging bridges and tunnels ; more productive seaports ; a greatly reformed Port Authority Trans-Hudson ( PATH ) rapid-transit system ; and a sensible replacement of the Port Authority Bus Terminal .

Loser pays , sometimes called the " English rule " but actually , in essence , the rule in place in the rest of the world , refers to the policy of reimbursement by the parties who lose in litigation of the winners ' legal expenses , including attorneys ' fees . This study argues that loser pays could be an important part of a larger effort to reduce litigation costs , better compensate prevailing litigants , and better align tort law with its goal of deterring socially harmful conduct . A loser-pays rule would discourage meritless lawsuits , but because any such rule should also ensure plaintiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our proposal calls for : <p> A robust litigation insurance industry similar to those that now exist in other loser-pays countries ; and <p> A cap on recoverable fees to eliminate the incentive that large litigants might have to attempt to " buy a verdict " under loser pays . <p> This study explores in depth how a loser-pays rule would change litigation in America . It includes key findings about the likely effects of loser-pays reform and evaluates previous experiments with loser pays in America .

Globally , nuclear reactors provide about 11 percent of the world 's electricity . That global fleet of reactors is also helping avoid the release of about 2.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually .

It will also have to facilitate the research and development of new reactor designs and streamline the process for permitting and siting those new reactors .

They say longer clinical trials should be required and newer , targeted , " smart " drugs like Vioxx should be tested against their cheaper , blunter ancestors before they are allowed on market . <p> Lost Lives , Higher Drug Prices <p> That mindset , however , will slow medical progress to a crawl by leading to larger , longer , and ever more expensive clinical trials designed to identify increasingly rare adverse effects . Adding more layers of onerous regulations to the FDA approval process will actually hurt patients : It will forestall the distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users , and it will keep new products off the market far longer . That will cause a direct cost in lost lives and higher drug prices . <p> Vioxx 's critics have forgotten that patients using older drugs are often exposed to worse side effects and receive fewer benefits than with the newer drugs . Arthritis sufferers are especially at risk because using non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) for long-term pain management exposes patients to a high risk of serious gastrointestinal problems , possibly leading to bleeding ulcers and even , in some cases , death . <p> The politics of global drug withdrawals and longer drug development times is a scientific step backward in an era when both common sense and science demonstrate that , as an article in the New England Journal of Medicine noted , " different patients respond in different ways to the same medication " ( see " Drug Therapy : Pharmacogenomics Drug Disposition , Drug Targets , and Side Effects , " Evans , W. E. and McLeod , H. L. , New England Journal of Medicine 348 : 538-549 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is borne out by the new science of pharmacogenomics , which demonstrates how drugs are metabolized differently in different groups of patients based on genetic variations . <p> Critics Remain Unconvinced <p> Nonetheless , critics still insist most drugs produced by industry and approved by the FDA are " me-too " drugs , copycats of each other that are not even better , or possibly even worse than , generic NSAIDs already on market , such as aspirin , ibuprofen , and naproxen . But research has shown that in many cases only one drug will work for a particular group of arthritis sufferers . Vioxx is no exception . Many people who took Vioxx had found Celebrex did n't work for them , and they could n't take ibuprofen or aspirin because they were at high risk for gastrointestinal problems or allergic to those medications . <p> In fact , the Washington Post recently chronicled how patients formerly on Vioxx are struggling to find substitutes that allow them the same level of pain relief and functionality ( " Withdrawal Symptoms : Patients , Doctors Explore Alternatives For Arthritis Relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 ) . One patient , a 58-year-old osteoarthritis sufferer for whom other treatments were less effective , was even quoted in the article as saying , " I 'm concerned about risks , ... but you also have to talk about quality of life . If Vioxx was still available I probably would 've stayed on it . " <p> Before there was Vioxx , there was aspirin . And now , of course , aspirin is used widely to prevent a second stroke or heart attack . But medical researchers have evidence that so-called " aspirin resistance " is much more common than formerly believed--perhaps as many as 50 percent of all high-risk patients taking aspirin therapy develop this condition . " Resistance " in this case means a patient 's cells do not respond by producing the blood-thinning platelets needed to fight off another stroke or heart attack .

As scientists develop what are called pharmacogenomic tools to tailor drugs to our genetic profile , doctors will be increasingly able to give the right drug to the right patient at the right time . <p> This is n't science fiction .

Using this personalized approach , Liggett says , " we have been able to take people who were miserable or near death and bring them back to a normal life . " <p> Pharmacogenomics will revolutionize drug development as well . Biotech and drug firms will be able to use genetic screens to identify the right group of people for whom prospective compounds work best . That will enable safer and faster testing using smaller groups of patients earlier in the development process .

A little more than half of the newly insured will have insurance from Medicaid ( about 13 million ) , while most others will gain coverage through private insurance purchased on state-run or federally run healthinsurance exchanges . <p> Irrespective of the source of coverage , it is axiomatic that demand for health-care services increases when the formerly uninsured gain coverage . While some of this increased demand may be due to legitimate need ( particularly for those with serious preexisting conditions who have been unable to obtain regular access to care because of lack of insurance ) , many of those who will be covered will be young and relatively healthy ( 39 percent of the uninsured are between the ages of 18 and 34 ) or will be those who rate their health as " good " or " excellent " ( 60 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required to purchase ) expansive coverage that insulates them from significant costs associated with health-care services , their demand for health-care services will increase beyond its optimal level . <p> This demand is obviously a concern in a nation that already spends 18 percent of its GDP on health care , but it also presents challenges for a health-care system where access to certain services " such as primary care " is significantly strained . It is this last dimension " access to care " that has been given relatively little thought in the popular debates over the Affordable Care Act ( aka Obamacare ) . <p> Indeed , if seriously or chronically i 'll patients face increased competition for physicians ' attention from the newly insured , it is possible that worsened health and increased costs could be the short-term result of Obamacare 's insurance expansion . <p> The main focus of our analysis is assessing access to primary-care physicians under the health-care law .

We project that by 2025 , the United States will experience a shortage of roughly 30,000 primary-care physicians " with about 16.5 percent ( 4,950 physicians ) of this shortage being driven by the expansion of insurance coverage under Obamacare , while the remaining 83.5 percent ( 25,050 physicians ) will be due to population growth , aging , and various demographic shifts .

The data reveal that 803 programs fell short of the required standards , meaning their students will lose access to federal student aid , including Pell grants and federal student loans . The group facing sanctions was largely comprised of programs at for-profit institutions , but programs at a few highly reputable , non-profit institutions also made the list , - including Harvard , John 's Hopkins and University of Southern California . The gainful employment rules , which were put in place in 2014 , require vocationally oriented programs participating in federal student aid to meet a heightened standard of student financial success , measured by a combination of student loan burden and earnings . <p> Some conservatives have- argued- that these regulations are overreaching and unfairly target for-profit schools . Among the 8,637 programs subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The critics are right in one respect : for-profit institutions should n't face a more stringent system of accountability . But they are wrong in another . These regulations do n't need to be clawed back . Instead , we need to do away with the current system of accountability and hold all institutions , regardless of their tax status , accountable for the outcomes their students face . <p> Currently , colleges face minimal standards when it comes to student outcomes . In order for a college to lose eligibility for federal student aid dollars , their former students must default on their loans at very high rates year after year . The spirit of this regulation is good , but the bar is set low and research- suggests- that the metric being used to measure default provides a poor indicator of borrower distress . <p> Beyond that , it 's the system of accreditation that acts as the gatekeeper to federal aid dollars . But accreditation has- historically been focused- on the inputs a college uses , like curriculum and faculty credentials , rather than student outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two are linked . Even Corinthian Colleges Inc. , the now bankrupt chain of for-profit colleges notorious for failing its students , - maintained accreditation- from the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools until the day it closed its doors . <p> Using gainful employment regulations to police for-profit colleges is like installing traffic cameras but only turning them on when a sports car drives by . It 's true that the for-profit sector has worse track record than the public and nonprofit sectors . It is not true , however , that there are no public or non-profit institutions producing consistently bad financial outcomes for students . In a- recent study- of 962 schools , the 10 worst performers yielded a negative return on investment after 20 years in the workforce , some leaving students as much as $110,000 in the red . None of them were for-profit schools . <p> The gainful employment regulations ensure that new students wo n't be able to enroll in institutions with track records of leaving students with heaps of student debt and little ability to pay . This is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism to help students avoid- all- of the institutions with bad rap sheets ? Why should we only protect students from enrolling in bad institutions that have shareholders and CEOs ? <p> Some could argue that non-vocationally oriented programs should not have to prove their worth with employment related student outcomes . Employment , of course , is not the only benefit to higher education . However , in a world where- 90 percent- of new college students report finances and employment as their reason for enrolling in college , such an argument falls flat . <p> So rather than eliminating gainful employment regulations , we need to put in place a student-focused system of accountability that works for all institutions . The current regulations may not be- calibrated perfectly , but the notion of building a system of accountability based on outcomes is the right one. - Billions- of taxpayer dollars are spent each year by the federal government to support investments in higher education . This spending can be justified on a number of grounds , even from a conservative viewpoint . But a well-functioning system of oversight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving the intended goals .

Their cultures and identities are split between Africa and the United States . They have last names like Onwughalu and Senkofa . They speak languages like Wolof , Twi , Yoruba and Hausa , and speak English with an accent . They were raised on African cuisine , music , dance and dress styles , customs and family dynamics . Their children often speak or at least understand their parents ' native language . <p> Living descendants of slaves in America neither knew their African ancestors nor even have elder relatives who knew them .

For example , Alan Keyes , the Republican Senate candidate in Illinois , has claimed that as a descendant of slaves , he is the " real " African American , compared with his Democratic rival , Barack Obama , who has an African father and white mother . And the reason Keyes and others are making arguments such as this is rather small , the idea being that " African American " should refer only to people with a history of subordination in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diallo , who was killed by police while reaching for his wallet , or Caribbean ones such as torture victim Abner Louima have found the U.S. to be the Land of Oz . <p> We are not African to any meaningful extent , but we are not white either - and that is much of why Jesse Jackson 's presentation of the term " African American " caught on so fast . It sets us apart from the mainstream . It carries an air of standing protest , a reminder that our ancestors were brought here against their will , that their descendants were treated like animals for centuries , and that we have come a long way since then . <p> But we need a way of sounding those notes with a term that , first , makes some sense and , second , does not insult the actual African Americans taking their place in our country .

He also promised to respect state and local authority over K-12 education . <p> The inescapable tension between those two promises is why school choice- stalwarts- are already coming out against a federal choice initiative . The central intuition behind school choice is that parents ought to have as much power as possible . Any federal program is almost certain to put the policy preferences of distant federal bureaucrats over states , civic organizations and parents . <p> Almost . To his credit , Trump seems to be eyeing the one approach that could avoid that trap . <p> In his address to Congress , Trump highlighted Denisha Merriweather , a young woman whose life was fundamentally changed by a state tax credit scholarship . This perhaps tipped Trump 's hand on the nature of his proposal : a federal tax credit for individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we assume that his administration caps the tax credit at $20 billion , this proposal could perhaps give millions of students the transformative opportunity Denisha had . But whether a tuition tax credit can reach its full potential , expanding opportunities for families without inadvertently tying their hands and the hands of state legislatures , depends entirely on how it 's written . <p> Last Congress , Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Todd Rokita introduced a tax credit bill that Betsy DeVos , now secretary of education , declared would , " empower parents throughout the country to have access to quality education options that are otherwise out of reach . " While that bill was a good start , it also contained three key flaws in the near term , would limit its potential and , in the long term , could harm the cause of school choice . <p> Fortunately , DeVos need not merely dust off someone else 's proposal and peddle it . She could make the idea her own by fixing its flaws and delivering a win for tens of millions of families for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill is that it prohibits scholarship-granting organizations from setting aside contributions " on behalf of any particular student or to any specific school or group of schools . " If you believe in the creative power of a Montessori education , in the timeless value of Catholic schools , or are a Big Brother mentor hoping to go above and beyond for your mentee , then this tuition tax credit is not for you . This restriction would not only limit donor interest to well under $20 billion a year , it would also exert pressure on existing state programs to drop their moral mission and conform . But there 's an easy fix : just delete that clause . <p> The second problem is that scholarship granting organizations may only donate to traditional private schools . In the last five years , Education Savings Accounts programs ( ESAs ) , a debit-card-esque account that parents can use on a wider range of educational options , have exploded in popularity ; programs have been launched in five states and will be debated in over a dozen state legislatures this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting parents customize their child 's education and potentially unleashing a wave of innovative educational options . By restricting choice in the federal program to traditional private schools , the Trump administration would not only miss a huge opportunity . It would knock the ESA debate off the rails , focusing state legislative attention on supplementing the more limited federal tax credit program . <p> It would take some effort to fix this flaw , but the reward would be well worth it . Congress could empower scholarship-granting organizations to act as ESA administrators , expanding the range of options available to parents and monitoring their spending . This model already exists in Florida , where Step Up For Students runs the Gardiner Special Needs Scholarship , allowing parents to customize their child 's education so long as they meet Step Up 's requirements . Similar civic institutions can and should flourish across the country , being held accountable to the taxpayers at the state or federal level . <p> The third issue is perhaps the most important and difficult to address : establishing firm guard rails against future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Justice investigated schools in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program for not adhering to federal regulations under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act . The thing is , both legal state and court precedent said that those regulations did n't apply to them . Any federal revenue stream opens up private schools to the depredations of future administrations who 'd prioritize hostility to school choice over rule of law . <p> But an even bigger issue is the fear from religious schools that federal school choice funding would be a Trojan Horse . Christian , Jewish and Muslim schools assume a tragic risk if they choose to take federal funding . Someday a progressive president may present them with an ultimatum : either violate their teachings and their conscience or forfeit federal funds and cast out hundreds of thousands of poor students . Religious schools may not be wrong to feel that no matter how strong the statutory language , a future administration might do this anyway . But the Trump administration must make a good-faith effort . <p> If they take the time and care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeVos and Trump 's team to launch a federal school choice initiative that encourages innovation and opportunity . But if they merely promote someone else 's proposal to score points on a campaign promise , they 'd ultimately set school choice back significantly . Here 's hoping they choose their course on school choice carefully .

This policy , which to take effect must be confirmed by a second vote next month , would only continue a trend in education that hurts teachers while also preventing class-size reduction . <p> How can we expect school systems to pay teachers more when we 're constantly reducing the number of hours they work in the classroom ? And how can we reduce class sizes when each teacher is handling fewer and fewer classes per day ? <p> To see how shorter school days hurt both teachers and students , we need to look at a major structural change in education . Florida 's inflation-adjusted education spending per student has roughly doubled in the last 30 years -- to $7,473 in 2000-01 . But the extra money has n't gone into teachers ' salaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation-adjusted dollars over the same period . <p> Instead , the single greatest factor driving the doubling of education spending in that time has been the hiring of a huge new army of teachers . Nationwide there has been a 48 percent increase in the teaching workforce relative to the student population , with a similar trend in Florida . <p> Spending all that extra money to hire all those teachers might have been justified if it had reduced class sizes , but it has n't . The average number of students in U.S. public school classrooms was 27 in 1971 ; by 1996 the average class size was essentially unchanged , with 24 students in elementary schools and 31 students in secondary schools . <p> Why did n't classes shrink ? One major reason is that individual teachers are spending less and less time in the classroom teaching students . The average teacher in a departmentalized setting ( that is , where students have different teachers for different subjects ) taught almost 4.5 hours per day in 1982 , but fewer than 3.9 hours per day in 2000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each secondary public school teacher dropped from 134 in 1971 to 97 in 1996 . <p> Perhaps some teachers prefer to work fewer classroom hours and get smaller raises , rather than work the same amount and get bigger raises . But given how far teachers ' salaries are trailing behind salaries in other professions , most teachers would probably prefer bigger raises rather than less work . The less time each teacher spends in the classroom , the more teachers each school needs to hire to provide the same level of instruction . The more teachers each school hires , the less money is available for teacher raises . Meanwhile , students and their families would definitely prefer the smaller classes that would come from having teachers spend more of their day in the classroom . <p> The Broward School Board should consider these facts when the idea of shorter school days comes up for a final vote next month . Teachers ' salaries have stagnated and class sizes have n't shrunk in large part because of just this kind of policy ; more of the same is the last thing Broward needs .

But in terms of economics and the future growth of this country , he was probably the most optimistic pessimist , to quote Amity , in history ( even more so than our current president ) . <p> Amity makes her case through the use of narrative and personalities . For example , she tells of a group of people who traveled to the Soviet Union in the 1920s and the ideas that came out of that journey . From her analysis of the ideas that came out of World War I , you get an understanding of what took place in the 1930s .

And this was not 1930 ; it was 1937 , the second Depression , the Depression within the Depression . Amity is making the point that even in the late 1930s , we were still mired in hard times . There was no recovery . It never took place . <p> You read about the New Deal in this book through the story of the Schechter brothers . It is extraordinary how much of a corporatist state we had in the 1930s . So it is not just a book about economics . It is not just about numbers . It brings the whole thing to life .

Others " most people " play Monopoly not to triumph but for the company of the ruthless party , to get along respectably , or to situate themselves in a community .

There is no game . <p> When it comes to the Great Depression , we know the traditional narrative . The stock-market crash generated an economic Katrina . The sitting president responded with preposterous inadequacy to this perfect storm . During the earlier years of the Depression , one in four Americans was unemployed . The Depression was a crisis of confidence , a result of some combination of monetary , banking , credit , and international factors . The terrible thing was the duration of the unemployment , which averaged in the mid-teens for the entire decade of the 1930s . <p> The second thing we learned from the traditional narrative was that the Depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great brains were needed to end it , minds a standard deviation or two out there , with superb credentials . The message was that government brains were smarter than average brains . That was why FDR 's advisory group was called the Brains Trust : Felix Frankfurter , Frances Perkins , Stuart Chase , George Warren , Marriner Eccles , Adolf Berle . The mystery had something to do with a shortage of money that only a prince of the economics kingdom could understand . Their tinkering with money saved us , and only they could have done it . <p> There were corollaries to the traditional narrative . In the New Deal , government knew more than big business . And big business knew more than small business . The small player at the board ? He was almost irrelevant . <p> We have internalized other presumptions about the period . One is that cleaning up Wall Street by getting rid of white-collar criminals helped the nation toward recovery . Remove the top hats and you level society in a way that is good economics . FDR , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man wearing his tuxedo and top hat who fell into the water but was saved from drowning when someone pulled him back on shore " after which the man began complaining that he had lost his top hat . <p> In this period , we were taught , property rights may have mattered , but they mattered less than a lot of other things " the social good , job creation , shoring up homeowners , and getting the money supply right . Property rights were appropriately subordinated to the macroeconomic crisis . The last part of the traditional story is that American democracy was endangered " that Sinclair Lewis was wise to warn of the rise of dictators in his play It Ca n't Happen Here . Therefore " or so the reasoning goes " the Wagner Act , the great labor law , was a good thing or , at the very least , a lesser evil . Organized labor was said to be a benign force in the economy and , in any case , exhilarating to learn about . There was a theatrical energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers both have found appealing . There was an element of satisfaction to thinking that here in the United States we were experiencing our own tame Petrograds . Sit-down strikes ? Those were adolescent capers of young industrial America . <p> Finally , we assume something about the tempo of it all : the traditional view of the 1930s is that action by the government was good and inaction was fatal . We always told ourselves that there is something about a deflationary spiral that mandates any kind of action , even action far removed from strict monetary management . Somebody had to do something , we thought . In 1933 , the humorist Will Rogers wrote that if Roosevelt had " burned down the capital , we would cheer and say , ' Well , at least we got a fire started , anyhow . ' " 2 Keynesianism works as the window dressing for that because more than it is about multipliers or demand , Keynesianism is about furious activity . <p> So that 's the official version . Or , to put it in the terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing because we had no bank . There was nobody to lead at the table and hand out the Monopoly money . We had too many top hats lording it about on the board , trying to establish a plutocratic monopoly , a plutocracy . We needed a strong , credentialed bank , and FDR materialized to be that bank . After his appearance , Americans were on their way to having a shot at building a little wealth . <p> When you go back to research the period , however , you find a different story . It starts the same : the early part of the Depression , the years upon which economists have focused , was indeed a Katrina . Credit , banking , monetary policy , and international components all combined to create that first dark period that was so well studied by our forerunners . A number of the New Deal measures provided lasting benefit for the economy , just as the traditional history holds . Here one must certainly count the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission , as the Manhattan Institute 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall ; the push for free trade led by Secretary of State Cordell Hull ; and the establishment of the modern mortgage format . Should we include deposit insurance on this list of benefits ? Maybe . Maybe not . <p> But the rest of the evidence contradicts the official narrative . After two or three years of research , I discerned one big theme : government prevented recovery . Herbert Hoover was too active " not too passive , as the old stereotypes suggest . Roosevelt and his New Deal impeded recovery as well . This was especially true in the latter half of the 1930s , where even all the traditional explanations " monetary , banking , international " just do n't suffice . You can find individual snapshots of growth during the Roosevelt years , and they are as impressive as the stock-market rally of the past year has been " impressive because they represent a leap from that tiny , terrifying base . But then , as now , we define recovery as something simple " getting back to where we were before , whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , the New Deal was a calculus of frustration , yielding the always recovering , but never recovered , economy . <p> The government did its damage by practicing arrogance : by talking down to the citizen and by compromising that citizen 's economic autonomy . In addition , policymakers forgot microeconomics and common sense . Instead , they became dazzled by macroeconomics . The Roosevelt administration wrongly emphasized executive-branch discretion rather than the rule of law . A final factor , too little discussed , in the severity of the Great Depression was the systematic undermining of property rights . <p> Let 's start with the arrogance , which is the arrogance of planning , or " scientism , " that Hayek also identified . The centerpiece of the New Deal 's first hundred days was the National Recovery Administration . The goal of the NRA in 1935 was more ambitious than , say , that of the health-care legislation of 2009 : for government to join with big business in supervising the industrial economy . Imagine an enormous multi-sector mechanism calibrated to monitor , and even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes were based were popular with scholars at the time . Prices had to be pushed up to make recovery possible . Big firms in industry " the ones that were " too big too fail " " were supposed to write codes for all firms in their sector , big and small . Naturally , this worked to the advantage of the larger firms . That 's one reason that the name of Monopoly resonated as it did in 1935 or 1936 . <p> Another NRA principle was that competition inhibited recovery by driving prices down . New Dealers carried on a passionate romance with the concept of the economy of scale . If something was bigger , they believed , it was more efficient . So size was supposed to speed recovery , too . Consumer choice ? Choice was inefficient , and thus inhibited recovery . <p> The absurdity of these principles was overlooked because the principles came from great minds . One Brains Trust member , Raymond Moley , described the general attitude of the Roosevelt administration . He sought to capture the myopic credentialism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The problems of economic life were to Frankfurter matters to be settled in a law office , a courtroom , or around a big labor-management bargaining table . These problems were litigious , controversial , not broadly constructive and evolutionary . The government was the protagonist . Its agents were its lawyers and commissioners . The antagonists were big corporate lawyers . In the background were misty principals whom Frankfurter never really knew at first hand and who were chiefly envisaged as concepts in legalistic fencing . These background figures were owners of the corporations , managers , workers , and consumers. 3 " <p> What Moley is saying is that in this period there were n't merely forgotten men . There was also a forgotten economy . <p> One family that was targeted by such officials was the Schechters , wholesale chicken butchers from Brooklyn . To read their testimony is to hear small businessmen think aloud . Against their own better judgment , the Schechters were trying to convince themselves that they ought to comply with the National Recovery Administration . The NRA code that applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , amounted to a bureaucratic obstacle : the Code of Fair Competition for the Live Poultry Industry of the Metropolitan Area in and about the City of New York . The Schechters did all the wrong things . They ignored federal mandates . They paid their staff butchers less than rules said they should . They charged prices that were deemed suspiciously low . They competed . They allowed consumers to pick their own chickens . The Schechters were prosecuted for violating the NRA . The contention on the part of the Justice Department in court was that the Schechters , and others in their business , did this because they lacked the education to know what was right . <p> The prosecution of the Schechters seemed comical but was actually tragic . If you imagine the courtroom scene , on the one side you see Walter Lyman Rice , from the government and a graduate of Harvard Law School . On the other side is a small man in the poultry trade , Louis Spatz , who is afraid of going to jail for doing the things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He barely speaks English . The prosecutor is n't letting him defend himself , even though Spatz is accurate about the way business works . <p> Rice : But you do not claim to be an expert ? Spatz : No.Rice : On the competitive practices in the live poultry industry ? Spatz : I would want to get paid if I was an expert.Rice : You are not an expert ! Spatz : I am experienced but not an expert . <p> At one point , this everyman , this small player , sort of pulls himself together . <p> Rice : And you would not endeavor to explain economic consequences of competitive practices ? Spatz : In my business , I am the best economist.Rice : What is that ? Spatz : In my business , I am the best economizer.Rice : You are the best economizer ? Spatz : Yes , without figuring.Rice : I wish to have that word spelled in the minutes , just as he stated it.Spatz : I do not know how to spell . <p> Why does this dialogue matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the natural drivers of recovery , and they were n't being allowed to do that driving , to accumulate wealth , to get to the sweet point of sliding a house onto their property square . Instead , they were sidelined . The Schechters won their case in the Supreme Court " the landmark " Sick Chicken Case " of 1935 . But the combined challenges of the lawsuit and the Depression did terrible damage to their business . <p> To address the monetary question : clearly , there was n't enough money around in the early 1930s . ( Some towns made their own scrip . One " Albion , Michigan " actually put an image of FDR 's head on its makeshift currency . ) Roosevelt was therefore not wrong in seeking to reflate . But though Roosevelt 's direction was all right , the discretionary aspect of his policy was terrifying . As Henry Morgenthau reports in his diaries , prices were personally set by the president . Indeed , if you go back to the 1930s , you see FDR taking us off the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting up in bed every morning , after his egg , say , and before his cigarette , setting the gold price . Let it go up twenty-one cents , he would say . Morgenthau would ask , why twenty-one cents ? Because , Roosevelt would reply , twenty-one is seven times three , and three is a lucky number . " If anyone knew how we set the gold price , " wrote Morgenthau in his diary , " they would be frightened . " Because for so long we approved of the direction of Roosevelt 's monetary policy , we forgot to ask whether his discretion mattered . It did . When Roosevelt undertook the gold experiment , the Roosevelt rally halted in its tracks . <p> What about our other received ideas , such as faith in the notion that cleaning up Wall Street was a net benefit ? When you look at the period , you see that the actions that the White House , the Justice Department , and the SEC took against Wall Street did , on balance , more damage than good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . They did n't just talk about money-changers ; they slammed the wealthy as " princes of property . " In 1937 , after his landslide reelection , Roosevelt delivered an inaugural address that presidential adviser Larry Summers would never let President Obama put up on the teleprompter . Roosevelt said that in government , we seek an instrument of " unimagined power " to fashion a higher order of things . This caused businesses to freeze in their tracks . Companies went on what Roosevelt 's crowd resentfully termed a " strike of capital . " <p> The capital strikers mattered because they were as important , perhaps even more important , to recovery as the Schechter types . They are the ones who play to kill , who aim to clean up at the Monopoly board . Alfred Lee Loomis of Tuxedo Park , New York , was an example of this spirit . Loomis had the kind of mind that contributes significantly to GDP . During World War I , he had improved the design of firearms for the U.S. Army . In the 1920s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was developing a new form of utility company that might finally be able to marshal the capital necessary to light up the American South . But when Loomis saw that the new administration was hauling utilities executives down to Washington for hearings , he shut down his business and retreated to his Tudor house to run a kind of private think tank for his own benefit . <p> What 's interesting is that it did n't take a big audit or an indictment to make Loomis absent himself . All it took was a suggestion of diminished return " less property . And the suggestion that he might have to show up at a hearing . That was enough to make him deprive the economy of his talent . In other words , all these years we have heard about a labor surfeit during the Depression ; but one can make the counterargument that there actually was a shortage of talent in the 1930s . <p> Taxes posed another challenge to the economy . A review suggests that the New Deal tax increases were n't worth whatever socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they did damage by simply taking away too much property from citizens and companies . So as the years wore on , businesses no longer saw a need to proceed . In the later 1930s , a banker , Leonard Ayres of the Cleveland Trust Company , pointed out in the New York Times that " for nearly a decade now the great majority of corporations have been losing money instead of making it . " 4 <p> In October 1937 , the New York Times reported a speech by W. O'Neil , president of General Tire and Rubber Company , that captured the mood . " The very large capitalist is on a strike because he is faced with an 80 percent tax on his profits on stocks , which is not subject to deduction for subsequent losses , " said O'Neil . The small-time capitalist , he added , " is on strike , too . He will not build the house that he needs , and there are many thousands like him in the United States . " 5 <p> Regarding big labor , what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it , but the Wagner Act of 1935 was a tiger of a law . The Taft-Hartley Act , the edited version that came after World War II , was a pussycat by comparison . The 1935 act suggested the possibility of terrifying changes at factories . One was the closed shop " nonunion members need not apply . The other was the sit-down strike , literally a threat to the basic property right of factory owners : the right to close their doors when they felt like it . <p> The Wagner Act gave unions the related power to demand higher wages . And they did . If you look at a chart of wages in the twentieth century , you will see something counterintuitive : real wages in the 1930s were actually higher than in the rest of the century . This is a perverse phenomenon in a period when the economy was so down . The result was good jobs for a few and high unemployment for the rest . Some of the economic work on this has been done by two scholars : Lee Ohanian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the reality of overpriced labor is evident in the phrases aboutthe Great Depression that we grew up with : " It was all right if you had a job " ; " Nice work if you can get it . " <p> " Nice work " was actually the refrain of a song from a 1937 Fred Astaire film released at the zenith of union power . Recoveries make a choice . This recovery chose to stay away . So went 1936 , 1937 , 1938 , 1939 " as the decade wore on , the rally of the early years fizzled . <p> In short , the problem with the great game board of the 1930s was not that there was no bank . It was that there was too much bank , in the form of the federal government . The bank was worse than " not too bad . " The bank was terrible . It fooled around with the money . It was too aggressive . It was arbitrary . It took advantage of its bank status to make itself the most powerful player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolize . <p> Benjamin Anderson , at the time an economist with the Chase National Bank , summed up his book about the period thusly : " Preceding chapters have explained the great depression of 1930 " 1939 as due to the efforts of the governments , and very especially the Government of the United States , to play God . " 6 <p> It is not hard to see some of today 's troubles as repeats of the errors made during the 1930s , from the arrogance up top to the idea that we can fashion a useful reform " in the current instance , a health-insurance reform " if only we can craft the details of that reform correctly . Now , as then , we have a federal government that is dilettantish with money " think of both the Bush and Obama dollar policies . Finally , our current government recalls the government of the 1930s in its disregard for other involved parties , whom it views , in those words of Raymond Moley , merely as " misty principals . " <p> Property rights are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways these days . We can say that the mortgage crisis was brought about by a lengthy erosion of property rights , first by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , but also by the Federal Reserve . Expanding upon theories espoused by FDR , Congress taught the country that homeownership was an entitlement . This fostered a misunderstanding of what property actually is . Homeowners did n't realize what ownership entailed , that is , exactly what the terms of their mortgage contracts obligated them to deliver . In our bipartisan enthusiasm for making everyone an owner , we debased the concept of homeownership . And we continue to debase it " through cramdowns , for example . <p> Next , property rights are endangered by the general assault on contracts . The proximate example of this is the disregard for creditor rights in the rescue packages for big automakers . The current administration made a political decision to subordinate the bondholders ' contracts to union demands . In not following precedent and emphasizing the cleverness of their own bankruptcy architecture , the framers of the Chrysler deal forgot one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expected return makes credit dearer next time around " or scarcely available at all . The signal for the future : U.S. bonds are not trustworthy . <p> Three other threats to property rights loom . One is tax increases . When we talk of confiscatory taxes , we are saying something vague , but what matters is the literal meaning : more taxes means less property . <p> Abuse of eminent-domain powers is the second looming threat to property rights . The next stimulus law is likely to emphasize infrastructure " railroads , roads for automobiles " and because of what has become known as the Kelo case , and cases like it , the federal government will have enormous license to use eminent domain to claim property . We can think of other erosions " intellectual property that will be lost in the formularies of the federal government that favor generic drugs . <p> Then there is inflation : the third , and perhaps the greatest , threat to property rights . Inflation is the ultimate confiscation . <p> This relentless emphasis on property rights may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need to talk about property rights , since they are taken for granted . No one ever said that property rights were n't important . The problem is , we simply did n't put them first . Saying " property rights " sounds selfish . It has been easier to say " social equity , " " ownership society , " or " rule of law " and to let property rights become an afterthought , a given . <p> But the experience of the Great Depression suggests that the protection of property rights is crucial to recoveries and that their erosion precludes recoveries . That 's why the board-game analogy is worthwhile . The board game reminds us that economic growth is n't merely about animal spirits . It is about the impulse of the small man , and the entrepreneur along with him , to start again . As the Times said so long ago , what matters is " real estate . " 7 The moment has come for all of us to devote resources to the defense of property rights . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event named after Friedrich August von Hayek . The federal incursion here and now is certainly no greater than what Britain saw with the nationalizations of Clement Attlee and his Labour Party in the 1940s . And it is important to remember that on this subject , Hayek was wrong . England did not become a dictatorship . It became more open , and eventually it got Margaret Thatcher . As for the United States , we do n't need a perfect government or a perfect economy . We do n't need a perfect bank . We just need one that is " not too bad . " Then individual players will come back . The main thing to remember is that recovery does n't happen because of a reform from the top . It happens down here on the board , one hotel at a time . <h> MEDIA CONTACT <h> Hayek Lecture and Book Prize <p> Political philosopher and Nobel laureate F. A.

Go to any police-community meeting in an urban area , and you will invariably hear some variant on the following requests : " We want the dealers off the corner . " " There are kids hanging out on my stoop . Why ca n't you arrest them for loitering ? " " I smell weed in my hallway . Ca n't you do something ? " <p> The irony is that the police can not respond to these heartfelt requests for order without generating the racially disproportionate statistics that will be used against them in an American Civil Liberties Union or Justice Department lawsuit . <p> By all means , we must do everything we can to make sure that police departments use force only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime rates are so disproportionate , policing will be more intense in minority neighborhoods , increasing the chances that when an encounter goes awry , it will have a minority victim . <p> Nevertheless , proactive policing is the best government program yet devised to regenerate troubled urban neighborhoods and free their law-abiding residents from the thrall of fear and disorder .

Of course , raising taxes on any industry creates economic distortions . Higher oil and gas industry taxes means less investment in the industry and fewer employment opportunities for workers in the industry . Moreover , higher oil and gas taxes are passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices . Consumers suffer many times when oil and gas prices rise both through their direct purchases of oil and gas and indirectly through higher prices for goods that depend on energy . <p> But there is yet another rarely considered cost to higher taxes on the oil and gas industry : the reduced value of retirement accounts for Americans . As it turns out , oil and gas companies , like most large American corporations , are not owned by a few wealthy individuals . Instead , they are owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their retirement savings . Contrary to popular belief , only about one percent of the shares of the five major oil companies are held by officers and directors of these companies . The rest is held by institutional investors and individual Americans , mostly in retirement accounts . <p> Raising taxes on oil companies would hurt Americans who benefit from oil companies stocks in their retirement portfolios . In the State of New York , for example , oil and gas investments in the two largest pension plans , the State Employees ' Retirement System and the Public School Employees ' Retirement System contributed 21 percent of the funds ' return . Higher taxes on oil and gas companies would hurt New York+GGs taxpayers , who would have to put more into the funds to make up for their lower returns . <p> Even so , the Obama administration proposed raising taxes on domestic oil and gas producers in its fiscal 2013 budget . Such taxes would , if approved by Congress , harm the economic performance of the industry and encourage investment overseas . Moreover , such new taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . <p> Oil and natural gas companies represent a small proportion of total investments in retirement accounts , yet account for a larger share of the return on these investments . Raising taxes on oil and gas would reduce the return on investment , and the returns to these retirement funds . In pension funds in the State of New York , for example , oil and natural gas companies represented 3.8 percent of assets , yet were responsible for 9.3 percent of returns . The same pattern holds true in other states .

Molecular biomarkers are the foundation of this approach . Many doctors " notably , oncologists " routinely prescribe drugs in ways that best fit each patient " biomarker profile . The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , however , has been slow to incorporate biomarkers into the regulatory procedures for drug approval and , as a result , has significantly slowed the development of safe and effective treatments for many diseases . <p> Realizing the full potential that biomarkers offer to revolutionize modern medicine will require substantive and clear regulatory standards , now lacking , for incorporating biomarkers into the drug-approval process , as well as a more transparent , predictable , and timely FDA process for reviewing biomarker submissions . <p> 1 . The Importance of Biomarkers for Drug Development and Approval <p> Biochemists rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design targeted drugs to block or control them . Doctors then prescribe the drugs to specific subgroups of patients who have the biomarkers in question ( **26;0;TOOLONG breast cancer , for instance ) . Other biomarkers can be used to track whether a disease is advancing or retreating at every stage of its development , thus providing early indications of how well a drug is performing . Changes in biomarker status ( such as lowering blood sugar in a diabetic patient ) that can provide rapid , reliable evidence of efficacy also have the potential to greatly accelerate the FDA 's drug-approval process . <p> Modern diagnostic tools have revealed that what used to be viewed as a single disease is quite often caused by biomarkers that vary significantly across patients ; different groups of patients therefore respond differently to the same drug . Researchers are assembling large databases and using powerful computers to link arrays of different biomarker profiles to the same clinically defined diseases . These findings can then lead to the design of multiple different drugs to address them . <p> Biomarker science also sets the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease-causing molecular pathways before clinical symptoms develop . The potential benefits are enormous . For example , according to one estimate , a drug that would delay the onset of Alzheimer 's by five years would save about $367 billion in direct health costs by 2050 while likely extending the life span of millions of patients . <p> Precision medicine is the future of medicine . But it is also the antithesis of the FDA 's long-standing one-size-fits-all drugapproval process . Top officials at the FDA have publicly acknowledged this for over a decade , but the agency has been very slow to develop consistent and transparent standards for using biomarkers in drug trials . The absence of such standards has sharply reduced industry incentives to make the large investments needed to develop new targeted drugs or seek formal approval of new uses for existing drugs . Meanwhile , countries such as the U.K. are preparing to completely revamp their drug-approval protocols to develop and use biomarker science during the drug-approval process and approve associated precision-medicine treatment protocols . By offering companies a faster , more certain , path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R&amp;D dollars and jobs out of the U.S. and onto their own shores . <p> Incorporating the most recent advances in biomarker science into the drug-approval framework will significantly accelerate the development of new therapeutic options and their delivery to patients suffering from serious , currently untreatable , disorders . It will also lower the overall cost of developing new treatments and significantly lower health care costs by allowing us to detect , treat , or prevent the development of chronic ailments much more effectively than is currently possible . <p> 2 . The FDA 's History of Crowd-Science Medicine <p> For more than a decade , the FDA has been saying the right things about biomarkers but has been very slow to act . In 2004 , the FDA 's Critical Path Initiative report identified biomarker development as a top priority . Dr. Janet Woodcock , currently head of the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , noted that " biomarkers are the foundation of evidence-based medicine " who should be treated , how , and with what . " Outcomes happen to people , not populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advent of targeted therapies and personalized medicine , Dr. Woodcock declared : " We are going to have to change the way drugs are developed . Period , " adding that the agency must " turn the clinical trial paradigm on its head . " <p> But the traditional paradigm is still standing . Under that regime , which emerged in the 1960s , a new drug is approved only if its efficacy has been established by " substantial evidence " grounded in " adequate and well-controlled " clinical trials . Its safety must also be established , though there is no express statutory standard for what kind of evidence is required . In practice , both standards are generally understood to apply only " under the conditions of use prescribed , recommended , or suggested in the labeling thereof . " No drug gets approved without a label , and the label is where the FDA , in effect , approves future users . <p> That approval ca n't be well-informed , however , without an understanding of the relevant details of the patient-side chemistry . Variations in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For most of the last 50 years , however , the FDA has required that a new drug 's efficacy be demonstrated by prescribing it in a standard way to a group of patients large enough to provide a statistically robust , one-dimensional correlation with a desired change in a clinical condition . Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trials , dating back to the 1930s and 1940s , are still often called the " gold standard " for modern drug testing . <p> But those protocols lead to what can , at best , be called crowd-science medicine " though , anchored as they are in empirical correlations , they are almost all crowd and very little science . They assume broad areas of biochemical uniformity among patients , where we now know that there is significant variation . They steer medicine relentlessly toward one-size-fits-all drugs for hypothetical one-size patients . <p> Tested in large groups of patients selected indiscriminately , many drugs that could help subsets of patients will fail to win approval because the FDA ca n't tolerate the uncertainty that its own policies sustain . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a long time to surface , these trials are often very slow to reach any conclusion at all . <p> The FDA 's " Accelerated Approval " rule , developed in the late 1980s and codified by Congress in 1997 , already provides the regulatory framework in which the FDA can , in principle " though very rarely in current practice " allow molecular biomarkers to be used to speed the evaluation process . The rule hinges on the use of " surrogate " endpoints that the FDA deems to be " reasonably likely " to predict clinical outcomes . The acceptance of surrogate endpoints allows the agency to make a first call about the drug 's efficacy without waiting for clinical effects to surface and persist for some ( often arbitrary ) period of time . The manufacturer must still complete studies that last long enough to confirm the drug 's clinical effects but does so after the drug has been conditionally approved . The drug may be withdrawn from the market if things do n't pan out . But here , too , the FDA has declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead on an ad hoc " and , therefore , unpredictable " case-by-case analysis . <p> 3 . A Bystander in the Biomarker Revolution <p> These policies have left the FDA as a bystander to much of the ongoing revolution in molecular medicine . Molecular biomarker science is now being used at every other stage of the drug-development process and in many areas of medical practice . Ironically , much of the expertise about biomarkers can be found in the federal government itself " specifically , at the NIH , which long ago expressed its eagerness to help the FDA incorporate biomarkers into its approval process . <p> The NIH , professional medical associations , and others are fast acquiring the scientific tools and resources to track the molecular mechanics of diseases from the bottom up . In so doing , they are steadily improving medicine 's ability to make an accurate prognosis of how an untreated disease is likely to progress inside an individual patient . The same body of science can lead to precise , objective criteria that define the molecular-level tasks that we want drugs to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when a drug causes significant changes in a disease 's progress . The tools that make it possible to acquire the molecular data needed to develop this body of science continue to improve rapidly . As they come to be more widely used , their costs will continue to drop . The same is true for the power and cost of the computers and software needed to assemble and analyze the massive amounts of complex data that such tools generate . <p> Vast amounts of such data are already being collected and analyzed by drug companies , medical specialists , and research centers . The costs are being covered by drug companies , philanthropists , private and public health-insurance programs , and taxpayers who fund the NIH and other research institutions . Collectively , the costs undoubtedly dwarf the FDA 's budget ; these programs also generate far more complex data than the FDA has the in-house expertise and computational tools to handle . <p> The Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) " the independent , nonprofit health arm of the National Academy of Sciences " specializes in developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IOM released a workshop report that recommended that " the FDA adopt a consistent scientific framework for biomarker evaluation in order to achieve a rigorous and transparent process . " <p> But clear substantive standards for the collection and analysis of data for biomarker validation at the FDA ( the biomarker " qualification " process in the FDA 's regulatory jargon ) remain conspicuous by their absence . Drug companies and doctors already have strong incentives to develop biomarker science . But the most powerful economic incentive for standardizing , pooling , and analyzing biomarker data is the prospect that the results can be used to frame clinical trials in ways that make it more likely that a drug will perform well and , in some circumstances , substantially shorten the time required for FDA approval . <p> 4 . The Path to Reform <p> In part , the FDA has been marginalized in this area because of its regulatory role . Many of the major players involved in the pooling and analysis of molecular data do n't directly interact with the agency , which faces sharp limits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other experts outside the context of specific product applications . These constraints have limited the FDA 's ability to keep pace with new advances . The NIH , by contrast , has a history of close collaboration with clinicians , medical research centers , professional medical societies , doctors , and patients , and NIH-funded research is often the starting point for uncovering and using newly discovered biomarkers . <p> To get things moving , Congress should create a framework for expert panels , convened under the auspices of the NIH and the IOM , to develop substantive standards for the use of biomarkers in the drug-approval process . Separate expert panels should be convened to develop standards that address the statistical tools needed to analyze biomarker data . <p> The FDA would be a partner in this process throughout , but the panels would be directed to frame standards that reflect the consensus views of the scientific community " and the standard-setting process should be dynamic and flexible enough to incorporate innovative approaches going forward . That said , the FDA would retain final authority in the drug-approval process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with how much confidence , about the relevant biomarkers and surrogate endpoints used in clinical trials , a drug 's safety and efficacy as established in those trials , the seriousness of the disease , and the availability of other therapies . <p> The objective of the reform effort should be to anchor the FDA-approval process in the best available molecular biology , speed up regulatory decision making , and ensure that the FDA 's review of biomarker submissions is based on a transparent , predictable , and efficient approach .

Many public-sector employers have recently considered placing new employees in a DC plan ; but only two states , Michigan and Alaska , as well as a handful of cities , currently use a DC plan as the primary retirement savings vehicle for new employees . When state and local governments have considered adopting a DC plan for new employees , they have encountered significant opposition from organized labor , managers of current public-retirement systems , and the cottage industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of DC plans argue that DB plans are more cost-effective because the latter deliver higher investment returns and convert retirement savings into annuities .

The limited availability of annuities among private-sector DC plans is largely the result of misguided federal regulation discouraging their provision . Nevertheless , a number of private-sector firms provide annuities under their DC plans . And most public-sector employers " which do not face regulation hostile to annuities " provide annuities at favorable prices under their DC plans . <p> Pension debt is a significant cost driver for DB plans .

This study evaluates the impact of enhanced job-readiness training and job-search assistance on reducing recidivism rates among ex-offenders . <p> Programs offering enhanced job assistance are far from the norm . The program used in this study " developed by an employment agency that assists ex-offenders , welfare recipients , and other " hard-to-serve " clients " differs from other job services in scope and focus . <p> The program , America Works , is condensed into an intense one- or two-week period . It uses a tough-love approach , stressing interpersonal communication and such " soft " skills as time and anger management . It places special attention on teaching practical skills that many former inmates never acquired , such as resume preparation , search strategies , and interview techniques . And it uses a network of employers , who are open to hiring ex-offenders and with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is not only to help former inmates find jobs but also to keep jobs , and it provides follow-up services for six months . In 2005 , the program provided job-readiness classes to 1,000 ex-offenders , placing 700 in jobs . <p> America Works receives referrals from agencies in New York City , including the city government 's Human Resources Administration ( HRA ) , work-release centers , and the city 's Rikers Island Correctional Facility . By contrast , typical services offered to ex-offenders provide far less job-readiness training over a less concentrated period . Instead of providing placement services , such programs generally limit assistance to self-directed job searches . <p> This paper 's key finding is that training designed to quickly place former inmates in jobs significantly decreases the likelihood that ex-offenders with nonviolent histories will be rearrested . Only 31.1 percent of nonviolent ex-offenders who received enhanced training were arrested during the 18 to 36 months in which they were tracked , compared with 50 percent of similar participants who received standard training . In contrast , former inmates with histories of violence were rearrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training or not : 44.6 percent versus 42.6 percent , respectively . Findings for criminal convictions show similar patterns for arrests . These results suggest that extra help in looking for work upon release from jail or prison can pay off in a big way but not for all types of former offenders . Enhanced assistance is most effective for those without a history of violence and with few prior charges " while the additional help is far less effective for those with a more difficult history , including violence or many prior charges . <p> Very little research has been conducted on this topic . The results of this study have important implications for government policymakers , public and private social welfare agencies , and , of course , employers . Indeed , at a time of ever-tightening federal and state budgets and ever-rising costs of incarceration , the Obama administration and many state governments are seeking ways to reduce swollen prison populations , particularly the number of nonviolent criminals , partly by using new guidelines for early release . Likewise , many states are scrambling to find programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inmates nevertheless face formidable hurdles in securing employment following release back into society . Often lacking skills to find a job , they typically receive little help , increasing the odds , especially in a still-weak economy , that they will come up empty " and revert to a life of crime and return , eventually , to prison . <p> By linking enhanced training to a targeted group of ex-offenders , this study points toward a breakthrough in reducing not only the rate of recidivism but also the cost to society . The program used by America Works , which has offices in New York and six other states and the District of Columbia , costs about $5,000 for each former inmate . While the benefits to society from averted crimes are very hard to calculate in dollar terms , the study estimated average savings of about $231,000 for each nonviolent ex-offender who received extra help , based on the lower crime record posted by the group as a whole , following training . This figure represents a 46-fold return on the cost of the training , not counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities . <p> The intervention of enhanced services was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 , with a randomized trial involving 259 ex-offenders in New York . Participants , all men , had been released from a prison , jail , or youth correctional facility within six months of acceptance into the program . Approximately half of the participants received enhanced employment services from America Works while the other half received typical services , also provided by America Works . Criminal recidivism for 219 ex-offenders was measured from administrative records in July 2012 , tracking arrests and convictions of participants in six-month intervals from the point they joined the study for up to 36 months . <p> Enhanced services had no significant impact on recidivism for the group as a whole . Yet that result masked significant differences among varied segments that formed the group . As previously noted , former inmates with histories of violence were little affected by the extra help while those with nonviolent histories benefited substantially . Even within the latter group , however , significant differences appeared , offering additional clues about where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services had the largest impact among nonviolent criminals with the fewest prior charges . Differences were also found among the three subsets of nonviolent offenders : those who had committed offenses involving property , those who had committed crimes involving the sale or possession of drugs , and those who had been involved in minor offenses . Ex-offenders with property crimes and those with minor offenses were found to be most responsible for positive recidivism results . The subset with a history of drug crimes appeared to have no significant impact on recidivism results . Given the small samples , however , caution must be used when interpreting such results . <p> Collectively , these results suggest that enhanced job-search assistance is most effective for the easiest of the hard-to-serve population " and that focusing future efforts on this group is the most cost-effective approach .

According to the state 's school district profile , the median teacher in the city earns $53,017 a year . Unfortunately , information on the number of hours worked by the average teacher in the City is not readily available . But , if we make the generous assumption that the average teacher in New York works the maximum 6.6 hours a day allowed by the union contract for the full 181 school days , that works out to $44.38 an hour . <p> So , if teachers are underpaid , then workers in other professions are badly underpaid , too . But there 's no clamor to raise the pay of computer scientists , dentists or engineers . <p> But do n't teachers spend a great deal of time grading papers and creating lesson plans while away from school ? Some do - but the comparisons here are still fair - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .

Many of these costs are effectively on " autopilot " : They are locked in place by law or by union contract , and lawmakers neither control nor review them . In Washington State , for example , 55-60 percent of the budget goes to pay the salaries and benefits of the state 's employees , so more than half of the state budget is off limits to policymakers . <p> As more and more of a government budget is devoted to employee pensions and health care , lawmakers must ( a ) raise taxes , or ( b ) engage in dangerous fiscal gimmickry , or ( c ) take on more debt , or ( d ) or spend less on schools , roads , public transport , libraries , assistance for the poor , and other functions . Troublingly , many governments are choosing option ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more to do less and less . <p> In this paper , we detail how spending on public-employee pensions and health care is crowding out essential government services in states , cities , and other local-government jurisdictions . <p> Because of local governments ' pension and health-care commitments , we report : <p> The cost to local government of employing a worker has soared .

A sanitation worker in New York City now costs $144,000 annually , up from $79,000 a decade ago . <p> Governments are spending a rapidly growing percentage of precious revenue on pensions alone . For example , in 2013 , according to New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg , " every penny in personal income tax we collect will go to cover our pension bill . " Since 2005 , the city 's spending on pensions rose from 6.1 percent of the budget to 11.7 percent . In Los Angeles , pension costs were 3 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 percent . <p> The most common response to rising pension and health-care costs is to cut services . Chicago , for example , is in the process of closing 11 percent of its schools . In Des Moines , Iowa , the library is now closed one day a week , trash in the parks is picked up less often and streets are cleaned less frequently , due to a rise in police and fire pension costs of 20 percent . Despite these cuts , Des Moines has instituted a property tax increase . <p> Pensions are not the only concern . Most local governments lack any long-term strategy for funding their health-carecommitments to employees . As of 2009 , the 61 American cities with a population greater than 500,000 collectively had $118 billion in liabilities for employee and retiree health care , and had only set aside enough money to cover 6 percent of this . Meanwhile , U.S. states ' health care liabilities increased by $22 billion ( 4 percent ) in just one year ( 2009 " 10 ) .

A dramatic increase in the federal minimum wage " to $15 or even $12 per hour " would replace a system that tailors policy to local conditions with a system that imposes a single standard from America 's most prosperous cities on less affluent areas that can ill afford it . <h> Key Findings <p> The ratio of the minimum wage to the median wage in the U.S. " based on the controlling federal , state , and local minimums " is 0.47 : this ratio aligns closely with the standard 0.5 benchmark and places the U.S. above the 0.46 average for comparable advanced , market-based economies . <p> The 13 states with the highest median wage all have a minimum wage at least one dollar above the federal minimum . <p> Relative to their median wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places like El Paso and Myrtle Beach " where the median wage level is less than $13 per hour " would be the equivalent of imposing a minimum wage of $30 per hour in Washington , D.C. , or Silicon Valley .

Under mayor Bill de Blasio , New York has joined the swelling ranks of U.S. cities that have made it harder to sanction unruly students . <p> Critics of such " discipline reform " point to a growing body of data and anecdotes that suggest that reducing the threat of suspension is making schools less orderly and safe .

Entrenched , multigenerational poverty is largely black ; and <p> 2 . It is intricately intertwined with the collapse of the nuclear family in the inner city . <p> By now , these facts should n't be hard to grasp . Almost 70 percent of black children are born to single mothers . Those mothers are far more likely than married mothers to be poor , even after a post-welfare-reform decline in child poverty . They are also more likely to pass that poverty on to their children . Single motherhood is a largely low-income and disproportionately black problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-family nation , separate and unequal - one thriving and intact , and the other struggling , broken and far too often African-American . <p> So why does The Times , like so many who rail against inequality , fall silent on the relation between poverty and single-parent families ? To answer that question - and to continue the confrontation with facts that Americans still prefer not to mention in polite company - you have to go back exactly 40 years . That was when a resounding cry of outrage echoed throughout Washington and the civil rights movement in reaction to Daniel Patrick Moynihan 's Department of Labor report warning that the ghetto family was in disarray . <p> Titled " The Negro Family : The Case for National Action , " the prophetic report prompted civil rights leaders , academics , politicians and pundits to make a momentous - and , as time has shown , tragically wrong - decision about how to frame the national discussion about poverty . <p> To go back to the political and social moment before the battle broke out over the Moynihan report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of black poverty had hardened into fixed orthodoxies - before phrases like " blaming the victim , " " self-esteem , " " out-of-wedlock childbearing " and " teen pregnancy . " While solving the black poverty problem seemed an immense political challenge , as a conceptual matter , it did n't seem like rocket science . Most analysts assumed that once the nation removed discriminatory legal barriers and expanded employment opportunities , blacks would advance , just as poor immigrants had . <p> Conditions for testing that proposition looked good . Between the 1954 Brown decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , legal racism had been dismantled . And the economy was humming along ; in the first five years of the ' 60s , the economy generated 7 million jobs . <p> Yet those most familiar with what was called " the Negro problem " were getting nervous . About half of all blacks had moved into the middle class by the mid- ' 60s , but now progress seemed to be stalling . The rise in black income relative to that of whites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt . <p> Policymakers had assumed that if male heads of household had jobs , women and children would be provided for . This no longer seemed true . Even while more black men were getting jobs , more black women were joining the welfare rolls . Mr. Moynihan , then assistant secretary of labor , decided that a serious analysis was in order . <p> Mr. Moynihan argued that the rise in single-mother families was not due to a lack of jobs , but rather to a destructive vein in ghetto culture that could be traced back to slavery and Jim Crow discrimination . Though black sociologist E. Franklin Frazier had already introduced the idea in the 1930s , Mr. Moynihan 's argument defied conventional social-science wisdom . <p> He also described the emergence of a " tangle of pathology , " including delinquency , joblessness , school failure , crime and fatherlessness that characterized ghetto - or what would come to be called underclass - behavior . Mr. Moynihan knew the dangers these threats posed to " the basic socializing unit " of the family , because more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . They " shape their children 's character and ability , " he wrote . " By and large , adult conduct in society is learned as a child . " What children learned in the " disorganized homes " of the ghetto , as he described through his forest of graphs , was that adults do not finish school , get jobs or , in the case of men , take care of their children or obey the law . Marriage , on the other hand , provides a " stable home " for children to learn common virtues . <p> Implicit in Mr. Moynihan 's analysis was that marriage orients men and women toward the future , asking them not just to commit to each other but to plan , to earn , to save and to devote themselves to advancing their children 's prospects . Single mothers in the ghetto , on the other hand , tended to drift into pregnancy and to float through the chaos around them . Such mothers are unlikely to " shape their children 's character and ability " in ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , in other words , meant that blacks would have their liberty , but that they would be strangers to equality . Hence , Mr. Moynihan 's conclusion : " A national effort toward the problems of Negro Americans must be directed toward the question of family structure . " <p> Despite President Lyndon B. Johnson 's endorsement , by that summer the Moynihan report was under attack from all sides . Civil servants in the " permanent government " at Health , Education and Welfare and at the Children 's Bureau muttered about the report 's " subtle racism . " Black leaders like Congress of Racial Equality director Floyd McKissick scolded that , rather than the family , " It 's the damn system that needs changing . " <p> Given the fresh wounds of segregation and the ugly tenaciousness of racism , the fear of white backsliding that one can hear in so many of Mr. Moynihan 's critics is entirely understandable . Less forgivable was the refusal to grapple seriously - either at the time or in the months , years , even decades to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report : that ghetto families were at risk of raising generations of children unable to seize the opportunity that the civil rights movement had opened up for them . <p> Most memorably , the black activist William Ryan accused Mr. Moynihan of " blaming the victim , " a phrase that would become the title of his 1971 book and the fear-inducing censor of future plain speaking about the ghetto 's decay . For white liberals and the black establishment , poverty became a zero-sum game : either you believed , as they did , that there was a defect in the system , or you believed that there was a defect in the individual . It was as if critiquing the family meant that you supported inferior schools , even that you were a racist . <p> Over the next 15 years , the black family question actually became a growth industry inside academe , the foundations and the government . Scholars invented a fantasy family whose function was not to reflect truth , but to soothe injured black self-esteem and to bolster the emerging feminist critique of male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , some scholars continued , maybe the nuclear family was just a toxic white hang-up , anyway . No one asked what nuclear families did or how they prepared children for a modern economy . The important point was simply that they were not black . <p> Feminists , similarly fixated on overturning the " oppressive ideal of the nuclear family , " also welcomed this dubious scholarship . Fretting about single-parent families was now not only racist , but also sexist , an effort to deny women their independence , their sexuality or both . As for the poverty of single mothers , that was simply more proof of patriarchal oppression . <p> The partisans of single motherhood got a perfect chance to test their theories , since the urban ghettos were fast turning into nuclear-family-free zones . Indeed , by 1980 , 15 years after " The Negro Family , " the out-of-wedlock birthrate among blacks had more than doubled , to 56 percent . In the ghetto , that number was considerably higher , as high as 66 percent in New York City . <p> Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family collapse while still addressing its increasingly alarming fallout . The first was to talk about children not as the offspring of individual mothers and fathers responsible for rearing them , but as an oppressed class in need of government programs . The second way was to talk instead about the epidemic of teen pregnancy . <p> There was just one small problem : There was no epidemic of teen pregnancy . There was an out-of-wedlock teen-pregnancy epidemic . Teenagers had gotten pregnant at even higher rates in the past . Back in the day , however , when they found out they were pregnant , girls had either gotten married or given their babies up for adoption . <p> Not this generation . They were used to seeing children growing up without fathers , and they felt no shame about arriving at the maternity ward with no rings on their fingers , even at 15 . <p> Failing to define the problem accurately , advocates were in no position to find the solution . Teen pregnancy not only failed to go down , despite all the public attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills that were thrown its way , but it actually went up . About 80 percent of those young girls who became mothers were single , and the vast majority would be poor . <p> Throughout the 1980s , the inner city continued to unravel . Child poverty stayed close to 20 percent , hitting a high of 22.7 percent in 1993 . Welfare dependency continued to rise , soaring from 2 million families in 1970 to 5 million by 1995 . By 1990 , 65 percent of all black children were being born to unmarried women . By this point , no one doubted that most of these children were destined to grow up poor and to pass down the legacy of single parenting . <p> The only good news was that the bad news was so unrelentingly bad that the usual bromides and evasions could no longer hold . Something had to shake up what amounted to an ideological paralysis , and that something came from conservatives . Three thinkers in particular - Charles Murray , Lawrence Mead and Thomas Sowell - though they did not always write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . <p> First , they did not flinch from blunt language in describing the wreckage of the inner city . Second , they pointed at the welfare policies of the 1960s as the cause of inner-city dysfunction , and in so doing , they made the welfare mother the public symbol of the ghetto 's ills . And third , they believed that the poor would have to change their behavior instead of waiting for Washington to end poverty . <p> By the early 1990s , when the ghetto was at its nadir , public opinion had clearly turned . No one was more attuned to this shift than triangulator Bill Clinton , who made the family a centerpiece of his domestic policy and signed a welfare-reform bill that he had twice vetoed - one that included among its goals increasing the number of children living with their two married parents . <p> So , have we reached the end of the Moynihan report saga ? That would be vastly overstating matters . Remember : 70 percent of black children are still born to unmarried mothers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all races and classes can not bring themselves to admit that marriage protects children . <p> Still , the nation is at a cultural inflection point that portends change . Though they always caution that " marriage is not a panacea , " social scientists almost uniformly accept the research that confirms the benefits for children growing up with their own married parents . Welfare reform and tougher child-support regulations have reinforced the message of personal responsibility . There are raw numbers to support the case for optimism : Teen pregnancy , which started to decline in the mid- ' 90s in response to a crisper , **28;97;TOOLONG cultural message , is at its lowest rate ever . <p> And finally , in the ghetto itself , there is a growing feeling that mother-only families do n't work . <p> That 's why people are lining up to see an aging comedian as he voices some not-very-funny opinions about parenting . <p> That 's why so many young men are vowing to be the fathers they never had . <p> That 's why there has been an uptick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their married parents .

Immigrants from Mexico , Guatemala , and El Salvador experienced at most little improvement , while progress for those from Asia and more-developed nations was unmistakable . <p> Assimilation improved rapidly in the nation 's two most common destination cities " Los Angeles and New York " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dallas-Fort Worth , which are also recipients of large numbers of immigrants . <p> Tracking the progress of immigrant cohorts over periods of up to three decades reveals other important trends : <p> Upon arrival , the most recent immigrants are significantly more assimilated along cultural and civic lines than their counterparts of a decade ago . <p> The halt in economic progress has affected recent and long-term immigrants alike . <p> Recent immigrants with strong cultural differences from the mainstream are the ones most likely to have responded to the recession by leaving the country . <p> International comparisons make use of data on rates of assimilation of immigrants to the following countries : Austria , Canada , France , Greece , Italy , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , and the United States . Comparison of nine of these countries ( excluding the Netherlands and the U.K. , which lack critical data elements ) in an international version of the assimilation index reveals a number of important findings : <p> On the whole , immigrants in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Portugal , where a large proportion of immigrants originated in former Portuguese-speaking colonies . <p> Immigrants from Canada rank first in terms of overall assimilation , largely as a consequence of their high rate of naturalization . <p> Easing the path to naturalization does not guarantee full integration into society . Immigrants in the Netherlands naturalize much more often than those in the United States but have significantly lower employment rates . <p> Breaking assimilation down still further , by both origin and destination , shows the United States to be ahead of most of Europe but behind Canada in a wide variety of categories . <p> Muslim immigrants , identified by data on religion in some nations and by country of birth in others , are most integrated in Canada , followed closely by the United States . <p> Muslim immigrants in Italy and Switzerland are much less assimilated than Mexican and Central American immigrants are in the United States . Muslim immigrants ' standing in Spain is roughly equal to the standing of Mexicans and Central Americans in the United States . <p> The United States ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for immigrants from China and Southeast Asia . Assimilation in the United States is ahead of all but one European country for immigrants from India and Eastern Europe . <p> Two facets of Canadian immigration policy may help explain the rapid integration of foreigners into Canadian society . First , the path to citizenship in Canada is short and easily traveled . Foreigners face a three-year residency requirement ( it is five for legal permanent residents in the United States and as many as twelve in some European countries ) , and the nation has taken a liberal stance toward dual citizenship since 1977 . Second , Canadian immigration policy places a distinct emphasis on attracting skilled migrants . Thirty percent of foreign-born adults in Canada have college degrees , while the rate is 23 percent in the United States and 10 percent in Spain and Italy . Educational attainment is not a factor in the international version of the assimilation index , but the link between immigrants ' level of education and their degree of assimilation is strong . <p> While these comparisons certainly raise the question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immigration policy , it is clear that the United States , compared to the other countries studied , is doing a good job of absorbing newcomers . Immigration is a global phenomenon , provoked largely by persistent gaps in living standards between rich and poor countries and facilitated by improvements in transportation and communication . The strains felt in European nations , which report their own problems with illegal immigration ( Italy and Spain ) and cultural integration ( Switzerland and France ) , appear upon close inspection to be more severe than those the United States has experienced .

The question is , how do we sort out the good teachers from the bad ? Winters shows the shortcomings of the current system , which relies on credentials and longevity , and spells out a series of reforms based on results achieved in the classroom .

Liberals have seized upon outlandishly improbable climate scenarios to urge drastic and immediate action . Former vice president Al Gore , a leading liberal voice on the subject , has compared global warming to " an asteroid colliding with the Earth and wreaking havoc . " " Our food systems , our cities , our people and our very way of life developed within a stable range of climatic conditions on Earth , " Gore has written . " Without immediate and decisive action , these favorable conditions on Earth could become a memory if we continue to make the climate crisis worse day after day after day . " <p> The truth is that the most authoritative , mainstream scientific predictions envision some serious , undesirable changes , but hardly the dystopia of Gore 's imagination . Yet , as liberals have yelled that the sky is falling , conservatives have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to the available facts . Liberal alarmism could be countered with arguments and with constructive policy alternatives to the administrative power grabs that the left prefers . Instead , for years those conservatives with access to the biggest megaphones have announced that the science underlying global warming is somewhere between highly speculative and " the greatest hoax , " to quote from the title of a book on the subject by Senator James Inhofe , a Republican with significant influence on climate matters . <p> Many more Republicans are uncomfortable making accusations of corruption and conspiracy against so much of the scientific community , but they too have struggled to sustain an untenable position . Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell , House speaker John Boehner , presidential candidates Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio , and rising star Senator Joni Ernst have all adopted the new talking point on the issue : " I 'm not a scientist . " This is an attempt to invoke ignorance in order to avoid embarrassment . <p> Scientific ignorance is not an excuse for refusing to stake out a position . Politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth building , on physicists to suggest which defense projects are most feasible , and on biologists to better understand the threat of Ebola or Swine Flu . There is no reason why climate change should be different . <p> Of course , there are always a few scientists who challenge this mainstream view . But too often politicians have chosen the side of the outlier scientist whose conclusion they like instead of the widely accepted view that might challenge their own preferences . Now and then scientific paradigms will be radically rethought by some inventive thinker , but politicians are not to be relied upon to figure out who is a Galileo and who is a quack . Where there is an almost universally held scientific conclusion , politicians " absent some extraordinary circumstance " should take it seriously . <p> The Republican position " either avowed ignorance or conspiracy theorizing " is ultimately unsustainable , but some still cling to it because they believe that accepting the premise that some climate change is occurring as a result of human action means accepting the conclusions of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicitly , that the politics of climate change is just a twisted road with a known destination : supporting new carbon taxes , a cap-and-trade system , or other statist means of energy rationing , and in the process ceding yet another key economic sector to government control . Conservatives seem to be on the horns of a dilemma : They will have to either continue to ignore real scientific findings or accept higher taxes , energy rationing , and increased regulation . <p> This kind of conundrum is not a new problem for conservatives . In his famous essay " Why I Am Not a Conservative , " written more than half a century ago , the great Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek pointed to exactly this " propensity to reject well-substantiated new knowledge because the conservative dislikes some of the consequences which seem to follow from it " as the most objectionable feature of conservatism . Yet in the same essay Hayek pointed to the resolution to this problem : " By refusing to face the facts , the conservative only weakens his own position . Frequently the conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all follow from them . " Hayek 's " rationalist " " akin to today 's progressive " sees the expansion of centralized state power as the eternal solution . Every new problem revealed by science , in the progressive view , can be solved by empowering expert administrators . The conservative 's response should be to embrace new scientific insights when they seem validated by available knowledge , while offering superior , market-based alternatives to the progressive 's favored solutions . <p> The truth is that the best approach to the problem of climate change is one rooted in deeply held conservative ideas . The right kind of approach will build on the tried policy of economic growth rather than the untried policy of carbon rationing and pricing schemes . It will recognize that society as a whole , working through its free institutions , is more adaptable and more inventive than regulators with limited imaginations tend to expect . It will seek to safeguard the future through the example of the past and the energies of the present . And it will be rooted in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLIMATE CHANGE First , we should acknowledge the science as we know it today . Greenhouse gases absorb and redirect longer-wavelength radiation , but not shorter-wavelength radiation . When radiation from the sun hits the earth , some of it is absorbed by the land and the sea , which are consequently warmed by the energy . As a result , when the earth re-emits the sun 's radiation in the form of heat , it is disproportionately of the lower-energy , longer-wavelength sort that the greenhouse gases , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) foremost among them , trap or send back to earth . Thus , more carbon-dioxide emissions lead to a hotter planet . How much hotter is a complicated question that has been the subject of intense scientific inquiry over the past several decades . The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has the task of integrating the best available knowledge on technical questions relating to climate change . The IPCC produces an Assessment Report every five to seven years that seeks to forecast climate change given fairly reasonable assumptions for world population and economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios for the 21st century . The fifth and most recent Assessment Report ( known as AR5 ) , published last year , projects that , without significant interventions to reduce emissions , global temperatures will rise on the order of two degrees Celsius by the end of the century in moderate emissions scenarios , and closer to four degrees in the most aggressive emissions scenarios . <p> Advocates for emissions controls , such as the Copenhagen Accord that the United States signed , often argue that scientific findings imply that we must keep the total global-temperature increase below two degrees Celsius in order to avoid disaster . So , it is argued , disaster looms unless we take decisive action . <p> Unfortunately for such advocates , the IPCC also estimates the economic impacts of various levels of warming . AR5 estimates that " global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of 2-C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income " " no one 's idea of economic disaster . The median estimate of the six studies cited by the report was that three to five degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross economic product ( the total gross domestic product of all the world 's nations ) at the end of the century . This is broadly consistent with the panel 's previous Assessment Report 4 of 2007 , which itself " confirmed " the results of Assessment Report 3 of 2001 . AR3 estimated that a four-degree increase in global temperatures should cause a reduction in global economic output of 1% to 5% . These estimates have been stable for more than a decade . <p> The key takeaway is this : According to the IPCC , the expected economic costs of global warming over a hundred years from now are likely to be about 3% of GDP . Now , of course , there is more to the world than GDP , and climate change would put more than just the economy at risk , like the well-being of different species and plant life . Moreover , the damage wo n't be uniformly distributed " some countries could have their economies damaged by much more than 3% and some countries by much less . The point is that 3% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change is not one of averting a global disaster in which Manhattan becomes an underwater theme park . Rather , climate change is likely to involve a modest risk that will have to be managed and a series of tradeoffs to be hotly debated . <p> If we are to seek to reduce the damage of greenhouse gases a hundred years from now , we will have to constrain emissions somehow in the near term . Since carbon dioxide is produced by nearly every aspect of the industrial economy , that means we would need to reduce current-day economic growth by some amount . We have to weigh the near-term and long-term costs to economic growth from emissions-abatement policies against the long-term benefits of those policies " namely , the extent to which global warming is avoided . <p> This kind of tradeoff presents a classic economic problem . Some individuals are consuming an item ( like carbon ) that damages the well-being of others who are not involved in the transaction ( such as those who will suffer from whatever effects a slightly warmer world could cause decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is to tax the item so that the amount the consumer pays is closer to the actual cost society bears . If the tax is set at the right amount , everyone is , in aggregate , better off . <p> Yet , even in this imagined , perfectly efficient scheme , a policy of carbon mitigation shows few net benefits . According to the modeling group led by William Nordhaus , a Yale professor widely considered to be the world 's leading expert on this kind of assessment , an optimally designed and implemented global carbon tax would provide an expected net benefit of about 0.2% of the present value of global GDP over the next several centuries . Even in Nordhaus 's theoretical world , the tax would be set at a level that would still allow about 75% of the unconstrained damages from emissions to take place , since it would be economically more damaging to set the tax high enough to prevent them . <p> A gain of 0.2% of future global GDP is in fact a lot of money , about $3 trillion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillion would be attractive . Yet , in this case , it would be unwise to work toward a global carbon tax or carbon-auctioning system . To understand why , we must move from the world of academic model-building to the real world of geostrategic competition and domestic politics . To realize this gain of $3 trillion , every nation would have to agree to and then enforce a global , harmonized tax on all significant uses of carbon and other greenhouse gases in any material form . This would require the agreement of " just to take a few examples " the Parliament of India , the Brazilian National Congress , the Chinese Politburo , the authoritarian leader of Russia , and the U.S. Congress . Each of these entities and individuals has been known throughout history to elevate narrow , sectarian interests above the comprehensive good of all mankind , to put it kindly . <p> For the sake of argument , let 's suppose we actually could negotiate such a binding agreement . All the side deals that would be required to get this done " ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to special exemptions for " strategically important " industries , to carve-outs for poorer countries , to offsets for often dubious promises not to clear rainforests , and the like " may well create enough economic drag to more than offset the benefit of 0.2% of the present value of global output . Our track record of closing and implementing deals like the Kyoto Protocol , or even the recent rounds of WTO and regional trade deal negotiations ( which , remember , are supposed to make the signatories richer ) , should n't inspire much confidence that the theoretical net benefits will outweigh the costs created by a global greenhouse-gas agreement . <p> In recent years , the U.S government has not seriously considered a carbon tax , which is the carbon-mitigation policy preferred by almost all academic economists . Instead , Congress considered a cap-and-trade system , a form of emissions rationing , and the Obama administration is currently proposing sector-specific regulation of coal plants , because it is more politically palatable to hide the costs to consumers through such profoundly inefficient tools . Yet even all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth that were added to the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill in 2009 were not enough to build a winning congressional coalition . <p> Further , even if we got to an agreement , we would then have to enforce , for hundreds of years , a set of global rules that would run directly contrary to the narrow self-interest of most people currently alive on the planet . How likely is it , for example , that a rural Chinese or Indian official would enforce the rules on a local coal-fired power plant ? These bottom-up pressures would likely render such an agreement a dead letter , or at least effectively make it a tax applicable only to the law-abiding developed countries that represent an ever-shrinking share of global carbon emissions . <p> Despite the dire warnings from progressives , the best models show us that global warming is a problem that is expected to have only a limited impact on the world economy . Any attempt to do anything about those damages would be rife with unintended consequences and , in any case , is geopolitical fantasy . Sober minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> CONFRONTING WORST CASES <p> But what if our best estimate is wrong and devastatingly optimistic ? After all , it 's only an estimate . Predicting the cost impact of various potential warming scenarios requires us to concatenate these climate predictions with economic models that predict the cost impact of these predicted temperature changes on the economy in the 21st , 22nd , and 23rd centuries . It is hubris to imagine that these can guarantee accuracy , and it is impossible to validate such a claim in any event . <p> Though three degrees Celsius is the most likely case , competent modelers do n't assume that the most likely case is the only case . Rather , they build probability distributions for levels of warming and their associated economic impacts . For instance , there is an X% chance of warming that is four and a half degrees or greater , a Y% chance of four degrees or greater , and so on . The concern is thus with the inherently unquantifiable possibility that our probability distribution itself is wrong . <p> A sense of caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insurance against the sort of devastating global warming that lies outside of the IPCC distribution . But standard cost-benefit analysis would suggest that such a precautionary policy is extraordinarily expensive . Suspend disbelief about the real-world politics for a moment , and assume that we could have a perfectly implemented global carbon tax . If the whole world introduced a tax high enough to keep atmospheric carbon concentration to no more than 420 parts per million " that 's one-and-a-half times the pre-industrial average and well above what many environmentalists worried about worst-case scenarios would deem " safe " " we would expect , using the Nordhaus analysis as a reference point , to spend about $14 trillion more than the benefits that we would achieve . To put that in context , it is an amount on the order of the annual GDP of the United States . That 's a heck of an insurance premium for an event so unlikely that it is literally outside of the probability distribution . <p> So what should we do ? On some intuitive level , it is clear that rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next century should be greater than our doubt surrounding the likelihood that a flipped quarter will land on heads around 500 times of 1,000 . Yet we can not incorporate this doubt into an alternative probability distribution without doing our own armchair climate science in place of the IPCC , nor is it responsible to set a goal and announce " whatever it takes ! " Furthermore , taking drastic action would also ignore the possibility that our models might be over-estimating the risks involved . It makes sense to try to prepare for the possibility of greater harm than we now project , but that goal has to be pursued in a way that takes account of the actual risks and costs involved . <p> As it happens , the problem of climate catastrophe is not without likenesses . There are other potential , unquantifiable dangers that are of comparable likelihood and severity to that of outside-of-distribution climate change . Our policy toward these dangers is never one of unreserved caution . <p> Start with the example of an asteroid striking the Earth . The consensus scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asteroid large enough to kill a large fraction of the world 's population will hit the earth in the next 100 years . That is , we face a 0.01% chance of sudden death for most people in the world , likely followed by massive climate change on the scale of that which killed off the non-avian dinosaurs . This scenario seems reasonably comparable to outside-of-distribution climate change . The U.S. government currently spends about $4 million per year on asteroid detection , in spite of an estimate that $1 billion per year spent on detection plus interdiction would be sufficient to reduce the probability of impact by 90% . Clearly for some potentially lethal threats we are unwilling to insure ourselves at spending levels that are orders of magnitude less than what is proposed for mitigating climate change . <p> Unfortunately for humanity , we face many dimly understood dangers : bioengineering technology gone haywire ; a regional nuclear war in central Asia kicking off massive global climate change ( in addition to its horrific direct effects ) ; a global pandemic triggered by a modified version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaponizing genetic-engineering technology . This list could go on almost indefinitely . To do everything conceivably possible to prevent catastrophic climate change is to become lost in the hot house of single-issue monomaniacs and to ignore the array of dangers and opportunities that we confront . <p> A healthy society is constantly scanning the horizon for threats and developing contingency plans to meet them . Yet the loss of economic and technological development that would be required to eliminate all theorized climate-change risk " or all risk from genetic and computational technologies or , for that matter , all risk from killer asteroids " would cripple our ability to deal with virtually every other foreseeable and unforeseeable risk , not to mention our ability to lead productive and satisfying lives in the meantime . <p> We can be confident that humanity will face many difficulties in the upcoming century , as it has in every century . We just do n't know which ones they will be . In the face of massive uncertainty , hedging one 's bets and keeping one 's options open is almost always the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative political and economic culture are the raw materials that will give us the most options to deal with physical dangers . Markets , democratic political institutions , and economic growth are therefore the means toward greater adaptability in the future . <p> THE ENERGY INNOVATION EXAMPLE <p> America faces a tradeoff in which neither option is appealing . On the one hand , we could continue to create wealth and , because of carbon emissions , see meaningful reductions in the rate of economic growth in less than a century . On the other hand , we could significantly clip the wings of the American economy , making ourselves poorer now and , because of compounding , possibly poorer later . <p> When presented with option A or option B , neither being ideal , the entrepreneur chooses to invent C. This is , in a way , what has happened in the energy sector over the past decade and can continue to happen . America has experienced a technology-driven energy revolution with little inducement or guidance from Washington . Within the last decade , the United States has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of reduction in CO2 emissions of any major country in the world and to permanent reductions in absolute emissions . The Department of Energy expects that energy-related carbon emissions will remain below 2005 levels for decades , despite population growth . <p> This enduring , structural change in the American energy sector is the result of a series of innovations allowing us to extract so-called unconventional fossil fuels . The most important of these innovations has been hydraulic fracturing , often called " fracking , " but other important developments include tight-oil extraction , horizontal drilling , and new applications of information technology . These combined efforts have allowed us to produce much more energy " an increase nearly equivalent to the total output of Iraq or Kuwait " and far cleaner energy . The fracking revolution has shifted American energy sources toward gas and away from coal . Since natural gas emits about half the carbon dioxide that coal does , our impact on the climate has been reduced . America 's reduction in emissions " to say nothing of the jobs we 've created and the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The elaborate climate models do n't account for this kind of innovation . Although they are , in a sense , models of change , they actually tend to be very static compared to the real world , as they ca n't predict large structural shifts due to technological innovation . In the future , radically cleaner fuel sources or technologies that could remove carbon from the atmosphere would be game-changers in the debate about climate policy , just as the fracking revolution has already changed the conversation . The question is how to bring about such game-changers . <p> The American energy revolution provides an example . It is important to remember that less than a decade ago , virtually no one saw the rapid development of an alternative energy source on the horizon . In 2008 , the International Energy Agency projected that U.S. oil and natural-gas production would remain flat or decline somewhat through about 2030 . The discussion of technological solutions focused on far-off , highly speculative , panacea-like technologies such as wind and solar energy . Yet there was something latent in the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lack of imagination . <p> The United States was able to launch its recent energy revolution for the same reason it has had revolutions in information technology , biotechnology , and certain other sectors . Three core elements undergird all these revolutions : a foundation of free markets and strong property rights ; the new-economy innovation paradigm of entrepreneurial start-ups with independent financing and competitive-cooperative relationships with industry leaders ; and support by government technology investments . ( For a fuller discussion of these , see Jim Manzi 's " The New American System , " in the Spring 2014 issue of National Affairs . ) <p> The primary driver has been the regulatory framework of strong property rights and free pricing . Among the world 's key petroleum-producing countries , only the United States allows private entities to control large-scale oil and gas reserves . And outside of North America , hydrocarbon pricing is typically governed by detailed regulatory frameworks that are built around the realities of conventional petroleum production . Freer pricing , in combination with ownership of mineral rights , allows innovators in America to reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the recent technological advances have been made through trial-and-error and incremental improvements " a kind of Darwinian competition among a network of independent companies " as opposed to huge one-time projects by industry giants or quasi-governmental organizations . That is a credit to America 's more flexible regulatory structure . <p> Finally , government has served the role of catalyst rather than manager . The Breakthrough Institute has produced reliable evidence that government subsidies for speculative technologies and research over at least 35 years have played a role in the development of the energy boom 's key technology enablers , such as 3-D seismology , diamond drill bits , and horizontal drilling . Government-led efforts that are less obviously related " such as detailed geological surveys and earlier defense-related expenditures that enabled the U.S.-centered information-technology revolution , which has in turn created the capacity to more rapidly develop " smart drilling " technology " have also been important . <p> While various government ministers in well-tailored suits spent lots of time over the last several decades meeting in Copenhagen and Rio de Janeiro to talk ad nauseam about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings do as they are told , the American system rode to the rescue by inventing and deploying new technology at scale . It is a system that conservatives routinely defend against progressives who want government to manage more and more . And it is a system that has done more than any other to substantially reduce carbon emissions . It would be foolish to think that system could n't do it again . <p> TECHNOLOGY , NOT TAXES <p> In How to Think Seriously About the Planet , the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton argues that conservatism and conservation share a root that is not just etymological . They are both policies of " husbanding resources and ensuring their renewal . " Just as conservatives have championed the enduring value of our constitutional order , the institutions that have supported the free market , and our cultural capital , so too should they preserve and maximize our material capital on this planet . And the way to preserve our ecological riches is through those very same systems conservatives have long worked to conserve : a free market and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is dubious at best to argue that large-scale attempts to manage the economy and mitigate carbon emissions will make us wealthier in the long run . The best models show that any realistic carbon tax " or worse , any set of command-and-control regulations or any crony-capitalist , carbon-credit auction scheme " will make us poorer , not richer . The first rule of conservative policymaking is to do no harm . Conservatives should oppose every large-scale , government-run carbon-mitigation plan , including the carbon tax that some on the right , like former congressman Bob Inglis , have hailed . Rigorous examination shows it would be better to do nothing than to accept the progressives ' favored options . <p> Conservatives , however , should not limit themselves to merely opposing Waxman-Markey . They can champion an agenda that understands human beings to be much more imaginative than the economic models expect . By fostering the legal and economic ecosystems most conducive to breakthrough energy technologies , conservatives can help lessen the harms of climate change . As stated above , this includes the property rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial and error . <p> The second priority should be the kinds of public policies that actually help foster innovation . Investment in general infrastructure " both classic projects , like roads and bridges , and newer ones , in the area of digital infrastructure " grease the economic wheels . We also need to invest in visionary technologies that are too long-term , too speculative , or have benefits too diffuse to be funded by private companies . <p> During the 1980s and ' 90s , the Department of Energy drastically increased its micromanagement of its labs in response to Congressional pressure to reduce waste and increase safety . This removed responsibility for core operating decisions " including personnel , travel , and project management " from the contractors that operate the labs to the DOE itself . This has greatly constrained the ability of the labs to flexibly pursue new innovations .

Because it tries to " engineer " a system we know very little about , geo-engineering should be pursued with utmost prudence and held in reserve as a " break glass in case of emergency " option . <p> We should also reckon with the fact that discovering breakthrough technologies is not guaranteed , so our best option might be to adapt to a slightly warmer world .

We do n't know how much the world will warm . We do n't quite know how that will affect our day-to-day well-being . We can only estimate economic and ecological effects , and we can only speculate about future technologies " we do n't know what kind of energy revolutions or geo-engineering feats are scientifically and practically possible . The proper response to a future we do not know is to build upon what we do know : the systems , institutions , and dispositions that have helped us solve problems and improve our lives . <p> All of these proposed policies build upon successes . When it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about conspiracies or hide behind ignorance . It should confront the facts as scientists generally understand them , as well as the limits of that understanding , and it should seek to empower innovators looking for solutions . The answer to the complex question of climate change will be neither a regulatory Rube Goldberg machine nor a massive new tax . Rather , conservatives should champion what they so frequently suggest as the best way to solve complex problems : policies that open the space for the private sector to innovate and adapt .

The House GOP 's proposed replacement to the ACA contains valuable reforms , but has struggled through lack of a clear unifying theme , and concerns remain that it provides inadequate coverage for those with pre-existing conditions . <p> The Senate can greatly improve on the ACA by concentrating that legislation 's sprawling subsidies on the subset of the American population that is unable to purchase insurance on an actuarially priced and competitive market. - It should similarly support attempts to concentrate Medicaid funds on the most essential services by building on reforms to that program proposed by the House . <p> By demonstrating a core commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make clear that its reforms will lower costs and guarantee that support will be effective where it is most needed . <p> As Democrats defend the ACA , their rallying point has been the protection it provides for individuals with pre-existing conditions . CBO has- estimated- that , under current law , around $100 billion per year will be spent subsidizing the premiums and cost-sharing of individuals enrolled on the ACA 's exchanges . <p> This vast inefficiency provides the key opening for the GOP . Health insurance subsidies should be concentrated on those who need them , rather than spread so broadly . In the American Health Care Act , the House took a good step in this direction by establishing a Patient and State Stability Fund of $10 billion to $15 billion per year to defray the costs of covering the chronically i 'll . A variety of stakeholders have suggested this amount is inadequate to cover the aggregate costs involved . <p> Yet the House bill also created a broad new tax credit , expected to cost- over $60 billion- per year. - This provides $2,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the individual market , but the money would be far better spent if reallocated to the PSSF . <p> This would allow states to support the coverage of the chronically ill who are unable to afford actuarially priced insurance , whether by expanding reinsurance , restructuring cost-sharing subsidies , or another method for targeting assistance at the neediest beneficiaries . <p> To ensure that subsidies remain reserved for those who most need them , the Senate GOP should remove any barriers that discourage those who can afford to purchase unsubsidized health insurance through a competitive , actuarially priced market from doing so . <p> The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the regulatory authority to roll back an October 2016 regulation by which the Obama administration had prohibited the sale of 364-day-long and renewable plans on the competitively priced " short-term " market . <p> This would allow all individuals without major pre-existing conditions to purchase attractive and affordably priced coverage in a well-functioning market , and leave the exchange 's subsidies focused on the small pool of the chronically ill who genuinely need further government support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts by repealing the individual mandate penalty , which the ACA had imposed on individuals who had only purchased these plans , and repeal any other tax disadvantages to which they are subject . <p> The AHCA allowed states to continue claiming matching funds for the expansion of Medicaid to able-bodied childless adults , but reduced the rate at which the federal government subsidizes the coverage of additional such beneficiaries in the future to bring it in line with the rates of subsidy for services provided to children , the disabled and pregnant women . <p> This was a sensible compromise , which treats both expansion and nonexpansion states fairly , and the Senate would be well-advised to strike a similar balance . <p> But given that the expansion of Medicaid coverage to low-income , able-bodied , childless adults increased the program 's costs by- only 12% , while overall expenditures are projected to increase by 64% over the next decade , the broader trajectory of the program is ultimately a more important issue . For this reason , the AHCA proposed to cap the rate by which each state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide health care coverage to those who can afford it least . However , by distributing funds according to the amount that states are themselves able to put in , it has ensured that the wealthiest states receive the largest federal subsidies . <p> In 2015 , Vermont received an average of $13,720 in federal Medicaid funds per person under the poverty level , but Alabama only $4,070 . <p> The Senate could enhance the House 's Medicaid provision by splitting its per-capita caps into two tracks : a higher growth rate for the program 's core set of hospital and physician services ( which varies relatively little between states ) , and a lower one for support services ( which have been expanded disproportionately by the wealthiest states ) . <p> This would prevent cuts from biting hardest in states that begin with the most meager allotments , focus the pressure to trim budgets on the states with the most inflated expenses , and by doing so make the majority of future members of Congress less eager to find pay-fors to override the caps in the budget every year .

Because the requirements to graduate from high school are set lower than the requirements to apply to a four-year college , many high school graduates are ineligible to enroll . <p> Findings of the study include : <p> The national high school graduation rate for all public school students remained flat over the last decade , going from 72% in 1991 to 71% in 2002 . <p> Nationally , the percentage of all students who left high school with the skills and qualifications necessary to attend college increased from 25% in 1991 to 34% in 2002 .

The state with the lowest graduation rate in the nation was South Carolina ( 53% ) , followed by Georgia ( 56% ) , Tennessee ( 57% ) , and Alabama ( 58% ) . <p> There is a wide disparity in the graduation rates of white and minority students . In the class of 2002 , about 78% of white students graduated from high school with a regular diploma , compared to 56% of African-American students and 52% of Hispanic students . <p> There is also a large difference among racial and ethnic groups in the percentage of students who leave high school eligible for college admission .

While a tough sell , Congress would be taking a big step in the right direction by cutting the program . <p> The PSLF program was created in 2007 , under the Bush administration , to encourage more college graduates to pursue careers in public service such as teaching and social work . The program allowed borrowers in the government and nonprofit sectors to have their entire federal student loan balance forgiven after just 10 years of payments , half that required of borrowers in the for-profit sector who participate in the most generous income driven repayment plan currently available . <p> But there 's a big problem with PSLF . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it also creates perverse incentives that run up the bill for taxpayers . <p> When students expect to pay back their debt - they take out as little as is necessary . But once they anticipate being eligible for loan forgiveness , each additional dollar of borrowing is essentially free " they 'll never pay it back . This encourages students to attend higher cost institutions and live more luxuriously than they would have otherwise . And the lack of limits on graduate borrowing means that the pot of free money available to these borrowers , at the expense of taxpayers , is essentially limitless . <p> Even if not all borrowers are savvy enough to game the system in this way , it seems that institutions are . Some , like Georgetown Law , have even- institutionalized- this practice . <p> Supporters of PSLF are quick to point out that there are instances where under subscription to certain professions is negatively impacting social welfare and can justify expenditure of taxpayer dollars . And they are certainly right . But they are wrong to think that PSLF is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , it would n't be hard to argue that taxpayer dollars should be spent to ensure that teaching and social work positions in every jurisdiction are adequately staffed . But it would be much more difficult to make a case that taxpayers should be further subsidizing the compensation of Supreme Court clerks " a highly sought-after and well-compensated position for young lawyers " would also make sense in this framework . The problem with PSLF is that it treats both of these cases the same way . <p> The exclusion of private sector workers is also problematic . Despite the fact that private , nonprofit , and government enterprises often offer similar services to the communities they serve ( i.e. hospitals , prisons ) , PSLF excludes workers at the private enterprises from eligibility for loan forgiveness subsidies . <p> Another problem with using PSLF to encourage public service is that college graduates who have small or modest debt balances do n't stand to gain anything from the program . This means that PSLF only creates an incentive for individuals with large student debt balances to enter public service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-subscription to certain professions , then we should subsidize the compensation of all individuals who enter that profession , not just those with high balances . <p> Furthermore , those who benefit from PSLF will benefit in proportion to the amount they 've borrowed . An individual who attended a public institution will receive less from PSLF from an individual in the same profession who attended a high cost institution . It 's tough to argue that is an equitable allocation of benefits , especially since students who attend higher cost institutions tend to come from more well-off families. - <p> Using taxpayer dollars to pay for subsidies that help fill vacancies in professions that are critical for public welfare is not a bad idea . But delivering those subsidies through PSLF is . Subsidies should be delivered through alternative mechanisms , like- wage subsidies- or tax benefits , which would allow them to be better targeted and more effective at incentivizing changes in behavior . Making the allocation of subsidies transparent in this way would save taxpayer dollars due to greater efficiency and would create accountability for policy makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are needed and not simply padding the pockets of constituents. - <p> The Trump administration is right ; it 's time to get subsidies for public service out of the student lending program
