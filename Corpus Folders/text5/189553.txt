@@42826552 @2826552/ <h> Medical standards for drivers <p> Manitoba Public Insurance assesses medical fitness to drive based on the Medical Standards for Drivers published by the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators ( CCMTA ) . The standards were developed by medical advisors ( physicians ) and driver licensing administrators from Canadian provinces and territories , and establish basic medical qualifications for drivers with medical conditions that may impact their ability to drive safely . <p> These standards were recently reformatted and updated in 2013 . Traditionally , CCMTA medical standards largely reflected a diagnostic model . In terms of an evidentiary basis , the standards reflected the consensus opinion of practicing physicians . <p> In this model , authorities are moving toward a functional approach to driver fitness . This means assessing the impact of a medical condition on the functions necessary for driving . The functions necessary for driving are generally cognitive , motor , and sensory . <p> CCMTA 's new publication has increased its emphasis on using research evidence , where it exists , as the basis of its driver fitness standards . Each medical condition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition causes impairment of one or more of the functions necessary for driving , or has been associated with an elevated risk of crash or impaired driving performance . <p> CCMTA physicians and health care professionals used many documents and medical expertise in preparing the medical standards including medical specialty associations , and the Canadian Medical Association . Physicians and optometrists are encouraged to review these standards when assessing and making recommendations regarding their patient 's medical fitness for driving . <p> In addition to the Medical Standards for Drivers , provincial jurisdictions use assessment guidelines to determine how particular conditions or combination of conditions may affect an individual 's ability to drive safely . <p> The functions necessary for driving are cognitive , sensory ( vision , touch ) and motor ( physical ) . Driving is a complex perceptual-motor skill that usually takes place in a complex environment requiring the functions to operate together . Since the combination of medical conditions is exhaustive , Medical Compliance and Assessments staff often analyze medical information specific to the types of impairments and the potential effect on driving functions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified as persistent or episodic and the effect of each on driving ability is assessed differently . <h> Episodic impairments <p> With episodic impairments , the event is sporadic , unpredictable and lasts for a short time . Episodic impairments do not have any ongoing measurable , testable or observable impacts on the functional ability to drive . Examples of episodic impairments include but are not limited to : <p> seizures <p> myocardial infarctions <p> transient ischemic attacks <p> hypoglycemic reactions <p> blackouts or fainting spells due to transitory illnesses <p> When the medical event occurs , there is no question that the individual is not competent to drive and may be incapacitated . Determining driver fitness for episodic impairments therefore focuses on medical assessments and the likelihood the event will recur . Generally the Medical Standards for episodic impairments reflect medical research and/or consensus medical opinions to assist in driving decisions . In most cases , drivers who experience episodic impairments are monitored by their physicians and driving privileges are suspended until such time as the condition has cleared ( completely or for an established period of time ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not require functional driving assessments because there are no ongoing , measureable effects on driving other than when the event occurs , which can not be predicted . <h> Persistent impairments <p> Persistent impairments , such as cognitive and motor deficits resulting from a stroke , are relatively stable and enduring . Drivers with medical conditions that have persistent impairments generally require a functional assessment , in addition to a medical assessment , to determine fitness to drive . Examples of medical conditions that may require a functional assessment include but are not limited to : <h> Multiple medical conditions <p> The Medical Standards for Drivers each focus on a single medical condition and are written as if the driver had only one medical condition . While the standards for each medical condition may indicate the driver is fit to drive , the cumulative effect of those conditions may make the driver unfit to drive . In situations where a driver 's medical fitness to drive is unclear , a functional assessment is the most useful tool to determine driver fitness .

After all , fixing the vehicle costs $500 less than paying out its value . <p> But let 's say we 'd get back about $1,200 salvage if we wrote it off and auctioned it . <p> Now , writing off this car becomes the least costly option . Writing it off costs the public insurance fund $4,000 minus the $1,200 we 'll get back for salvage total $2,800 . On the other hand , fixing it will cost $3,500 . <p> It 's not always true that write-offs are bad vehicles or they ca n't be fixed . Write-offs sometimes have damage that only affects how they look not how safe or reliable they are . <p> Take a car damaged by hail , for instance .

@@42826678 @2826678/ <h> Questions and Answers <p> Q <p> Why do n't I receive income replacement for the first seven days I missed work after the accident ? <p> A <p> The seven-day waiting period is similar to a deductible in other insurance policies - you share a small part of the loss . However , if you 're off work for more than a week , you 're covered for the more substantial loss . This protects seriously injured people who need income replacement long-term and keeps the overall cost of coverage down . <p> Q <p> I was collecting Employment Insurance at the time of my accident . My injuries are serious enough to prevent me from looking for work at this time so I 'm no longer eligible for Employment Insurance . Do I qualify for income replacement ? <p> A <p> Yes . Income replacement will replace 90 per cent of the net benefit you were receiving from Employment Insurance for the first 180 days . At that point , if the disability persists , we will do a 180 day determination to assess your situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and I was in hospital for two months , then in rehab for six months . I 'm now able to return to work . When I contacted my employer , I was told that my full-time job had been taken by someone else and that there was no work for me .

Your Autopac insurance covers the amount over your deductible ( up to your policy limit , in most cases $50,000 ) . <p> Each incident of loss or damage equals one claim , with a deductible for each claim .
