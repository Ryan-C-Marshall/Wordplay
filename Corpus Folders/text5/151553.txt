@@46021936 @6021936/ <p> Hello all , I have a question and I was hoping someone might have the answer : <p> first the problem , then the details ... <p> For a very long time I have noticed the occurrence of a brown residue on the end of some joints . The residue comes in a thin layer at the bottom of the roach where you inhale and has an extremely bitter taste ; if I notice it on my lips and I wipe them with a finger it stains the skin so it has to be washed . The residue increases as the spliff is smoked . <p> So my questions are what this is and why it happens . <p> Now the background : over the past 6 years , with countless different strains , papers , roach materials , tobacco , no tobacco , etc. this has happened to me only a few times , and seemingly with no connection between the instances . <p> My smoking buddy , who smokes as much as I do , has this happen to him maybe half the time he rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , so that we have absolutely no idea of the cause , though we have considered it often . <p> It is intensely unpleasant to hand or be handed a joint with this , and I want to know how I can avoid it . As I say , this happens to me infrequently ( though it has just happened now , hence my posting this query ! ) , but it happens to my smoking buddy so often that I really see no other alternative than to mock him constantly for being filth and getting crap all over the joint . <p> As much as I enjoy that , I 'd still appreciate it if anyone had a clue to what is the cause of this . <p> Thanks , and all best , <p> Arthur Fortune-Green <p> Bitterfly <p> 15-12-07 , 02:21 AM <p> awww mate that 's such a cute post : D <p> is this a pisstake ? ? ? <p> if not ( which i ca n't believe ) , all that is is the resin or oil produced when your bud is smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> this is more likely to occur on the roach end if you have a tight roach which prohibits airflow ! ! <p> if you smoke a pipe , your pipe would eventually become totally clogged by it , and you need to scrape it out ! <p> arthurFG <p> 15-12-07 , 02:42 AM <p> Thank you for your reply . <p> This had , of course , occurred to me . The problem is that this answer does not account for the randomness of the instances of this residue . I had considered that the tightness of the roach might be an issue , but this seems to happen regardless of how the roach is . <p> For a time I thought that it might be something to do with the material of the roach - paper card or glossy magazine/train ticket , but again I have found no rhyme or reason to the occurrences . <p> I ca n't tell you how many times I have spluttered in disgust and had to snip the end of the roach where the residue has been building up . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me is that where I prefer a more aesthetically pleasing spliff , and so cut all my roaches with scissors , my smoking buddy , in his impatience and haste , tends to tear his roughly , and without regard for symmetry ( of course resulting in a less attractive offering ) . Could this be a cause of his higher rate of residue production ? <p> And , Bitterfly , this is not a pisstake . I never joke about brown residue . <p> AF-G <p> Bitterfly <p> 15-12-07 , 03:14 AM <p> mate , your use of words is visceral and beautiful ; please contribute more to this site : D <p> i love to cut my roaches with scissors too : D <p> i hear you mate , loud and clear ; <p> i guess the oil deposits are due to the lineage , strain and pheno of the bud , the more resinous the green is the more oil will be produced i.e. a strain employed primarily for hash production <p> but that is my own theory ! i am positive that a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your query ( we are even fortunate to have an industry expert , marijuanamatt at our disposal , and seasnoned pros such LK , ragman , diaper and acsi ) , come back tomorrow and i 'd be surprised if you do n't find the answer you 've been seeking : ) <p> D <p> 15-12-07 , 09:53 AM <p> Smoke with filters then mate , it does n't affect the amount of THC you inhale .. well it does , but it 's hardly noticable . : ) <p> WTL <p> 15-12-07 , 10:50 AM <p> I find this happens to me if the skin is overhanging the roach . But also as Bitter has said strain can paly a part in it aswell . <p> EDIT . Welcome to the forum dude . <p> radioheaded <p> 16-12-07 , 06:52 PM <p> I 'm fairly positive this is just the tar from the smoke , building up . It does only happen every so often but I would hazard a guess that it all depends on the shape and tightness of the joint as a whole and not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have something to do with it as well , I remember soapbar being particularly oily . <p> evo <p> 17-12-07 , 01:24 PM <p> it is the tar from the smoke building up on the paper . better then it being in your lungs though : ) <p> Midnight Toker <p> 17-12-07 , 01:34 PM <p> I sometimes get a " brown residue " at the bottom of my boxers , do you think it might be related ? ? <p> evo <p> 17-12-07 , 01:37 PM <p> anal leakage ! <p> D <p> 17-12-07 , 01:39 PM <p> Save your anal tar MT and soon you 'll have enough to build a motorway in 3rd world countries <p> Midnight Toker <p> 17-12-07 , 02:26 PM <p> Save your anal tar MT and soon you 'll have enough to build a motorway in 3rd world countries <p> : rvmp : : rvmp : : rvmp : Nice one dru . <p> greengiant <p> 24-12-07 , 06:31 PM <p> it is the tar from the smoke building up on the paper . better then it being in your lungs though : )

There is no official definition of it , so it 's all down to the way someone perceives heavy usage .

Open it up to expose the shaft and lube ( not wd40 use a good 3in1 oil ) anywhere the shaft touches metal and keep turning by hand until it moves freely then sorted . Iv thrown away fans before for this reason before i realised they wernt actually broken . Sorry to gatecrash but hope it helps

@@46021944 @6021944/ <p> There seem to be lots of new growers here . And invariably when they post about their plants , they talk about how tall they are . Which is not helpful . <p> Tall is not good . The more tuned your system and skills are , the shorter your plants will actually be in the first few weeks of life . A 3-4 inch tall plant could be more healthy and more mature than a 12 inch plant . So while short is better , height is mostly meaningless when evaluating a plant . For new plants from seed , here is what matters . <p> Sets of leaves - The first little tiny " seed leaves " do not count . But after that , you should get leaves coming out in pairs opposite each other . The number of sets of leaves on your plant is a good indication of how well it is doing , and also when it will be time to prune . If you are going to prune , most people do it after the fourth set of leaves have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my plants , they should only be about 3 inches tall at this point if I am doing everything right , especially in regard to adequate light . If they are perfect , you will see stems starting to form at each lower leaf set by the time the fourth set is established , which means you have the light dialed in perfectly . <p> Blades per leaf - This is somewhat controlled by genetics . Some strains simply have more blades than others . But within the same strain , a plant that is healthier will see more blades per leaf . The first set is usually one blade , second set 3 blades , 3rd set 5 blades , 4th set 7 blades ( hopefully ) . My preferred strain usually peaks out at 7 leaves , but a really happy plant will have 9 . Some strains will get up to 11 or 13 . If I have several seeds started and want to thin them out , the number of blades is my single biggest determination of future plant health . <p> Alternate Phyllotaxy - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other on the stem . as the plant matures , you will see the leaves start to offset from each other , so you will have a leaf on one side and then the other in a more staggered layout . Then the next set is offset 90 degrees , but still staggered . This change in the plant is an indication of cannabis puberty . They are now teenagers ! ! For those of you wondering when to switch to 12/12 for flowering , you can do it anytime after this starts . Generally , if you switch to 12/12 before this starts , the plant will not go aggressively in flowering . You will do better to stay in veg mode ( 18/6 or 24/0 ) until you see it exhibit this pattern . The extra light will support more growth , and switching to 12/12 too early just gives you a smaller less developed plant at flowering time . You can veg it for months if you want , but the MINIMUM is to wait until you see alternate phyllotaxy happening . <p> These are the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new plants . Other things matter as well , but are much more subjective . Among them is leaf size , leaf coloration , and condition . Obviously any damage due to nutes or bugs is important . But the three item listed above are really a good guide for your happy healthy plant . Start to pay attention to them for any new seedlings , and you will get a better sense of just how happy your plants are . <p> Thank god for that i have a plant that has 11-12 blades on one leaf , i take it she is a healthy git ? <p> RASTA <p> 21-09-13 , 11:35 AM <p> There seem to be lots of new growers here . And invariably when they post about their plants , they talk about how tall they are . Which is not helpful . <p> Tall is not good . The more tuned your system and skills are , the shorter your plants will actually be in the first few weeks of life . A 3-4 inch tall plant could be more healthy and more mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , height is mostly meaningless when evaluating a plant . For new plants from seed , here is what matters . <p> Sets of leaves - The first little tiny " seed leaves " do not count . But after that , you should get leaves coming out in pairs opposite each other . The number of sets of leaves on your plant is a good indication of how well it is doing , and also when it will be time to prune . If you are going to prune , most people do it after the fourth set of leaves have come out ( thus cutting off the fifth set ) . In my plants , they should only be about 3 inches tall at this point if I am doing everything right , especially in regard to adequate light . If they are perfect , you will see stems starting to form at each lower leaf set by the time the fourth set is established , which means you have the light dialed in perfectly . <p> Blades per leaf - This is somewhat controlled by genetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But within the same strain , a plant that is healthier will see more blades per leaf . The first set is usually one blade , second set 3 blades , 3rd set 5 blades , 4th set 7 blades ( hopefully ) . My preferred strain usually peaks out at 7 leaves , but a really happy plant will have 9 . Some strains will get up to 11 or 13 . If I have several seeds started and want to thin them out , the number of blades is my single biggest determination of future plant health . <p> Alternate Phyllotaxy - The first few sets of leaves come out opposite each other on the stem . as the plant matures , you will see the leaves start to offset from each other , so you will have a leaf on one side and then the other in a more staggered layout . Then the next set is offset 90 degrees , but still staggered . This change in the plant is an indication of cannabis puberty . They are now teenagers ! ! For those of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do it anytime after this starts . Generally , if you switch to 12/12 before this starts , the plant will not go aggressively in flowering . You will do better to stay in veg mode ( 18/6 or 24/0 ) until you see it exhibit this pattern . The extra light will support more growth , and switching to 12/12 too early just gives you a smaller less developed plant at flowering time . You can veg it for months if you want , but the MINIMUM is to wait until you see alternate phyllotaxy happening . <p> These are the three things you should tell us when looking for advice for your new plants . Other things matter as well , but are much more subjective . Among them is leaf size , leaf coloration , and condition . Obviously any damage due to nutes or bugs is important .

It MAY coincide with blade count , or maybe not . You may find it better defines when a plant will actually go into flower vs " still has a few weeks vegging before it shows sex " . It is just a more subtle distinction vs counting blades .

A Dutch Nurseryman who told me about his greenhouse - du n no what plants he had , something less interesting than weed . His lights came on &amp; off in 20 minute bursts because the plant does n't figure out that the light is off for a while . I.E. - something like this ... 20 mins - Light comes on , plant registers the light is on 20 mins after it comes on . - Light goes off . 20 mins - Light is off , plant still thinks the light is on and before it realises the light is off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , plant does n't realise the light went off . etc . Dark period is just dark all the time . <p> Evolutionarily speaking , because it 's still here for us all to enjoy , and is not extinct ... Cannabis must , by definition , be capable of flowering and therefore reproducing given exposure to a maximum of a Full Moon , which was likely slightly brighter in the millions of years hence . And lightening which is bright for a split second . I 'm no Botonist but i would say that there is still much we still do n't know about the precise photo-period of Cannabis . Problem being that probably like most growers , i 'm too fond of getting stoned to risk a failed grow just at the moment .

@@46021951 @6021951/ <p> The story of " skunk " Skunk has come to be a generic term for any strong cannabis , when we say Skunk , we mean a plant descended from the original Skunk No. 1 bred by Sam in the 70s . Skunk No. 1 ( AKA " The Pure " ) , is the origin of all the skunk varieties grown through the world today , this plant was created by Sam the Skunk Man , at Sacred Seeds , in the late 70s . Sam bred Afghani Indica , " Acapulco Gold " , Mexican Sativa and Columbian Gold Sativa to create an exceptionally strong and flavourful cannabis plant . Skunk plants are typically early maturing , well stabilised , with high potency and yield . <p> Typically Skunk plants are grown under artificial conditions , rather than in the wild , either under grow lights or in " greenhouse conditions " using hydroponic techniques . All this can be done at home , using basic equipment , and some varieties will happily grow on a windowsill or balcony . <p> The more intensively you nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher the THC content . Skunk varieties tend to have THC content of between 10% and 14% , with many having even higher concentrations . Our league table of Skunk THC content lays out the facts : <p> As you can see , some Skunk varieties are exceptionally strong , having very high THC . Because of this , many people find the effects of smoking Skunk come on quicker . There is widespread evidence which supports a heightened hallucinogenic high , compared to other cannabis varieties . <p> MEXICAN SATIVA from sensi seed , they are not the original strain but are very close <p> http : **36;0;TOOLONG Mexico has a long and important cannabis tradition . The country that coined the term marijuana is home to some wonderful varieties of cannabis which are rarely seen outside her borders . <p> The main ancestor and parent of the Mexican Sativa seed-strain is a prized cultivar from the southern province of Oaxaca . To adapt this exotic Sativa for flowering in the northern summer , it was infused with genes from Durban - the famously hardy African Sativa - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best seed offspring were then back-crossed to the Oaxacan line to maintain the distinctive qualities of the original strain . Mexican Sativa fuses the subtle flavours of three continents within her long , delicate buds . Notes of sandalwood and aniseed are wrapped up in the sharp , fresh , resin-tinged scent of the Oaxacan original . <p> This is a very interesting indica/sativa ( 25%/75% ) hybrid . It is a mixture of traditional landrace , pure bred lines from the Santa Marta mountain range in Colombia . This variety was utilized by Simon Bolivar in his travels around the Amazon rainforest in which he interchanged spices and medicinal plants with natives during his conquests . This is a large , vigorous strain , with many side branches . It has a sweet , intense smell that complements its potent , sometimes psychedelic effect . <p> Afghani No 1 is a traditional landrace strain collected in the mountains of Afghanistan by Sacred Seeds in the 1970s . It was one of the first pure indica true-breeding strains used in worldwide cannabis breeding programmes . It is well known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties for hashish production . This strain has been acclimatised to western growing conditions by selectively crossbreeding various Afghani No 1 parents and selecting offspring plants with favourable traits . <p> The popularity of Afghani No 1 can be seen through its use as a genetic building block in many predominately indica strains created or preserved within the Sensi Seed bank gene pool and other seed companies . <p> Afghani No 1 is a vigorous growing yet small bushy plant , with a strong stem that is renowned for its strong aroma when flowering . Its classic indica properties and true-breeding nature make it an ideal indica parent plant . <p> This is one of our most impressive sativas not for yield but for taste and effect . Our breeders have continually selected the most early maturing , and vigorous growing phenotypes from their Thai genetics to help shorten the usually very lengthy Thai sativas flowering period . At the same time they have aimed to maintain the other beneficial characteristics , and we are more than happy with the results . <p> The optimum THC content of this plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cerebral high . Beware this can sometimes seem a little hallucinogenic in strong doses . <p> This strain now flowers in 11 weeks so is more suitable for indoors than out . Although it will grow happily in greenhouses , that will protect it from any early frosts . It will also grow outside in warmer climates such as around the Mediterranean . <p> This plant can grow large when allowed and produces light fluffy sativa buds favoured more by the connoisseur than by cultivators growing for yield . <p> So what wrong with " Skunk " ? nothing , its a good strain the problem is that its high amount of THC may not be good for all human , so the papers start to notice cannabis because the government are downgrading it ( but now its be upgraded ) so the daily mail start to make headlines like " Boy on skunk cannabis butchered a grandmother " so now the UK are having " reefer madness " with everyone banging on about " Skunk changed my child " and bullshit like that . <p> The story of skunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool post , thx mate ; ) <p> XHoody-FrankzX <p> 20-02-09 , 07:50 AM <p> yes I found that very informational and I appreciate the history lesson <p> Peace <p> Opiate <p> 20-02-09 , 04:14 PM <p> you left out the part where the lethal skunkabis causes your heart to stop and you die .... <p> Kajun666 <p> 20-02-09 , 04:17 PM <p> Fo0kin good read m8. thank you for posting this info . <p> Cones247 <p> 21-02-09 , 09:51 PM <p> Very informative . <p> N4TH4N88 <p> 21-02-09 , 09:54 PM <p> i have a joint of lethal skunkabis in my hand now . <p> GAMBINO <p> 22-02-09 , 02:15 PM <p> looks like a good read i 'm shooting out now but deff gon na have a read later

Only need a very small amount anyways . It does n't smell anything like weed so not like people would start thinking weed instantly if they would smell it either . <p> bboyz <p> 08-03-11 , 10:16 PM <p> i more worried about the smell while its all simmering for so many hours in beginning as i have bad luck with things in general so i bet its same time as neighbours come out and would smell it lol <p> Weed Weegie <p> 08-03-11 , 10:17 PM <p> Weed weggie - why did you stop tablet form ? <p> I just never got round to going back out to get the capsules lol , I just generally take an iolite about with me now to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber full of eucalyptus on me aswell incase I get caught lol .... just say i 've got asthma and it helps ; ) <p> But the little capsules work well , I was melting most days in work . Outstanding . <p> bboyz <p> 09-03-11 , 09:09 PM <p> and when you say to take the capsules did you turn into a oil then pour into the capsules or just grind trim and bud and put a lil amount into the capsules ? also the iolites is they portable you still need plug for them ? <p> J420 <p> 09-03-11 , 09:39 PM <p> The iolites are portable and works great , its a vape so no smell , can smoke it on trams and hospitals without any problems . There are tons of portable vaps if you look around , just google portable vaporizer and check ebay . <p> I would n't bother with caps if I were you , bit of a pain in the ass to deal with . <p> bboyz <p> 09-03-11 , 10:32 PM <p> ok i 'll check ebay out and google : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in room under onas and if i put into caps i would n't have to smell kitchen out making hash or butter it seems alot eaiser to just pour an amount in and take tablet plus it would release into my digestive system where my crohns is mainly needed surely that would help anti-inflammatory in specific area maybe ? <p> J420 <p> 09-03-11 , 10:57 PM <p> Ona blocks are no miracle workers mate , they ca n't handle something like trim smell its just too strong so its gon na stink either way after you have chopped and do what you need to do . <p> And you can make ice hash , check Burnz thread about it ( think its him ) , you just need a shitload of ice , a bucket , screwdriver etc and you make the butter in your room if you get a portable stove , just have all the windows open and use some seabreeze stuff every now and then . Can be done in 6-7hours so you can do it while the others are at work and school etc <p> Using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to eat it then no ? Besides you ingest gelatin and other compounds that are in the caps so something to think about to . <p> bboyz <p> 10-03-11 , 03:22 AM <p> Ye I got alot to think about once I got my yield I need to carefully make sure it lasts until my next harvest so it might mean just using vapes and the odd spliff when at a party pure weed though so no tobacco : ) <p> donnachris <p> 19-03-11 , 12:51 AM <p> i 'd find a way to make you butter as opposed to vaping. if your trying to get high vaping is okay , but edibles are the way to go for pain relief , imo . <p> donnachris <p> 19-03-11 , 02:23 AM <p> i 'd find a way to make you butter as opposed to vaping. if your trying to get high vaping is okay , but edibles are the way to go for pain relief , imo . <p> Bubbla <p> 19-03-11 , 06:14 PM <p> bubble hash yes i read about that am i right in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say my two plants yeild 2 oz between them and i was to take half ounce to make bubble hash , am i gon na benifit and make it last like i could when i vape for next harvest ? <p> You 'll be lucky to get a few grams from 2 oz my friend . You need a lot of Weed to make any significant amount . Even making traditional Hash requires very large amounts of weed to produce quality Hash . <p> As for Cooking , well hash butter is far less smelly than using straight Weed but it still smells a bit . Using a frying pan &amp; butter only will stink you out of your House , but the Water &amp; butter method on a rolling boil is less smelly but people will notice . Have you got a BBQ ? If you have do it outside , problem solved : ) <p> bboyz <p> 23-06-11 , 01:00 PM <p> hi been a while since being in this thread .... i am going to buy a electric stone and cook in my room i can shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... i also will be using the kief from grinder also in whichever ways i can .... i hopefully will have enough trima nd bud from next harvest to experiement while keeping a few ounce for my vapes .... cheers again all of you been big help <p> harrypothead <p> 24-07-11 , 10:02 PM <p> Bless all stoners .

First grown in the Mediterranean region , it now flourishes , too , in the Eastern United States and in California . Originally valued as a supplement to encourage production of breast milk in new mothers , for menstrual problems , depression , and even to ease the symptoms of varicose veins , its current popularity stems from its use in the treatment and prevention of liver disease . The human liver can become damaged by disease , environmental toxins or from the effects of personal choices , such as overuse of alcohol or drugs . Milk thistle may help to ameliorate this liver damage . <p> The benefits of milk thistle are nothing short of amazing . Researchers call it a smart herb because it seems to know when to produce new cells as well as when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells . How this herb knows when to help regenerate cells and when to keep them from regenerating is still a matter for research , but the benefits to the liver are undeniable . <p> Liver damaging toxins are everywhere , and we take them in on a daily basis-from the air we breathe to the food we eat . The core ingredient of milk thistle is silymarin , a known antioxidant that can aid the body in a variety of ways . <p> With so many uses and benefits you may want to add milk thistle to your health routine today . So come learn about how to use milk thistle , what it is , and where it comes from .

Eccrine sweat is produced by the eccrine glands - the major sweat glands , found in the skin . Eccrine sweat is clear and odorless , and composed of primarily water and NaCl ( salt - hence when you work out and sweat , the sweat tastes salty ) . Eccrine sweat acts to cool the body down . Apocrine sweat is produced by the apocrine sweat glands ( funny that ) . Evolutionary , the apocrine glands function as as olfactory pheromones and are used to attract a mate . Humans have mostly lost this olfactory ability ; althoughnot completely , hence when you smell certain folk - and this is acompletelyindividual thing , what does it for one person wo n't necessarily for another - they just makes us want to rub ourselves all over them - ummmm hmmm .

Because it 's lipid based it gets into the body 's tissues - hence it takes three months to leave the body , and why you can find it in hair , etc . Because it 's lipid based and because both the apocrine and sebaceous glands produce lipid based excretions , if you smoke enough weed , the THC will naturally excrete in those excretions and hence you can smell weed on your body .

Remember , deodorants do not prevent sweating . They mainly mask the smell of the bacteria on your sweaty skin . Antiperspirants are chemical agents that reduce sweating . Many antiperspirant preparations also contain a deodorant , which helps to mask the smell . Check the product you use to make sure it contains an antiperspirant . <p> hydroguy1985 <p> 04-08-12 , 09:38 PM <p> i just started dating a girl that smells just like me. she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i ca n't think that weed is going to change body odor too much ( unless i 'm really just that smelly ) 10970 @qwx420970 <p> 05-08-12 , 09:58 AM <p> i just started dating a girl that smells just like me. she does n't  smoke pot though ; i smoke a LOT . so i ca n't think that weed is going to change body odor too much ( unless i 'm really just that smelly ) <p> Do you smell each other on a regular basis ?

@@46021959 @6021959/ <p> Defoliation is an extreme marijuana growth technique . It 's not to be done lightly . In fact , the topic of defoliation is one of the most controversial subjects in the marijuana growing field . People on both sides defend their position vehemently . <p> I 'm on the side that believe there is absolutely nothing stressful about defoliation or bending branches . Honestly , there is no way to achieve nearly a pound of buds from a 2-3 foot tall plant indoors , except using defoliation . <p> Opponents often have arguments like , " PLANTS NEED THOSE LEAVES ! If they did n't , they would n't be there . " Or my all-time favorite , " I have a friend who used to grow , and he insists that will hurt the plant . " Yet the saddest part of all is how so few people are willing to look at the evidence . In some ways , I almost would prefer the rest of the growing world keep up their ill-advised lollipopping , removing growing tips , and other low-yield techniques . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers for decades . Nevertheless , I am determined to educate other growers about defoliating and let them see the results for themselves . So let me start by giving you some picture proof that defoliation works ( make sure you scroll down to see all of them ! ) . You see , I 've been defoliating intensively for 30 years . I am now training plants to be 32 " tall and 32 " round and yielding 250-400 grams under 400 watt lamp . <p> Nebula Haze from GrowWeedEasy.com : Yes , that 's right , he said 8-14 OUNCES of buds of marijuana harvested off each short , easy-to-manage 32 " tall plant , using just a regular 400 watt HID grow light . <p> Here are two of my beauties ( the one on the right needs a good plucking ) LONG ...

" I recently attended an advanced seminar with a prominent fellow grower and got roundly booed when attempting to describe the defoliation technique , even with pictures showing dramatic benefits . Unlike many other growers , I believe what 's most important is studying how the plant actually grows , instead of assuming she grows how we think she should grow . Real experimentation and unbiased observers are the only way growers are going to learn how to get the best yields for the amount of time , money , and effort . <p> And it 's true that some types of defoliation are brutal to the plants ( such as when misguided growers removing all the leaves off extremely young marijuana plants ) , but other types of defoliation are actually hugely beneficial to increasing yields ( I 'll be showing you exactly what do do shortly ) . And defoliation is beneficial for more than just marijuana , it also has been proven to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's well-known that cowpeas experience significant increases in yields when up to 50% of their leaves are defoliated during their flowering stage ...

And it 's true that the real beauty of defoliation is difficult to translate in pictures and verbally . But I will do my best to give you everything you need to start producing your own huge yields with marijuana defoliation . But First , Let Me Show You About Increased Bud Production With Defoliation During the Flowering Stage Before plucking LONG ... LONG ... <p> Only 4 Days After That ( after another defoliation session ) LONG ... LONG ... Are you beginning to see the power of defoliation ? <p> How Early Do You Start Defoliating ? I first started defoliating in desperation after many years of SOG , which I feel has proven to be too much work for inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields have been more consistent when training a single plant to use this space instead of 4 or 9 or 25 SOG clones . Never mind the fact that in many states , patients are limited to just a handful of plants , removing SoG as a viable option . Most growers who are curious about this do not want to perform defoliation on small plants . They consider the practice in veg to be too radical . And I 100% agree that totally stripping your seedlings of all leaves will be devastating to their growth . And the honest truth is that defoliation is n't for everyone . Beginners are often already dealing with the drawbacks to their choice of method or media , and defoliation can be disastrous to any but the healthiest of plants . Because of this , I sometimes hesitate to throw defoliation into the mix of challenges for beginning growers and I strongly advise any growers to experiment with defoliation ( or with any extreme growth control method ) in the vegetative stage only where there is nothing at stake . That being said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marijuana plant to leaf out completely is in an outdoor situation where you want as large a plant as possible . In that case you can save deleafing for mid to late summer after full-stretch and branching . The way I practice this method ( growing indoors ) leaves never get a chance to age . No leaves are allowed more than about two weeks existence . I start at the top in order to remove the shading . Removing lower leaf contributes nothing to the strategy of exposing usually shaded out mid and lower growth to premium light . I still remove older shabby leaves to keep it all tidy . And this is where defoliation gets controversial . Many growers feel that controlling their plant in any way during the vegetative stage will significantly reduce yields . And I understand how it can seem that way , especially to new growers , before you 've gone through the entire life cycle of the marijuana plant a few times . Experiments show , again and again , that large plants with intensively prepared structure during extended Veg cycle yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nebula Haze from GrowWeedEasy.com : I 've also found this to be the case . Small marijuana plants that are forced to flower when extremely young are can be fun as an experiment , but produce pitiful yields . Investing more time in the vegetative stage to gain girth , while controlling the shape and growth of the plant , has dramatically increased yields for me . <p> The truth is , that with marijuana , the real ' secret sauce ' to getting enormous yields is when you 've perfectly prepared your plants for the flowering stage . As any grower knows , once you 're deep into flowering , there is n't a whole lot you can do about huge , out-of-control plants except hold on , pray for the best , and do better next time . I DO NOT lollipop and advice strongly against it . I use defoliation to skillfully and artfully prepare plants during the vegetative stage , so that lollipopping becomes completely unnecessary . I am on a mission to refocus growing technique to never remove ANY productive growth . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique is a huge tool in the grower 's toolbox that allows you to dominate the Vegetative stage . Then it can be used in the Flowering stage to maximize yields . <p> Defoliation is the Big Secret to High-Yield , Compact Marijuana Plants My style involves intensive defoliation along with the twist and train method ( a version of supercropping ) using a basic net for support . I only top once , if at all , at the 5th or 6th node(approximately) depending on the height and structure of a given clone . I also deleaf them at this time . The only plants that get more topping than that are because they had clones taken from them . I do n't usually keep dedicated mothers , instead , I just clone the clones and cycle everything through . Here is a close-up of a veg clone getting it 's second stripping . <p> Before LONG ... LONG ... After LONG ... LONG ... To get the best results , you should start defoliation in the vegetative stage . Leaf removal in bud is beneficial after stretch but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more compact plant with more budding sites in a given size . <p> Stripping and bending takes practice but you must do it to get practice . By starting in veg you risk no bud . Veg plants are replaceable so experiment and be ready to devote a little more time to prepare them . <p> I 'd describe my stripping as " aggressive . " Once your plant is trained to deal with defoliation , it 's hard to go wrong . Plus , after years of experience , I 've become very familiar with how these plants grow and always know what my outcome will be . <p> But defoliation does n't end in the vegetative stage . I also continue to pull the fan leaves off of my flowering plants to expose the buds . As far as when and how often , I do n't get too scientific about it . <p> Usually if things look leafy , meaning that you see more leaf than budsites when viewing the crop , it may be time for another deleafing . It usually takes a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are 2-4 new leaves that have flattened and greened enough to deleaf again . This repeated releafing process allows that lower growth to benefit from the maturing of the immediate leaf mass . <p> Leaf removal stimulates lower and mid bud growth by exposing those normally shaded out areas to premium light . Of course those new to the technique should start slow , but if you start too slow you wo n't remove enough leaf to see the best result . You basically want to prevent any ' shade ' from happening . <p> Cont ....... 10963 @qwx420963 <p> 13-06-12 , 07:02 AM <p> Here 's an example of how I deleaf a girl who is 2 weeks into 12-12 ( flowering ) Before LONG ... LONG ... After LONG ... LONG ... Notice how , you can now see light all the way through the plant . This is a good thing for light , as opposed to seeing nothing but leaves in the before pic . Wait , did you say you wanted to see what kind of buds I get at the BOTTOM of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants LONG ... LONG ... This is on the morning of harvest . While some are obsessed with top growth I like well developed bottoms . Tops are a given . If bottoms are this well developed the tops are certainly getting their share of light . Some guys like tops , some like bottoms . I like my girls to be equally well developed . Ready to Get Started ? You can start easy and try to save leaves but what happens when you see the results like all the mid growth exploding with the new exposure . It would serve logic that if you remove a little and there is good results than remove more and on and on until you get comfortable with stripping down these girls . I recommend you start deleafing as soon as your plants start looking ' bushy ' at all . Start with removing the fans from all the branches and watch the results . Then remove progressively more . Do n't remove any branches or sites if you want to commit to this method . The idea is shade removal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or so and remove again when they look leafy . This girl is 32 " sq . and under 30 " tall . She was thoroughly plucked continuously through her 11 week flowering cycle as well as during veg . No shortage of branches or buds , all of them chunky and exposed . I ended up harvesting 12 ounces off her . Marijuana plants do not get like this on their own . Stripping in veg and throughout bud is the only way to get results like this . <p> Answer to the 3 Most Common Questions About Marijuana Defoliation 1 . ) Which Leaves Can Be Plucked ? All of them . That was the short answer . I remove everything that is easily pinched off with the thumbnail and forefinger . I keep a little bit of a cutting tool for a thumbnail specifically for that purpose . I do n't try to get in super close to the buds once they get sticky unless it is just intolerably crowded . Any leaf that is attached by enough of a peristem to be plucked easily is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bud cluster and are difficult to remove by hand . I do not yank or pull down on the leaf . I snip it off with the thumbnail . Do n't sweat the stubs that are left , they dry out and fall off . Best not to try to cut so close to the plant , especially in mold prone climates. 2 . ) Can Defoliation Be Used with Any Growing Medium ? Yes . Medium is not a factor . Go with what you like . Defoliation works great for marijuana grown in soil , coco coir , perlite , vermiculite , DWC , bubbleponics , and any other growing medium that marijuana grows in. 3 . ) I 've Never Defoliated and Now I 'm Several Weeks into Flowering with Tall , BUSHY Out-of-Control Plants ... Can I Still Start Defoliating ? If you 've never defoliated before , go conservative to start , even if your plants look healthy . Do it moderately at first and a little more daily . Pluck fan leaves to prevent branches from growing taller . During the flowering stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . <p> So there you have it , a basic introduction to defoliation for huge yields . It 's about time defoliation went mainstream !

I have a pheno type of Ice Cream , SS AK and SS White Russian which loves this method and on the other side of the coin the 3 pheno types of V3 and a landrace afghan kush did not enjoy this process at all .

In other words running 300 - 400 watts per plant vertically / with light movers will penetrate most natural canopies the plant develops ( except scrogs of course ) . But yes this is n't a hard concept to grasp . If a part of your plant is getting more shade than light , start trimming . <p> Tabbatha <p> 06-07-12 , 07:28 AM <p> By the way have I yarned on about auxins yet ? <p> Every time a plant loses a leaf , auxins are created in the roots and sent to that area to heal it . These are basically steroids for the plant so overall it will be a physically stronger plant with defoliation . <p> Obviously this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegging times to heal and a slightly increases risk of shock . <p> : ) <p> advice hunter <p> 07-07-12 , 01:49 PM <p> Remember the first plants we all grew .

When it was finished it looked like a christmas tree with only that top bud to be proud of . Look at how we all grow our plants now . We 're all brutal to how we started But it ends up being for the better .

Or so the word on the street says . ; ) <p> Skorchem <p> 10-07-12 , 05:33 PM <p> Just to let you know 5 days have passed since I took off most of the big leafs and they have all grown back with a vengeance , the lower budsites have caught up in size with the higher ones and overall they look much happier and more bountiful <p> tricone <p> 10-07-12 , 06:10 PM <p> Thought I would throw this into the mix . Its from another forum but not a cannabis one . Should Fan Leaves be Trimmed ? <p> There are a number of theories why fan leaves should or should not be removed . The purpose of this paper is to analyze cannabis cultivation techniques that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each theory is presented , followed by a review of fan leaf function . The different theories advocating for and against the removal of fan leaves are then discussed in the context of fan leaf function and cultivation techniques . <p> THEORIES WHY TO TRIM FAN LEAVES Increase Lower Bud Development The fan leaves shade lower buds and that these buds do not develop to there full potential because of a reduction in lighting intensity due to shading from upper fan leaves . <p> To conserve energy for upper bud development Trimming fan leaves and lower , shaded branches focuses the plants development on main top buds ( Che Bleu , 03.13.2002 ) . A plant wastes precious energy several ways . A tall plant needs to use energy to build extra stem , and then use extra energy to move water up higher , this is why I believe " scrog " methods are productive . An untrimmed bushy plant causes the plant to expend energy to build elaborate branches and leaves , and then has to use excess energy to supply all these structures . Careful trimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and unproductive suckers will leave more energy for a larger yield . Suckers do exactly as their name suggests , they suck needless energy from the plant which can be put to better use , towards yield ( Leaf , 03.13.2002 ) . <p> Reduce the Stretch If fan leaves are trimmed during the early flowering stage , the stretch is reduced ( Che Bleu , 03.13.2002 ) . Reducing the stretch might be advantageous in certain cultivation conditions . <p> Speeding Up The Flushing Process Remove some of the fan leaves 14 days before harvest . It helps speed up the flushing process and or makes flushing unnecessary ( Homemadepot , 03.13.2002 ) . <p> Reduce The Chance of Mould Removal of dead fan leaves is necessary to reduce the risk of mould . Failing to " clear the airway " can lead to development of mould in the " crowded " areas of the plant ( Jeast , 03.13.2002 ) . <p> Scrog growers may also reduce the chance of mould by removing fan leaves due to reduce the level of transpiration . This is because many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious problem ( DoctorDangerous , 09.04.2002 ) . However with better ventilation it may be necessary to avoid the mould problem ( Nietzsche , 09.04.2002 ) . <p> Increase root development on Clones Fan leaves on clones should have their blades cut in half , to make the clone grow slowly while a root system develops ( Weezil , 03.12.2002 ) . <p> HOW DO FAN LEAVES FUNCTION The large fan leaves have a definite function in the growth and development of cannabis . Large leaves serve as photosynthetic factories for the production of sugars and other necessary growth substances . Most cannabis plants begin to lose their larger leaves when they enter the flowering stage and this trend continues on until senescence ( death of the plant ) . <p> Fan leaves account for the greatest area for the reception of photons on a plant , thus they account for the majority of photosynthesis which occurs within a plant . Cells in the plant 's leaves , called chloroplasts , contain a green pigment called chlorophyll which interacts with sunlight to split the water in the plant into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar energy that hits them , the other 85% passes through-- but they reflect all the green light , which means it looks darker below the leaf to a human than it does to the plant because our eyes are most sensitive to the green spectrum ( Shipperke , 03.15.2002 ) . <p> Photosynthesis occurs in all green parts of plants . The process has two stages , the light reactions and the Calvin cycle , that convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen . These sugars are later used to power all the processes in the plant , including the synthesis of THC and other cannabinoids ( Shipperke , 04.02.2002 ; Ca , 03.13.2002 ) . Fan leaves possess the greatest number of stomata , which are small pores or valves on the underside of the leaf which water vapor and carbon dioxide diffuse during transpiration and photosynthesis ( carbon fixation ) . Carbon dioxide first enters the leaf through the stomata and combines with the stored energy in the chloroplasts through a chemical reaction ( the Calvin cycle ) to produce a simple sugar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes in the leaf to supply the synthesized food to other plant parts such as growing or respiring tissues like young leaves , roots , and flowers of the plant . meristems ( UK Tricky Knome , 03.14.2002 ) . <p> Removal of fan leaves will not only slow growth , but it will also hinder the plants ability to rid itself of toxic gases , and also hinder the regulation of the plants temperature via stomata . Changes in the plants chemical metabolism caused by fan leave removal causes the plant to work overtime to rid toxins with less leaves , as a result the pant may allocate more growth hormones into growing more leaves to make up for what has been lost ( Equator , 03.15.2002 ) . Removing large amounts of fan leaves may also interfere with the metabolic balance of the plant . Leaf removal may also cause sex reversal resulting from a metabolic imbalance . <p> There is a relationship regarding the amount of carbohydrates a leaf produces and CO2 intake relative to outside forces . When you have a situation whereby the leaf is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be - low light , old age , disease , insect attack etc , the plant will discard it . ( Thunderbunny as citied , by Nietzsche , 03.13.2002 . <p> Plants have two different kinds of vessels in their stems to move stuff around , xylem and phloem . Xylem runs from the roots up the stem carrying water and nutrients . Phloem runs both up and down to move sugars hormones , proteins , etc but mostly sugars . Each part of the plant can be either a sugar source or a sugar sink ( Shipperke , 03.15.2002 ) . Phloem moves from sources ( areas of supply ) to sinks ( areas of metabolism or storage ) . Granted that the flowers can produce some photosynthate , but they are no where near as effective as fan leaves ( resin glands significantly reduce light to the tissue they are found on ) . Flowers are sink tissues , leaves are source tissues . Sinks do not produce enough photosynthate , and are importers . Sources give photosynthate to sinks in closest proximity . Upper leaves bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves bring goodies to roots ( UK Tricky Knome , 03.17.2002 ) . Remove the source and the sink will be affected ( Diels Alder , 03.15.2002 ) . <p> The leaves at the top of a plant tend to supply the top growing shoots . The leaves at the bottom of the plant tend to supply the roots . The middle leaves can go either way as the demand changes . During flowering and fruiting , only the very bottom leaves supply the roots and the rest of the leaves try to get as much energy as possible to the flowers of fruits . For this reason , the more leaves are unshaded and in good light , the more chance the plant has of creating extra storage of energy that will ultimately go into yield ( Leaf , 03.13.2002 ) . However Jeast ( 03.13.02 ) believes that the rich green leaves emerging from the bud are a sufficient energy source of solar energy for the plant 's floral development . Therefore the old fan leaves are once again rendered useless and only drain energy from the developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fan leaves store mobile nutrients , these stored nutrients are essential in the later stages of flowering . When flushing a plant the fan leaves will lose their color quickly . This is because the nutrients are being mobilized to the atypical meristem ( grow tip , bud site ) . Draining your fan leaves with a flushing period will increase floral development ( Ca , 13.03.2002 ) . Fan leaves therefore serve as a nutrient deficiency buffer zone for the plant ( Higstar , 03.13.2002 ) . Nutrient burn usually causes bottom leaves begin to die however DaGnome ( 03.15.2002 ) observed that if you do not remove the leaves then they will absorb damage as premature removal generally results in more leaf loss . However if growing hydroponically under ideal conditions it could be argued that fan leaves serve as a nutrient buffer is a moot point . <p> WHEN AND WHAT TO TRIM IF AT ALL To trim or not to trim that is the question . Try everything for yourself . Try it all ways . ( The Crazy Composer , 13.03.2002 ) . Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your are growing when where and what you trim ( Cardboardbill , 03.13.2002 ) <p> Genetic Variance Cannabis phenotypes play a large part . A strain with very few leaves and long internodes will need a lot less trimming - if a trimming technique is even adopted . A strain with a surplus of leaves and short internodes would require more thinning to get the same amount of light to the lower buds ( The Crazy Composer , 13.03.2002 ) . Cannabis varieties from high sunshine equatorial areas like thai sativa have thin leaves most likely due to more light than say a indicia plant from afghan regions have wider fan leaves due to less light intensity in their natural environment ( Lebman , 03.20.2002 ) . <p> Remove non productive dead leaf material Here are some signs to look for when removing foliage . Leaves that have reached their final size and are ageing will stop producing chlorophyll and start changing to a lighter color , often yellowing and showing purple petioles ( leaf stems ) . This is when the leaves ' capacity to produce sugars starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way to allow Sunlight to fall on the younger leaves that are producing at a higher rate . The older leaves , even though larger , are no longer very productive once they are not dark green anymore . By the time they start looking pale or discolored , they are not contributing anything to the plant at all . Obviously , the lower leaves are the oldest and the first to age . Old leaves can be removed at any time they are shading younger ones , but try to never remove a leaf in its expanding stage because it is producing at full power ( Leaf , 03.13.2002 . <p> Outdoors , fan leaves serve an additional and very important purpose of protecting the buds from the elements and predators . These leaves often become damaged in the course of doing their duty , and will then wither or break off ( Jeast , 03.13.02 ) . However depending on the humidity of the growing climate Leaf ( 03.13.2002 ) suggests to trim most leaves that show signs of age , are dull in color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bugs or bug damage to prevent mould . <p> To Increase Lower Bud Development Light efficiency decreases with distance . The inverse squared light rule states that illuminance is inversely proportionate to the square of the distance from the light source . Removing the largest area of photosynthesis that is closest to the light source simply to benefit smaller leaves growing out of the but sites that are further away is not logical when growing indoors " ( Smokinrav , 03.15.2002 ) . Cultivating outdoors under the sun , the fan leaves do n't create nearly as much shade as they do indoors ( shabang , 03.13.2002 ) . This is consistent with the inverse squared light rule ; the sun is 149,597,890 km away so a few feet has no real effect on intensity . This suggests that a trimming benefit could be achieved outdoors as opposed to indoors however leaves only absorb about 15% of the solar energy that hits them , the other 85% passes through except for green light which is reflected , therefore removal of fan leaves would only provide a 15% increase light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 03.12.2002 ) removes fan leaves that are yellowing or starting to yellow ( these are usually on the lower stems ) and also mid-stem fan leaves that are shading buds . He always try to retain the upper 2 - 3 sets of fan leaves indoors as he believe they are the ones that are truly " working " . The concept of the upper fan leaves doing all the work is consistent with effect of the inverse square rule on lighting intensity indoors and the flow on effect for photosynthesis . In support for trimming HyGradeChronic ( 03.25.2002 ) states selective trimming benefits lower floral development , allowing the buds to fill out and tighten up better . However he does mention that humidity must be kept to a minimum as leftover stems from the leaf can develop mould unless kept at optimum humidity . Another flow on effect to leaf trimming mentioned by HydradeChronic is that it takes seven to ten days longer for floral development to finish , but the resulting florescence is at its peak from top to bottom . <p> An alternative to trimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light mover on a single plant the results are better thanks to the better penetration of light at different angles . Even simple under lighting and side lighting works well to counter fan leaves by adding extra light where it would not normally get ( Vapour , 03/13.2002 ) . <p> Increase upper bud development What folks need to focus on is the causes of premature leaf drop as that negatively affects yields . If you 've read my posts over the years , I try to pound that issue home whenever given a chance . After a good root development , the most important element in floral production is the retention of healthy leaves ( Thunderbunny as citied , by Nietzsche , 03.13.2002 ) . <p> Green Reaper ( 03.12.2002 ) suggests that large leaves actually take more energy to maintain than they produce . In contrast Thunderbunny ( as citied , by Nietzsche , 03.13.2002 ) states that when a leaf no longer serves a productive purpose , the plant will remove the leftover metabolites from the leaf , which causes the old spotty , yellowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf is gone , a percentage of what would be available carbohydrates for future plant growth is diminished in direct relationship to the loss . The mobility of plants sugars and nutrients suggests that fully developed fan leaves are sources not sinks . Whether developing fan leaves are a sink or a source however is not as clear . An actively growing leaf may be a sink , using energy from the other parts of the plant to fuel their development ( George , 03.20.2002 ) . Older developed leaves and that are sources . However there is no evidence to support that during the plants life cycle the development of fan leaves takes more energy then a fully developed fan leave provides , that is to say sink phase is greater than the source phase ( Nietzsche ) . It would also seem illogical from an evolutionary point of view that a plant would evolve to produce leaves that take more energy to sustain then they produce ( shabang , 03.13.2002 ) . <p> Trim fan leaves in the last 14 days to help speed up flushing It helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Homemadepot , 03.13.2002 ) . However the leaves should naturally yellow , too much green in the leaves translates to too much " green " taste in the leaves in my opinion ( Bigislandbud , 03.14.2002 ) . <p> Reducing the Stretch If trimming fan leaves reduced the stretch it is likely that this occurred because it takes away from the plant 's available energy stores and energy generators ( Shabang , 03.13.2002 ) . This method of reducing the stretch should only be used if absolutely necessary , other options include chemical treatment may be a more viable option . <p> HOW TO TRIM IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO SO If you decide to trim your fan leaves , one should always do it by clipping the petiole about halfway between the base of the fan leaf and the stem/branch . Allow the remainder of the petiole to dry up and fall off on its own . This will help protect the plant from risks of infections . They should never be stripped or broken off at the base of the petiole as that would be expose more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot stalk of a leaf ( 10k , 03.16.2002 ) <p> Leaf ( 03.13.2002 ) believes that excessive leaf trimming and branch pruning will cause the plant to use extra energy to repair itself . However , trimming must be done from time to time , for the longer a plant is left untrimmed , the more material must be removed at one time , therefore the greater the damage that the plant will need to repair . Do not trim fan leaves during veg either , unless they turn yellow . The first real pruning starts when going into 12/12 ( Jeast , 03.13.2002 ) . When trimming and pruning , I try to ensure that I do not cause the plant to ' bleed ' . Leaf tries to pinch off shoots and leaves with my fingernails as opposed to leaving a clean cut . One thing to remember is every time you cut into any part of a plant , you are exposing the inside of the plant to fungus and bacteria ( Leaf , 03.13.2002 ) . <p> Tuck instead of trimming Another method is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't forget that even though they wont be getting as much light they are still photosynthesizing and more importantly exchanging gases storing nutrients , and building sugars which the bud then converts into THC and other cannibinoids ( Ca , 13.03.2002 ) <p> The Evil M <p> 22-07-12 , 09:45 PM <p> Anyone tried these techniques on a 12/12 from seed grow ?

So I feel confident to say in earlie growth and before a single bud has appeared removing leaves is a major mistake ( But removing leaf/topping and shaping the plant is an acceptable measure IF needed ) . <p> Once the plant has started budding it will be using a large portion of stored energy to grow its bud , it is at this point that you want the plant to focus on growing its buds , the plant will be using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so removing some will , in my opinion , redirect the energy used to maintain those leaves into the bud . <p> But then removing the leaf will also reduce its energy intake , I cant say i 'm well educated on the plant we all love but I have been told a few times you want to expose the buds to more light to improve its THC levels , but I do not fully agree , the leaf is a structure built to take in light , carbon dioxide ect to produce sugars , the structure of a leaf is esentially covered by uncountable mini lungs , which will take in carbon dioxide and expell oxygen , such structure does not exsist on the actual bud and so therotically bud 's can not benefit from a light source ( I 'd have to get a microscope to confirm this ) . <p> So , defoliation is possibly maybe ; ) beneficial , at a very late stage in the plants budding process , 100% removal is a big no no , you are removing the plants ability to breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in photosynthasis . <p> On the other hand if you were to remove around 30% of its foilage ( In the tree world , you never want to remove more than 30% of a tree 's canopy at once as this will cause a great deal of damage to the tree and recovery time ) , I would say that is an acceptable measure , aiding in air circulation , exposing lower canopy to light . <p> So my conclusion is when my plants are budding , ill be removing around 30% of the leaf coverage in the belief that although this will have negative effects , it will also have some positive . <p> Edit : Another note , it takes Alot of energy for a plant to produce a leaf , more so a big/shade leaf , if you want to remove them , do it when they are smaller or you plant will have just spent a certain portion of its energy to grow a leaf , and after all that work , you remove it . ( Wasted energy ) <p> Sharkboh <p> 01-10-12 , 11:20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your post , when u say do n't remove any leaf until the plant grows buds , does that include the lower branches and leaves ? I tend to not stress the plant a week before switching to flower and then I leave it about a week in to flower to transform . Then between weeks 2 and 3 I gradually thin the bottom out , is this ok ? Buds start to form during week 2 of flower .... <p> ATM I have 2 G force flying Dutchman in flower , 4 weeks in . During week 2 I removed a fair mount of top fan leaves to create more light , plants look ok ATM , crystals coming along now , will keep u posted on the redults <p> Vador <p> 01-10-12 , 12:55 PM <p> That was both very informative and really interesting . I have always been lead to believe that removing leaves stresses plants and slows growth , thinking about it defoliation makes a lot of sense , as you said you need to eliminate the shade . Going to give this a try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those leaves chopped off <p> Sharkboh <p> 01-10-12 , 08:03 PM <p> It defo does n't stunt growth because mine still shot up and I had to tie them and move the light up ... Buds look decent size so far , hoping the crystals get there , got 400w hps and 2 x 25w UVB on two plants ... Light pen is good and air flow <p> Shinigami <p> 01-10-12 , 08:46 PM <p> Here 's an example of how I deleaf a girl who is 2 weeks into 12-12 ( flowering ) Before LONG ... LONG ... After LONG ... LONG ... Notice how , you can now see light all the way through the plant . This is a good thing for light , as opposed to seeing nothing but leaves in the before pic . Wait , did you say you wanted to see what kind of buds I get at the BOTTOM of the plant ? You get extensive bottom growth on defoliated plants LONG ... LONG ... This is on the morning of harvest . While some are obsessed with top growth I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms are this well developed the tops are certainly getting their share of light . Some guys like tops , some like bottoms . I like my girls to be equally well developed . Ready to Get Started ? You can start easy and try to save leaves but what happens when you see the results like all the mid growth exploding with the new exposure . It would serve logic that if you remove a little and there is good results than remove more and on and on until you get comfortable with stripping down these girls . I recommend you start deleafing as soon as your plants start looking ' bushy ' at all . Start with removing the fans from all the branches and watch the results . Then remove progressively more . Do n't remove any branches or sites if you want to commit to this method . The idea is shade removal , NOT budsite removal . Allow them to releaf for a week or so and remove again when they look leafy . This girl is 32 " sq . and under 30 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week flowering cycle as well as during veg . No shortage of branches or buds , all of them chunky and exposed . I ended up harvesting 12 ounces off her . Marijuana plants do not get like this on their own . Stripping in veg and throughout bud is the only way to get results like this . <p> Answer to the 3 Most Common Questions About Marijuana Defoliation 1 . ) Which Leaves Can Be Plucked ? All of them . That was the short answer . I remove everything that is easily pinched off with the thumbnail and forefinger . I keep a little bit of a cutting tool for a thumbnail specifically for that purpose . I do n't try to get in super close to the buds once they get sticky unless it is just intolerably crowded . Any leaf that is attached by enough of a peristem to be plucked easily is fair game . Bud leaves are attached deeper in the bud cluster and are difficult to remove by hand . I do not yank or pull down on the leaf . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stubs that are left , they dry out and fall off . Best not to try to cut so close to the plant , especially in mold prone climates. 2 . ) Can Defoliation Be Used with Any Growing Medium ? Yes . Medium is not a factor . Go with what you like . Defoliation works great for marijuana grown in soil , coco coir , perlite , vermiculite , DWC , bubbleponics , and any other growing medium that marijuana grows in. 3 . ) I 've Never Defoliated and Now I 'm Several Weeks into Flowering with Tall , BUSHY Out-of-Control Plants ... Can I Still Start Defoliating ? If you 've never defoliated before , go conservative to start , even if your plants look healthy . Do it moderately at first and a little more daily . Pluck fan leaves to prevent branches from growing taller . During the flowering stage , you 'll be able to see the increase in bud production . <p> So there you have it , a basic introduction to defoliation for huge yields . It 's about time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirety : LONG ... <p> So i have 7 plants , 2 or 3 of which i needed to get rid of , and one defo ( a sativa which would take longer to flower than the rest ) so i thought , what the hell , and i took roughly 150 leaves of it , its in its 5th week of veg , well , well into it ... and pretty much left all new growth , and a few smaller leaves , and took off 80% ish of the plant , i 'm hoping for all the pathetic tiny bud sites no bigger than my finger nail , which have been at that stage for weeks , due to being shaded alot from leaves , to grow a noticeable amount in the next 2-3 days , i ca n't follow it through to flower sadly , but thought i 'd give it a shot . <p> Bammbulance <p> 01-10-12 , 11:38 PM <p> Thanks bam , I am a little confused by your post , when u say do n't remove any leaf until the plant grows buds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to not stress the plant a week before switching to flower and then I leave it about a week in to flower to transform . Then between weeks 2 and 3 I gradually thin the bottom out , is this ok ? Buds start to form during week 2 of flower .... <p> ATM I have 2 G force flying Dutchman in flower , 4 weeks in . During week 2 I removed a fair mount of top fan leaves to create more light , plants look ok ATM , crystals coming along now , will keep u posted on the redults <p> Yeah I did n't really consider the stress , although I know plants i 'm still a novice when it comes to The Plant , I ca n't really say for certain but all plants get stressed from such a broad amount of reasons , I think as long as you do gradual removal , and make sure you do nice cuts ( Just above a node where a leaf or branch is growing with a Sharp knife ) . <p> Other than that im unsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grow up and running . : D <p> Sharkboh <p> 02-10-12 , 03:58 PM <p> Poet , thanks for the pictures , I have one question which I really need answering , does removing the leaves like you have done effect the quality of the bud ? <p> Those are NOT my pics nor is the article mine .

If I remove all the fan leaves will my plants die ? ? Iv'e read that cutting fan leaves stunts growth and bud production , is this the case ? ? <p> Beverley Stoned <p> 10-05-14 , 08:55 AM <p> I ca n't believe so many experienced growers are against this method . I 've tried it twice in veg on my current girls and the difference from previous attempts in staggering . Budsites galore . Ca n't wait to see how this translates in flower . The plants actually seem happier and healthier as a result , like if they 'd been weight training ! It 's a shame all this false info about it stressing the plants too much is keeping people from trying it as it did for me . Although obviously you have to use common sense and only do it when the plant is ready and I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , photosynthesise and get rid of heat . <p> Must say I 'm thinking twice about doing it long into flower though , do n't want to risk stress when it matters . I 'm also concerned it might extend the stretch period . Anyone experienced in this got an opinion ? <p> Stray <p> 12-05-14 , 06:54 AM <p> Good little read . <p> Brand new to cannabis cultivation so I did n't even know there was another way of doing it . Removing the leaves seems weird though , I thought it was the more leafs means the more light it can absorb . But fuck , if it works it works . <p> Special Branch <p> 12-05-14 , 08:36 AM <p> I 've also read that its the leaves that bring on the buds ... ie , do all the work <p> Stray <p> 12-05-14 , 01:27 PM <p> I 've been reading and someone said that it 's effective because it enables the leaves further down to absorb light and they 're closer to the root system . <p> That 's what I 've read anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bostin <p> 12-05-14 , 08:55 PM <p> I hope this works-stripped the fan leaves last week ( 3 weeks into flower ) on 3 Fruit punch-they seem to be growing well-fingers crossed my yield is higher ! ! : - ) <p> gohtee <p> 14-05-14 , 06:54 AM <p> fan leaves are used in vegetative growth to aid your plant in heigh and width . the " sugar leaves " on the bud help a great deal for flowering . it 's definitely a good idea to slowly start stripping away at the fan leaves when you flip to 12/12 , but do it over a period of time . less stress on your plant , more production going into buds . keep trimming them away until you have a thick canopy of colas. if you plan on revegging her then keep a bit more fan leaves , because then she 'll already have big leaves to absorb light and start growing again . cheers <p> Bacon1202 <p> 15-05-14 , 03:16 PM <p> I 've been skeptical with the defoliation method myself . But after doing some research and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little everyday and I must say they are thriving and bud development looks like it has increased by some so far . I 'm into week 3 of flowering at the moment wish me luck ! <p> Dr. Stoned 2.0 <p> 15-05-14 , 03:21 PM <p> I use defoliation around one week after start of true flowering or 3 weeks from 12/12 . Gradually deleting fan leaves for 3-4 weeks until the plants look like I want them to look . Does it works ? Well I just got 25oz from 4 plants under 720w leds in a 1m tent . So it does n't hurt and make plenty of air circulation . <p> uncleskunkle <p> 19-03-15 , 11:02 PM <p> Great thread . I too have great success using these methods . I would much rather train a few plants and grow big bushes where i can control the canopy than to grow lots of lanky plants that produce a bunch of useless lower buds . <p> waterdawg12 <p> 27-03-15 , 05:24 PM <p> I do defoilate sometimes ( still on the fence lol ) , its helped some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lolliepop due to my first branches produce some pretty big colas .

I have some cuttings and one from seen and on the cuttings there leaves are razor thin but the seed ones are fat .

I have been kinda lollypopping , but this could be better if I get half the success your pictures show ! I would think that an outdoor sativa would be better left alone but that just me thinking aloud . Not a sativa expert and certainly not a defoliator as it has never worked for me lol .

There is probably more to it than that . You say the seed plant is different from the clone right ? This probably has more to do with the fact it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years and I actually practiced it in my outdoor grows 30 years ago . Back in the day it was more to do with , make more bud sites , as it was thought the lower branches would grow better to replace the missing leaves and hence lower energy production . This was typically done in veg and once flowered , left alone . Now it seems the theory is it allows more light to the bud sites . I just think that if it actually was beneficial it would have been decided on either yay or nay .

I usually trim the leaves ie just take 1/2 of one or two fronds from the leaf . 50% + remains on the plant . I just trim if there are lower branches not receiving much light . Just a light trim of the branches that are restricting light to the lower branches . This is the best of both worlds IMO . You def keep a good percentage of leaf intact . Kind of like when grubs eat your leaves a portion will be consumed and ( hopefully ) some will remain . Intensive defoliation IME outdoors is counterproductive .

After a huge learning curve I have settled into a technique for tent growing that includes topping once , defoliation both during veg , and as well through out flower , combined with the " bending " and or tying down of braches .. <p> I think some are missing what is important as well though .. At least for me , I am not necessarily trying to get light all the way to the dirt .. Although that is fine , I am training ( bending ) branches so that am creating a " zone of buds " ( canopy ) that consists of an area only about 18 " into the plant ... The sweet zone .. If trained properly , there are very few popcorn type buds below that 18 " zone . And the few that are there , I pay no special attention to .. <p> I am a new grower , but can confirm a minimum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am actually getting upwards of 1 1/4 last grow and continuing to work on even higher yields .. <p> A big part is how many nodes I top to .. I am am still experimenting , but for the set up I have , it is starting to look like topping at 7 or even 8 nodes will yield the most .. I can not imagine growing any other way except as the OP has described ... <p> I do have a question about growth at the lower part of the plant while still in veg ... <p> Question : Should we ever clip any of the small branches from the lower area of the plant ... I have noticed a lot of these new and very small branches have in the past just been long and stringy with just a small amount of bud on them ... <p> So would like very much to hear how others who grow as the OP and I do , how you feel about this lower growth ..

I was thinking of bringing some weed home with me . I have 3 concerns : <p> 1 . If I DO get caught , assuming I 'm taking only 10 grams of weed , what will be my punishment if any ? <p> 2 . Is it better to just put it in my suitcase ( checked in baggage ) somewhere , or like hiding it inside a shampoo bottle ? I mean if they find it in my suitcase I can be innocent like : " oh sorry I forgot it there ... " but if they find it in the shampoo bottle , could be accused for smuggling ? <p> 3 . Can weed in plastic bag be seen inside a shampoo bottle in the X-ray machine ? <p> i go all the time , my buddy usually just get a small kinder egg style plastic container and sticks it in his baws , i do n't  risk it . last time they hade the full body scanner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid it so they are getting stricter , that was feb this year , i think , for ASOT 550 in den bosch . stayed in/near dam square this time rather than rembrandtplein area where i usually stay . was crapper quality hotel unfortunately but good area for getting about etc , <p> where you staying . i 'll sugest a few good shops nearbye. that was my 9th visit in 4 years . fecking love the place . usually go september and then begining of year . often wake up there if i go on a mad wan lol ... sadly missed this september weekend as i moved flat .. RAGING , LOL <p> will be back hopefully feb/march tho. its cheap to get to now from glasgow if book early enough . shame about living costs tho. got a new buddy who might sort me with free digs at his works sister otel over there , so getting cheaper still ... HELLLL YYYEhh <p> the ban wont stick in the dam anyway .... the people i know in smaller rural places say its strict there , but my understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policing it at his desecration , good luck getting re elected by all the small to medium business owners than will go bankrupt , from small hotels/ b&amp;b and stores to the vast amount of culinary outlets ... plus they always find a way to sell the product that poeple go there for . yes they get lots of " drug " tourists . but in reality the picture of shady bustards like us ai n't  the main stream tourists that go there for the weed culture . ranges from architects to doctors the works .. the revenue from us weed tourists is far , far to great to be ignored .. <p> j'boy <p> 10-10-12 , 08:41 AM <p> One thing to say DO NT DO IT <p> best option in my opinion also , its less risk to get decent seeds and grow urself. ass fingered for a few G , not my cup of tea ... my mate just missed the full body scan as i switched him in queue , that alone could have got us both jailed for it ... then they stopped him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly thought he was busted. it was right after passport check at gate , so i wondered over and calmed his nerves and said we were at a gig and feeling rough . luckily that was enough to put his nerves at ease , just ... and fuck all the hastle that comes with smuggling ... rest of ur life fucked for a few joints ... go hard or go home .. if i was thaqt strapped for weed and willing to risk my freedom over it it bring shit loads and get a train ... i value freedom and my kids to much for it .. for 10g .. no thanks i 'd rather just borrow it from my mate until mine was for harvest . <p> dynodave <p> 10-10-12 , 09:15 AM <p> the body scanner ur on about pal is n't for lookin at packages inside you , it for stuff hidden under ur clothing , guns bombs etc to do an inturnal body scan they need reasonable suspision <p> j'boy <p> 10-10-12 , 02:13 PM <p> the body scanner ur on about pal is n't for lookin at packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guns bombs etc to do an inturnal body scan they need reasonable suspision <p> lol no doubt if my mate got seen with a kinder egg in his boxers , he would have give suspicion enough , for a finger bashing lol ... maybe that 's what he was after tho wahahahahaha ... point is , not my cup of tea . <p> i asked to see it and they refused , fuckers , lol 10987 @qwx420987 <p> 10-10-12 , 02:21 PM <p> do n't  fuck about , refer to my original posts on the first page <p> if you take it on your person or in your case , then your a fucking dipshit. yeah they will probs caution you and let you go if your lucky <p> by why fucking risk it when you can stick it in the post and reduce the risk of being caught but 99% lots of useful info in my op 's , do it properly and your laughing 10987 @qwx420987 <p> 10-10-12 , 02:24 PM <p> put them in a fair few bags , and split that 10g into 2 jiffy envelopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will do is send you a letter letting you know about confiscation , they wo n't take any further action against you . chances are if you travel with it and its found you will atleast get a cuation could be worse . will help if you put something else in the envelope like a pen/phone charger <p> you want your post to blend into the similar envelopes , 90% chance it will make it to your adress no problems , make sure you pay enough postage and put a return adress on the back ( try to get a real one from amsterdam like a b&amp;b or hostel ) . <p> we all hear the stories of people pluggin it , putting it in coffee cups and candles but imo if you do it this way then your lacking braincells why take the risk when you can eliminate almost all risk involved with smuggling . this is tried and tested by more people then you can imagine , 2 words . silk road <p> joshy133 <p> 10-10-12 , 02:27 PM <p> Hi I 'm visiting Amsterdam this Thursday for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed home with me .

Buzzing man ....... <p> Dal <p> 19-10-12 , 05:28 PM <p> This is very true I got done for about an oz of hash nothing too bad a 110 fine and caution . Now whenever I fly my name must be on a list or something " black mark " as every time I travel I get pulled going out and coming back even in ferry ports as well . Right pain in the arse for not sticking it up arse ! Lol 1 a black mark on your passport , a night in the cells , a court apearance and a fine . Basically a kick up the arse . 2 and 3 no good in your baggage it will show up even in a bottle its better on ur person , stick it up ur arse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have any reason to put you through a scanner and pull it out in the car to get stoned on the way home . Buzzing man ....... <p> Amber Reef <p> 19-10-12 , 06:54 PM <p> i know the main method for getting it back or was a couple of years ago was thru the post , do n't  know if that method is the best way now but a couple of yrs back many were doing it this way and succeeding , my old man and his mates got caught with pre rolled reefers at amsterdam airport , they were taken off them and were all cautioned : ) . I 've never been myself but if i did go i 'd try the post method powder the bud flattened in a birthday card or summat and hope for he best : ) <p> dbuk <p> 20-10-12 , 12:07 AM <p> Body scanners can not see up your rectum , they are for spotting ceramic blades to stop hijackings suicide bombers and people Body packing kilos of herion or coke , they would have to X-ray you which they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for internal smuggling . Ie you have high drug readings on your person or baggage with suspicious flight patterns or they have been tipped off , you may well get a tug if they swab you and your baggage and there are traces of drugs found but you have been to dam on a bender they have bigger fish to fry ... Iv posted international loads of times and it 's never been intercepted , a guy I know used to get loads of brick weed from Africa sent wrapped in nothing but brown paper and tape no trouble for years , he got a letter saying his parcel has been confiscated or something like that and if he wanted to contest this to contact hmrc .... he did n't <p> nevertoohigh <p> 20-10-12 , 12:10 AM <p> why when we 're on a forum full of growing tips is it even worthwhile attempting to smuggle crappy ( no pun intended lol ) little bits home up your arse ? <p> nugget <p> 20-10-12 , 12:17 PM <p> If your insistant on bringing small quantities back my advice is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe in a johnny and up your bum if that 's your thing . Do n't  carry any form of paraphernalia associated with weed or cannabis culture , including slogan t-shirts , papers . As I said nothing associated in anyway . Then if you do get stopped the customs staff must have a plausable reason above suspicion to carry out any search beyond a bag search and quick pat-down and search of pockets . If it gets as far as anykind of body search then they have to gain further permision and show valid evidence of suspicion which unless your showing all the signs of guilt and shitting yourself they would find this difficult and labour intesive . There is always a risk . Be prepared to get caught and if you do , accept your failing . 10987 @qwx420987 <p> 20-10-12 , 12:24 PM <p> up ur arse or in the post ( the answer is a no brainer for me lmao ) i have just got back from amsterdam and everyone on our flight had to go through the body scanner ... i was n't happy about that started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lean we did n't  kick up a fuss and went through it **31;204;TOOLONG just thought that was good to know , body scanner then even a quick frisk search .... but ofcourse it wo n't see what you 've lovingly placed in your rectum <p> danod123 <p> 20-10-12 , 01:02 PM <p> I have been to amsterdam on a plane from uk 3 times in last 2 yrs and have bought about half oz of weed home with me each time . on each occassion not a single person from our plane was searched and have got it through no problem each time . the first time i was nervous and hid it between my cheeks but the last 2 times i and my friends have all just put it in a bag in our pockets of our clothes in our hand luggage . i think that this way if caught u can pass it off as a mistake that you have just forgot it was there . U have been in the weed smoking capital of the world after all . <p> Dal <p> 20-10-12 , 01:19 PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a gem sometimes !

@@46021961 @6021961/ <p> ok so i 've been all over this forum and about eight more and i keep seeing the same thing : people adding molasses to their plants once they get into flowering . what is the purpose of this ? ? i did read in one persons post that it is supposed to help the bud be " more frosty . " Is this correct , if I add molasses to the other nutrients that i use , will it help my buds produce more THC ? ? If so , why is n't everybody on the forum doing it not just a select few ? ? 10976 @qwx420976 <p> 06-05-11 , 09:11 PM <p> That sounds like a description of molasses that I 've given in the past : ) Basically yeah , it makes plants more frosty .

I find other boosters provide better bud development on a weight side of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trichs . Next time I 'm trying both together , hopefully it should be fine and not too much as when I used molasses ( well technically I used black treacle , same difference near enough ) I found it did n't matter how much I used , the more the merrier , it 'd take it all day long and not burn from it , furthering the whole sugar/red bull idea rather than a strong nutrient which would be more your protein shake , lol <p> crapdog <p> 06-05-11 , 09:32 PM <p> Thanks for the great question ; thanks for the great answer ! ! 10979 @qwx420979 <p> 06-05-11 , 09:34 PM <p> I hear a tablespoon in each feed after 2weeks of flower does the trick . <p> Normally you would water water feed water water feed , I assume you would wan na go - molasses+water water feed etc ... <p> I could be wrong though , as I have n't used it yet : ) <p> easterbunny <p> 06-05-11 , 09:58 PM <p> I hear a tablespoon in each feed after 2weeks of flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed water water feed , I assume you would wan na go - molasses+water water feed etc ... <p> Yes it 's a tad too much , but all strains are diff , some are highly sensitive to nutes , some are n't , so if it 's working , keep going , if it starts to shown signs of nute burn , reduce it . <p> Good luck : bong : <p> Azerbanphal <p> 07-05-11 , 11:13 AM <p> The main reason it 's good is n't the sugars - its the high amount of natural plant occurring potash ( potassium ) . <p> Best used in organic/soil based grows - mineral/hydro nutes tends to negate the benefits . <p> Mr Bloom <p> 07-05-11 , 11:21 AM <p> Blackstrap molasses for gardeners can work as a carbohydrate source to feed and stimulate microorganisms . And , because molasses ( average NPK 1-0-5 ) contains potash , sulfur , and many trace minerals , it can serve as a nutritious soil amendment . Molasses is also an excellent chelating agent .

I use 10l pots and once they start taking off they drink about 2 litres a day , though obviously plant size and temps will affect this ( I like big plants and my room is usually quite hot ) also depends if you have anything in your coco to aid water retention i.e. vermiculite or similar ( I do n't ) I need to water daily as the amount of water the pots can hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing worse than going in and they are all upside down .

@@46021966 @6021966/ <p> OK .. I have seen a number of threads with using this hydrogen peroxide and thought what was the advantages in using this stuff .. well here it is .. <p> Hydrogen Peroxide and Horticulture <p> Hydrogen Peroxide ( H2O2 ) is a clear sharp smelling substance very similar in appearance to water ( H2O ) . Like water it is made up of Hydrogen ( H2 ) and Oxygen ( O2 ) , however H2O2 has an extra Oxygen atom in an unstable arrangement . It is this extra atom that gives H2O2 its useful properties . H2O2 has been used for many purposes including cleaning , bleaching , sterilizing , rocket fuel , animal feed treatment and in addition many miraculous claims about its health benefits have been made . This article is n't about any of these ; instead it will concentrate on horticultural applications . H2O2 is of great use for both hydroponics and dirt/soilless gardening . <p> What Does Hydrogen Peroxide do ? H2O2 is an unstable molecule , when it breaks down a single oxygen atom and a molecule of water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach itself to either another O- atom forming a stable Oxygen molecule or attack a nearby organic molecule . Both the stable and O- forms will increase the level of dissolved oxygen . This is the method by which H2O2 is beneficial . Pre treating the water supply with H2O2will drive out the Chlorine many cities use to sterilize it . This will also degrade any pesticides or herbicides that might be present as well as any other organic matter . Well water can be high in methane and organic sulfates , both of which H2O2 will remove . Many disease causing organisms and spores are killed by Oxygen , the free Oxygen H2O2 releases is extremely effective at this . H2O2 will help eliminate existing infections and will help prevent future ones . It is also useful for suppressing algae growth . The free Oxygen atom will destroy dead organic material ( i.e , leaves roots ) in the system preventing them from rotting and spreading diseases . <p> Over Watering Roots require Oxygen to breathe and low levels are the main cause of almost all root diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same syndrome although it is rarely recognized as what it really is . Hydroponic crops often fail due to " root rot " and soil crops succumb to " over watering . " The real cause of both these problems is a shortage of Oxygen at the root zone . In a soil system the soil consists of particles , a film of water on the particles and air spaces between the particles . When too much water is put into the soil the air spaces fill with liquid . The roots will quickly use up what Oxygen is dissolved in the water , if they have n't drunk enough of the liquid to allow air back in to the soil spaces they will stop working . In this situation roots will start dying within twenty-four hours . As the roots die the plants ability to drink water and nutrients will decrease , this will cause symptoms of nutrient deficiencies ( mostly pale , slow , weak growth ) , and strangely they will start to wilt like they do n't have enough water . It is easy to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In a Hydroponic system the cause is a more direct simple lack of oxygen in the solution ; this may be from inadequate circulation and/or aeration . High reservoir temperatures also interfere with Oxygen 's ability to dissolve in the water . Temperatures above 70F ( 20C ) will eventually cause problems , 62F-65F ( 16C-18C ) is recommended . The same symptoms will appear as with soil plants but you can also check the roots . Healthy roots should be mostly white with maybe a slight yellowish tan tinge . If they are a brownish color with dead tips or they easily pull away there is at least the beginning of a serious problem . An organic , dirt like rotting smell means there is already a very good chance it is too late . As roots die and rot they eat Oxygen out of the water , as Oxygen levels are even further depleted more roots die , a viscous circle may be well under way . Reduced Oxygen levels and high temperatures both encourage anaerobic bacteria and fungi . The plants may still be saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hydrogen Peroxide prevents root rot/over watering . When plants are watered with H2O2 it will break down and release Oxygen into the area around the roots . This helps stop the Oxygen from being depleted in the water filled air spaces until air can get back into them . High Oxygen levels at the roots will encourage rapid healthy root growth . In a Hydroponic system H2O2 will disperse through out the system and raise Oxygen levels as it breaks down . Strong white healthy roots with lots of fuzzy new growth will be visible . This fuzzy growth has massive surface area allowing for rapid absorption of the huge amounts of water and nutrients needed for rapid top growth . A healthy plant starts with a healthy root system . <p> How to use it . H2O2 comes in several different strengths 3% , 5% , 8% and 35% , also sold as food grade Hydrogen Peroxide . The most economical is 35% which we recommend be diluted to three percent before using , as at this high concentration it can cause damage to skin and clothing . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you clean up any spills or splashes immediately , it will damage almost anything very quickly . This is extra important with skin and clothing . Skin will be temporarily bleached pure white if not washed cleaned . Gloves are strongly recommended when working with any strong chemical . <p> Food grade H2O2 can be diluted to three percent by mixing it one part to eleven parts water ( preferably distilled ) . The storage container should be opaque to prevent light from getting in and it must be able to hold some pressure . If three-liter pop bottles are available in your area they are ideal for mixing and storing H2O2 . There are twelve quarter liters ( 250ml ) in three liters , if you put in one quarter liter H2O2 and eleven quarter liters ( 250ml ) water in the bottle it will full of three percent H2O2 and the bottle can hold the pressure that the H2O2 will generate . Three percent Hydrogen Peroxide may be added at up to three ml 's per liter ( 2 12 tsp . Per gallon ) , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase to full strength over a few weeks . Use every watering even on fresh cuttings . For hydroponics use every reservoir change and replace twenty-five percent ( one quarter ) every day . Example : In a 100L reservoir you would add three hundred ml 's ( 3% ) H2O2when changing the nutrient . You would then add seventy-five ml 's more every day . <p> Where to get it . 35% food grade : called food grade because it has no toxic impurities . Of course your local hydroponics retailer , whom you can locate over the web. ( there may be shipping restrictions on high strength peroxides ) . 3%5% , 8% Can be found at most pharmacies , prices start at a less than a quid for a one hundred-ml bottle that will treat one hundred liters . <p> What to do if you already have root rot . <p> In Dirt : Use peroxide water with an anti-fungicide and a high Phosphate fertilizer ( 9-45-15 , 10-52-10 , 0-60-0 ) for root growth . Or any other product with rooting hormone dissolved in it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily until liquid pours out the bottom of the pot . This sound like bad idea , but it flushes out stagnant dead water and replaces it with fresh highly oxygenated water . Do n't let plants sit in trays full of water , the soil will absorb this water and stay too wet . Do n't water again until the pot feels light and the top inch or two of the soil are dry . <p> In Hydro : Change your nutrients . Add H2O2 to the system . This will add oxygen and chemically eat dead roots . If roots are badly rotted and can be pulled away by hand you should pull them off . They are already dead and will only rot , causing further problems . Add a fungicide to kill any fungus that is probably present in the rotted tissue to prevent it from spreading . Increase aeration of the water , get an air pump and air stones , or more of them , for the reservoir . An air stone under every plant is usually very effective , but will require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four hundred stones are available . Decrease the reservoir temperature , oxygen dissolves better in cold water and disease causing organisms reproduce slower as well . A good temperate range is 62F to 65F ; anything above 70F will eventually cause a problem . It is also a good idea to remove any wilty plants from the system and put them on a separate reservoir so they do n't infect plants that are still healthy . <p> Summary The key to big productive plants is a big healthy root system and Hydrogen Peroxide is a great way to keep your roots healthy . It is a must to ensure the biggest best crops possible and to increase the chances of your plants thriving to harvest . Peroxide users will rarely lose plants or crops to root disease and will harvest larger and more consistent crops . <p> hyperlite <p> 10-06-10 , 02:33 PM <p> great post i 'm a bit confused . at the start of the post it says its used just in hydro ( soiless ) and then at the end it thalks about in dirt ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . i used to use it for cleaning cuts and grazies when skateboarding , we used to use it at 100% the pain was unbeleavable but its the thing to use as it destroys all the dead tissue . and good for stopping scarring . <p> up2nogood <p> 10-06-10 , 03:21 PM <p> great post i 'm a bit confused . at the start of the post it says its used just in hydro ( soiless ) and then at the end it thalks about in dirt ? ? maybe i missed something ? il vouch for HP though . i used to use it for cleaning cuts and grazies when skateboarding , we used to use it at 100% the pain was unbeleavable but its the thing to use as it destroys all the dead tissue . and good for stopping scarring . <p> its used in both mate .. you just add some of it to the water when you give your plants a drink . <p> sqydro <p> 19-06-10 , 02:40 AM <p> yeah good post am nearly starting my bubbler grow and was going to buy some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot occurs or can i use it as a deterent ? <p> wert <p> 19-06-10 , 08:02 AM <p> its used in both mate .. you just add some of it to the water when you give your plants a drink . in soil it will kill the micro life both good and bad . <p> Cannalover <p> 19-06-10 , 09:35 AM <p> Hi mate was it you that put up a pic on here somewhere of the bells hp , ca n't remember , so its okay to use this food grade hp on plants then , where did you buy your hp from looks like it come from a chemist , sorry for all questions but i 'm after some of this stuff so if i can get it at my chemist then alls good . <p> wert <p> 19-06-10 , 09:49 AM <p> you can buy 3% hydrogen peroxide from chemists , hardware stores and supermarkets.it is supplied in higher concentrations but is a corrosive and higher % solutions need to be stored and handled with care . <p> Cannalover <p> 19-06-10 , 10:42 AM <p> Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3% on my clones then to help them root faster . <p> wert <p> 19-06-10 , 10:45 AM <p> 3% is too strong.dilute to about 0.5 % or even lower for young plants . <p> up2nogood <p> 19-06-10 , 10:51 AM <p> 3% is too strong.dilute to about 0.5 % or even lower for young plants . <p> well I have put some 6% in my small propagator lid bubbler and the roots have grown quite a bit since 2 days ago and no i 'll effect ... and I added some formulex in as well .. : ) <p> up2nogood <p> 19-06-10 , 10:53 AM <p> Thanks for the reply wert so its okay to use this 3% on my clones then to help them root faster . <p> I am sure they will be ok mate ..

I bet I had it then also , but ( being a noob ) never realsied this was a problem . It took around 2 months curing , but came good(ish) in the end . The Super Lemon is now developing the same characterisitics as the 1st grow , some of the little leaves around the higher buds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving from the end of the leaf inwards , &amp; the buds are taking on that same weird smell as 1st time . <p> I 've flushed the res through twice this arvo , with pH 'd water ; then added a weak ( 1.5EC ) mix , 14 litres ( around 1/2 an aquafarm res ) , pH 'd to 5.8 , with 40ml of 6% h2o2 , ( Bells ) but I 'm seeing people who add a 35% strength h2o2 to their res , to a mix of 3% ( This is where it gets confusing - a 35% strength h2o2 solution , added to make up 3% of the entire res mix ) <p> If those calc 's are correct , I 've not added any where near enough , &amp; of a relatively weak solution . ( 6% , compared to 35% ) BUT , I 've not used this stuff before , &amp; I 'm thinking too little is better than too much , She 's late in Flower now , maybe it 's damage limitation as opposed to cure ? <p> up2nogood <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first grow using hydro so maybe wait until someone with more experience comes in mate .. my water is at 25c and sometimes gets to 29c so I have to add iced water bottles to bring temps down . how close is your light to your canopy ? did you use the same place to grow last time ? this may help you but I am uncertain if this is correct but buildmeabutterfly is mostly correct as its his chart <p> That 's a handy list there mate , When I was adding h2o2 to the mix , I had the meter in , &amp; never got any increase in ppm whatsoever , so I rekon I 've used waay too little of the stuff ...

To be sure this does n't  happen to you , and to ensure the highest quality of your cannabisno matter what strain it isits important to take note of a few Key Points of Harvest Time . <p> Numero Uno <p> The first , and perhaps most important , aspect of harvesting cannabis is knowing exactly when to start chopping down the ladies . A precision harvest is essential for potent cultivation . Growers must be very careful not to cut down plants that are not yet at the pinnacle of resin production , but they must also be wary of cutting plants too lateat a time when THC production has curtailed and resin glands begin to degrade . <p> There are various methods by which even the most amateur grower can tell when buds are truly ripe for the picking . The simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or long hairs , that cover the plants buds . At the onset of flowering , these pistils are white and stringy . But as the flowering period comes to an end , they begin to turn color , first from white to orange and then again to a dark red or brown . These color changes signify the maturation of the buds ; however , the color and time frame may vary significantly across different varieties of cannabis . <p> Therefore , a better , yet slightly more complicated , method for determining ripeness is through trichome examination . Trichomes are the actual resin glands that contain THC and other psychoactive cannabinoids , and they are very delicate and easily ruptured . These trichomes are visible on the outside of buds and small leaves and look like little white sugar crystals to the naked eye . However , with the power of a magnifying glass or simple microscope , you can see that trichomes are comprised of a stalk and resin head and are clear or white in color . <p> As with pistils , trichomes also begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scenario , a grower wants to harvest buds before they get too dark in color . Even a subtle amber hue in these glands could mean that cannabinoids have begun breaking down and decomposing , which means less potent pot . Using a magnifier between 50x-100x , advanced growers look for a creamy or milky white color in trichomes that tells them its time to harvest . <p> The Catch <p> As with most tricks of the trade , there is always a catch . And in this case it can be taken quite literally as well , because when checking your buds for ripeness you 'll want to " catch " any and all clues that can signal maturationa few weeks before harvest time . Having a " harvest heads-up " can be extremely beneficial for growers , not only to prep equipment and rooms for drying and curing , but also to prep the plants for taste and smooth smoking . <p> If a grower can consistently examine trichomes and keep accurate time records from the start of the flowering photoperiod ( 12/12 light cycle ) , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushing out the grow medium in preparation for the harvest . <p> The Two-Step Flush <p> The last two weeks of flowering should be spent getting rid of any built-up nutrients in the growing medium , a process called leaching , or flushing . By removing all access to nutrients , the plant begins to consume its stored food reserves . These reserves are nasty compounds that we do n't want in our smoke , such as sugars , starches and various other elements . Harvesting plants that still have these undesirable elements present will only result in a harsh smoke and terrible burnability . <p> Flushing should begin about 14 days before harvest by stopping all nutrients and using only pure water to feed the plants . By providing no nutrients , you force the plant to rely only on what is left in the growing medium to feed on . The actual act of flushing is achieved by over-irrigating the medium until the nutrients inside are dissolved and washed out the bottom of the container . The best way to do this is with a two-step flush technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First , flood the grow medium with a heavy dose of water and wait a few minutes to allow all of the salts ( nutrient buildup ) to break down . Then add more water to chase out the first dose . By waiting a few minutes after adding the first dose of water , you 're allowing enough time for the water to dissolve the salts . As salts decompose , they can be effectively flushed out by the second dose . Traditional leaching usually employs only the first flush of water , which is n't always adequate for complete dissolution . <p> A few days after flushing , you should notice signs of nitrogen deficiency . The leaves will go from dark to light green , eventually turning completely yellow . Another sign is a reddening of the leaf stems , starting at the center of the leaf where the blades come together . <p> Test your flush by snapping off a leaf and tasting the juice that flows from the stem . If the taste is bitter , there 's still plenty of food in the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pure water , the plant is clean enough for harvest . The bitterness is from nutrients and other chemicals that you definitely do not want in your smoke . <p> Dry Air = More Resin <p> One final flush should occur a day or two before harvesting , with the final 24 hours of the gardens life being spent in relative dryness . This last deluge should be done with fresh water and can be a single or a two-step flush , depending on how much fertilizer was applied previous to the final two weeks of flowering . This will be the final watering your plants ever get . In doing this , you help ensure that the plants will begin to slowly dehydrate as you approach harvest , which in turn will aid the plants in their final hours of resin production . <p> Some gardeners even like to allow their medium to go bone-dry before harvesting . The idea is that resin production seems to skyrocket if the medium is allowed to dry before harvesting , but this is n't due to dry medium it 's due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden is low , your resin production will increase . This is a natural response cannabis has to dry air , an attempt to protect itself from hot , dry conditions . Marijuana resin actually has one of the highest UV-resistance ratings in the plant kingdom . The resin reflects light , preventing the buds from getting sunburn . ( This is also why it 's so easy for helicopters to spot marijuana from the sky ; it glows when seen through UV-sensitive equipment . ) <p> Lowering the humidity in the room on that last night before harvest morning will ensure increased resin production , without having to let the medium go bone-dry first . Additionally , some growers like to subject their gardens to prolonged dark periods of up to 24 hours just before cutting , claiming they notice spikes in resin production . This is all right as the low humidity will cut down on light uptake anyway , plus it helps to make sure liquid foods within the plants drain down to the root zone . <p> Harvest &amp; Manicure <p> When the big day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light period begins in the growroom . If the grow lamps turn on , its okay to cut them completely and work by standard room lighting . Begin by cutting the entire plant away from the root ball . If the plants are too large to harvest with one cut at the bottom , start by cutting the larger , heavier branches first . Remember to leave one or two larger stems connected to the branches you are cutting off . These stems will form nice " Vs " on the branches for easy hang drying . <p> Most indoor growers begin taking off the large fan leaves about a week before actual harvest . This is a good idea , especially once these leaves begin paling from green to yellow in color . Continue your harvest by taking off all leaves not associated with the buds and then move on to trimming off the smaller sugar leaves . Look for leaves with little resin coverage first and then move into the interior of the nuggets . Its easier to remove leaves within the buds once they have dried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second round of manicuring . By turning buds over and getting to the underside of smaller sugar leaves , it becomes easier to snip away at the stem and remove the entire leaf . Many growers like to only trim off leaf edges that come out of buds , leaving an aesthetic shape to the bud with the heavily resinated portion of the sugar leaves still intact within the buds . <p> Once the plants are cut , trimmed and manicured to perfection , it is best to hang branches upside down on strings strung across open spaces to get maximum air flow over your buds . Keeping buds on the branches does slow the drying , as the branches do retain some water however , this is the easiest way to completely surround buds with dry air without using drying chambers or machines . <p> Drying for Taste and Burnability <p> Now that you 've harvested and are ready to dry and cure , you will want to preserve as much of the vibrant color and taste of your herb as possible . Buds should hang dry for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 50 percent humidity . You want to get most of the water out of the buds in those first days and then slow the process down for another week or so during the curing process . <p> Remember that a plant is not dead upon cuttingit is still very much alive . A plant is effectively dead when the water pressure inside is too low to continue vascular movement . In other words , when the waterworks stop , the plant is dead . The goal here is to dry the plant as evenly as possible and at a nice slow pace . When buds are rapidly dried , the plant tissue can trap in unwanted starches and nitrates which cause buds to burn unevenly and with an awful taste . <p> At four to five days into the dry , the tips of some buds might be dry enough to pluck off and sample . After the buds have gone through their full cycle of drying , we want to slow the whole thing down and draw the rest of the moisture out very gradually . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your herb is harvested correctly , there is very little need for long cures . Long cures are needed to make harsh herb smoke smoother . If you start out with smooth , clean herb , there 's less need for long cures . Most buds should be cured and ready to smoke in less than two weeks after the drying period . Expert growers who harvest properly can complete curing in five or six days , but a good average can easily range from 10 to 14 days . <p> Inexperienced growers often tend to get impatient and only cure for a few days , but this can be a costly mistake when it comes to potency . Allowing the buds to cure evenly , which means drying at a slower rate , removes moisture within the buds so that all the THC can be converted in its psychoactive form . <p> The curing process evens out the moisture levels in the herb . You want the same amount of moisture in the center of the buds as you do on the outside of the buds until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herb too fast can trap moisture in the middle and not allow for a proper cure . <p> For the curing process , you want to put the half-dried buds into air-tight containers . Inside the container , the buds will become evenly moist , inside and out , as they begin to " sweat . " You can check to see if your buds are sweating and releasing moisture by gently squeezing them between your fingers to see if they feel damper than they did a few hours before sealing them up . Glass jars with rubber seals and lockdown lids are the best option for curing , but for large amounts of harvested buds , you 'll need something much bigger . Tight-sealing rubber or plastic bins are the best option for large quantities of buds but many growers feel these containers impart a plastic-type taste onto the buds . This can be offset by adding a small slice of lemon or orange peel to the bins toward the end of your cure . <p> Once the buds are again evenly moist , open the containers to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to the curing process . Not only do they prevent condensation from forming in your curing bins , but the fresh air is drier than the air you just allowed to escape from the container . The moisture still trapped in the herb will again slowly escape and moisten the new , fresh air . Open the container several times a day to exchange the moistened air with fresh air to slowly draw out the moisture in the buds . Eventually ( again , one to two weeks ) the moisture level in the herb will be at the right level to stash away and , of course , smoke ! <p> What Time of Day to Harvest ? <p> Timing the harvest is Paramount to the final quality . Harvest your precious buds in the dark , just before the lights normally come on . If possible , do not allow the plants to see direct light as long as their roots are attached . Direct light on a plant will draw up stored starches and sugars from the root system . <p> During the nighttime hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that they made during the daylight hours . During " lights out , " starches and sugars produced by photosynthesis during the day drain downward to the roots . Knowing this , it is easy to figure out that you want to cut your plants away from the roots before the lights come on , when food moves back upward into the buds . <p> Outdoor herb is often harvested during the daytime hours and the result is a harsh , difficult burn and an extra long cure . The starches and sugars present in daytime-harvested herb act like fire retardantsnot the effect we 're looking for . In addition to tasting and burning bad , these fire retardants also change the chemical make up of the smoke you 're ingesting . This means that the THC , cannabinol , cannabidoil and other active cannabinoids ca n't burn at the perfect temperature to get you properly high because they have n't properly converted to their psychoactive forms . <p> Facts on Drying &amp; Curing <p> During the drying of marijuana buds , THC is converted from an acidic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets you high . This is why fresh marijuana is generally weaker than properly dried and cured buds . <p> Marijuana will lose approximately 75 percent of its weight during drying due to water evaporating from plant matter . <p> Buds dried too fast will be frail and may start to crumble . Keep humidity between 45 and 55 percent in your drying room to prevent this and to help keep aroma and flavor locked in . <p> Buds are done drying and ready for curing when stems snap when bent rather than just folding over . <p> Air exchanges during curing should occur every four or five hours with curing bins left open for 10 minutes at a time . <p> Sgt Bilko <p> 22-04-10 , 09:12 PM <p> Very interesting thread , without a doubt !

The reason I ask is because the first lot were coco , and now the 2nd lot are in JI2 but with coco mixed in . Two different mediums same problem , the only common factor is the coco . <p> I would n't have thought ji2 would have been to rich for them , I know it 's not designed for cuts and seedling but I use it quite often to germinate seeds and never have a problem , in fact I have some autos in my diary now that were germinated in JI2 and they 're fine . If it was a problem of the soil being to rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips of the leaves working downwards , like nute burn , your yellowing seems to be coming from the new growth in the centre , working it 's way out . If you are able to , I would re-pot again , but forget the multi purpose and the coco , and just go JI2 + about 25% perlite . <p> b.t.y <p> 16-05-10 , 06:50 PM <p> Hey Percy . Am pretty sure the coco is fine . I got it from a mate who had it for about two hours out of the shop anduis plants are in coco alone . I am convinced it 's the grow space . My room is in a basement with not alot of fresh air . I have removed the White plastic sheeting the I had on the floor as it seemed to start happening when I put that in .

The plant will think it is suddenly in the depths of winter and about to die , so it 's self survival mode will kick in , by that I mean because it has n't been pollinated , it will start to chuck out male flowers to try and pollinate itself . Self preservation . You say you are force flowering because you do n't want your plant to get much bigger , we only have about 3 or 4 weeks before outdoor grows in the UK start to flower naturaly , personally I would leave it .

@@46021971 @6021971/ <p> The traces of cannabis can stay in your system for a long time . After the thc have done its job and releases from the receptors it continue to circulate in your blood .

The strength of the drug is determined by the amount of THC it contains which varies from plant to plant . Marijuana stays in your system for different amounts of time depending on how often you smoke it , how much you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) . <p> More information about passing a drug test If you smoke it occasionally it will remain in your system for up to 10 days . <p> If you smoke marijuana on a regular basis it will stay in your system for as long as 45 days , and if you smoke marijuana at a constant pace , it can stay in the body for 90 days . Marijuana is fat soluble . It stores in the fat cells of the body , the brain , the liver , the kidneys , in other words the major organs . <p> Delta-9-THC enters the bloodstream rapidly after smoking ( in minutes ) or more slowly when ingested orally ( 20 minutes to 1.5 hours ) . It is rapidly metabolized into inert molecules known as metabolites . These chemicals also have the word Tetrahydrocannabinol in them and are called THC , which can be quite confusing . <p> Delta-9-THC is detectable in the blood for a few hours . <p> So even if you do n't eat the THC will be stored in other places also , not eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 04:19 PM <p> to be honest it was years ago so I ca n't really remember my ' regimine ' , i just would go as long as I could i guess . One problem i do see with it is that when you do n't eat your body does two big things that could get in the way of your plan . <p> first , metabolism slows down and second what it does manage to metabolize is internal body-fat . Unless you are totally anorexic with a 0% body fat ratio there will still be lipids in your blood stream ( i should also mention that ' fat ' can come in many forms called lipids ) . That internal body fat i think would still get you in the end .

Any fat circulating in my blood at this point should be fat that 's heading for burning . If that 's correct I do n't  see how any thc/metabolites could stay in my system for any longer than it normally stays in my blood . Which I have read to be somwhere around 48 hours . <p> Another number of plausible detection times in blood is up to two weeks .

You 'd have to be walking around at 0.00% body fat and the food you were eating would have to be digested and passed through before your body had the chance to store it as fat . Not a chance .

It selectively binds with high affinity to central benzodiazepine receptors , which are located in a- and -subunits of GABAA receptors ( Salgueiro et al . 1997 ) ; this anxiolytic activity is not associated with the unwanted side effects caused by synthetic benzodiazepines , such as muscular relaxation , amnesia , and sedation . Apigenin inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) , a cytokine primarily expressed by monocytes and macrophages ( Gerritsen et al . 1995 ) . TNF-a induces and maintains inflammation , a pathological condition in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis . THC decreases TNF-a , probably by a nonreceptor-mediated mechanism ( Burnette-Curley and Cabral 1995 ) , although one study suggested THC might induce TNF-a ( Shivers et al . 1994 ) .

I 've carried hash , E and charlie abroad on countless ocassions using this method i used to stick it down my boxers but all you do is get para and look out for dogs ..... you take your chance but if caught give your friend or partner all the spending money and tell them to have a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know whether you guys have seen those vids from the ex police ' how not to get busted ' but from reading a few similar threads to this no one ever says that wrapping the weed/hash at the latest time possible before boarding a plane or posting it in the mail as everything is porious and after time the smell will seep through what ever you wrap it in ....... so my advice on wrapping it up is do it as late as possible and make sure you wash your hands alot as said <p> but personally not worth the risk with chances of getting it at the festival are HIGH ! <p> supersillybilly <p> 04-04-11 , 06:06 PM <p> The old wrapped in cling film taped under the armpit does the job for small amounts .

@@46021982 @6021982/ <p> Just over a month ago I used a microscope on a Mj plant for the first time ever . The first thing I see are tons of small clear or cloudy spheres under ea leaf . I assume they 're spidermite eggs because they look exactly like every picture I 've seen of them . Considering there were about 100 in any given 5mm circle , I can assume I have millions if not billions of eggs . The problem is that would take millions of mites to lay and I could n't find any . So I shook the plants over white paper and after several attempts I found three little translucent red critters . They looked a lot like a s-mite , but I think they were smaller , maybe 1.5x as long as an egg is wide not counting the legs/antenna . And there were six legs and two large segmented antenna out front they used to feel their way around , not walk on . The antenna were longer and thicker than the legs with maybe 8-10 segments . It 's been over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more mites to be found , but I do see these " eggs " on new growth too , not always , but usually . So who laid them ? They pop easily , if I rub or squeeze the leaf leaving a clear liquid smear . Is it possible they 're just droplets of plant juice which the sugars or whatever dried on the outside to create a kind of shell ? That would make more sense than invisible mites that never hatch . <p> So to recap ; they 've been there at least 5 weeks , but probably much longer . It seems none have hatched . They appear on new growth yet no egg layers to be found ... <p> This is in soil growing from seeds for 3 months now . 78-80 deg , humidity varies from 20-50 . Room/house has never been used to grow or had any kind of plant in it for years . <p> physiologia <p> 26-02-10 , 12:42 AM <p> I do n't suppose you have access to a compound microscope do you ? <p> chevota <p> 04-03-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand held cheapie . I noticed that since the plant is flowering that there are some " eggs " on top of the small leaves coming out of the top of the buds , but these " egg " looking things have a stalk , trichomes ! So I really think these eggs I 'm seeing all over everything are really just part of the plant , but it 's weird how they look exactly like every egg picture I 've ever seen in books or online . <p> BURNZ <p> 04-03-10 , 06:15 AM <p> PMFSL ! ! ! ! !

Well everything except the adult mites . <p> wert <p> 03-05-10 , 11:42 PM <p> have you used a scope to see what 's going on ? surely they have hatched something by now . could be eggs from some flying pest , whitefly , moth . <p> chevota <p> 04-05-10 , 07:33 AM <p> I have a little 60-100 scope which is how I first found them . I had never looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what 's normal . I harvested those plants last week , but the batch of clones I made from them has the " eggs " too . Not nearly as many , and most have just a few if any , but one leaf was covered with thousands . They look exactly like the picture of mite eggs , and look a lot like the head of a trichome except they are perfectly smooth and round and will pop leaving watery fluid if you squish or wipe them with a finger . They are mostly clear , some cloudy and a few are almost smokey white . 99% appear under the leaves , even on dead spots , very very few on the top side , and very few on yellowing leaves or new growth . On the buds of the original plants and these clones all I see are normal trichomes , but the beginnings of the trichomes on the buds looked like eggs at first until they grew a stalk . But this is only on the buds , the spheres under the leaves do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With my first post I was really expecting people to say those spheres are normal , but so far not a word .

If you do n't see any sign of pests then I would not be worried , just keep an eye out for any little critters . <p> Like wert says it could be eggs from another insect . <p> wert <p> 04-05-10 , 08:15 AM <p> are you sure they are not trichomes that have formed on the underside of your leaves ? <p> skunk575 <p> 04-05-10 , 09:32 AM <p> are you sure they are not trichomes that have formed on the underside of your leaves ? <p> Am with you on this one wert with what he has said as i get trichomes appearing on the top and underside of my leafs all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When I was reading this I too was thinking all the way , they are blatently just trichromes , lol , you want those fuckers ! <p> But you shook the plant and got 3 red bugs out ? hmmm <p> chevota <p> 05-05-10 , 09:14 AM <p> The real trichomes are just not the same . The first trichs I found looked like the eggs at first , then when I looked more carefully it was obvious they are not the same . Just like the pix in this thread , similar , but no . Trichs do not appear hazy/white in Veg , or pop leaving a clear fluid . The eggs are not sticky , they 're perfectly smooth/round , and they all sit directly on the leaf surface . Also , they rarely appear together , 99% of the trichs are on the buds , 99% of the eggs are under big leaves . They do n't seem to be attached well either , but it 's hard to tell because they are so fragile . When I try to move one with a needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped first . The needle to egg ratio in both size and strength was like a 6 ' digging bar to a Dove egg yolk . The eggs and trich heads are basically the same size , with the eggs being a bit bigger on avg . Even tho they look exactly like all the egg pix I find online , I 'm convinced they are n't since they never hatch , but still wondering what they are .... <p> Thanks for all the replies people . 10989 @qwx420989 <p> 02-04-11 , 09:34 AM <p> PMFSL ! ! ! ! !

In her announcement Ms Smith indicated the new penalties would come into force at the time of the upgrading of cannabis to class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty system for cannabis possession means that the penalty issued is directly related to the number of times an individual has previously been caught in possession of the drug . <p> If an adult is caught in possession of cannabis : <p> 1 ) for the first time - they will be issued with a cannabis warning . A cannabis warning is a spoken warning given by a police officer , either on the street or at the police station . The police have the option of using a cannabis warning when someone is caught with a small amount of cannabis for personal use . <p> ' Cannabis warnings ' were first introduced in 2004 as a way for police to respond to cannabis possession offences while the drug was at Class C. However , cannabis warnings issued during the period that cannabis was a Class C drug ( bewteen January 29 2004 and January 26 2009 ) will not be carried forward . <p> 2 ) for the second time - They will be issued with a Penalty Notice for Disorder ( PND ) for cannabis possession . PNDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an incident or in custody - they carry an on-the-spot fine of 80 . <p> Please note : as of January 23 2009 , the introduction of PNDs is awaiting parliamentary approval . The Government has indicated that the introduction of PNDs for cannabis possession will go ahead as soon as possible , subject to the agreement of parliament . <p> 3 ) for the third time - police officers will consider further action . This could include release without charge , caution , conditional caution or prosecution . <p> 4 ) any additional times - According to government statements all subsequent offences are likely to result in arrest . <p> Vacuum packing is the best way , after all , that is a common method used by pro smugglers as the actual pressure of the atmosphere is keeping any smells from escaping but as has been said , you 've also got to be smell free yourself so freshly washed clothes are worn that have n't been exposed to cannabis smoke or been anywhere near it . Also , wear shoes or trainers that you 've never smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and anything illegal you 've taken whilst wearing them will set alarms off and cause them to scrutinise you further and if you do smoke pot before leaving you might as well stick a sign on your head saying " over here Fido .

There is a school of thought that say a seed planted upside down will germinate quicker . I 'm not sure how true that is but planting it that way does indeed help the seed to push through the soil , as the tap root goes up slightly &amp; then down . Most people here probably don'tr know about it but a lot of old growers do it that way <p> GreenThumbRob <p> 14-04-11 , 06:08 AM <p> " Marijuana seeds should be placed with the POINTED END UP into a prepared cannabis seeds germination bed or just good soil at a depth of 1/2 to 3/4 inch . The embryo tap root emerges from the pointed ( stylar ) end and the natural method of growth is for this root to make a turn and grow downward ( see the illustration ) This bend formed by the downward curve of the taproot is what emerges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward helps the new plant to loosen and cast off the seed case when it breaks through the surface . If the cannabis seeds are placed with the pointed end down , the embryo will be required to expend a great deal of its stored energy for twisting and turning to position the tap root when it realizes that it is heading the wrong way ( see illustration of germinating marijuana seeds ) The seedling will need this energy to exert the forces required to later lift its head ( now enclosed by the two halves of the seed case ) above the soil , cast off the seed case and then spread its two embryo leaves and begin the life-giving photosynthetic process . This is a critical stage in growth and carelessness in placing the marijuana seeds will exhaust even the most hearty seedling and result in a slow start and a feeble plant in later life . Cannabis seeds should be placed in a small hole at a depth of 1/2 to 3/4 inch . An excellent medium for germination is a mixture of rich humus and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soil needs a ph of 7.5 to 8.0 and should not be so moist that it sticks to your fingers . If the medium is too moist , the seeds will rot and ferment before they can sprout . A simple test for moisture is to stick a pencil into the soil and if soil adheres to it when removed , then it is too moist . Sort of like when you test a cake by sticking a straw into it to see if it is baked through to the middle . The ideal is not too moist , and not too dry - and be sure that the soil is well-drained . Research has shown that a soil temperature that is at , or slightly above , the air temperature promotes the best survival rates and growth , " ( Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds , 2011 ) . <p> DoobyDude <p> 16-04-11 , 02:27 PM <p> All you have done is copy and paste the text from the link in my OP ... it 's this text that I was questioning - I already know what it says ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with the sprouting stage . <p> teutonic <p> 16-04-11 , 07:19 PM <p> hmmmf all i 've ever done is pop them in the soil after a 24hr soak in a shot glass .

From every seed I 've seen germ the tap root seems to curl back down the seed .

Good luck with your grow ! <p> midwestmachine <p> 30-04-11 , 04:48 AM <p> If you think about how a seeds would land if being dropped that 's how it should be , the pointy end is lighter so that end would stay up as the heavy end would hit the ground.When you Germ check out how the root comes out of the pointy end and curls down towards the other end.This way the root goes down and then pushes the seed up once established.What I do is if the seeds are only a lil germed i put the pointy end up so it can naturally curl and push.If the seeds are really germed and have a large tail and are past the curl stage i plant the root down in the soil and it pushes the seed case up and off.You can just toss em in there and they 'll correct automatically.The idea is to put less stress on the plant to break the soil surface easier.Thats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might make them stronger but IDK <p> medMUser <p> 20-02-16 , 04:09 AM <p> Not trying to argue , but seeds should ideally ALWAYS be ' pointed end up ' . Take a look at the picture on the right . I have been growing for over 10 years . Not that I know it all , not even close .

You can get by putting the seed any way you want , but not recommended . <p> But for the best shot at success , it 's always ' pointed end up ' .

And on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Like I said , you can get away with placing the seed any way you want , sideways is 2nd best , but the seed has it 's own way of doing things .

But time &amp; plant energy is always lost . <p> When a pot seed cracks the tip always goes straight up the direction the point is in , but only for a very short distance . After that it turns down toward the fat end &amp; thinks it 's headed to deeper earth . If ' pointed end up ' , it does head for deeper soil .

@@46021989 @6021989/ <p> Hi Guys ... I found this while surfin the good old net ... May be of some help to people . <p> Plants and Humidity Humidity has a major impact upon the overall performance and final yield of plants grown indoors . The level of humidity will alter how your plants function and if you can successfully take control of it as a grow room environmental factor then you will see a significant improvement in the performance of your plants . This article intends to explain in straightforward terms what humidity is , how it affects plant development at various life-stages and what you can do as a grower to manage your humidity for maximum effect . <p> Humidity Explained Humidity refers to the amount of water vapour that the air holds at a given time . It is usually expressed as a percentage in relation to the maximum amount of water vapour that the air will hold at current temperatures . This particular and most common form of humidity measurement is known as Relative Humidity ( RH ) and is usually expressed as a percentage . Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are directly related , i.e. the warmer the air , the more water vapour it can hold . So , at 100% humidity the air can not hold any additional water vapour - unless the temperature were to change . <p> Plants and Humidity : Introduction A common misconception in indoor gardening revolves around the idea that plants do not like high levels of humidity . This quite simply is n't true ! Plants love high humidity ( especially in vegetative growth ) , but all too often indoor growers create low humidity environments to avoid potential pathogens that are not really an issue until the flowering stage . This " play it safe " attitude is understandable as nobody wants to have a fungal or bacterial problem but through careful humidity management throughout your plants growth you can avoid any such problems whilst also significantly improving your growth rates . <p> Plants and Humidity : The Science Your plants ability to remain suitably hydrated and capable of absorbing the necessary nutrients for growth greatly depends on how efficient water transportation is within their systems . The humidity of your growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling factor on how much moisture transpires from your plants and therefore how water is moving through the plant from roots to leaves . <p> To understand the effect of humidity on water transport there are a couple of points you need to understand . Firstly , water tends to move from high humidity areas to low humidity areas . Secondly , the humidity inside plants has been found close to 100% . The rate at which water leaves your plants ( via transpiration ) will increase the lower the humidity in your grow room . Since the humidity inside your plants falls in the region of 100% , the humidity of the growing environment will also need to be relatively high to avoid potentially damaging over transpiration . This is particularly relevant before fruits and flowers begin to form . <p> Obviously , if humidity is very low then plants will lose too much water leading to the threat of damage caused by dryness . Consequently , the development of new leaves may suffer , older leaves could curl or even shed , and flowers/fruit occasionally die before or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not desirable , high humidity can cause problems too . Excessively high humidity and serious lack of ventilation sometimes encourages the spread of fungal diseases including Botrytis ( Bud Rot ) and Mildew , as well as stem and root infections in the very worst cases . However , with a reasonable amount of care and the right equipment this scenario is very easy to avoid . <p> Plants and Humidity : Recommendations According to Different Life-Stages Although the following recommended levels of humidity apply to most plants it is worth noting that exceptions do exist . For example , the majority of species respond positively to 50-80% RH during vegetative growth , but Cacti prefer much lower settings of 30-35% . Please only use the suggestions that follow as a guide . <p> Since humidity is clearly an important factor , we highly recommend investing in some basic monitoring equipment to allow you to accurately monitor and measure your humidity levels . Your cheapest option is a Humidity Dial hygrometer which will give you clear , accurate readings of relative humidity at very little expense . For only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combo Meter , which precisely reports both humidity and temperature . <p> Young Cutting and Seedling Stage At the beginning of your plants life relative humidity should ideally be between 70-80% RH . Use of a Hi-Top , Aeroponic , Jumbo Aeroponic or X-Stream Heated Propagator will enable you to create these conditions with minimal fuss . All of them incorporate ventilation panels which can be opened and closed to preserve , increase or decrease humidity when deemed necessary . A high humidity setting is advisable when plants are young because it encourages them to devote most of their energy to growing roots and foliage rather than attempting to correct the humidity balance by over transpiring . As a result of increasing the humidity at this crucial stage , roots form at a faster rate , plant health improves and growth is significantly more vigorous . <p> Vegetative Growth Stage When your plants are ready to be moved out of a propagator and into their main growing environment the optimum relative humidity should be around 50-80% RH . Creating an enclosed grow room using reflective sheeting or by using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . The suggested humidity in vegetative growth are slightly lower than they were in propagation because at this stage your plants will start growing leaves and shoots at a rapid speed , increasing the surface area from which water is able to transpire . This puts less strain on each leaf in terms of transpiration meaning the difference between humidity inside and outside every plant does n't  need to be so close . Your plant also needs to maintain a certain degree of transpiration to draw water and nutrients into the plant to fuel all of this new growth . <p> Due to the fact that your plants will now be growing in an artificial light controlled environment , you need to consider dark cycles - when humidity usually decreases . Counteract this accordingly by setting up your grow room so that humidity is about 10% higher at night compared to the day . Be warned though - if at any point humidity drops below the suggested rate for a prolonged period of time plants stand the chance of experiencing potentially troublesome issues , including over-fertilisation . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humidifier should be employed . We offer two options when it come to increasing humidity . For large areas HR-15 Professional Humidifier will be ideal . It comes supplied with an integral humidistat and user-friendly controls , so you can manage humidity in rooms of sizes up to 30m2 according to whatever settings are considered appropriate . A separate water reservoir is required with this unit due to the volumes of water used in maintaining high humidity in large areas . <p> For smaller spaces the impressive Ultrasonic Mini Humidifier is more than capable of creating just the right growing humidity . This affordable option features a compact design and inbuilt water tank capable of running it for up to 18 hours . This unit is ideal for use in BudBox or similarly sized enclosed grow rooms . <p> Flowering/Fruiting Stage High humidity can remain present in the growing environment up until the flowering/fruiting period at which point it should be lowered to significantly reduce the threat of rot . An effective solution to preventing humidity from rising too high is with adequate ventilation . By extracting hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outside your grow room , high humidity will automatically become less of an issue . A suitable setting at this stage would range from 35 to 50% RH . <p> Grub <p> 10-01-11 , 01:07 PM <p> Excellent post post .

So for how long did chronic cannabis smokers stay positive for THC under continuously monitored abstinence with their analytical THC limit of quantification of 1.5 micrograms per liter ? <p> Chronic daily cannabis smokers were positive as long as 24 days . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But recently , we have shown in these individuals who build up very large body burden of cannabinoids in their system . We have shown extended detection windows in whole blood , plasma , urine , and now in oral fluid . So although most chronic daily cannabis smokers , and that 's really important , this is not your typical population . These are individuals who are using in this study up to 10 cannabis joints per day for as long as 10 years . In this cohort of individuals , you could have positive tests as long as 24 days . So this might be a positive attribute for workplace drug testing , but a serious limitation for driving under the influence of drugs <p> What is the SAMHSA proposed cannabinoid cutoff in oral fluid and what are the oral fluid cannabinoid cutoffs currently being used in the driving under the influence of drugs , alcohol and medicines program ? <p> So in 2004 , SAMHSA proposed a screening cutoff for THC , of four micrograms per liter , and a confirmation cutoff of two micrograms per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , and we have had an additional seven years of research which have really added to our scientific database for proposing cutoffs . <p> So although those were proposed by SAMHSA , everything is being considered right up to the minute on the latest research and I think it 's quite probable that those cutoffs might change . <p> In Europe , in the European Union , they have a very strong program . They are already using oral fluid testing on a routine basis for driving under the influence of drugs . And in their program , they are using a one microgram/liter cutoff concentration . That is a confirmation cutoff compared to the SAMHSA proposed two micrograms/liter . They do n't require that you screen at a higher cutoff ; they just require that you confirm at the one microgram/liter level . <p> So with these higher cutoffs , what are the detection windows for cannabinoids and oral fluid in the chronic cannabis smoking population <p> So what we found was that using a one microgram/liter like DRUID , we had most people who were negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much longer period of time . And at the higher proposed 2 micrograms/liter SAMHSA cutoff for just THC , we 've the same program with detection for a very long in the terms of 24 or more days . But if we combined THC with Carboxy-THC cutoff of 20 nanograms/liter , we could reduce the detection window to less than 48 hours . And also if we included cannabidiol or cannabinol , we could reduce the detection window to less than 24 hours . So there is very good reason for including multiple cannabinoids rather than just THC to define your detection window . <p> If read that right then you can still test over the 2mg after 48hrs for chronic users ? <p> Pugz <p> 03-04-14 , 09:35 AM <p> I 'm starting to think the gov is setting us up for a fall . Taken again from above link <p> What physiological factors could contribute to residual cannabinoid excretion and what do you expect THC detection windows in occasional cannabis smokers to be ? <p> The more cannabis that an individual uses , the larger the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipophilic and you build up a large depot in your body when you continually use the drug . If an individual has a large body mass , they may have more drug stored in their body , and certainly , we believe that one of the factors that contributes to residual cannabinoid excretion is exercise . There are not very good research studies to support this , but there is a tremendous body of literature . I am called by medical review officers almost once a week saying they have a chronic daily cannabis smoker who is been in abstinence and in treatment and been monitored on a regular basis with numerous negative samples . Then they begin to exercise and lose weight and suddenly they produce a positive result . And it 's believed that this is the release of this cannabinoids that are stored in the body . So that 's one factor that could contribute to this residual excretion . So in occasional cannabis smokers , we 're doing that research right now and I can tell you preliminary non- published data that we 're finding surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we had thought that in an occasional user , the detection time would be something less than one day . So we 're doing additional research that should be completed by the spring that will tell us fully what this occasional cannabis smoker window of detection is . <p> In the paper , large into personal variation in cannabinoid oral fluid concentrations as well as detection times reported , what could cause such variability <p> That 's a really good question and I do n't know that we have all of the answers to that . Certainly , body mass is one factor , exercise is another factor , but the biggest ones are going to be the amount of cannabis they use on a daily basis so the frequency of use and then certainly the chronicity of use and the length of time that the individual has been using the drug are the primary factors . <p> dank <p> 04-04-14 , 11:00 AM <p> If they wana take my license off me for something so pathetic then so be it , ill have to loose my job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bastard too ! ? ? <p> algie <p> 04-04-14 , 11:27 AM <p> i have just done 40 years driving to earn my crust absolutely stoned out my brain , was right for me cos it calmed me and slowed me down some , maybe people with my condition should not be given a licence to drive , you see em on the road everyday . the older you get the less likely the law will stop you <p> the lost boy <p> 08-04-14 , 11:36 PM <p> they ai n't  ever gon na stop me from thinking and saying " fk u pendick " <p> BLOODSUCKER <p> 06-08-14 , 12:04 AM <p> JUST READ THIS DO I NEED TO STRESS ? <p> Police will be given new powers to test suspected drug drivers for cannabis as " drugalyser " tests are rolled out at to selected forces the Secretary of State for Transport will announce tomorrow .

Now police will be able to use saliva testing kits or " drugalyser " in much the same way as a breathalyser . The tests will show if a driver has taken cannabis and will act as a " staging post " towards a full drug driving offence according to department of transport officials . The drug testing kits are expected to be introduced to 11 forces across England and Wales , including Gloucestershire , Hampshire and Greater Manchester . Patrick McLoughlin will say tomorrow that unlike alcohol breathalysers and the legal drink-drive limit which have been in force since 1967 the fight against drug-driving is " only just beginning .

Drug driving causes 200 deaths on British roads every year , and yet perpetrators are fifty time less likely to be convicted than drink drivers , he will say . A new law that will make drug driving an offence in its own right is expected to come into force in late summer this year and these tests will form the basis of prosecutions when cases are brought against drivers accused of taking drugs . The law will cover the abuse of prescription drugs as well as illegal narcotics although the new tests will only be able to detect cannabis . Once the law comes into force police simply have to show that a driver had taken drugs not that they were impaired by them the same as the current law for drink driving . And zero-tolerance will mean that , unlike with drink driving , any detected level will be against the law .

Yeah that 's definately the problem mate , you 've got to have old air going out and new air coming in or you will definately have humidity issues 10989 @qwx420989 <p> 20-01-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Leaves breath from the underside/underneath and if the top of 1 leaf is touching/covering the underneath of another leaf it causes condensation or sweats . <p> nickyt <p> 22-01-11 , 11:33 PM <p> hi yes there r leaves touchin other leaves were i have tucked a few out the way of bud sites , but like peeps have said i defo got ta get my self a fan and filter kit , ill also space the pots out as much as i can cheers ppl <p> Catpoison <p> 23-01-11 , 01:45 PM <p> hi yes there r leaves touchin other leaves were i have tucked a few out the way of bud sites , but like peeps have said i defo got ta get my self a fan and filter kit , ill also space the pots out as much as i can cheers ppl <p> I think this is pretty normal mate ... my humidity levels are fine but if a leaf is lying on top of another , the moisture that the bottom leaf transpires ca n't go anywhere and sits on the leaf , like Cannaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be concerned about that ... I 'd worry about having no ventilation at all though ! ! ! <p> humblepie <p> 23-01-11 , 02:15 PM <p> as above leafs touching each other are more prone to transpiring more water , as will not having adequet ventalation. a large drop of over 10-15c between lights on and off temps can cause it as well i beleive <p> Muller <p> 23-01-11 , 02:22 PM <p> High temps and low humidity will cause this , or switching fans of at night will increase the humidity and water vapors will settle on the leaves . If you find two differnt leaves off your plant that are overlapping and touching , lift em up and they 'll be wet . Plants evaporate water through there leaves and suck up from there roots , almost working like a water pump to the plant . Peace : joint : <p> nickyt <p> 29-01-11 , 12:29 PM <p> thanks guys its sorted now got new fan and filter set r/h down to 46% when i opened tent for first time after dark period all good.cheers once again 
@@46021994 @6021994/ <p> Hi all , I have grown a few plants in the past and have recently started growing some again . An old lady friend of mine was asked to look after a couple of plants by someone who never came back to collect them . So she asked if I 'd like them and i gladly took them off her hands . They were pretty well into the budding stage so I budded one and it was a very nice smoke . The second one I put out in the sun but cut off the heavily budded parts of the plant and have enjoyed that also . The plant is now growing nicely and I will leave it to continue . <p> What I 'd like to know is why , the plant has three leaves instead of the usual five ? It certainly looks a bit odd but smells lovely . <p> Has anyone else seen a plant with only three leaves ? <p> WTL <p> 16-05-08 , 06:09 PM <p> Hello dude and welcome to the forum , <p> It could be down to you putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about just gic=ve it a bit of time and it will sort itself out . <p> randelld <p> 16-05-08 , 06:42 PM <p> I do n't think it is that because we took some seeds from the one that we smoked and have got one of them growing and that also only has three leave sets . I 'm sure it must be something to do with the type that it is but we have no idea what type of plant it is . <p> Was hoping someone might have seen it before . Thanks anyway WTL <p> We 're in Spain <p> WTL <p> 17-05-08 , 09:20 AM <p> Hmmmm like you say then mate must be down to the genes of the plant , I have seen 3 blade leaves before on a lemon stinky i re-veged .

Peace <p> Nephilim <p> 19-05-08 , 10:57 PM <p> I saw the same thing once on one of five THC Bomb plants , all were treated the same but one stayed at single bladed leaves for the first few internodes growth and did not go above 3 bladed until put onto 12/12 . It did have the advantage that the side shoot development was a lot better due to more light getting through so led to a very broad branched out plant . <p> Grape101 <p> 20-05-08 , 10:44 AM <p> Dude those photos were taken in 2005 ! <p> PTB <p> 20-05-08 , 10:45 AM <p> My clones right now have massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's really odd ! <p> z3p13 <p> 05-06-08 , 01:44 PM <p> Alright I have this plant that 's about 3.5 ft tall , smells great , is extreamly healthy , but EVERY leaf consists of only 3 prongs .

@@46021995 @6021995/ <p> Since I repotted into 11L pots , the soil was well watered and is still damp half way down , to the bottom .. So before I get to my next watering I was wondering what kind of schedule/frequency any of you using 11L pots tend to stick to ? How much water do you give and how often ? I know this can be strain dependant but any answers would be nice so I can get a rough idea : D <p> Cheers people ! <p> THC Shark <p> 03-05-08 , 04:22 PM <p> I use 11l pots and personally I think that you should water every 2-3 days . In the XXL budbox I use for my plants , sometimes I water my plants everyday . <p> To find your best watering schedule , you should water your plants , then wait to see when the soil at the bottom of the pot is dried up , then again as it needs it . You should let your plants dry up the soil slightly before watering again , this reduces water logging .. It can depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hope that kinda helps mate ... toke on ! ! ! : D <p> Nanuck1980 <p> 03-05-08 , 04:23 PM <p> I give about 1l every 2 or 3 days .

I have a feeling if I gave them enough to have run off like Nan said , they 'd only want doing every week or so for the bottom to go dry before watering again like you suggest .. But who knows ? Temps in the tent are anything between 25 to 29 degrees , normally floating around 27 lights on . Guess I 'll start with the lesser water and see how they like it , probably working up to once weekly . <p> Depends on temp and plant size but when repotting into 11L pots they 're usually good for 5-7 days I find with watering frequency increasing up to them needing water every day once they 've rooted the pots out . <p> weed heed <p> 03-05-08 , 09:49 PM <p> hi yes i agree organix i potted my plant up to ten litre pots a couple of weeks ago and i do it once a week using the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think your cool and once they root into the pots you will need to do it more frequently.ps my plants took two litres of water each i thought that was loads but the plants loved it.all the best weed heed <p> THC Shark <p> 04-05-08 , 07:35 PM <p> my plants were about 5 1/2ft tall so i guess , they were taking in a bit more water than other smaller plants in the same size pot , whenever I water , I give each plant 2L of water every one-two days . <p> I was thinking , if Your plants were recently repotted into these 11l pots then maybe the roots have n't had a chance to grow to down to the bottom of the pot . Therefore making it look like the plant does n't need watering . <p> On the other hand , if you have roots coming out the bottom of the pot then you probably are over watering . <p> Strider <p> 04-05-08 , 08:50 PM <p> I think i 'm the only person who waters every day ... <p> Nanuck1980 <p> 05-05-08 , 01:53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as above , but as sweet says , recon everybody does it diff ; ) I keep all my plants around 4foot . <p> THOMAS CHONG <p> 06-05-08 , 09:58 AM <p> I water a small amount evey morning and my plants seem to be thriving.:deviltoker : <p> PTB <p> 06-05-08 , 10:24 AM <p> I water every 3days about a litre a plant when in 11L pots . <p> How often does everyone feed their plants ? <p> JPS <p> 06-05-08 , 10:36 AM <p> I feed every second watering . <p> PTB <p> 06-05-08 , 10:56 AM <p> I feed every second watering . <p> I looked to see if you posted in this thread before but you have n't so how often do you water ? : pimped : <p> Strider <p> 06-05-08 , 10:58 AM <p> I feed every second watering . <p> Ditto , assuming there are no complications of course <p> PTB <p> 06-05-08 , 11:01 AM <p> Ditto , assuming there are no complications of course <p> So as you water every day , you feed every two days ? <p> Haha sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how often to feed .

@@46021996 @6021996/ <p> For ( artificial ) light , there is a law that always applies known as the Inverse Square Law . It states that light diminishes exponentially in energy as the distance is increased from the source . <p> A good example is that you might be getting 1000 PAR Watts at 4 " from your light source , but that would change to 250 PAR Watts at double the distance ( 8 " ) . This law makes it EXTREMELY important for indoor plant growers to get their light source as close as possible to their plants . The amount of light your plant receives is directly related to it 's yield/flower density . <p> The problem : Indoor lamps used for plant cultivation ( HID - High Intensity Discharge ) give off large amounts of heat , to such a degree that they could cause damage to the plant if put too close . <p> Indoors , there is an optimum distance/height between the plants and the light source . This distance fully illuminates the whole canopy with direct light from the source , but is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will be called the OLH , for Optimum Lamp Height . <p> Ultimately , to get the best light efficiency from your lamp , you want it at the OLH at all costs . But how can you get it there without causing harm to your plants with the abundant heat ? <p> First , try moving your light to the OLH and see what it does to your plants . If they have no problem , then you 're fine . If you have a high output HID , this probably wo n't be enough . <p> Next , try actively exhausting your light hood by hooking up a direct exhaust system to the hood , and then move your lamp to the OLH and see if the plants are O.K. If the plants still seemed affected by the heat , then you must add glass to your actively exhausted lamp hood . Glass will absorb/reflect/filter some of the light energy being emitted by the lamp . <p> The number would seem relatively low , around 2-3% of PAR wattage , but it will effectively filter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp . UV-B is believed , and has been shown , to have a positive influence on the potency of Cannabis . <p> Overall , it would be beneficial for one to add glass if needed to keep their lamp at the OLH , due to the all-powerful Inverse Square Law ; moving light farther away will greatly reduce the amount of energy being emitted and is reaching your plants ( Light intensity is directly related to yield and flower density ) . <p> Almost all glass offered today for insertion in air-cooled lamp hoods is tempered glass , which is regular glass with low amounts of impurities . If one was looking for the most efficient glass for their hood , quartz glass will allow the transmission of UV-B , but is not made specifically for light hoods . <p> And also remember , that if you have a rectangular garden , it is important to position the longest side of the reflector parallel to the shortest side of your garden . ( from FAQ by Head Rush ) <p> Additional note : you should periodically inspect and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or underleaf spraying for insects . The dust and dirt that collects will definitely decrease reflectivity . Isopropanol alcohol , glass cleaner or water ( and a soft cloth ) can all be used to remove streaks , dust and spots . <p> Contributed by : MedMan <p> There are a number of factors which play a part in the temperature radiated from your bulb , watts , hood design and air circulation for example . <p> A simple method of testing for temperature is to use the back of your hand ; if its too hot for your hand , its too hot for your plants . Good ventilation is the key to getting your light closer to the garden . <p> If you are using a cool tube you can have your light alot closer to your plant 's . If you are not using a cool tube you may still be able to get your light a little closer if you have very good air flow and extraction . <p> newbiedrgreenthumb <p> 01-11-08 , 01:30 PM <p> wish i had read this before MY first grow ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi can anyone tell me what 's the difference between hps and led 's im new to this <p> Snake <p> 15-07-09 , 06:40 AM <p> HPS = High Pressure Sodium , chews through the electric bill but is the best option 600w is the most efficient CFL = Compact Flourescent Lamp , easier on the electric bill and some growers can get good results .

I use parabolics and run 600W dual HPS and can happily run them at 6 inches but no closer than that , you will however need to have a fan sweeping the area to disperse the heat but the heat from these reflectors are very low anyways . If you are using a SuperNova or generic version of then you will want about 10 inches from the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HPS . I do n't have any experience with diamond reflectors but have been told they perform better at greater distances i.e a couple of feet at least . At the end of the day it depends on how comfortable you are with having your lamps close to the top of the canopy and how often you check on your crop . If you check daily then 6 - 8 inches is fine for parabolics but if you leave your grow for 3 or 4 days at a time then you maybe better off keeping them a little further away . But as always if you have good air circulation in your room then burning the top of your canopy should not be an issue to you , if you can not use extractors because of noise or whatever then you can get heat shields for your lamps but again how effective they are i am not sure or there are always Cool Tube Lights which house the lamp in a glass tube with an extractor on the end to remove all the heat generated . To really find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some different options and see what works for you the best - start off 15 inches from the top of the canopy then move the lamp a half an inch closer each day you will soon know when you have gone to far because the top of your canopy will start to turn brown and or you may start to see the buds start to bleach white . If this happens then your sweet spot was about an inch and a half further away . Hope this helps some people as i have only covered a couple of options here . <p> DoobieManScoop <p> 08-04-13 , 11:49 AM <p> nice stuff thanks bro <p> stephen07 <p> 30-04-13 , 12:55 PM <p> Quick question , my seedlings are a week old can I start dropping the light it 's at 40 " ATM .

Keeping it closer you will have a much more bushy plant . so depending on the space you have , You will know your self how to adjust your light .

Thanks for this great thread . It 's really helpful . I 'm wondering about adding reflective material ( the hammered metallic surfaced/styrofoam stuff that you can put behind radiators to reduce heating bills ) to my enclosure to increase light to my 2 week old seedlings as they mature . I am using a 600W dual spectrum lamp with analog ballast . I have two 6 inch fans and a small humidifier to reduce heat . My enclosure is 4 feet x 4 feet with 6 seedlings . Heat has been an issue but the humidifier and fans has helped and I now have 50-55% humidity and temperature is 76 - 85F . My lamp has had to be kept raised to reduce temperature and I 'm worries that reflective material will raise the temperature again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12:33 AM <p> It will make your temp go up but its good for your plants to have light cuming from everywhere ... Just try it annd see what happen .. If u fuk up u can try again till u get it right . We all fuk up from time to time . <p> Titan35 <p> 26-08-13 , 10:20 PM <p> Hey quick question , I have 2 600watt dimmable ballasts . My girls are 3weeks old .

I have My first plant veggin from sprout for two weeks tomorrow . Ca n't tell the sex yet but its in a 2 liter bottle system and used organic potting soil with 50/50 perlite . Its gotten to the second node and is about to start the third . I 'm contemplating the idea of lollipoppin but first jus want to perfect the veg state . Two regular cfls in a 35 gallon ( I believe ) plastics tote . Lined it with tin foil ( I know it 's got mixed reviews but I 'm on a budget ) I have one fan with an exhaust hole on top . It has n't reached more than 80 degrees f so I have n't needed to turn fan on much til our recent heat wave .

I 'm only growing 3 little ladies to start with and I 've just put them in their 26l final home . I 'll switch out the 400wmh to a 600w hps for flower and I have them on a timer . My problem is I do n't think the 400w is bright enough even though it is lowered right down to the plants . Should I swap it out to a Dutch barn type of diffuser ? Is the glass covering taking away some of light ? Or do I need more lighting at this stage ?

Unless you are diligent and work hard , the problem will not go away , your crop is doomed as one by one they fail and die . <p> As a Native American , proud of our heritage and ways in keeping with the environment , I give to you a method that is naturally harmonious , and pure . The method is so benign , you may use this method even during flowering - without a single harm to your precious plants . <p> The best way is not the easiest by far ; to do the perfect job takes comitment - so all you lazy bud heads who want a quick fix : " look elsewhere , or coat your precious medicine with chemicals and poison ... and remind me not to smoke your herb . " <p> " Now then , for all you fervent horticulturists ... " <p> Spider mites are alive ; you can make them dead . All life is fragile , but ... " how do I kill the mites without hurting my crop ? " <p> I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , I have found an all-natural way to rid the infestations that sometimes occur . Curing your plants takes time and care , but you can rid your babies of the mini-spiders that suck your plant 's life 's blood . <p> Spiders have skin-like exoskeletons ; the tissues are sensitive to change . Molecules soak though their pours , skin and orifices ; thus , what may bother you - a giant living organism - might prove fatal to a spider the size of a pinhead . This is so when using a common group of proteins found in Nature . I will teach you how to naturally and inexpensively rid your plants of the dreaded spider mites . LONG ... Habanera Pepper ( sometimes pronounced Habenero ) is the key ingredient in pepper spray . Once you make a batch of CALICLEAN you 'll see why . One may buy habanera peppers in any vegetable section for about 6 dollars a pound . The peppers are light orange to dark red , and are about the size of a bic lighter when fully mature , most are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! If you have mites , time is of the essence . <p> NOTICE : The spray you make is not harmful to humans ( hab peppers are an ingredient in all really good south of the border salsas ) , but irritating to mucus membranes and soft tissues , it will make you cough - as its like breathing chili powder , so use care . <p> " GEE , MY PLANT LEAVES ARE DOTTED WITH WHITE SPOTS AND TURNING PALE OR YELLOW . " If you have taken a powerful magnifying glass to the underside of your plant 's leaves you will have seen the little off-yellow dots with a brown center that move about slowly over the plant leafs and veins - the mature mites . These big mites leave web-strands like other spiders . Web strands between leaf and stems ( as they cross back and forth to new vulnerable leaves ) , and between leaf serrations are indications of a healthy infestation and big mites on your plants . You may also have seen almost too-hard-to-see little brown dots crawling slowly about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suckers . You may also have seen groups of little white dots near the central leaf brachiation and the main leaf veins . These are clutches of mite eggs . They will soon hatch and produce up to 80 mites per clutch , per mature mite . You are screwed if you do nothing . But fret not , you can save your plants , and they will recover and thrive - with diligence . <p> HERE IS WHAT TO DO <p> Making the Calicleaner <p> 1 . ) Get a sauce pan - fill with one pint of water - put on lowest flame possible ( do not boil ! ! ! ) . 2 . ) Chop 4 -5 Habanera peppers fine . Chop open seeds ( http : **38;389;TOOLONG ) and central membranes , as the power lies there . 3 . ) Simmer chopped peppers for 20 minutes - making sure not to boil ( you will destroy the active proteins ) . 4 . ) When you put your head over the pan and the wispy-steam stings your eyes , the Calicleaner is ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strainer - a little fine grit is OK - let cool in a clean bowl . 6 . ) Pour room temperature contents in a mister spray bottle . Your are ready to apply . <p> HOW TO APPLY Calicleaner 1 . ) Put on gloves , and wear a mask , or at least put a bandana around your nose and mouth . 2 . ) Turn off all fans - you do not want this spray in your eyes ! ! ! 3 . ) Spray the bottom of EVERY leaf - starting with the bottom leaves first , work up to the top . 4 . ) After the bottoms are done , hit the tops and the stems . 5 . ) Squirt liberally in new leaf pods - tightly wound new leaf growth ( the small mites hide there ) . 6 . ) Get the heck out of the room till it clears . 7 . ) Repeat procedure with each plant . 8 . ) Spray the soil , the pots , and the floor or earth around the area to kill dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with soap and water when complete - the stuff will heat-up skin for 4 hours . 10 . ) DO NOT WORRY . Though the stuff is lethal to mites , the plants love it . <p> WHATS NEXT ? ? <p> Congratulations ! You have successfully killed the mites that you sprayed - on contact ! . Plus , the mites are thwarted in biting again as they get a lethal dose of hot mouth . Your plants should be turning green again with in half a day . Though the leaves are scarred , they will recover and work again - producing vital sugars for growth . <p> However , you are not done . Some mites will escape the spray , though you have killed 95% of them . Thus , you will have to do the spray again tomorrow . As a matter of fact you will have to spray every 2-3 days till you see no more mites - usually up to two weeks . SOME EGGS WILL HATCH ! ! ! Thus a week after the first spray , do a super job again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kill ' em right away . <p> Use your magnifying glass to inspect each plant carefully , when nothing moves and you see no more webs , your plants are clear . YEAH ! ! <p> Additional precautions : make sure your containers and pots do not touch , mites migrate . Clean your floors and equipment so live mites do not return ( spray them down with Caliclean ) . Since no person can kill every living mite in their situation , eternal diligence is now part of the equation . One mite may turn into a million in a month . <p> Spraying notes : Mites tend to collect where the leaves join at the nexus and overlap . If you can , lay your plants on-end or position upsidedown ( be real careful ) to make sure all undersides are sprayed . Cut off curled leaves where they collect . If you 're a rich person you may make a full pound to ten gallons of water and dunk them - even better ! ! <p> The best part of using Calicleaner is you may use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all natural , no one is harmed but the mites : " Nature to deal with Nature .

When you buy a ticket you are bound by their terms and conditions , not the usual search laws which apply outside . As a general rule it is only the security staff who can search but are unable to search in underwear that you are wearing . Therefore this is the ONLY sensible place to hide a stash . If you are found with anything you are likely to be passed on for a cavity search , depending on the festival . Having said that , it all depends on the brief ( or the zealousness ) given to the search teams .

In many ' solution culture ' hydroponic systems , the oxygen supplied for plant root uptake is provided mostly as dissolved oxygen ( DO ) held in the nutrient solution . If depletion of this dissolved oxygen in the root system occurs , then growth of plants , water and mineral uptake are reduced . <p> Injury from low ( or no ) oxygen in the root zone can take several forms and these will differ in severity between plant types . Often the first sign of inadequate oxygen supply to the roots is wilting of the plant under warm conditions and high light levels . Insufficient oxygen reduces the permeability of the roots to water and there will be an accumulation of toxins , so that both water and minerals are not absorbed in sufficient amounts to support plant growth . This wilting is accompanied by slower rates of photosynthesis and carbohydrate transfer , so that over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If oxygen starvation continues , mineral deficiencies will begin to show , roots die back and plants will become stunted . If the lack of oxygen continues in the root zone , plants produce a stress hormone - ethylene , which accumulates in the roots and causes collapse of the root cells , at this stage pathogens such as pythium can easily take hold and destroy the plant . <p> Oxygen in Hydroponic Nutrient Solutions While its possible to measure the levels of dissolved oxygen in a hydroponic nutrient solution , its not carried out as often as EC and pH monitoring due to the cost of accurate DO ( Dissolved Oxygen meters ) . However , if an effective method of aeration is continually being used , and solution temperatures are not reaching excessively high levels , then good levels of oxygenation in most systems can be achieved One of the most common and effective methods of oxygenation in hydroponic nutrient solutions is with the use of air pumps/machines and air stones . <p> Air Pumps and Air Stones While there are a number of methods that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these , such as ozone treatment , are expensive and not often used by smaller growers . One of the most practical and inexpensive , yet efficient ways of getting more dissolved oxygen into a plants root system is through forcing air into the nutrient . Air pumps are widely available in a range of sizes , from very small up to very large with capacity to run from one to many air stones each introducing hundreds of tiny bubbles of fresh , oxygen rich air into the nutrient solution . <p> Why an Air Stone While an air pump tube alone can bubble air into a nutrient solution , oxygenation or the process of getting atmospheric oxygen dissolved into the liquid nutrient , is much more effective where many tiny bubbles of air are created , rather than a slow stream of larger bubbles . The greater the surface contact between the air bubbles and the nutrient , the more oxygen will diffuse into the nutrient solution and smaller bubbles create a far greater surface area than a few larger bubbles will . Air stones simply break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porous ' stone ' so that many tiny bubbles are rapidly introduced into the nutrient . Depending on the size or dimensions of the nutrient reservoir into which air is being introduced for oxygenation , air stones of different shapes and sizes can be selected . For small rectangular tanks , long thin air stones ( some up to 1 foot in length ) can be placed on the base of the reservoir to distribute air bubbles and oxygen uniformly . A larger number of smaller , round , cylindrical or oval air stones placed at equal distance inside a nutrient pool or tank also ensure high levels of oxygenation . <p> Air stones also have the benefit of acting as ' weights ' which remain stable on the base , or in the lower layers of the nutrient tank - the further the bubbles have to travel to reach the surface of the nutrient , the more time oxygen has to diffuse into the liquid and the higher the rates of dissolved oxygen than can be obtained from an air pump and stone set up . <p> For systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump with many outlets will allow oxygenation into all systems and it is always a good idea to buy an air machine and air stones larger than currently required so that aeration can be increased under warmer conditions or if the hydroponic system is later expanded . <p> Oxygen and Temperature Effects - Effective Aeration While forcing air bubbles deep down into the nutrient reservoir generally increases the dissolved oxygen levels in the nutrient , there is one other major factor to consider and that 's the temperature of the air being pumped into the nutrient . As the temperature of a nutrient solution increases , its ability to hold dissolved oxygen decreases . So a cool nutrient solution may in fact hold twice as much oxygen at ' saturation level ' than a warm solution . For example a nutrient solution at 45 F can hold around 12ppm of dissolved oxygen at ' saturation ' , ( meaning it is the most it can hold ) , but the same nutrient solution at a temperature of 85 F will hold less than 7ppm at saturation . This means at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen available for the plants root system to take up . To complicate matters further , the requirement of the plants root system for oxygen at warmer temperatures , is many times greater than at cooler temperatures due to the increased rate of root respiration . So warm nutrients mean a very high oxygen requirement from the plants roots , but the nutrient can only hold very limited amounts of dissolved oxygen at saturation , no matter how much air is being bubbled into the solution . Ideally , nutrient solution temperatures for most plants should be run lower than the overall air temperature - this has many beneficial effects on plant growth and development . However , if overly warm air from the growing environment is pumped into an otherwise cool nutrient solution , the warm air will rapidly increase the temperature of the nutrient to that of the growing environment . If air is being pumped via an air machine with an intake close to lights or other heat sources then rapid heating of the nutrient will occur . On the other hand , cool air has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels are pumped in and thus result in a much more highly oxygenated solution for the plants roots . If keeping the nutrient solution temperature down seems to be a continual problem , checking the air inlet temperature of an air pump is a good idea . Overly warm nutrient solutions ( ideally nutrient solutions should remain below 65 - 75 F ) for most warm season , high light plants and well below 69 F for cool season.can have serious effects on the plants root system . Apart from the increased oxygen requirement due to a much higher rate of root respiration which can rapidly result in oxygen starvation , high solution temperatures favour many of the root disease pathogens . Plant roots become highly ' stressed ' when experiencing high temperatures , particularly if there is a large mis-match between the air the root temperature . Root stress slows the development of new roots , resulting in reserves inside the root tissue being burned up during respiration faster than they are accumulated , and stress makes the root system in general more susceptible to disease attack . Keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuring that air machines are not blasting hot air into the solution and cooking plant roots . Aeration is most effective when cool air is bubbled into a nutrient . <p> Oxygenation and Nutrient Uptake Healthy roots supplied with sufficient oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions selectively from the surrounding solution as required . The metabolic energy which is required to drive this nutrient uptake process is obtained from root respiration using oxygen . In fact there can be a net loss of nutrient ions from a plants root system when suffering from a lack of oxygen ( anaerobic conditions ) . Without sufficient oxygen in the root zone , plants are unable to take up mineral nutrients in the concentrations required for maximum growth and development . Maintain maximum levels of dissolved oxygen boosts nutrient uptake by ensuring healthy roots have the energy required to rapidly take up and transport water and mineral ions . <p> Calcium is one important nutrient ion which has been shown to benefit from high levels of oxygenation in the hydroponic nutrient solution Calcium , unlike the other major nutrients is absorbed mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The root apex has a large energy requirement for new cell production and growth and is therefore vulnerable to oxygen stress If root tips begin to suffer from a lack of oxygen , a shortage of calcium in the shoot will occur . This shortage of calcium makes the development of calcium disorders such as tip burn and blossom end rot of fruit more likely and severe under oxygen starvation conditions . High levels of oxygenation ensure healthy root tips are able to take the levels of calcium required for new tissue growth and development . <p> Conclusion While providing oxygenation with the use of air machines and stones is an excellent method of increasing the dissolved oxygen ( DO ) levels in a nutrient solution , the temperature of the air intake and nutrient solution must also be managed to ensure oxygen starvation in the root zone does not occur . Pumping hot air into a nutrient not only creates temperature stress in the root zone , it also results in less oxygen carrying capacity in the solution itself - a recipe for root suffocation that will rapidly affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygenation right means checking both aeration capacity of the equipment being chosen and temperatures in the nutrient and root zone . <p> Goodbuddy <p> 09-11-13 , 01:20 PM <p> Top post Gramps : mr : <p> FACE <p> 09-11-13 , 01:33 PM <p> Nice posts pops glad to see u finally solved it and hope to see u full on again now <p> Grandad <p> 09-11-13 , 01:40 PM <p> cheers buddy , me too . done all i can now , just keep doin it and prayin : ) <p> stealthgrow <p> 09-11-13 , 01:48 PM <p> read the same article yesterday mate LONG ... and I thought the point about sucking in warmer air through the air intake was brilliant . <p> Any thoughts how you can prevent the problems especially as you grow your plants so HUGGGGEEEE in them aquafarms ? would it be worth adding a res to your farms and trying to get some DO in there as well to help ? <p> Grandad <p> 09-11-13 , 02:39 PM <p> yea a sticky : ) <p> i 've been thinking about it , and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my air stones ( 6 inch discs ) , as an unweighted airline will just float . alas i 'm out of room to add another res in . <p> i 'm also gon na use 3 farms instead of 2 to fill my screen , so they are n't just as big . as my last big plant started going tits up around the same size . <p> Immyedin <p> 18-12-13 , 09:49 PM <p> Hi grandad good read up as about to start my first ever grow , <p> I think I seen u mention u adding an airline to ur farms as the stones got blocked By the friendly bacteria , if the line just floats how would that work thanks again <p> Grandad <p> 19-12-13 , 10:07 AM <p> mornin immyedin , mine is down the blue pipe , which brings it out(in) at the bottom of the tank . if i go in the farms again , i will glue the airline to the bottom of the tank and not bother with the airstones. an airline can also be placed down the drip ring pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run the airline down the blue pipe at the front ) <p> this is only a problem if using airstones and bennies under a screen . without the screen the plants can be lifted up , so the airstones can be checked/changed or cleaned without too much trouble . <p> WakiiBakii <p> 21-12-13 , 05:44 AM <p> Great write up Grandad ! A lot of useful information here : party : <p> Grandad <p> 27-01-14 , 03:47 PM <p> here 's a bit more I found ...... <p> I have done something terrible . I killed my plants . I strangled them , slowly depriving them of the very oxygen they needed to live . I regret my transgressions , and even though I did n't  mean to do it , the fact remains that they are all dead . For the sake of preventing more of these senseless deaths , I will share with you my findings on how plants use oxygen . We all know that plants use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and produce oxygen as a byproduct of that photosynthetic reaction . Here is where my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots must have oxygen . In a hydroponic environment it is essential to ensure your plants roots are supplied with oxygen . Growers using organic soils will never concern themselves with supplying oxygen to their plants ; however , hydroponic growers like me must be well versed in the science of dissolved oxygen ( from here on out called DO ) . <p> Abundant , small bubbles are the key to increasing DO levels in your nutrient solution . <p> While most crops seem to prefer about 9 PPM DO , some crops like lettuce have demonstrated little to no difference in fresh weight or dry weight when grown in DO levels ranging from 2.1 PPM to 16.8 PPM ( Albright et al , 1996 ) . The low level of DO necessary for lettuce growth helps explain why the non-circulating Kratky method of hydroponic growing is so successful for growing lettuce . Conversely , some types of hydroponic systems require saturated or even supersaturated DO levels to yield vigorous growth , as is the case with NFT systems where ideal DO levels can surpass 40 PPM . <p> Dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per million ( PPM ) at room temperature . Temperature has a powerful effect on how much oxygen can be held by water molecules . The warmer the water is , the less gas it is able to hold . Fully oxygenated water at 68 Fahrenheit will hold about 9 PPM of DO , while the same water at 86 Fahrenheit only holds about 7.5 PPM ( over 15% less DO ) . It should come as no surprise then that the ideal temperature for maximizing root growth in hydroponic systems is 68 Fahrenheit , the temperature at which water naturally holds the 8-9 PPM of DO , which is the very amount of DO necessary to support vigorous plant growth in most crops . Water holds both dissolved solids like fertilizer as well as dissolved gases like CO2 &amp; O2 . The higher the PPM ( dissolved solids ) , the less gases water can hold , so be aware that over fertilizing often occurs in conjunction with oxygen deprivation . <p> Adding hydrogen peroxide is a common practice used by many hydroponic growers but is one that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O2 , the diatomic form which can be absorbed by the plant roots , and O2- , the free radical form which is highly reactive . Hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) converts to H2O + O2- when added to water . The O2- that is formed is not desirable because it will indiscriminately oxidize or damage healthy living plant cells . Also , although adding hydrogen peroxide to a reservoir will result in an initial boost in DO levels , those gains are short lived . Hydrogen peroxide is best kept in a growers toolbox for cleaning equipment and treating bacterial and fungal infections . <p> Air Pumps &amp; Air Stones <p> Air diffuses into water whenever water comes in contact with air . This commonly occurs when water on the surface of a reservoir touches the air in a grow room or when air bubbles rise through a column of water in a reservoir . Many growers employ the combination of an air pump and air stone to add oxygen to their fertigation solution ( the mixture of water and fertilizer ) . This is a viable option for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels fairly inexpensively . An air pump pumps air through food grade plastic tubing to the bottom of the reservoir , where it is attached to an air stone . The air stone then diffuses the air into small bubbles which rise through the water , increasing the DO level as they rise . This also happens to be a great method for keeping ones water and fertilizer mixed , preventing the fertilizer from settling to the bottom of the reservoir . <p> The size of the bubble that an air stone produces makes a significant difference in their ability to add dissolved oxygen to water . If a single large bubble and 8 small bubbles have the same total amount of air inside of them , then the surface area of the smaller bubbles will always be greater . Consider this example : a bubble with a 5 mm diameter has a volume of 524 mm3 and a surface area of 314 mm2 . A bubble with a 10 mm diameter has a volume of 4,188 mm3 and a surface area of 1,256 mm2 . The 10 mm bubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a combined surface area of 2,512 mm3 . By producing bubbles that are half the size , the surface area is effectively doubled , doubling the surface contact of bubbles to water therefore doubling the capacity of the air to increase the DO level . Additionally , smaller bubbles are less buoyant and rise through the water slower , allowing them to diffuse more oxygen into the water . Smaller bubbles are produced by high quality air stones made from silicon carbide , which is fired at 1300 degrees Celsius . The high temperature produces a more porous stone which makes smaller bubbles than the less expensive blue air stones which are only fired at 200 degrees Celsius . <p> An air stone in the bottom of your hydroponic nutrient reservoir can make all the difference ! <p> Air pumps and air stones are not without their problems , however . Pumping air from inside a grow room , especially a grow room enriched with CO2 , will cause the pH of the fertigation solution to drop over time . As air that contains 400 PPM of CO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are formed which accumulate and lower the pH of the solution . Additionally , water holds on to some gases better than others , and because water can only hold a set amount of gas at a given time , the water molecules will selectively hold CO2 and allow the O2 to dissipate out of the water . Consider this example : if water can only hold 100 units of gas at saturation and it starts with 50 units of CO2 and 50 units of O2 , then as air ( which contains both CO2 and O2 ) is bubbled through the water over time , the water will absorb more CO2 and release the O2 , resulting in lower and lower DO levels over time . <p> So are all hydroponic growers destined to kill their plants ? If we add hydrogen peroxide then we oxidize the roots ; if we bubble air through the water then we raise the pH and force the DO level down over time ; even if we do nothing , when water stagnates ( stands still ) , dissolved oxygen starts to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere . Do n't  give up hope yet ! There isa solution to our DO woes adding a mixing or stirring pump to the reservoir . <p> Stirring Pumps <p> A stirring pump is a submersible pump placed at the bottom of a reservoir attached to little or no tubing that either continuously or on a timed cycle mixes the solution , similar to how the oceanic currents keep the water in the oceans perpetually moving . Mixed or moving water will allow the already dissolved oxygen in the water to remain stable in its concentration and also provide increased DO as the water mixes with air on the surface of the reservoir . Moreover , the movement of the water will prevent stagnation and reduce the potential of the growth of harmful anaerobic bacteria which cause unpleasant smells , toxins , and disease . <p> Although there are a few methods of increasing the DO level I have not touched upon like commercial air diffusers and electrolysis , these methods are not practical for most gardeners . In a nutshell , it is best to use the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Culture , and if you choose to use it in another type of hydroponic system make sure to place the air pump in an uninhabited , well-ventilated room that is not enriched with CO2 ( people hanging out in an enclosed space increases the CO2 levels ) . Dissolved oxygen levels in systems other than DWC are best maintained with the addition of a stirring pump . If you follow these recommendations you may save your plants ( and your conscience ) and become a more successful gardener in the process . <p> lousizzle <p> 20-02-14 , 11:55 PM <p> put a airstone and airline thanx you like fuckin scientists ... yeaa budddy great info

If you are using buds that are trimmed and dried you can use less depending on the quality of the weed . I would say to use at least 1/4 oz if you are using good buds . <p> Update on your results <p> donnachris <p> 25-04-11 , 02:40 PM <p> i like to make my butter 1-2 grams of weed per tablspoon of butter . which would mean in 250 grams of butter you would add 16-32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of weed that you use , the less of it you need . good luck , and keep us posted . <p> i used a big bag of trim to do mine ( about 4-5oz ) and i used 500g of butter LONG ... when i 'd finished i ended up with about 250-300g of " canna-butter "

They may also refer you to a Youth Offending Team ( YOT ) and are likely to : <p> give you a reprimand and tell your parents what has happened if it is the first time you 've been caught give you a final warning and refer you to a YOT if it 's your second offence arrest you if it is the third time you have been caught with cannabis , which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intent to supply and dealing If you are found to be supplying or dealing drugs , the punishment is likely to be tough . Supplying drugs does n't  just apply to dealers . If police suspect that you intend to share drugs with your friends , this is still considered to be supplying . <p> Being suspected of supplying drugs means you are much more likely to be charged . The amount of drugs found on you , and whether you have a criminal record , will be taken into account when a punishment is being decided . <p> The maximum sentences for intent to supply drugs are : <p> up to life in prison or an unlimited fine ( or both ) for a Class A drug up to 14 years in prison or an unlimited fine ( or both ) for a Class B or Class C drug <p> After a certain amount it is always regarded as intent to supply . as for greed-NO I was playing around with eleven strains-Trying to obtain my own seeds ( Fem ) from which i did intend to make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages . I do not and did not sell weed , but i would sell seed . Yes i did get caught-but i never moaned about it-After all i broke the law . My user name is BAD2-Which stands for Bipolar Affective Disorder 2-which is the illness i suffer from-I could have used this an excuse in court.but i never because i knew exactly what i doing . I only replied to a thread about sentences-but it appears that if you get more than a slap on the wrist or an 85.00 fine then you are greedy ? Thanks for your time guys . Be happy-Be stoned . PS.i do n't smoke weed.my illness does not allow it-not even booze <p> wert <p> 23-04-10 , 10:02 AM <p> Ai n't trying to frighten anyone Wert-it 's like murder-it carries a life sentence but it do n't mean you will get life . a conviction for murder is mandatory life , no other sentence possible . nothing wrong with producing seeds:cool : as for not fighting your case with as much mitigation as possible .............. why ? they will do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to do everything in your power not to be . <p> Rizla <p> 26-04-10 , 09:34 PM <p> yes like wert said . if you do get busted why make it easy ? <p> personaly i 'd use all the medical evidence i had at my disposal to aid the case . <p> is growing weed for percy - or selling seeds for small grow rooms hurting anyone ? what 's the crime here ? sure its " ilegal " but so is EATING MINCE PIES ON CHRISTMAS DAY ! ! would you go quietly and take your sentence on that one ? or use hunger as your defence ? <p> its wrong to punish us smokers while drink is legal . its hypocritical . and all the while we " go quietly " the longer we 'll be discriminated against . <p> yoko2009 <p> 26-04-10 , 11:35 PM <p> A friend of mine had over 200 plants on the go in his unit , he managed to get a smack head to take the wrap if he paid him 15,000 the unit was let in his name but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  have a clue . the gear head admitted all and believe it or not it was his first offence to do with drugs so all he got a 12 month sentence . He will probably be out in 6-8 months . Them smack heads love it in prison where they can get shit loads of that shite anyway and when he gets out he s got 15G waiting for him to get off his tits on ! 10989 @qwx420989 <p> 27-04-10 , 05:46 AM <p> i got caught with 6 plants , and a supply charge , i 'm not a dealer it was sent to a friend ... i got 6 months drug rehab and probation for 12 months no fine or costs and it went to crown court ! ! ! <p> Omg bubbs did ur breif not like u ? I got caught with 5 then acouple of month later 10 andont think I paid more than 150 in fines and got 1 caution . <p> Yoko , that 's the way to do it , use ur local friendly baghead lol . <p> Cannalover <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail that 's 2500 a month right.I 'm no smackhead but if anyone wants to pay me to take the rap for 200 plants and wants to pay me 15,000 please pm me okay . PS i mean it .. <p> yoko2009 <p> 27-04-10 , 08:25 PM <p> cannalover ill keep you in mind hehe 2500 a month sounds a lot but this guy has plenty of dough so it worked out a good deal for all , to be fair he thought he would have got longer at least 2 years so the smack head got a lucky bonus , maybe he should have agreed a price on time served but the kid wanted paying up front . if it was him who got caught he would have got much longer ! <p> MrBimble <p> 27-04-10 , 08:31 PM <p> 15K - It would have been cheaper to import an asian gardener - if he got caught he 'd probably get a flat &amp; dole cheque . <p> yoko2009 <p> 27-04-10 , 09:25 PM <p> hehe your probably right Bimble. is it just me but i do n't  think 15k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job that only paid 15k a year , i suppose that 's how i 'd look at it . i know 15k for a gear head is good money plus they get B&amp;B for free in smack central but surely the majority of us normal folk would n't take the blame for 15k even if you know your only getting 12 month and could be out in 6 ? ? ? ? Having a think i reckon it would take 50grand for me to take a 12 month wrap and even then it would depend on where i am in life at the time ! <p> Sgt Bilko <p> 27-04-10 , 09:38 PM <p> Ha ha ha just checked out this thread at the right time ! Brilliant idea ! I know so many people who would quite happily take half that money for more than double that time ! ! Is n't it great profiting of those less fortunate than yourself lol , well i ai n't  gon na have a fully developed conscience for a good couple of years so may as well ! Most of the bagheads i know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free bit of cash for them , the trip to the big house with the bad people is inevitable = ) 10989 @qwx420989 <p> 28-04-10 , 08:17 AM <p> Yoko , 15 bags ai n't enough m8 , 50k sounds ok but like u say it depends wr u are in life .

It 's a first offence at Edinburgh sheriff court . 10989 @qwx420989 <p> 13-07-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its obviously personal use so u should n't get more than a cation and a little fine maximum .

Peace . <p> Eggbox <p> 13-07-10 , 08:35 PM <p> 2 plants and 2 ounce should n't get you more than a fine , maybe CS mate . Edinburgh sheriff has some pretty sound prosecutors , who see far too many grow ops go through their courts , they really do just look for the commercial ones : ) 10981 @qwx420981 <p> 13-07-10 , 08:52 PM <p> Got caught with 3 plants and some GBL , no previous so I only got a caution , but they did take my tent and lights and nutes , and the GBL , guess that was a fine of sorts as I now have to replace them which will cost me about 250 notes . <p> IMO they are been more lenient these days as so many are growing now . <p> Key is co-operate with them too , do n't be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM <p> A Friend of a friend has a attempt murder charge a string of others and 1 charge for cannabis posession and he s just finished c.s about a month ago . he also has 4 plants growing , what 's do you reckon his out come would be ? 10981 @qwx420981 <p> 13-07-10 , 08:58 PM <p> Attempted murder ? <p> Years , ca n't see what difference the plants will make if he 's got that hanging over him . <p> Gary420 <p> 13-07-10 , 09:01 PM <p> what even if its less than 10 and he can prove its personal ? <p> wert <p> 13-07-10 , 09:01 PM <p> if he is up on an attempted murder charge and other offences they will probably T I C it or ignore it . <p> Gary420 <p> 13-07-10 , 09:04 PM <p> if he is up on an attempted murder charge and other offences they will probably T I C it or ignore it . <p> He s done his time for it wert and has n't been in bother since . so would it b curtains then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a minor offence regardless who it has been commited by , first offence for growing . <p> Gary420 <p> 13-07-10 , 09:11 PM <p> Wert you have saved a paranoid man from trashing his beloved plants . pat yourself on the back my pension collecting friend <p> leafy <p> 14-07-10 , 07:07 PM <p> What do you mean he has done his time for it ?

We turned up about 20 mins early and found the landlord there with 2 skips and a few other people . <p> They were carting out 100 's of plant pots and miles of silver ducting etc . It turns out the house had been raided 2 days before , this house had 7 bedrooms and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for growing apparently except the annexe flat . <p> I really wanted that house but thought better of it when I saw that . It would be kinda stupid moving into a house with that kinda history , you 'd be worried about smoking a joint ffs . Not sure how they found the grow , heli 's would probably not be able to fly over because the house was right on the approach to a large international airport ! 10979 @qwx420979 <p> 27-06-11 , 07:08 AM <p> Shit , that 's another one of my properties found . <p> Luckily i 've got like 20 left : D <p> relto <p> 27-06-11 , 07:19 AM <p> would not suprise me if the filth .. trawled through ebay as well ... loads of grow shops on there <p> gbomb <p> 27-06-11 , 07:28 AM <p> i was working on mersey island in essex about three weeks ago when a 74yr old man was caught and sentenced for cultivating more than 100 plants he was sentenced to 18 months suspended for 2yrs result i would say <p> elegantfool <p> 27-06-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omg that 's 25 years ago , is a career policeman , he 's a chief inspector now ( wo n't say where ) and smokes more weed than anyone . anyway we were talking and he told me they are not bothered about Percy grower but if they get a tip off they wo n't ignore it and will act on it if you have 4 plants or 400 , so yes percy is not important to the police , mega raids , men and resources for one old guy with 3 beautiful green northern lights in his celler to get slapped wrist and 20 hrs cs ; but they will actively go after you if they know you are growing . He also told me the costs of using a helicopter are rediculous and with more cuts coming under the tories the forces the use of helicopters is being limited to serious crimes and traffic ? ? If they get a tip of yes they will check it out but as a previous poster says best way to have a successful grow is to just tell no one if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one of the other hundreds of cannabis forums . The police are shit they rely on tips and information to solve anything so if no one knows about your grow no one can sell you out to the old bill . <p> lonely life this percy grower life lol but so rewarding <p> Tiptoe2009 <p> 27-06-11 , 10:16 PM <p> I just do n't know if I can continue to face the loneliness sniff sniff <p> Twofootlong <p> 03-07-11 , 02:12 AM <p> Feel free to send abuse ( I do n't care as I get it all the time ! ! ; ) ) but I have a friend who is in the met who knows I grow and I can backup what had been said on here already that they are not activily looking for Percy growers . According to him it 's way too much paperwork . However he did say that if you get arrested for something else not related and they see evedence of growing or somebody reports a funny ' smell ' etc .. then they ca n't be seen to be ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even have a picture of him standing next to a blue cheese plant I grew last year on my patio . He used to be a stoner but is gutted that he ca n't even be around people smoking now as he does regulary get random drug tests . <p> Reppinuk <p> 15-07-11 , 03:11 AM <p> Interesting thread but it would be useful to know how you guys got caught . <p> No offence buddy but if i knew that or any 1 else did we wouldnt of gotten caught woud we , but at a guess i would say i was grass . peace <p> Reppinuk <p> 15-07-11 , 03:36 AM <p> Hey guys , just would like to share my story with you lot if ya do n't  mind lol . So i had partitioned my room off so that i could grown seven decently sized plants , 2 weeks into flowering and things are goin well with my makeshift grow , anyway i wake up start to play the xbox and get high with a friend , suddenly i get this little urge to peek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpark ..... and to my utter suprise there it was the dirrty discusting riot van they i had never wished to see . Anyway i started to look back and forth as if to say to my friend do summert ya cunt ! the helpful bastard stashed his bud and scales in my fuckin bed , wich really unerves me to this day . So i shout down the stairs to my mum the police are comin to nock on mum ! ! ! after tryin to play smart arse for like 2 mins she let then in the silly twat ! and they come straight up stairs into my bedroom and asked where is the grow ? ? ? as to wich i replyed what grow ? ? ? good eh . So then there was abit of awkward ness and i basically had to look at it for them too see it the dum cunts , because when they opened my door it just looked like a small bedroom because i had all posters covering the plaster board that was to split my room . At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing to god they would n't take the nutes , they took everthing including nutes and left me with just a plaster board and a few leafs .... the ride to the station was really fun wiffing my plants as they sat right infront of me waitin to be destroyed or whatever . When they took me inside i was given a lawyer and he told me to basically say it was all persy wich i did , and they took my finger prints n stuff and gladly sent me on my way , so now i 'm back at home GOING ABSOLUTLEY NUTTS ! ! ! ! WORSE PART OF IT ALL IS THAT I HAD TO BUY SOME OFF STREET TO CALM ME DOWN .... WICH IS WHAT I WAS TRYIN TO AVOID IN THE FIRST PLACE ! ! ! lesson for the kiddies do n't  tell nobody simple as that my friends . <p> South Yorkshire Police officers have have dismantled two cannabis factories in Doncaster . <p> Officers also executed a warrant at an address on Riley Avenue , Balby , where a small cannabis set-up was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A 32-year-old man was arrested for cultivation of cannabis and received a caution . <p> Just for anyone with the same police force and wondering what 6 plants will probably get you 10981 @qwx420981 <p> 26-07-11 , 04:13 AM <p> 6K 's worth for 6 plants ? Oh man how I laughed . <p> RastaMouse22 <p> 09-08-11 , 08:37 AM <p> Hi guys just wondering what would happen .. 1 about 2-3weeks from finish 1 showing pistils and 2 seedlings .. I live in the surrey area .. Never caught with bud only a caution for graf few years back ( in my more idiotic years ) lol <p> Rasta <p> Tabbatha <p> 09-08-11 , 08:51 AM <p> I thought the same exact thing .. then I got out a calculator to show how crazy it was .. but I got a bit of a shock <p> Let 's say street value of avg 200p/oz .. ( which I could n't get so cheap ) <p> So , 6000 divided by 200 = 30 ounces . <p> 30 ounces divided by 6 plants is only 5 oz a plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far off this time after all ? <p> : / <p> whatless 3000 <p> 09-08-11 , 08:56 AM <p> po po pulled me with a spiff and abit of hydro kit like 4 nft tanks they put a marker on the van i was driving as soon as it touches the road its getting pulled talking all sorts of shit to the driver trying to find my location telling them there 's a warrant out for me all sorts of bs they knocked at all 4 addresses looking for me one of them had 15 plants upstairs was not a peaceful week i can tell u but i stayed strong did n't  get rid of the girls i chop em monday thank fuck annnwwaayyyyy morale of the story even when you picking up things that are totally legal if the police suspect you they will be all over your shit do n't  get caught slipping like i did i was very very very lucky also i swear they need alot of evidence for a judge to sign off on a warrant i read further back on the thread they searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the fuck they manage that unless he waved the little rights we have <p> rabbit <p> 18-08-11 , 02:40 AM <p> I see reports in our weekly local paper all the time so I 'll have to start posting them up . It 's strict up here though as they want to rid the island of all drugs and make examples out of anyone caught growing . I 've seen reports of percys getting 200 fine , some CS , and compulsory drug rehab for a single plant or two , though it could be a second/third offence I suppose . <p> Our local paper prints the persons name and full home address so I should really be keeping a note of them all just incase I ever need to find a dealer lol . <p> MrBimble <p> 18-08-11 , 08:25 PM <p> Round here the value they put on plants can be anything from 1000 - 5000 each .... And they do not like hydro setups . I think the last few I saw reported as " Professional hydro ' system " so I 'm sticking to soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between crops ( well no more than 5 at a time ) . <p> thcwarrior <p> 23-08-11 , 01:42 PM <p> 6K 's worth for 6 plants ? Oh man how I laughed . <p> why is that funny dude ? Off the psychosis i had before the bust 2 weeks ago i would hit between 35 - 45oz off the 6 plants , usually minimum of 40 so add that up in value . if you ai n't  hitting those figures for 6 plants man you ai n't  doing it right lol. 2 x 600w should give no less <p> MrBimble <p> 24-08-11 , 07:37 PM <p> 6,000 from 6 plants , so let 's do the math ....... <p> Street price is 10 per gram so to get 6,000 you would need to get 100g per plant so unless you 're growing Auto 's which tend to have lower yields then one plant in a 11-15l pot or hydro under a decent light is going to yeild that . <p> Riouk86 <p> 21-09-11 , 10:00 AM <p> Hello there , just wandering what sentence would be likely handed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught with sixteen plants , he 's a good friend with no previous record , will he get jail time and if so how long ? Thanks <p> MrBimble <p> 21-09-11 , 06:24 PM <p> Depends on what he said when he got caught . He 'll be in the shit if he even hinted at selling and , sharing it with anyone or even giving any to his mates/wife etc as they 'll go straight for a " dealilng " charge ( especially if they found scales , bagies or any text on phone about weed ) . <p> 16 is a lot of plants to say it was percy so could still fall for a " supply or intent to supply " charge . <p> If lucky fine , CS or possibly suspended sentance , if unlucky ( see thread about cunt of a judge in sheffield ) anything up to 4 years bird . <p> If he 's been carefull what he said &amp; has a good brief then most likely a fine &amp; CS . <p> The best bet is to search the local newspaper archives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting - that 'll give the best sign of what try of Nazi is going to be hearing the case . <p> Diddydon <p> 21-09-11 , 06:50 PM <p> 18 months for 250 plants . people here do not realise cultivation can carry a life sentence and an unlimited fine .

For example , a man was caught on the highway between the Netherlands and Belgium with fifteen grams of cannabis . Later , he was also caught in his workplace ( he is a cook ) with five grams of cannabis and the police were informed . He and his boss were interviewed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming cannabis at home for his own pleasure ; he was not dealing anything and was happy in his life with no problems . He also said in a later interview that he had quit his habit so the prosecutor ended the lawsuit against him . Therefore , he was never sued and he never came before a court . <p> There is tolerance if a person says that he/she will quit their habit but otherwise there could be problems . A user who has been caught will be asked by the police to give urine tests and be interviewed a few times . If the habit is continued , the user may go before a court . In another case , a man refused a urine test saying that he was continuing his habit and he is now before the court in Brussels . His defence was to claim a violation of his privacy with arguments based on the European Convention of Human Rights . It is doubtful that he will succeed in Belgium but he might in the court of Strasbourg . <p> The situation of tolerance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Justice . This Act states that if someone is caught with , for example , fifteen grams of cannabis and claims that he only tried it once , he will not be prosecuted . Many criticisms can be made about this situation . The decision to sue someone is in the hands of a prosecutor and the prosecutor will do so only on really arbitrary motives . For example , if you are in poor social circumstances or are unemployed , you will be sued , but if you have a good job or come from a good family then you will not have any problems . One of the basic principals of the French Revolution was that the law must be applied in the same way to everyone , and we really must stand on that position of legality . Whether you are sued or not before a tribunal should not depend on social characteristics . <p> Trev <p> 21-09-11 , 07:57 PM <p> Changing the subject a bit , if you do n't mind me asking how did you get busted the few of you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 08:18 PM <p> Ex partner , What a freak ! ! ! <p> Diddydon <p> 22-09-11 , 01:18 PM <p> A woman scorned .... etc <p> C 2 the J <p> 22-09-11 , 11:56 PM <p> its always a persons own fault if they get rumbled , they either cant keep their gobs shut about what their upto , advertise what their doing ( stupid setups , leaking setups ) , smell or dealing from their grow site . Occasionally somebody will be caught by a copper at their door for something else &amp; he/she notices something to arouse suspicion ( which reminds me of a post on here where a dude , who did n't  have a decent CF was captured because his m8 went to the shop 30 secs from the house , left his fiends door ajar to get back in &amp; a passing plod got a wiff of his grow from the slightly open door , opened said door &amp; walked right into the guys house &amp; nabbed him ) or even being grassed by a nasty family member ( which happend to another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure your setup is good , 2. ) buy a good fan &amp; CF , 3. ) do n't  put stupid signs in your windows ( ie plastic coverings ) &amp; most of all 4 . ) KEEP YOUR GROW SECRET , not even your best m8 should find out ( best m8s fall out too ) . Do n't  worry about the electricity board or supa doopa infra red police helicopters like fuckin airwolf ( if your over 30 you 'll know what i 'm talking about ) , unless your growing on an industrial scale , too which you shouldnt be on this forum ( we have a 10 plant max rule ) , follow the 4 simple rules above &amp; the rest should be easy &amp; very productive . <p> dezz101 <p> 11-02-12 , 11:21 PM <p> 18 months for 250 plants . people here do not realise cultivation can carry a life sentence and an unlimited fine . ( Scotland. ) 250 plants is a tad excessive though I mean for a first offence if they gave anyone a life sentence for a room full of plants I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore never done . Judges are n't stupid they know what will and wo n't stick and unless you 're a big time dealer funding scary shit they ai n't gon na lock you up and throw away the key . <p> smokies80 <p> 19-02-12 , 06:18 PM <p> that is a bloody good result : ) <p> smokies80 <p> 19-02-12 , 06:20 PM <p> Round here the value they put on plants can be anything from 1000 - 5000 each .... And they do not like hydro setups . I think the last few I saw reported as " Professional hydro ' system " so I 'm sticking to soil and as few plants as possible to keep me going between crops ( well no more than 5 at a time ) . <p> yep a hydro setup = sophisticated setup = professional setup = commercial set up ( in the eyes of the law ) <p> Monkeybum <p> 28-02-12 , 09:28 PM <p> Hi all , <p> Last Saturday me and 4 mates were harvesting my crop of 12 cheese plants .

Anyone got any idea what I 'm looking at ? <p> Mike:confused : <p> MrBimble <p> 29-02-12 , 08:13 PM <p> Busted during harvesting is a real bummer - get caught with plants and its just cultivation . <p> But they 'll go for production and that carries a POCA which means they can seize assets . The cuttings will be used to prove multiple cropping planned - backing up the production charge . <p> So your looking at 26 plants , cultivation &amp; production with intent to supply ( if the weight of bud exceeds 100g then that pushes you up a band too ) . <p> Read the thread with new sentencing guidelines an expect level 2/3 sentence . <p> Most councils &amp; letting agencies will evict tennents if the property is used for illegal activities . <p> Legendary Fox <p> 16-03-12 , 06:41 PM <p> In Scotland , if you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal then ? <p> Icon <p> 16-03-12 , 06:49 PM <p> no one should use coke or any white powder in my book , just stick to good old happy backy <p> Get your self to San pedro Guatemala then tell me that <p> sent from san pedro using a Jedi mind trick <p> obiwan <p> 17-03-12 , 08:52 AM <p> 18 months for 250 plants . people here do not realise cultivation can carry a life sentence and an unlimited fine .

Thanks for a all the help HILLY <p> Hillbilly <p> 27-08-12 , 06:14 PM <p> I would n't mess with the roots at this point , it should start cooling off soon so that will help too . My plants used less the last 24 hours then then did just a few days ago , but I have had to water every day so I just hope I can start cutting back on my water with a bit of cooler weather soon . I hope the same for you watering all the time is a pain lol

Here a pic <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> mellowed <p> 22-01-11 , 09:20 PM <p> This is what I found in my little library of knowledge on cannabis plants . <p> ROOT ROT . <p> What causes root rot ? Low Oxygen levels . ( DO ) Desolved Oxigen . Temp 's are the main reason for root rot , Low temps will lower the DO levels and high temps will cause low DO levels . Keeping temps between 65 to 72 will allow MAX DO levels or max o2 for roots . ( Thank you so much for the information syko2 ! has provided above ! ) <p> Over watering also causes root rot , Root Rot infects parts of the roots , which then spread infecting the whole roots causing death , Root Rot can be caused by to high of temps in hydro as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause Root Rot , even signs of it looking over watered , because the soil holds moisture to long for the roots to dry out . So these 3 things are all connected together . The main one that causes everything is over watering . Once you find out you have root rot , depending on how bad the problem is , you can add H202 ( Hydrogen Peroxide ) with your water or hydro setup to kill the bacteria caused from root rot . If the plant is severely taken over by it , there are only a few things you can do , cut off the roots affected by it depending on if its hair roots or tap roots , add H202 , or just chop the plant . To prevent Root Rot , adding product 's like Thrive Alive B-1 , See Weed , Super thrive will help protect your plant 's from root rot and will help cure root problems .

Police should be targeting the drug supply chain and the sniffer dog program was introduced with the Government promising that it will be used to attack the drug supply chain . It is completely useless in achieving that purpose .

Figures released by the state government show that in 80 per cent of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched and no drugs were found.Sniffer dogs operate on the street , at railway stations , even in pubs . If the dog singles a person out , they are usually searched for drugs but government figures show the dogs are often mistaken.In the nine short months to the end of September last year more than 11,000 people have been pulled aside and given an intrusive public search here in New South Wales on the basis of a false positive .

An unusual smell like curry powder might attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work either . To a dog it 's like trying to cover up the sound of a violin with a trumpet , it just does n't work . Deodorants , perfume , etc make it worse by the volatile chemicals carrying the smell of the canna further than normal . <p> Two things to consider . You need to think of the canna like paint as it sticks to anything it touches leaving a scent . So wash your hands and wrap it up using the wrapping to handle the canna so you do n't ' contaminate ' the outside of the wrap . Then wash your hands . Then another wrap , then wash your hands . And then wrap again . Then wash your hands and maybe get changed as well . The other thing is that the smelly volatile chemicals in the weed will seep out anyway . It 's like a party balloon - its airtight but slowly the air molecules squeeze out as they are under pressure . So you need to leave the wrapping til the last minute .

@@46022017 @6022017/ <p> Cannabis acts mainly on one Cannabinoid receptor in the brains neural cells . Receptors are basically the input in a brain cell for the different chemicals in your brain and those chemicals ( neurotransmitters ) tell the neuron what to do . So by introducing THC to a neuron , it soon alters natural neurotransmitter communication . Therefor , thoughts of different natures . <p> By constantly pushing Cannabinoid receptors into overdrive by putting THC through them , they wear out and become less excited ( Neuronal Excitability ) . By disabling them when not high , can help them to become more sensitive and therefor eliminates some of the tolerance to THC or other Cannabinoids . This processes is refereed to as Antagonism . Just like a bad guy antagonist in a story , he does n't let the receptor work . The opposite is called Agonism and helps the receptor to flourish . <p> Cannabinoid receptors also control a lot of other chemical neurotransmitter interactions within the brain ( Neuromodulation ) and this produces the same effect as above ( overdrives them into not working properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiend , whose normal neurotransmission has been modulated , slowed and shot by consuming too much THC too soon via the Cannabinoid receptors . These neurotransmitters , that are affected by Marijuana use , are responsible for concentration , learning , memory retention and nerve growth factor among many others . <p> So by now you can start to see how Marijuana can affect the brain negatively or positively if you like your thought processes to diminished and subdued . I will now describe how you can use this knowledge for supplementation that can diminish these scientifically documented negative effects of Marijuana . <p> Tolerance <p> Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonists are still not yet on the public market but are being trialed for obesity as CB1 receptors use the naturally produced Cannabinoid Anandamide for hunger . Natural antagonists are still available . <p> Other alternatives look at NMDA receptor antagonism as an effective method to reduce the rate of tolerance . This method is one of the most successful for benzo and meth withdrawl . NMDA receptors greatly improve the brain to form memories ( long term memory similar to learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely used as a tolerence reducer for benzodiapine abuse aswell as marijuana . It is a NMDA receptor antagonist and can reduce marijuana impct on overloading NMDA receptors . Similar to Memantine is Amantadine . <p> Huperzine A <p> Huperzine is also an NMDA antagonist and increases Acetylcholine which is an important neurostransmitter responisble for concentration and learning . It also increases REM sleep which can help sleep issues caused by Marijuana . Also prevents neurotoxic effects of glutatamate . <p> Cannabis releases dopamine via the D1 receptors , which is responsible for feeling the pleasurable feeling of being high . Sulbutiamine is a synthetic form of vitamin B1 or thiamine ( or to the canna growers boost juice or superthrive ) and increases density of D1 dopamine receptors so just like bud more density = more high . It also is a antagonist and increases sensitivity which also adds to a better high . You can also combat the down regulation of the dopamine receptor with a NMDA antagonists . They block calcium entry into cells , which prevents the cell from becoming tolerant to dopamine . It prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell can feel dopamine , but does n't become tolerant to it . So you can still get euphoria , but you wo n't feel cravings for it or have a diminished effect from the euphoria next time around . So if you where to take magnesium or dextromethorphan with these it would prevent tolerance . <p> American Ginseng <p> Proven to increase metabolism of THC to its inactive version 11-nor-9-carboxy . This means american ginseng is a working detox . Prevents CB1 activation after intoxication , reducing ones tolerance . American Ginseng also contains CB1 Inverse agonist falcarinol ( Studies show it reverses CB1s effects at certain sites ) . Some slight hormonal type improvements have also been noted . American Ginseng also increases dopamine production in certain areas of the brain improving memory and tolerance . American Ginseng also works as a choline uptake enhancer exactly as racetams ( nootropics ) do . <p> Carrot Extract or Capsules <p> Carrots contain falcarinol which is a CB1 antagonist therby increasing the receptors sensitivity by it not being activated . <p> Fish Oil <p> Helps to rebuild and maintain Cannabinoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Has shown to be an active detox for Marijuana and especially alchol . <p> Memory Impairment <p> Marijuana affects long-term and short-term memory potentiation and synaptic plasticity which refers to the connectivity between neurons and affects how often they fire over time . Increasing or decreasing the neurotransmitters and there actions can have a positive effect and many are used worldwide to increase the processes in working memory that Marijuana specificly deteriorates . The highest concentration of cannabinoid receptors in the brain exists in the hippocampus , which soley responsible for memory production . <p> Alpha GPC <p> Alpha GPC increase a very important neurotransmitter called Acetylcholine which is predomintly used for attention , arousal , learning , memory and muscle contraction . Compounds in cannabis inhibit the release of Acetylcholine . <p> cAMP <p> cAMP pertains to signal transduction and memory . Low levels have been related to mariuana psychosis . A reduction of cAMP levels in glutaminergic neurons , lowers the activity of the NMDA function in the hippocampus . It is found in lowered concentrations in both schizophrenic and psychotic bipolar disorder patients . This protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Forskolin . Forskolin is made from Coleus which is also a slight hallucinogenic available at most garden stores . Forskolin should be taken with Artichoke Extract to enhance PDE 4 Long Term Memory Formation . <p> Huperzine A <p> Huperzine A is a very important supplement to consider for marijuanas defective influence on hippocampal NMDA receptors ( which lead to memory loss when activated by Marijuana ) . NMDA receptors are believed to be involved in cellular hippocampal LTP and LTD processes , in respect to memory consolidation and forgetting factors. 316 For these process to occur on the cellular level , a high enough excitatory postsynaptic potential must occur to depolarize the CA1 hippocampal postsynaptic membranes and remove the magnesium blockade on NMDA receptors , making magnesium another supplement of equal rank to be considered . <p> Glutathione is produced naturally in the liver .

Glutathione deficiencies have been shown to lower short term memory and help cause schizophrenia . This compound has been shown to protect dopamine neurons from damage and increase their activation . Glutathione precursors have also been shown to help chronic marijuana users quit if they wanted to . This herb has also been found to thwart brain damage and inflammation caused from smoke , lipoxygenase , and even removes aluminum from brain tissue . Acetylcysteine raises glutathione and is good for memory ( i.e. protective against brain damage ) . <p> Vassopressin <p> Marijuana is said to inhibit the release of vasopressin , and thus perhaps interfere with memory-imprinting .

Also can relieve symptoms of brain fog . Studies have shown it is very beneficial with boosting the effects of NGF . It helps ATP production . Uridine relies on ATP to exert its effects , thus proving synergistic effects between the two . Aceytl-L-Carnitine also works synergistically with l-glutamine , increasing the activation of glutaminase , the enzyme responsible with converting glutamine into glutamate ( most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain ) . <p> Ginkgo Biloba <p> Used worlwide for Memory &amp; Attention . Also a D1 antagonist which can lead to better sensitivity to dopamine release which equals a better high . <p> Dihydromyricetin Extract <p> A natural proven intoxication blocker .

It reduces glutamate receptor desensitization and blocks NMDA exitotoxicity . Which makes it a good supplement to consider for any Marijuana user . Aniracetam and other racetams upregulate the AMPA receptor which marijuana removes from the cell surface . <p> Oxiracetam <p> Is also a Nootropic that is a NMDA agonist so will not alleviate the negative impact of marijuana on the NMDA receptor but can provide noticable concentrative effects in other circumstances . Oxiracetam and other racetams upregulate the AMPA receptor which marijuana removes from the cell surface . <p> Sleep &amp; Depression <p> Sleep is important in not attaining psychosis . Cannabis decreases REM sleep and causes a form of sleep deprivation which can lead to minor and major psychotic episodes . <p> GABA <p> GABA is a neurotransmitter important for regulating &amp; suppressing thoughts .

These also increase BDNF which can help with better synaptic plasticity , and they also seem to normalize EEG which is something than schizophrenics could benefit from .

Since deciding to start using cannabis I feel like my life is turning around . I have a much more positive outlook on life . True I 've probably lost some memory , but no more than alcohol would have done , and alcohol has done so much harm . Now I smoke instead I feel much much healthier too ... People around me have actually noticed my change in attitude for the better and have commented on it . I actually feel love for people around me , something I found hard to feel at all . And I am taking these feelings with me the times when I am sober too . So far it 's all good !

I just carefuly nuked the fuckers with a good veg BUG spray from the DIY shop and prayed that the Insectiside would have either worn off in the final 3-4 weeks or I figured i had probaly smoked shit a million times worse than that in some of the crap i have smoked over the last 25 yrs . <p> it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoked no probs at all . occasionaly i 'd get a joint make a loud POP like a firecracker , but i figured that 's just a dead spidermite getting roasted as i toked on his arse : ) weed was the best i 'd ever had by the way . : ) <p> STICKEYFINGERS <p> 03-03-10 , 05:55 PM <p> Try some SPRAYSAFE . Its in a blue bottle . I had a bad infestation on my last crop and was told to use it . U can use it in the last week of flower ! ! I was also advised to HOOVER the buggers off but i did n't  need to , just a good wipe and a good spray . a week later i croped and there was no sign of them . Hope this helps . <p> bubbs <p> 03-03-10 , 06:16 PM <p> oh bugger GM that 's shit mate , well this is how i used to control mine in flower , in a big sprayer , 5ltr , i used 20 ml neem oil , 10 ml voddy , 1ml peppermint oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake vigorously and spray like shit , i usually did it in the morning so that when lights came on at night they were dry , this seems to do the trick for about 2 to 3 weeks if you have a heavy infestation , do n't  worry about the light just do it with the lights off and curtains closed ive never had a hermie yet ! ! ! <p> TheGreenMachine <p> 03-03-10 , 10:09 PM <p> Thanks guys . <p> I 'll try the wiping the leaves route first and see how that goes .

There are these clumps or balls of mites on the end of young leaves now and when you squish them they go a brown green goo on your fingers .

I ordered 2000 though cause my brother and his mate are infested too but I just been informed that my bro 's mate 's mate has been busted so they both harvested early to get shut of the plants so now I 'll have 2000 of the little buggers for half dozen plants . lol .

Aparently , the bugs I have chosen lays thier egss in the webbing and basicly infiltrates the nest . <p> I ca n't wait for them to arive . I 'll leave the desk fan that 's circulating air around off while I dipserse my predators and leave it off for a few hours so they can establish themselves . Aparently , the predators like it around 60% humid although I thought this was bad for plants in flower . <p> So as I see it , while I get the room nice for the predators , I risk mould on my buds : ( What 's the lesser of two evils here ? Mouldy bud or snap crackle pop bud ? <p> I know one thing , I 'm going to be watching closely most of the day with a Loupe or magnifying glass to see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : laugh : <p> Sci-Pe <p> 11-03-10 , 10:55 AM <p> Haha KILL !

When I administered them , I turned my oscilating fan off completely , sprinkled the bottles contents across all my plants and left the room for half a day before putting the oscilating fan back on . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet : ) <p> So my little predators should have been busy since Saturday getting established and invading the spider mites webs on a kill frenzy . <p> With 3 weeks left for my girlies ( possibly 4 weeks ) all I can do now is let the bugs do thier thing . <p> I also repotted one of my mothers which was outgrowing it 's pot . I just gave it 's rootball a trim and repotted it in fresh soil . Greedy cow had gotten so big in the root department she was drying out the soil in her pot within hours of it being watered . <p> Also interestingly , one of the mothers I have is from this batch of girls in flower . All the cuttings were established at the same time and I kept one back as a mum . This mum is now maybe 8 inches tall while her sisters in the flowering room are 2 - 3ft monsters . Just goes to show the power of HPS over a 125w CFL ! <p> Not that I want monster mums in my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same mum under diferent environments . <p> TheGreenMachine <p> 22-03-10 , 09:37 AM <p> Had my predators in my grow room for about a week now . <p> On the surface , it looks like they are doing their job ! : D <p> I have n't been going in removing spider mite webbing half as much since introducing the predatory mites , only occasionally having to sweep away the most obvious webs . I have to say that there does n't seem to be as much webbing as there has been at all . <p> Usually over a 1 week period , I would be swamped with webs on the plants in one corner , but this past week has seen only a few noticable webs here and there . <p> So it appears my little munching predators are doing something to maintain the problem . I 'm quite happy if all they do is keep the spider mites under control . <p> Ah yes , but wait , there 's more .... <p> What did I do like a complete dope ..... ? Well these predator mites come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was vermiculite .

@@46022025 @6022025/ <p> I have seen posts recently where growers have disputed that spraying the leaves of a plant is the best method of feeding there grows . All though it can be beneficial it does n't have the effect most growers think it has . <p> Does anyone here spray there plants through the veg cycle until reaching the 1st week of flowering ... ? I spray for a max of 2 weeks when there babies but not after that period of time . <p> What nutes do you spray if you are a spray grower ... ? <p> The Myth of Foliar Feeding <p> " Fertilizers sprayed on the leaves of trees and shrubs are more effective than soil applications " <p> The Myth <p> Recently , I received an email from a professional colleague whose clients often ask about foliar feeding as a method of fertilizing plants . As he says , " All the water soluble fertilizer companies advertise the practice all the time . " What , he wondered , was my opinion of the practice ? Foliar feeding involves spraying the foliage of target plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on scientific research from the 1950s , which demonstrated that leaves can take up minerals through their stomata , and in some cases through their cuticles . This research is consistently cited in the argument that foliar feeding is 8 , 10 , or even 20 times more effective than traditional soil application . In assessing the advertised claims for foliar feeding of shrubs and trees , I had particular questions that are answered in bulleted lists below ( all bullets are directly from marketing media ) : <p> When the soil is too cold for conversion of nutrient elements into usable forms When it is at least 72F Any time except when it is too hot or too cold Transplant time Bloom time When a quick growth response is desired After fruit set Every 2-3 weeks Any time of stress As long as the plant has leaves that are n't  dormant When the soil is deficient in nutrients <p> ( 3 ) What time of the day , and in what quantity , should you apply foliar fertilizers ? <p> Early morning Until it drips from the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " In our opinion , foliar feeding is by far the best approach to use to insure maximum growth , yields , and quality by overcoming limitations of the soil and its ability to transfer nutrients into the plant . " The Reality If these laundry lists look more like a multiple choice test rather than solid information , its not surprising . Foliar feeding is yet another agricultural practice best suited to intensive crop production under specific soil limitations rather than as a landscape management tool . Thus , advertisers take great liberties with the facts , often resulting in contradictory messages ( note especially the recommended temperature conditions ! ) . Rather than individually refute the numerous errors in the claims , I 'll explain when foliar feeding might actually be beneficial . The original 1950s research came from Michigan State University and was particularly useful in understanding how nutrients move within plant tissues . As explained by Dr. Tukey in his testimony to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy , use of radiolabelled nutrients allowed his team to discover " that a leaf is a very efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively small , but to offset this handicap , the efficiency is high . " From this advertisers claim that foliar feeding is 8 , 10 or 20 times more effective than soil application . This is not accurate for several reasons . Obviously , materials applied directly to a leaf are more likely to enter the leaf in large quantity than the same materials applied to the soil . Leaching , chemical reactions , microbial activity , etc. can decrease what actually reaches the roots and is taken up into the plant . But materials applied to the leaf do not necessarily travel throughout the entire plant as effectively as they do through root uptake . They often remain in the same or adjoining tissues but travel no further . This is especially true of those elements recognized as " immobile " within plant tissues ( apart from root uptake and xylem transport ) . Research over many decades has explored the mineral uptake and transport of many species of fruit trees , conifers including pine and spruce species , and some hardwoods of ornamental or commercial value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species responding well to treatment and others remaining unaffected . Generally , the results suggest that foliar application of particular nutrients can be useful in crop production situations where soil conditions limit nutrient availability . For instance , alkaline soils do not readily release many metallic nutrients , especially iron and manganese . Zinc , copper , magnesium , molybdenum , boron , and calcium are other micronutrients required in small quantities that have been applied to foliage in an effort to relieve deficiencies and combat fruit disorders . Fruit , as adjacent tissue , can benefit from foliar spray . But this is a localized application that does not affect the trunk or roots and therefore is not a solution to soil imbalances . In fact , researchers consistently state that foliar treatments are a specialized , temporary solution to leaf and fruit deficiencies in tree fruit production but will not solve larger soil management issues . On the other hand , macronutrients , such as nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium , are needed in larger quantities . While many of these are mobile in the plant , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take up enough material to supply the entire plants demands . Furthermore , foliar application of high concentrations of such nutrients often results in leaf burn as water evaporates and the fertilizer salts remain behind . Substituting numerous , lower concentration applications would not be cost effective . Species differ widely in their ability to take up nutrients through their leaves . Differences in cuticle thickness , stomatal resistance , and other genetic factors will influence uptake , as will environmental conditions . Plants in a protected situation ( like a greenhouse ) have thinner and more porous cuticles than plants in the field and take up foliar sprays much more readily . Likewise , plants adapted to arid environments naturally have thicker , less penetrable cuticles than those from more moderate locations . A better management solution to the problem of nutrient availability is to choose plants that can adapt to the existing soil conditions . If you have alkaline or calcareous soils , for heavens sake do n't  install acid loving plants ! Poor plant selection in terms of mineral nutrition will be a management problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Choose cultivars of species that are more resistant to alkaline soils they are able to acidify the root environment so that micronutrients are remobilized from the soil and available for uptake . The existing research does not justify foliar fertilization of landscape plants as a general method of mineral nutrition . It can be useful for diagnosing deficiencies ; for instance , spraying leaves with iron chelate can help determine if interveinal chlorosis is from iron deficiency . It would obviously have benefit for those landowners with landscape fruit trees that perpetually have flower or fruit disorders associated with micronutrient deficiencies . Applying fertilizers to leaves ( or the soil ) without regard to actual mineral needs wastes time and money , can injure plant roots and soil organisms , and contributes to the increasing problem of environmental pollution . <p> The Bottom Line <p> Tree and shrub species differ dramatically in their ability to absorb foliar fertilizers . Proper plant selection relative to soil type is crucial to appropriate mineral nutrition . Foliar spraying is best accomplished on overcast , cool days to reduce leaf burn . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not solve them . Micronutrients are the only minerals that are effectively applied through foliar application . Foliar application will not alleviate mineral deficiencies in roots or subsequent crown growth . Foliar spraying is only a temporary solution to the larger problem of soil nutrient availability . Minerals ( especially micronutrients ) applied in amounts that exceed a plants needs can injure or kill the plant and contribute to environmental pollution . Any benefit from foliar spraying of landscape trees and shrubs is minor considering the cost and labor required . <p> CockRoach <p> 26-03-10 , 11:41 AM <p> Good post wrams mate ive been saying for a while that as long you keep your ladys happy in terms of feed and humidity then you should NEVER need to spray plants . it can lead to all kinds of problems you really do n't  want like mould/stem rott/damping off to name a few <p> cock <p> wert <p> 26-03-10 , 12:58 PM <p> just to add a wetting agent , i use yukka extractshidigara sp is good to use when foliar spraying to stop the fluid going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 02:25 PM <p> Good post wrams mate ive been saying for a while that as long you keep your ladys happy in terms of feed and humidity then you should NEVER need to spray plants . it can lead to all kinds of problems you really do n't  want like mould/stem rott/damping off to name a few <p> cock <p> Your welcome buddy . : D <p> To be honest I only ever spray when I plant cuttings and that is always Carbonated Water , I sometimes spray babies to for a week to 10 days there abouts , this does help them because carbonated water gives plants the much needed ' Carbon Dioxide LONG ... which plants thrive on so does them wonders in my humble opinion .

Foliar feeding is yet another agricultural practice best suited to intensive crop production under specific soil limitations rather than as a landscape management tool .

Lol : ) <p> starchild <p> 26-03-10 , 10:37 PM <p> I have always , and will always foliar feed . Its true , there are situations when foliar feeding is dangerous , that has been touched on . However it really depends on what you are actually folia feeding . I only ever spray the plants with seaweed , and my own , homemade , and completely organic variety . <p> Seaweed contains natural wetting agents ( **30;554;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that get lost in soil , or even plain water , as the concentrations in those instances have to be so high , you can risk nute lockout . With foliar feeding , you can use a much weaker dose , as its almost immediately absorbed by the plant . <p> I would never suggest you could feed your plants with ' grow ' or ' bloom ' , you would clog the plants pores with the concentrated sugars from the molasses in the feed , and probably choke your plant . <p> Spraying with water is a very good way to increase the natural humidity of your plants , as they drink it rootwise , they absord it through their leaves , and the plants can last longer without drying out . However too much plain water can wash valuable nitrogen from the plant , and in some cases inhibit groth , however a seaweed folair feed contains traces of nitrogen based minerals , and the plant replaces what could have been lost ... <p> I guess the argument will always rage on ... lol <p> ViK <p> 26-03-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding but I 'm confident that it makes a difference . Especially if you have deficencies , it acts much faster than feeding the roots , and if you 've got lock out then the roots are n't taking anything anyway ... I use whatever I 'm feeding them watered down to a third strength . <p> Rizla <p> 27-03-10 , 01:16 PM <p> I read an article in an old WEED WORLD mag where an old time grower would foliar right up till the last 2 weeks of flower with various stickers , spreaders and what-not . He swore by it . He did say he kept his RH at around 45% at all times tho , and this dispensed with any budrot forming . <p> Remeber tho folks , foliar at a QUARTER strengh MAX ! as has been posted . and use it as a suppliment or short-term deficiency fix ( in some cases ) never a main feed . <p> NEVER foliar at lights on when your plants are near a HOT HID . cold spray and hot lights do n't  mix , cant say ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm sure the risk is there , anyway , foliar feeding under hot lights can damage the leaves where water spots cause the light to focus . just as lights off is hitting is when i do my flowering plants .

Many just quote a fan size . If your cf is only capable of allowing something like 500cfm through it and you are pulling double that , you have problems .

By the sounds of it , you do n't  have negative pressure . <p> Do the sides of your tent get sucked in by the fan ? If so , its ok , ignore what comes next ! lol <p> If the sides DO NT get sucked in , you do n't  have negative pressure . <p> Negative pressure is caused when you have more air being forced out of the tent than is being forced in . This means that any smells MUST escape via the exhaust fan , which , in your case , means they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  have negative pressure , smells can escape anywhere they like , mostly via your zip and area 's like that . <p> Hope this helps fella .

@@46022037 @6022037/ <p> Hi all . I am in the process of designing my 2 pot rdwc system , which will be upgraded to 4 pot if succesfull . I have a couple of questions relating to the design , and if anyone can help out i 'd be very grateful . Now i sometimes over-think these things , but i have a question about the return pipes . Question 1 . is there any specific place i can place these return pipes , which may create some turbulence in the pots , which will prevent the roots from growin into the return pipes . Like could i create a swirlin motion inside the pots which would keep the roots in the pot instead of down the return pipes . I notice that most folks just place them in the centre of the box ? <p> question 2 . The feed tubes/ to the spray bars . I am lookin to put these in a square pattern around all 4 sides of the box , with a pipe into a tee fittin , then around the sides and another tee leadin out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume that these are best enterin the pot so that there is the same lenth of pipe before the next tee , to keep pressure constant in the spray pipes . Like if the feed and exit pipes were at 90 dejrees to each other , then there would be more pressure in the " short pipe run " if you understand . Would i be reite thinkin it would be better if they were equal . I havny cut any holes in the boxes yet , so any advice is appreciated . <p> Also how do you size your nutrient chiller ? My boxes are 42 litre , which will probably have 30litres of nutes in it , and my res is 84 litre . I would rather buy the chiiller to suit the 4 pot set up , rather than have to buy another one later . <p> Cheers for your help , dudes . <p> Billy <p> GUNIT <p> 03-06-15 , 07:03 PM <p> hi there mate , here 's a diagram of my system which was a 4 pot but i have no gone to a 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideally you want your returns on opposite sides of the tubs to combat the suctions pulling the roots into the returns . I have found that it let 's them stay pretty much central . I would recommend a min of 32mm for the returns as it seems to create a good flow rate . if you want to create extra turbulance at 2 90 degree bends inside the res from the returns pointing at the surface and the flow will create flooms on the surface . G <p> Jerry Weeds <p> 03-06-15 , 08:52 PM <p> Or instead of pipes you can go with 18mm hose or something so you can move buckets where you want , why go with pipes =/ this rdwc in fact is much more difrent than mine lol , i have 18mm back in bottom , and 4mm pipe on the top brings water in . <p> Toasted <p> 03-06-15 , 09:47 PM <p> hey mate when i was building my system i went with 7 65 ltr tubs 1 for res and was going to go with 42mm returns but was a little worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks so managed to find 110mm returns the plants have been in the system about 2 weeks now and root growth is rapid to say the least so i think 32- 42mm would be minimum for a good veg to save problems later . I will be down sizeing my system to 4 or maybe even 2 tubs as growth is rapid i will be lucky to get a 5 wk veg let alone 7-8wk For mine i orig orderd a 300a chiller so it would n't have to work as hard as a 150a but i ended up with a 500a and it works perfect and my insulation on the tubs ai n't  great lol 10971 @qwx420971 <p> 03-06-15 , 11:33 PM <p> Thanks for your advice , i appreciate it . Ive been speakin to Upton on another forum about this too , and will be puttin the return pipes at opposite sides of the totes , ( 32mm pipes ) , like you say Mr Unit . I 'm usin 200mm net pots , which will sit on top of a slab of celotes 50mm insulation I had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cos i do n't  think i need them that larje . I also thoujht that i may be able to use a slitely smaller pump , but a variable speed pump a jebao dc12000 has been recommended , and a hailea hc500 chiller . This is startin to be expensive , so it better be worth it : ) I am likin the sound of the 90 bends towards the surface to create flooms . Mite try it out as it sounds like it will help . Am plannin an overflow back to the res too , in 22mm pipe , and will keep it near the top of the totes . I did think about keepin the overflow at at the water level , to balance out the levels in the pots , and make sure both totes were at the same level ? What do you think ? <p> And what nutes do you use in these systems . I been readin back and the lejend that is Heath Robinson used ionic ? What 's the crack , will these be ok ? I notice they are fairly cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on order , and some canna coco a and B , but do n't  suppose these would work in the recirculatin system ? or would they <p> All i have to do now is order a chiller and a pump , and break out the hole saw . woop woop <p> GUNIT <p> 04-06-15 , 06:04 AM <p> i would keep the overflow slightly above your max level mate as you will find the majority of the roots sit close too the surface so they may grow into the pipe . I only use ionic myself mate , always have done and always will , the only other poduct i use is superthrive and even then i only use it during early veg to give the seedlings a kick up the arse . my pump is a hailea hx-8830 which is 3500 ltr/hr and it 's been more than enough for my 150litre 2 plant system . <p> Upton is a good friend of mine as we have been using this forum and others for years now so you 've been in good hands with my old friend . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i designed the spray bar system many moons ago on breedbay and gave the idea to other folk but tbh since using it i have returned to my original setup of just using at t-piece on the end of the feed pipe in each tub as it 's alot easier to setup and the end results have been pretty much the same with both systems . <p> and this is the manifold i constructed to feed the plant tubs LONG ... <p> i have a vid showing my flooming system but i 'll have to try dig it out after work , if you need any other info just ask buddy or pm me .

These little dooh daahs fit inside the end of the pipe , effectively stiffening it where it goes into the fitting , helpin to secure a leak free joint ( it says here ) : ) Or i mite just buy a heap of glue fittings and punt these offf to ebay . <p> last stupid q of the day , how do i join the 22mm pipe to the pump outlet.DO i need some sort of rubber adaptor or something .

I have now set this up in the tent , and drilled the holes in the pipes . No idea what i was doin apart fro Uptons advice to start small .

Shark seed did n't  jerm , it did n't  really sink properly in the water , it floated about an inch from the bottom of the container so i binned it after 3 days . I now have a Humbolt seeds trainwreck soakin . I think i will put this in a root riot cube soaked with a splash of rhizo , if it ever arrives. , then hand water it till the roots enter the res , then see how she flies . <p> Rock on !

The Lemon turned into a real stinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed up of explodin seeds in ma joints . Either that or i willl just have to go thru it with a fine tooth comb , to remove them . Amatuer mistake , i know , but that ; ll teach me to keep an eye on them eh ? I have cracked a couple and am just hopin that they do n't  hermie on me . I 've also cracked a trainwreck for the bubbler . Now i 'm just waitin for the nutes to arrive , and the seeds to show from the root riots .

Betweeen the res and the totes i will use equal length 13mm hose , with individual isolation taps , which should help durin changes . At the tote box i will have another top hat grommet either side of the net pot , with a Tee piece just inside the lid , to create a waterfall effect inside the tote . I will use the 40mm returns on this one , and a 6000l/hr pump I reckon this will work ok ? <p> What do you think ? <p> GUNIT <p> 11-06-15 , 07:17 PM <p> sounds good mate , ca n't wait to see it set up n running .

Most replacements are either 1 " BSP or 1.5 " BSP It has n't  been delivered yet , that 's why i ask . I want to order one up as soon as i can , rather than wait till pump arrives , then wait another week for the hose tail attachment to arrive . I want to get the show on the road sooner rather than later ! ! I 'm still waitin for the pump to arrive .

I will punt a diary up when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week in the pots , and are nothin much to look at . They look healthy enuff , and the EC is 0.6 in the lemon and 0.7 in the trainwreck .

( cue collosal fuck up of titanic proportions ! ) <p> I have packed away the RDWC stuff the now , because i 'm just too busy , chanjed jobs , have holidays comin up , and my tents are full to overload , but i have all the bits now , and most of it made , so come 10 weeks from now ( september ) i will be reducin the numbers of plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crank it up for a few trees . <p> I do n't  want to do this half arsed , so will wait till all my soil stuff is finished , which will be about 10 weeks , and i can have the tents totally cleaned out , bleached , cleaned , chanje filters ( one of my rhinos is 28 months old , constant use and just startin to leak a little bit of whiff , so i cant complain. ) and can soley concentrate on the RDWC system . I am now lookin at a 6 site 42 litre box system , with 84 litre res . <p> I have been lookin at youtube a lot lately , and notice that some folk use airstones in the buckets , and pump the nutes from the furthest bucket back to the res. to draw the nutrient thru the bottom of the tubs , with the stones bubblin it up .

If i had the choice i would go with spraybars overs airstones dude , from what ive read it delivers more DO than airstones and some people claim airstones can have a effect on stability of PH . I 've never noticed unstable PH with my grows usin em though . <p> Good idea on crackin on with the soil and getting shit out theway before you let her rip mate .

I also have some end caps for the Y pieces which i can fit and drill with a smaller hole if needed , or just to see if it increases the DO . I may even drill 2 holes , so i will effectively have 8 seperate sprays inside the tote . It would all help the DO holy grail i suppose . <p> Its all abit experimental just now , but you know what they say ..... nothin ventured and all that ! ! 10971 @qwx420971 <p> 23-06-15 , 09:26 PM <p> LONG ...

I finished the 4 pot system usin 84 litre totes , a 5000l hr pump and dual spray bars , and it works like a dream . the ph does n't  move and the plants look fantastic , if i say so myself . Here are some pics LONG ...

LONG ... its not quite finished yet , but it is powered by a 100litre an hour air pump which ive named " the beast " , it should be quite a nice system . I 've spent the day puttin up my new 2.4 by 2.4 tent for it to fit into . Easier to do on yer own than the little tents , surprisinjly Also cut the holes for the 40mm pipe . Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shite . This system will have 40mm main pipes which are reduced down to 22 for the return to the pump . I was plannin puttin the pump outside the res , but its too noisy so i will make up a pipe in 22mm to come over the top of the res , then into the pump , with a silicone coupler . The out side of the pump will be put into 19mm hose to the HC 500 chiller , and a return to the res from it . <p> pip pip wibble <p> Spartacus Smokes <p> 07-03-16 , 07:23 PM <p> Do the waste pipe and fittings hold all the water without leaking ? are they always full ?

This is a great advantage for those of you who appreciate having a year-round supply of fresh flowers , veggies and herbs . Artificial lighting is also a great way to jump-start spring by starting your seedlings months ahead of the last frost . There are three main types of horticultural lighting systems . <p> Lighting is one of the five major factors to consider when creating a support system for your plant life , ( water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus if you plan to grow inside , out of season , you must supplement the sunlight normally required for proper growth . This can be done with three different kinds of lighting , incandescent , fluorescent , and H.I.D . ( High Intensity Discharge ) . These are the most popular types of lighting for gardening purposes . There are many other kinds of lighting , but they do n't produce proper color ( kelvins ) that is suitable for growing . <p> Incandescent lighting These are the least efficient and least effective method of lighting , for plant growth . Incandescent lighting is the same as what is used in the average medium base household fixtures . This type of lighting is a very poor choice of lighting for your garden because of their inefficiency . <p> Fluorescent lights These are a little better choice than incandescent lights due to the fact that they are about twice as efficient ( lumens of light output per watt of electricity used ) . However these lights are not very effective in comparison to an HID ( High Intensity Discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches away from their subjects to ensure successful growth . However , some find that our T-5 fluorescent lights are perfect for use with seedlings and cuttings as well as for use with other plants that do not require the high intensity of H.I.D . ( High Intensity Discharge ) lighting . <p> H.I.D . ( High Intensity Discharge ) These lights are by far the most efficient and effective lights being used by growers today . There are two types of H.I.D . ( High Intensity Discharge ) lamps that have suitable light spectrums ( color range ) and intensity for plant growth . MH ( Metal Halide ) lamps are rich in the blue light spectrum , similar to full summer sun . HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) lamps are rich in the red/yellow spectrums , similar to the color of the fall sun . <p> HID ( High Intensity Discharge ) Plant Grow Lights Metal Halide - MH MH ( Metal Halide ) bulbs are very efficient and produce between 70 and 115 lumens of light output per watt of electricity used . MH ( Metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to full summer sun , with a spectrum rich in the blue end . This promotes fast vegetative growth and compact , stocky plants with short internodal leaf spacing . <p> Metal halide bulbs produce an abundance of light in the blue spectrum . This color of light promotes plant growth and is excellent for green leafy growth and keeping plants compact . It is the best type of light to be used as a primary light source ( if no or little natural sunlight is available ) . The average lifespan is about 10,000 cumulative hours . The bulb will light up beyond this time but due to the gradual decline of light , it is not worth your while to wait for the bulb to finally burn out . If you compare their lumen ( brightness ) per unit of energy consumed , metal halides produce up to 125 lumens per watt compared to 39 lumens per watt with standard fluorescent lights and 18 lumens per watt for standard incandescent bulbs <p> MH ( Metal Halide ) bulbs create light by passing electricity through an clear inner arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear glass tube . This inner arc tube contains mercury and other metals in iodide form . When electricity is applied to these metal iodides they give off very intense light and heat . The outer casing can also be phosphorus coated . Most gardeners prefer the clear bulb , as it produces the brightest white light available . <p> MH ( Metal Halide ) bulbs come in sizes from 70 to 1500 watts with the 250 w , 400 w and the 1000 w being the most popular sizes for gardening . All MH ( Metal Halide ) bulbs need to run with a ballast ( a ballast is a transformer that steps up the voltage to the proper amount needed to ignite the iodides ) , that is designed to run that specific bulb size . <p> The bulbs themselves need to be burned in a specific position . They come in three types : Vertical ( marked BU or BD ) , Horizontal ( marked HOR ) and Universal ( marked U ) .

This band of light triggers hormones in plants to increase flowering/budding in plants . They are the best grow lights available for secondary or supplemental lighting ( used in conjunction with natural sunlight ) . This is ideal for greenhouse growing applications . <p> Not only is this a great flowering light , it has two features that make it a more economical choice . Their average lifespan is twice that of metal halides , but after 18,000 hours of use , they will start to draw more electricity than their rated watts while gradually producing less light . HPS bulbs are very efficient . They produce up to 140 lumens per watt . Their disadvantage is they are deficient in the blue spectrum . If a gardener were to start a young plant under a HPS bulb , she/he would see impressive vertical growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up thin and lanky and in no time you will have to prune your plant back before it grows into the light fixture . The exception to this is using HPS grow lights in a greenhouse or in conjunction another light source that emits light in the blue spectrum . Light sources that have a high output in the blue spectrum like sunlight and MH grow lights offset any stretching caused by HPS bulbs . <p> HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) bulbs are the most efficient bulbs that are available for grow lights . They are high in the red and yellow parts of the light spectrum and low in the blue , this imitates the fall sun . Because of this spectrum some plants that are grown with HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) lights will grow elongated and rather leggy , while many other plants are not affected by the limited light spectrum . For plants that normally bud and flower in the fall an HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) is usually the light of choice because it 's light spectrum promotes flower production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) bulbs ( such as the Son Agro ) available for improved growing with HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) efficiency . These are designed specifically for indoor horticulture , and have a more balanced color spectrum . <p> HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) bulbs are made out of a translucent ceramic arc tube containing a mixture of sodium , mercury and xenon gas . This arc tube is suspended in an outer glass shield ( bulb ) . HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) bulbs range in power from 35w to 1000w , with the 250w , 400w , 600w and 1000w being the most popular for horticulture use . <p> HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) bulbs should be changed no later than 24 months from initial use . These bulbs ( like the Metal Halides ) also slowly lose their brightness over time , so to maintain proper light intensity the bulbs must be changed at the end of their rated life . <p> HID ( High Intensity Discharge ) Plant Grow Lights HID lighting is the most efficient way to convert electricity into light that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HID grow lights used for horticultural lighting : <p> HID Lighting Helpful Tips . Hanging height : Due to the heat that is emitted from these types of fixtures , you should hang them according to size . Smaller wattage systems ( 100 and 250 ) should be hung about 2 to 3 feet from the top of the plants . Medium wattage systems ( 400 and 600 ) should be hung around 4 feet from the top of the plants . High wattage systems ( 1000 and up ) should be placed at least 4 to 6 feet from the plant tops . <p> . How long should lights run ? This depends on the type of plant . Most plants and vegetables need about 10 to 12 hours of light to promote growth . Plants that produce fruits or flowers will show improvement with up to 16 hours a day of supplemental light . <p> Selecting a Grow Light Plants have the unique ability to manufacture their own food . The food manufacturing process is called photosynthesis . Photosynthesis is carried out by many different organisms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photosynthesis is the one carried out by higher plants and algae , as well as by cyanobacteria and their relatives , which are responsible for a major part of photosynthesis in oceans . All these organisms convert CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) to organic material by reducing this gas to carbohydrates in a rather complex set of reactions . Electrons for this reduction reaction ultimately come from water , which is then converted to oxygen and protons . Energy for this process is provided by light , which is absorbed by pigments ( primarily chlorophylls and carotenoids ) . Chlorophylls absorb blue and red light and carotenoids absorb blue-green light , but green and yellow light are not effectively absorbed by photosynthetic pigments in plants ; therefore , light of these colors is either reflected by leaves or passes through the leaves . This is why plants are green . <p> Cool ( blue ) and warm ( orange ) colors in the spectrum enhance chlorophyll activity and food production . Cool light is most pronounced during the summer months when the sun is highest in the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warm light , such as when the sun is lower in the sky during the fall harvest months , is responsible for triggering reproduction in plants in the form of flowers and fruits . After you select the type of lamp you want then you must decide how many systems will be required to cover the planted area . The following chart shows the coverage area of the available lamp sizes . HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) lighting can cost up to 15% more than comparable MH ( Metal Halide ) systems , however , the bulbs have a longer life span and also have a higher lumen output than any other H.I.D . ( High Intensity Discharge ) lighting . MH ( Metal Halide ) bulbs lose about 15% to 20% of their light intensity after one year where as the HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) bulbs lose only about 5% of their intensity in the same time frame . MH ( Metal Halide ) systems produce between 70 and 115 lumens per watt of electricity consumed , HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) systems produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which of these types of H.I.D . ( High Intensity Discharge ) lighting is the preference for generic use . But , the rule of thumb is that metal halide light spectrum is best for dense vegetative growth and the high pressure sodium is best suited for blooming growth . If you are starting to wonder if this article has a specific answer to the question of which is better , well , I 'll leave it up to personal preference . Some people have been known to have a MH ( Metal Halide ) and a HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) lighting system , using the MH ( Metal Halide ) for the vegetative cycle and then switching over to a HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) system when it 's time for blooming . Another option is to use a switchable ballast ( available in 1000w MH/HPS and 400w MH/HPS ) . These are ballasts that allow the grower the option of using an MH ( Metal Halides ) or an HPS lamp ( High Pressure Sodium ) , or they can use both ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the grow period to the other bulb , to simulate the grow seasons ) . These switchable systems are slightly less efficient than the normal ballasts , but they are much cheaper than buying an entirely separate system . <p> Regardless of which system you choose , you should change out your bulbs no later than the end of their rated life ; this is due to the loss of intensity and therefore rendering the system less efficient . MH ( Metal Halide ) bulbs should be changed after 12 to 18 months and HPS ( High Pressure Sodium ) bulbs after about 24 months . This will ensure proper light intensity and therefore proper growth . <p> Fluorescent Plant Grow Lights Until recently , fluorescent grow lights have had a low output and have been too big and bulky to be of much use as a grow light for anything more than starting seedlings . Compact and T5 full spectrum fluorescent lights have changed that . At 75 to 90 lumens per watt , these lights are energy efficient and extremely effective especially when used in numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the light emitted is used by the plant ) and produce much less heat than incandescent and HID grow lights . This allows them to be placed closer to plants ( within a few inches ) greatly decreasing lumen loss from the bulb to the plant . <p> The standard 40 and 20 watt full spectrum tubes are great for starts and seedlings . They are also popular for growing low-light plants like herbs and African violets . These lights are low intensity and need to be placed within 6 " ( up to 12 " for shade loving plants ) of the plants to be effective . They are a poor light source for flowering and budding primarily because of their low lumen output . <p> Incandescent Plant Grow Lights These lights are good for providing supplemental light to individual house plants or small groups of plants and provide an inexpensive alternative to other grow lights , because they do not require a ballast . Incandescent lights have a low lumen output per watt compared to HID and fluorescent grow lights . <p> The Cost to Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a light , take the lights combined wattage , and divide it by 1000 to get the kilowatts used . Then multiply that number by the amount your electric company charges per kilowatt hour . HID lights will use the number of watts it emits per hour , ie ; 600w system will use 600 watts per hour ( regardless of spectrum ) . <p> 200 - 280 nm UVC ultraviolet range which is extremely harmful to plants because it is highly toxic . 280 - 315 nm Includes harmful UVB ultraviolet light which causes plants colors to fade . 315 - 380 nm Range of UVA ultraviolet light which is neither harmful nor beneficial to plant growth . 380 - 400 nm Start of visible light spectrum . Process of chlorophyll absorption begins . UV protected plastics ideally block out any light below this range . 400 - 520 nm This range includes violet , blue , and green bands . Peak absorption by chlorophyll occurs , and a strong influence on photosynthesis. ( promotes vegetative growth ) 520 - 610 nm This range includes the green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigments . 610 - 720 nm This is the red band . Large amount of absorption by chlorophyll occurs , and most significant influence on photosynthesis. ( promotes flowering and budding ) 720 - 1000 nm There is little absorption by chlorophyll here . Flowering and germination is influenced . At the high end of the band is infrared , which is heat . 1000+ nm Totally infrared range . All energy absorbed at this point is converted to heat . <p> WHY use a GARDENLIGHT for indoor gardening ? Grow lights are usually the most expensive item in the indoor garden , so it 's important to choose the right one for your requirements . You should measure the square footage of your garden area , and consider the plants that will be grown . Different plants have different light requirements . Normally , the taller the plant , the more light required in order to reach the lower sections . Plants that flower or fruit typically require more light than those which do not ( ie : herbs ) . <p> WHAT type of GARDENLIGHT should you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are not powerful enough to light an area more than 8-10 " below the bulb . Although more efficient than incandescents , they are still much less efficient than HID light systems . HID ( High Intensity Discharge ) light systems have revolutionized indoor gardening in the last two decades . They are the most energy efficient grow lights available , so they produce much more light for the amount of power consumed . National Garden Wholesale offers GARDENLIGHTS in MH and HPS . Metal Halide ( MH ) bulbs emit a light spectrum which appears blue-white to the human eye . This color spectrum is more conducive for vegetative growth , or starting seeds &amp; clones . High Pressure Sodium ( HPS ) bulbs emit a spectrum which is more concentrated in red/orange light . This color is ideal for the fruiting and flowering stage of a plant 's development . It is a good multi-purpose light as well . Larger wattage systems will cover larger growing areas , and since these bulbs produce greater light intensity they are superior for growing taller plants such as tomatoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use at least 25 watts per square foot of garden space . You may need less if your GARDENLIGHT is used to supplement natural sunlight , or if you are growing a plant that does not require as much light ( ie : lettuce ) . However , many gardeners prefer to double or even triple the recommended wattage to achieve faster growth rates . There is really no such thing as too much light , but using a big light in a small space will sometimes result in high temperatures that are difficult to control . Keep in mind that plants need periods of darkness too . Most indoor gardeners use supplemental lighting from 10 - 16 hrs per day . <p> Hanging Height Keep an HID bulb about 30 " - 36 " above the top of your plants . ( This is an average distance ... lower wattage bulbs may be placed closer , while higher wattage bulbs may need to be placed further away ) . Higher wattage bulbs provide more intense light for large growing areas . Lower wattage systems are used for smaller garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plants will also affect coverage area . <p> Average coverage area by wattage : 150/175 watts - 2 ' x 2 ' 250 watts - 3 ' x 3 ' 400 watts - 4 ' x 4 ' 600 watts - 6.5 ' x 6.5 ' 1000 watts - 8 ' x8 ' Power Consumption On average a GARDENLIGHT will increase your electricity cost from $5 to $8 per month-the exact amount depends on the size of the system and the number of hours operated . However , since these grow lights are so energy efficient , you are getting huge amounts of light ( and growing power ) for your money ! Make sure your grow room 's power circuit can handle the power draw . For safety reasons , do not exceed 75% of the rated ability of the fuse ( for example : use no more than 15 amps on a 20-amp circuit ) . To calculate your cost , multiply the bulb wattage X hours of operation and divide by 1000 . This figure is the number of kilowatt hours of electricity consumed . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will use 7.2 kilowatt hours ) . Check your power bill for the cost of each kilowatt hour . <p> Information about Lamps The plant sensitivity curve for photosynthesis has its peak at the red end of the spectrum ( 675nm ) ( McCree ) . <p> This chart indicated that providing plants with the wavelengths best suited to photosynthesis , is the most efficient use of artificial light . Tests show a mean deviation from the average sensitivity curve of less than 5% for a wide variety of plants . The curve shows that the maximum sensitivity for photosynthesis lies in the far red at approximately 675 nm . <p> The plant sensitivity curve disputes two common misconceptions . The first is that an " ideal " plant growing lamp duplicates the spectral energy distribution of the sun . Sunlight has a continual spectrum , radiating energy in wavelengths that contribute less to photosynthesis , and are therefore " wasted " on the plant . For this reason , many lamps are more efficient than sunlight for plants . <p> Which Lamp is Best for Your Growing Needs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectrum . It 's the best type of light to be used as a primary light source ( if little or no natural sunlight is available ) .

They are the best lamps available for secondary or supplemental lighting ( used in conjuction with natural sunlight ) . This type of light promotes flowering/budding in plants . It 's ideal for Greenhouse/Commercial growing applications . <p> Conversion Lamps There are two(2) types of conversion lamps : Sodium Lamps which run on halide ballasts - more common . Halide Lamps which run on sodium ballasts . This type of lamp allows you to tailor the light source to the growth stage of the plant ( again , using halide blue light for growth and sodium red light for flowering/budding ) merely by changing lamps . <p> Fluorescent This type of light is perfect for starts and seedlings but is a poor light source for growth and budding primarily because of low lumen output . <p> Incandescent Unlike the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballast .

@@46022040 @6022040/ <p> We naturally tend to focus on the upper part of the plant because it 's more visible , but the root system is just as vital to a plant 's overall health . Roots take up water and nutrients and anchor the plant to the medium . Without healthy roots , plants will be stunted and prone to disease , stems will be weak and might break easily , flowers wo n't bloom and fruit wo n't set . Without root care , seedlings and cuttings will never root properly or take to the medium . There are guidelines every gardener can follow to promote root health and products and techniques available that can improve root growth . Roots are a vital link in the chain of plant systems and chains are only as strong as their weakest link , keep your roots healthy and you 'll keep the chain strong . <p> Seedlings : <p> When a seed germinates , a known as the taproot breaks out of the seed and begins its search for nutrients and water . During this stage of root and plant development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to thrive . The health of the roots is crucial at this stage of growth because the taproot is small and delicate . Seedling roots prefer warmer temperatures than the roots of mature plants . Root growth will increase dramatically if you can maintain the root zone temperature at 24 to 27C and keep the air temperature a few degrees cooler If root zone temperatures exceed 27C the roots can dry out or become prone to diseases like root rot or damping off . Place your seedling trays on a seedling heating mat equipped with a thermostat , which can be purchased at any indoor gardening supply store . <p> There are some fairly common reasons behind most problems you might encounter with your seedling roots . overwatering is a big concern as seedlings do not yet have the ability to absorb much water and underwateing can also become a problem since seedling roots are few and delicate and unable to survive fully drying out . <p> Feeding young seedlings nutrients is unnecessary because they already carry enough nutrients to sustain themselves within the seed . Seedling roots do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks this encourages the roots to grow down and out in search of water and nutrients . I always follow this rule and never feed them anything before week two at the very earliest . These steps also aplly to cuttings , but cuttings need roots first , and this is best achieved by dipping the cut end of the clone in a rooting compound right after the cut is made . Rooting compounds contain the same rooting hormones that are found naturally in plants and it is believed that covering the undifferentiated cells along the cut with concentrated dose of these hormones can greatly improve the success rate of cuttings and increase the speed at which they develop roots . Plenty of good guides on here for cuttings Bud Lightyears one being a very simple and effective way . As plants mature , their roots begin to branch out from the taproot much like the leafy growth above the ground branches out from the stem . Rootlets tiny root hairs that draw in water and nutrients begin to grow . Root tips continue to elongate , always searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now anchor the plant , allowing trees to survive strong winds and orchids to cling to the branches and nooks of trees . These mature roots also begin to transport water and store food for the plant in the form of starches . Mature roots also have certain requirements that must be met for them to thrive . <p> Soil : <p> Roots growing in soil will do best in a temperature range between 18 and 24C . Soil that is any colder than this will slow down processes within the roots and the plant will absorb less water and nutrients , while soil any warmer than 24C will allow roots to become dehydrated or even actually cook . Soil that is kept to warm will also have little oxygen present in the nutrient solution , effectively drowning the plant . Growing in pots requires the gardener to pay close attention to the size of the root ball . Roots that have hit the edge of their containers will become tangled and starved for space plants can become stunted , affecting the production of fruit and flowers . Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best the to transplant the plant into a larger pot . This can be stressful to the plant , so try to be gentle on the roots . Try running room temperature water over the pot , which can help gently coax out a stubborn cluster of roots . If you want to keep the plant in the same-sized container , you can trim back the roots every so often , but this must be done with a sterile instrument to avoid the spread of disease . Root trimming is not recommended for plants that you are trying to get a yield from , high-yield plants need lots of healthy roots to maximise fruit production . <p> Hydro : <p> Plants in hydroponic systems can be almost completely submerged in water while keeping roots healthy and white . Air stones can be used to infuse oxygen into the water . Oxygen can also be introcuced via fluming or spraybars . Plants in hydroponic systems like their root zones a bit cooler than their soil counterparts in pots , preferring that the nutrient solution in the reservoir stay in the 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Water in this range can hold much more oxygen than water above 24 C. Sometimes HID lights used in indoor gardening can cause the temperature of the grow room and subsequently your hydroponic solution to climb above the range safe for roots . <p> To combat high reservoir temperatures , you can insulate your reservoirs or cover the reservoir with black and white plastic with the white side facing up to reflect the light up and the black side facing the solution to absorb any light that sneaks through . This will also help prevent algae and bacteria from forming in the reservoir . These organisms compete with the plants for oxygen and nutrients and can lead to root infections . The least amount of pumps and equipment you run in your res the better as they will produce small amounts of heat which will warm up your res , so try and keep them to a minimum . Ive been fortunate enough never to suffer from root rot and plan on keeping that way . A reservoir chiller is also an effective remedy for high reservoir temperatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult and i personally would n't grow without one now . Extra care should be taken when growing in hydro that the root mass does n't  block up pumps or filters , ive had a close shave with this a few times and if left unoticed would cause a disaster to equipment and more importantly your crop . So somthing to keep your eye on , i even strip clean all my pumps after each grow and remove any sucked in roots and give them a good clean down to keep them as effective as possible . <p> Feeds and bennys : <p> Personnaly i love canna rhizotonic for my dwc grows , do n't  have to use it at manucactures stated dose but even at a low dose does wonder for my crops . I think if your temp and other feeds is in check there is no need to run bennys but there is situations where they can be very bennifical . <p> There are plenty of products on your local hydroponics shop shelves that are designed to keep roots healthy and improve their development . One such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in the hormones that promote root growth . There are also many biological products available that contain colonies of beneficial bacteria or fungi that work symbiotically with your plants , helping them break down and absorb nutrients more easily . This is especially applicable in organic gardens . The downside of these products is that they are live and do have a shelf life . The numbers gradually decrease as time passes , so be wary of buying products containing living beneficial bacteria or fungi that do n't have a packaging date or a best-before date . There are some products available that do n't contain any living bacteria or fungi just the enzymes produced by them . These products are great because they do not have a shelf life , they can be used with hydrogen peroxide and they can be applied in hydroponic and aeroponic systems as well as in pots . Some insects infest root zones and feed on and damage roots . The larvae of fungus gnats live in the growing medium and eat tiny root hairs . They appear as thin white worms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults are small black flies that suck the juices out of leaves . Fungus gnats affect a wide range of herbaceous plants . To deal with fungus gnat larvae , treat your growing medium with a larvicide , adults can be treated with yellow or blue sticky cards or with biological controls like ladybugs . Nematodes are another species that can harm your roots . Pest nematodes are translucent worms less than 2.5 mm long that can cause root knots or galls and injure root tips . Infected plants develop distorted leaves and stunted growth and fruit production . Nematode infestations are best treated by using nematicides or by introducing predatory nematodes that will feed on the pest variety . <p> The root system is so vital to the overall health of your plants . Without a healthy root system , plants will display stunted growth and impaired fruit production . You ca n't afford to forget about the roots , even though they are below the surface , because healthy roots equal healthy plants .

This allows you to smoke it all and not burn your fingers or lips and can help prevent tobacco or weed being sucked into the mouth .

Example a sea of green 35 pots and want to harvest fast , then i would send them to flower and expect say 1oz x 35 in the min time for that strain . Or if you are growing a few and in no rush for the harvest ( which i doubt ) then veg for longer . The longer you veg the bigger the plant the bigger the yield . But it depends on pot size . grow space , head hight . No good growing a six foot plant in a 4ltr pot or small tent/cupboard . Saying that you would never beat the sog for yield , you would need a single plant the size of a christmas tree : )

Some of them are slightly strange looking , like a little bit stretched but I think it 's to do with the light being too close . I 'll get a pic up later . I 've just spent the last hour fucking around , getting my dehumidifier into the tent . I 've set it up so that it drains directly into the res tank ( will need to keep an eye on ph ) as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have drank about 12 litres in less than 2 days so this setup might save me a bit of effort topping up . The humidity is terrible but I 've been spraying with budrot stop as a precaution . One of the reasons I 'm looking forward to harvest is so I can re-configure the set-up using the lessons I 've learnt from this grow . <p> I 'm just smoking a small sample now which I dried on low heat in the oven ( heresy I know ! ) just to see how strong it is ( I 've done the same a couple of times over the last couple of weeks ) and it 's not bad , in terms of potency at least ... obviously , the taste is a bit crap ! <p> Thanks for the advice though dude ... it 's just what I wanted to hear ! <p> LUDACRIS <p> 30-09-10 , 09:36 PM <p> Thanks dude , but I 'm well past that stage now ! I 've got some nice fat buds and figure I 've got less than 3 weeks till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know though , is whether I count the 60-65 days flowering time from the stage shown in your pics or from when the plant started getting proper flowers .

They were flipped to 12/12 45 days ago and had been showing pistils for about 2 weeks prior to that .

If the tops are ready then just harvest the tops and go for a double or triple harvest . <p> Catpoison <p> 30-09-10 , 10:09 PM <p> There 's quite a lot of variance between the individual buds , with some of them looking a lot younger than others so I may do as suggested and do a 2 stage harvest , let the others catch up .

Once the plant has reached maturity , it is forming its most potent marijuana , and should not be cut down completely . You can often induce the females to flower a second ( and sometimes a third ) time , especially if the plants are indoors or if the weather is expected to stay mild for several more weeks . <p> To encourage a second bloom , first take the bulk of the harvest : all but the smallest buds , and most of the leaf . Some green leaves should be left on the plant to maintain the plant 's growth . After harvesting , give the plants a thorough watering , and water with a soluble , complete fertiliser that provides a good supply of both N and P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indoors . <p> The best procedure is to treat the plants like a hedge . Cut all the plants back to equal heights , about two to three feet tall . Remove most of the grass , but again leave a few green leaves on the plant . Do n't remove lower branches even if they are leafless , since these will sprout again . Lower the light system to the tops of the plants , and maintain the daily cycle at about 12 hours . The second crop of buds will be ready for harvest in four to eight weeks . With this system , the plants appear like dense hedges of buds . If the second crop of buds forms quickly , you should try for a third crop . Continue to fertilise the plants regularly , and watch for signs of magnesium deficiencies , which often show up when the plants have been growing for an extended time . <p> Double and triple harvests are one of the benefits of indoor growing . Although plants are relatively small indoors , the original harvest of buds can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokie : <p> Ariadne <p> 30-09-10 , 10:14 PM <p> Not sure if anyone 's answered your first question but the answer is that you count the days from when you switched to 12/12 . Those early pistils were on preflowers , which are a sign of sexual maturity , but they do n't develop into full buds . <p> up2nogood <p> 30-09-10 , 10:35 PM <p> you count the days when you first see the first pistils Ariadne not when you start 12/12 as the plant is still in veg even though its being flipped to 12/12 ... if the question was about that .. : ) <p> LUDACRIS <p> 30-09-10 , 10:51 PM <p> you count the days when you first see the first pistils Ariadne not when you start 12/12 as the plant is still in veg even though its being flipped to 12/12 ... if the question was about that .. : ) <p> Yes **25;1107;TOOLONG I never count the days as the plant is ready when its ready . <p> Catpoison <p> 30-09-10 , 10:55 PM <p> Cool .

I reckon I 'm probably closer to 40 days than 45 then . <p> Another ( maybe dumb ) question ... : ) Seeing as how I 'll be flushing the plant anyway , is there any harm or benefit to giving them a higher than normal EC for the last week or so ? Say 1.8 instead of 1.5 which is what they 've been on for the last few weeks . <p> No benefit 's . Just flush with the same water . I never flush my plants as i just stop the nutes near harvest time then switch tp simply watering them well for a week then when they dry after a week i chop em down .

According to the University of Illinois Extension , mites feed off of leaf mold , decaying plant material and peat moss . Therefore , removing any debris in the soil will give the mites less to live on , which may lead to their elimination . Re-pot your plant into sterile soil . Moreover , make sure your pot is clean and void of any soil or debris . Soak the plant 's roots to remove the old soil before placing it inside the new soils and pot . While it is important to remove as much of the old dirt as possible , you must re-pot the plant quickly before its roots dry out or the plant could die . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any dilution instructions and follow the directions on the label . <p> There is a totally organic product you can use called Gnats , not sure who carries the product though . <p> alwaystoned1 <p> 02-03-11 , 07:40 AM <p> if your 7 weeks into flower i would n't try changing your soil that will stress the fuck out your plants unless your soil is totally infested i would n't worry to much just finish of your grow <p> leeds grower <p> 02-03-11 , 11:36 AM <p> give gnat off a whirl , 1ml per ltr of water <p> J420 <p> 02-03-11 , 11:40 AM <p> Lemon concetrate juice is one thing you can use , just put a little in your water and also put down a few slices of lemon skin around in the soil , have worked good for me before and something I do on all plants/flowers . <p> What kind of soil are you using ?

@@46022055 @6022055/ <p> First grow and all , so just looking for some clarification on a few things guys . I am growing in soil , both sativa 's and Indica 's . I am currently into 4 weeks flowering and the pistils on both the sativa 's and indica 's are starting to brown . I am feeding using Bio-bizz bloom and grow with top max and bio-heaven . I have read that when the pistils start to brown I should lower the bloom and increase the grow . I am feeding just now at 1ml/l grow and 4ml/l bloom . My concern is that with the sativa 's only 4 weeks into flowering is this not too soon to lower the bloom nutes ? . <p> Cheers <p> yavana <p> 05-09-09 , 06:06 PM <p> I 've read the whole lower the bloom ferts thing before , but most people I know do the opposite , some going so far as getting ferts that have no nitrogen in them for the last few weeks . <p> From my experience , you 'll get better , less leafy bud if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . That said , the leaves are your energy factories so you want to be feeding enough N to keep them running . It 's sort of a balance and I 've found sativas to be more sensitive than indicas when it comes to overfeeding N. <p> I was losing a considerable number of fan leaves lower down which is spreading up the plant . I fed the plants some epsom salts thinking it was a mg. def at week 3 of flowering . I fed 2 doses of a tablespoon per 5 ltrs of water . The yellowing continues to affect the larger fan leaves which seems now to be onto some smaller leaves . I have ruled out over watering which brings me to the conclusion it is a N def . Now if i increased the dose of BB grow to 2ml/l or even 3ml/l would this be ok ? , what I mean is would this effect flowering if I have too much N ? <p> yavana <p> 06-09-09 , 11:38 AM <p> trance , <p> Even BB Bloom has N it in , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're in appropriately size buckets , it 's really hard to see an N-deficiency being the problem with your feed schedule . I would check run off pH and make sure that the pH is in the appropriate range before I added more N. It should be like 6-6.6 , straying too far can lockout the nitrogen . <p> Question : how are your stems , especially on the newer growth ? Are they really soft ? And - do your sativas seem to be worse off than your indicas or is it about equal both ways ? <p> trance <p> 06-09-09 , 11:59 AM <p> Its BB all mix soil yavana . I flushed a few weeks back and the run off was 6.8 . It could be that I was a wee bit late in feeding the epsom salts and I lost a considerable amount of fan leaves . Once I flushed I slowly increased the feed rate so its possible the N def happened just after the flush . I am not sure on the casue , but the white widow seems to be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top have started to go lime green . I fed 2 doses of 1 tablespoon per 5 ltrs Epsom , same as kali Mist so do n't obviously want to feed any more ? . So that 's why I was leaning towards a N def . The BB grow is quite low in N anyway , and I have only just increased dose of bloom to 4ml/l . Being a first grow I find its hard to tell if its a new problem or still damage from the orig def ! : confused : <p> New growth further down the plant turns yellow very quickly , just pull them off when the die . It 's an interesting point about pot size ...... the pots are 6.5 ltrs - plants are about 3.5-4 ft tall , it takes about 1.5 ltrs of water to water them ? I suppose if the plant pots are a tad on the small side you would need to use higher strength nutes ? . <p> yavana <p> 06-09-09 , 12:04 PM <p> You 're done with the Epsom I think . For flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BB Bloom almost has enough . I do n't really subscribe to the increasing nitrogen in late flower school ... <p> That said , I 'm curious - what size pots are you using and about how often does your soil dry out ? I 'm also curious - what is your ambient temp and humidity ? <p> trance <p> 06-09-09 , 12:14 PM <p> 6.5 ltr pots , water every 4 days for the sativa 's - sometimes they get to the point of a little droop , so def not overwatering . Temps range from 20 c to around 28 c , humidity is around 30-40% . The conditions are all good , I def do n't think they are a cause . Would I still lose fan leaves this early in flower with the sativa 's yavana ? . Thanks for answering my questions bud , much appreciated ! : weed : <p> trance <p> 06-09-09 , 12:20 PM <p> The yellowing starts in the middle of the leaves and works towards the edges ? <p> Bush Dr <p> 06-09-09 , 12:30 PM <p> You 're over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plain water flush until the leaves start looking right then Bloom , 2 days later start the Top Max again <p> Do NOT give them any Grow from now on <p> Week 4 ..... you could save these and still get a decent smoke <p> Yes excess N ruins good bud and will make it taste like shit <p> yavana <p> 06-09-09 , 12:32 PM <p> Hey man , I think we 've got it narrowed down . <p> Depending on how long you vegged , 6.5L pots are pretty small to flower in . It can be done and can even be done in smaller pots , but requires a lot of skill ( and totally not worth the effort ) . I think your girls are rootbound and stressing from that . Typically I pot from 4in pots ( the little ones ) to about 4L to 11L with a veg period of about 1 month . When I veg too long in the 11L pot ( say , over two weeks ) , I have the same problem late in flower . You 'll get bud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feed ... say no more than 4ml/L of combined grow/bloom . I do n't think increasing the N is really going to help out all that much , because I think the problem is just the plants being root-bound . Your plants should mature a bit earlier than what the seed company says , so watch the pistils not the weeks . <p> yavana <p> 06-09-09 , 12:43 PM <p> Hey trance , <p> I missed your earlier edit - in my opinion , your 4ft plants are definitely too big for 6.5L pots . But - I just wanted to make clear - do not repot into bigger pots . You might end up with a bunch of hermies if you do that this late into flower . <p> trance <p> 06-09-09 , 03:34 PM <p> Thanks guys . Regarding over feeding , I thought it was very hard to burn the plants with organics , and judging by what others are feeding the doses do n't seem high ? . With the root bound issue , I am not knocking your theory yavana , sounds like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dry out quicker than every 4 days , which I currently watering at ? <p> acehigh <p> 07-09-09 , 01:43 PM <p> i used 13litre buckets drilled holes in bottom ...... perfect . <p> yavana <p> 07-09-09 , 03:45 PM <p> Thanks guys . Regarding over feeding , I thought it was very hard to burn the plants with organics , and judging by what others are feeding the doses do n't seem high ? . With the root bound issue , I am not knocking your theory yavana , sounds like that could be the issue TBH , but would the pots not dry out quicker than every 4 days , which I currently watering at ? <p> They would unless there 's some sort of an imbalance in the soil . If your soil has a high salt concentration , the plant will actually release water from the roots to the soil and will resist taking on more water because of the ionic grade , so you end up watering not too much . It 's even worse with leaf loss because you have a lot less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance <p> 07-09-09 , 10:08 PM <p> I flushed all the plants today and fed them a little epsom . I noticed what looked like potassium burning on one of the plant leaves this morning . I think from now on I will feed every 2 nd watering , seems like overfeeding was part of the issue . I suppose just need to be cautious even with organic stuff eh ! !

This is ONLY for soil growing , there are a lot of ways to clone for hydroponics but this is not one . This simple and reliable cloning method is for all you newbie or just unlucky cloners , and it does not require any close supervision . If you are having cloning problems , please try it like this : <p> The " key " to my problem was my great difficulty to get roots before damp off problems , etc . Oasis recommends that the cubes be sat in shallow nute solution and left there . I found that was far too wet for oxygen hungry MJ . To " buffer " the cube , we shall use regular soil mix that is kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow much more oxygen to the rooting area . <p> Let 's get started:Start with standard 3 " seedling pots ( I prefer the very thin and flexible breeders pots found in large flats ) , some Oasis cubes , and a sharp box cutter or knife . <p> Good drainage:Using the knife , cut all four corners out of the pots , the provided drain holes are NOT enough . MJ does not like " wet feet " . <p> Plant the Oasis cube:Now dig a hole in the pre-moistened soil mix deep enough to bury an Oasis cube nearly all the way in . You should finish with something like this ... <p> Prepare the cloning solution:Now we should prepare our cloning solution . I use Olivia 's Cloning solution and gel , per instructions ; it works quite well . Start by mixing 3 tablespoons of the cloning solution ( large bottle ) with 1 quart of pH adjusted water ( anywhere between pH 6 and pH 7 is good ) . Add one teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide ( 3% solution ) to the mix to " supercharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate container in the refrigerator to chill . <p> Prepare the cuts:Now to the mum chamber to select a cut . Show is an Aussie Bush female mum . I should have trimmed the prospective cut YESTERDAY and given it a day to " heal and recuperate " before final removal . I 'll cheat for the sake of continuity . Let 's try the left secondary . <p> Like I said , this part should have been done 24 hrs ago .. Also , for you " mummers " out there , you can see that I have ruined the left secondary as a future clone site . By removing the first ( lowest ) node as well as the clone ( it 's for science ! ) , I have effectively killed the left secondary . Leave that first node alone ! <p> Take the cutting(s):Now take the cut at a 45 degree angle , and pop it directly into the slightly chilled solution . Let it soak and uptake solution for 10 to 20 minutes . Please note the exacto-knife and the alcohol wipe , remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterilize the cutting blade after EACH cut . Also , a new blade is recommended for every cloning session . <p> Re-cut the clone and place it in a small amount of the cloning gel . Let it soak and uptake gel for 10 minutes or so . *PLEASE NOTE* DO NOT dip the cut into the whole bottle . Any viruses or other nasties you may have on the cut WILL contaminate the entire bottle and thus ruin all future cuts you try to make from that bottle . <p> Finally , roll the cut around in the gel to thoroughly coat the outside of the stem for an inch or so ; try to " pick-up " as much of the gel as you can with the stem as you transfer the cut to the Oasis cube you have prepared . <p> Inserting the cuts:After " stabbing " the cut slightly down ( about 1/2 " ) into the bottom of the hole in the cube , slightly pinch the side of the cube to " close " the hole around the stem . Gently , gently please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution until it runs out the bottom . <p> She is now ready to go into the cloning domes . As you can see , I use two clear plastic tubs to form one dome assembly . They are not airtight , but we do n't want that anyway . <p> The mum &amp; cloning chamber enjoys year round temperatures between 74 and 76 degrees , just about exactly perfect . Above 80 , fungus and rot become bigger problems . Below 70 , and the clone just " stalls " and takes FOREVER if it makes it at all . Be SURE to remove the domes at least once ( twice is better ) every day for a few minutes to allow " new " air in . Mist slightly every time and water only with cloning solution when the dirt is starting to dry a bit or the clone starts to wilt . <p> Lighting:Clones have a limited energy " budget " , only what they " contain " the instant they are cut . Almost all of that energy is needed just to establish good rooting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other process not needed for rooting . For this reason , lighting should be kept quite soft and diffuse until the clones fully root . When using fluoros , keep the tubes about 6 " to a foot above the top of the domes . With HID lighting , stay well back , 3 to 5 feet or more ( depending on wattage of the light ) and shade the dome from the intense HID lighting . I like to use a white paper towel on top of the domes to further diffuse and soften the light . Clones need VERY little light until they root . Just insure they are getting at least 18 hours of light each day and 24/7 is ok too . <p> Hardening off : ( getting them used to being without the dome ) After about a week , start leaving the dome off for a few minutes longer each day . Monitor the clones carefully and replace the dome after misting if they start to wilt . DO NOT forget that you have the dome off . A young batch WILL wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After several " hardening " sessions , the domes may be left off all together ( as long as there is NO wilting ) . There she is on the lower right ... <p> Special Technique : Trimming fan leaves.In this example , the clones shown are Crystal Light x AK47 ( unsexed ) . The fans were trimmed prior to setting them in the cubes because they were already quite large and lush when the cuts were taken , experience will tell you when you have " too much " leaf surface and the clone will just wilt and resist efforts to revive it . So , trim the big stuff before " stabbing it " . If it remains " wilty " remove the largest trimmed fans completely , this usually does it for stubborn ones . You can even then trim the smaller fans if you REALLY are trying to save a " special " clone . <p> Tip 1 : When are they starting to root ? Please compare this picture with the picture , 2nd above . Please note that now all of the clones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have leaves that are strong and turning upward , as compared to the previous photo when they were all " wilty " . This is a sure sign that the clones have started rooting , you will also see new growth starting form the grow tips . The 5 older clones in the photo are now ready to be " hardened off " gradually , and finally removed from the cloning chamber and placed in full vegetative mode . Also , please note the grid wire at the bottom of the tub . It works great to keep the planters out of the water . <p> Tip 2 : Humidity control under the domeThis is a good idea for you folks that are too busy to keep an eye on things a least twice a day . Just put an air stone in some water in a container inside the dome as shown . The humidity will be kept at a nice level and you will not need to mist the clones at all . Please notice the wire mesh is still used to keep the planters out of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is set on a couple of bricks inside the tub . <p> Here we see the " humidifier tub " in action . After just a few minutes , the humidity is 75% and the temp is 78 degress f . I will try to reduce that " inside " temp to a steady 75 or 76 degrees . Please note that the white lid for the tub is serving as a perfect light blocker/diffuser . <p> Final Tip and Credit : Oldtimer1 's ezine articles on cloning and bonsai mums ! Taking cuttings from old mums is " the way " to duplicate great results . Once you find the magic mum , you just grow out her cuttings for more of the same great smoke . It is far beyond the scope of this article to go into mums , but let me expound the excellence of OldTimer1 's article on cloning and making mums .

In that 20 years I developed an easy to follow method that anyone that can make Mac and cheese can follow . I also know from experience that people using reference books hate to read so this book will be laid out in sections with a redundant amount of pictures to help the reader get the full measure of what is taking place in each tutorial . We will start with basic grow room design and soil making and move through each phase of producing your own 100% Organic medical grade cannabis . <p> This is not really a how to book on all the ways there are to grow weed but a very simple straightforward way to produce the maximum amount of medicine your state laws may allow . While Cannabis is still illegal in many places the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply information is needed . I am known for a no nonsense way of explaining things without most of the mysticism or science speak in most guides although I will elaborate on the chemistry behind some aspects . Cannabis is very easy to grow indoors if conditions are right so room set up is a huge part of doing things properly and not creating conditions where pest , Mildew or poor control of environment can cause set backs or worse death of a plant . <p> I have noticed that people are mostly visual and when I teach online many times questions will be asked that are answered in the text . Because of this fact this book is different in one way . It will contain an enormous amount of pictures that will explain exactly how it is done . Appendix Soil Room Construction Seed Starting Cloning Topping Transplanting Top Dressing Atmosphere Lighting Air Bondage Super Cropping Garden Management A Dank MysteryDoes Clone maturity increase quality ? Organic FadeThe key to Flavor Feeding and Sucanat Amber Alert a guide to Harvesting times The Final Stage Harvesting Males and Pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannabis Tincture <h> Soil <p> To me there is nothing like the flavor of properly grown organic cannabis . The subtle flavors and aromas created when using mother earth is over whelming to the senses when done properly . As with many vegetables a rich Organic soil can bring out the best in a plant . Over the past 20 years I have tried almost every possible way to cultivate our favorite plant and while hydro is certainly faster and the yields blow soil away , I have developed a soil that performs extremely well and there 's very little guess work . I do n't  worry about ph or ppm I simply have spent a few years developing a sound recipe and in combination with 7 gallon nursery pots I can run from start to finish using only water . Other than a bit of sweat equity every 90 days or so it takes a huge amount of science out of the garden and puts nature back in charge . This recipe is slightly different from my last and from the one so many use as gospel that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with at least 6-8 large bags of high quality organic soil . The selection of your base soil is very important so do n't  cut corners here . I can not begin to discuss all the different products but I will discuss a few in this article . A good Organic soil should cost between 8-10$ per 30# bag . <p> " Lignite , also known as leonardite , mined lignin , brown coal , and slack , is an important constituent to the oil well , drilling industry . Lignite , or leonardite as it will be referred as hereafter , is technically known as a low rank coal between peat and sub-bituminous . Leonardite was named for Dr. A.G. Leonard , North Dakota 's first state geologist , who was a pioneer in the study of lignite deposits . Leonardite is applied to products having a high content of humic acid . Humic acid has been found to be very useful as a drilling mud thinner . " <p> If you have access to a good local mix like these then I highly recommend starting with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial brands as well but not as is . The best results we have seen from well known soil that is available nationwide is Fox Farms " Ocean Forrest " soil combined in a 2-1 ratio with Light Warrior . On its own the Ocean Forrest is known for burning plants and having the wrong ratios of nutrients but when cut down with Light Warrior it makes a pretty good mix for a base soil . <p> You can also just use 2 bales of Sunshine mix #4 but this is my last choice and plants growing in this may not complete properly with this " Just add water " method of soil growing . The concept to this concentrated soil is to not have to worry with mixing up nutrients after the soil is made . The concentrate is placed in the bottom + to + of the container and blended with base soil . This allows the plants to grow into the strong concentrated soil and in the right size container need nothing else but water throughout the full harvest cycle . With strains requiring high levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Super Soil but this is only with a small percentage of strains . <p> Here are the amounts we have found that produce the best tasting buds and strongest medicines . <p> This is the same basic recipe I have used for 15 years the hardest ingredient to acquire is the worm castings most people do n't even know what it is . Be resourceful and find it worms make up + of the living organisms underground btw and hold our planet together . Be careful not to waste money on Soil Conditioner with worm casting but local Pure Worm poop with no added mulch . There are several methods of mixing this up well . You can sweep off a patio or garage and work there on a tarp . You can use a kids plastic wading pool these cost about 10$ and work really well for a few seasons . Some growers have been known to rent a cement mixer and cut down on the physical labor . As long as you get the ingredients mixed up properly that is all that matters . This can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your not used to strenuous activity . This method is good for mind and body . Working with soil keeps me in pretty good shape , but if you have limitations you can simply have someone mix it up for you while you supervise . One of the things I like about this method is I can drop of plants to a patient and all they have to do is water the plants when the soil dries out . <p> Place a few bags of base soil in first making a mound . I then place the powdered nutrients in a circle around the mound and then cover with another bag of base soil . Then goes in the bat poop and then more base soil . I continue to layer soil and additives until everything has been added to the pile . So now I put on the muck boots , these help me kick the soil around and get it mixed up well using my larger leg muscles and not my back and arms . Then its as simple as my Skipper used to say " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I obsess on , even breaking up all the clods of soil by hand . I mix for about 15 minutes , turning the pile over and over until it is mixed well . I store the mix in large garbage cans . Before using the mix the entire load is poured out once more and mixed well . Once placed in the containers I water it slightly adding 3 gallons of water to a large garbage can full . It will make the stirring harder next week but it will activate the Mycorrhizae and I think help all the powders dissolve . <p> So now we add water and let it cook in the sunshine . 30 days is best for this concentrate . Do not put seeds or clones directly in this mix . It is an advanced mix used in conjunction with base soil . It is used to place in the bottom of each finishing container and fully rooted established clones are placed in a bed of base soil that is layered on top of the concentrate . As the plants grow they slowly push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for a full cycle . The Super Soil can be used also to top dress plants that take longer to mature . I will use this mix for a full year just adding like 30-50% in the lower potion of the container and plain base soil in the top portion . Base Soil means your regular potting soil Like Roots , Harvest Moon , or even sunshine mix without the additives ! Buds from this method finish with a fade and a smoother fruity flavor . The plants are not green when done but Purple , Red , Orange and even Black at times . The resin content is heavier and the terpins always seem to be more pungent . <p> This method is used my medical growers all over with amazing results . The feed back I receive is really positive with reports of Hydro like growth and novice growers producing buds of the same quality as life long growers . <h> Room Construction <p> Room Construction <p> In this chapter we will discuss the construction of a proper grow area . There are several key areas I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only methods that can be used . With the invention of grow huts and even larger enclosed personal grow areas its become easy to set up a space . I like to do things on a bigger scale because I am teaching the craft of indoor growing on a care giver scale . We still only bud 12 plants at one time but we do grow year round and in order to do this you must have complete control of your grow room environment . Here are some Key points to address : Insulation is critical in controlling temperature swings and energy consumption , it also provides sound proofing . Security is also important as not everyone views our special plant as medicine but cash for the taking Durability is a must if your going to run crop after crop you ca n't use flimsy materials . Stealth is important in a legal garden to prevent judgmental neighbors causing problems . My very first grow room was a walk in closet with a 430 Sun Agro lamp and a cheap bathroom exhaust fan . I had heat issues and smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn a few things that would make my next one better . My second area was a 4x12 Corridor with 3 400 watt lights and a larger exhaust system with added air-conditioning . It worked well but my power bills were outrageous in the un-insulated apartment I set up in . I have grown in 3 states and 3 countries so I have tackled many different conditions , all of this drove me to the level of scale you see in the rooms featured . With each design I learned more and more and you will see all of this applied to the rooms featured here . <p> Before we look at a area actually built for growing let 's look at a few rental homes that were converted to grow in with minimal changes to the structure . <p> This is a bed room and walk in closet from almost 10 years ago . If you ca n't screw or nail into the walls a free standing enclosure works great I also love upstairs bonus rooms for converting . <p> This is a simple 20x24 garage that we walled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . We can open the doors and if you look inside its very hard to tell its not just all storage and office . 12 Feet of the width of the garage gave us plenty of room to construct three separate rooms and an additional area starting seedlings . Not all rooms are used at once but its very handy to be able to use a room temporarily when the plants are larger just before harvesting . <p> This is what we have so far . I have had new rooms professionally framed for longevity and security . The sizes are surprisingly small for what I am investing but I do n't want a bigger area just a safe one . <h> Seed Starting <p> You would be surprised how many veteran growers have problems with getting seeds started . The most common mistake is to use a heat mat and cook the seeds . Cannabis is a weed and as long as the seeds are viable its hard to prevent them from germinating . I have had pot seeds germinate under the floor mat of a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem not viable germinated under my BBQ grill in gravel in the cold winter . I see people soaking or treating the seeds in god knows what products and I just shake my head . LONG ... <p> All a seed needs to germinate is moisture and a temperature range between 50-90 and your good to go . There are other factors involved though and if you will germinate your seeds between 70-80 degrees you will have a better ratio of females . Warmer temperatures tend to produce more male plants . Many growers still use the tried and true method of soaking seeds in a paper towel . With the invention of " Rapid Rooters " , a product made up from composted organic materials bonded together with plant-derived polymers . These plugs are manufactured using a scientifically controlled process that yields large populations of beneficial microbes in the media . We started using them to clone in about 3 years ago and when I tried starting seeds in them I knew I would never do it any other way . <p> I flip the cone shaped rooting plugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to fit into sectional treys but that just added cost and you will see I try and keep things simple and low frills . Wash hands well with a disinfecting soap , this will remove any oils or contaminants . Make a small hole with a poker and place the seed point side up into the plug about + " into the rooter. 10985 @qwx420985

@@46022067 @6022067/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Day 1 of 12/12 is NOT day 1 of Flower <p> I decided to write this article because the error is something that I had made on more than one occasion until a Hydro Shop owner put me straight and because I now understand ( Flowering Times ) I wo n't be making the same errors again . <p> READ ON <p> So you order your seeds and have it all set in your mind . Your getting a 8 weeks strain which means as soon as your done with the vegging and put the plants to 12 and 12 you are on day one of flowering right ? ? ? Well actually No that is wrong . <p> If you take a look for example on the canna coco feeding chart you will see that in the first section of the BLOOM it tells you to begin using Canna boost alongside your Coco A&amp;B and this is where a LOT of people including myself have made the error . Look closely at the Canna feeding chart and it says in small print ( growth stagnate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take 2 weeks in some cases which would mean that even if your plant has been in 12/12 for 7-10 or even 14 days you should start counting day 1 of flower from the first sign of these ( fruit formation pistols ) <p> So why does it matter if you take day 1 of flower from the first day of 12/12 ? <p> Well if you do this then you have a few main issues <p> 1 . You will think your crop is due to be cut 7-10 or 14 days before it actually is which will affect many things ... mainly the smoke quality <p> 2 . You will add boost too early which will mean you add the PK too early which will mean you flush too early <p> So think about it this way , when you next pick your seed from a seedbank based on " Flowering Time " do n't contact the seed company complaining that their product is not doing what is should be or that the strain or seedbank is selling under par seeds . Instead look out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first day as day 1 and I am guessing 80% of people who say their crop is late to bloom will actually realize that it is not the strain is slow but it is something this simple which has been overlooked . <p> I hope this helps a LOT of people here I really hope that I contributed my first bit of knowledge to a forum that has helped me no end . <p> yes that is true but you want to be adding boosters etc at the right time not 2 weeks before it should be <p> I would n't use breeders flowering times to determine when to add boosters etc . For example i recently grew some NYCD , I had a pheno which took 8 weeks from flip to 12/12 another which took 10 weeks and one that went 14 ! Just using the breeders flowering time to determine when to use boosters just would n't have worked . <p> There are a few threads along simila rlines if you search through the forum , I know I have commented on a few anyway . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when to start counting . Clones v seedlings is one , with clones being much older than the seedling ( they are the same age as the original donor plant , which could be over a year old ) . This means they may go into flower WITH pistils . This being the case , how does that compute relative to what the grow shop people said ? It does n't  because they talk of pistils as the first sign of flowering . <p> The only date you can be 100% vertain of is the date you flipped . Eg , let 's say you have a seedling and you start flowering it . After 4 days , I come round and take a look at it . You can see pistils but because my eyes are not as good as they once were , I may not be able to see them unaided . So if this plant was mine , would it be flowering because I cant see the pistils ? Do you get what I mean ? The point being , if looking for these signs , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then you have to consider , does it matter ? I do n't  think so . We all know our plants are mainly 8-10 week flowering . SO if you have 2 rooms , a veg &amp; flower , you need to know roughly when you need to have a plant ready to go into flower . Other than that , it does n't  matter . <p> So how do I work ? When adding boosters , it is this kind of thing to look for , not a calendar date . I use Big Bud , Liquid Silicon , Overdrive and currently Buddah 's Tree 9/18 . When I see the first proper flowers forming , I start using Big Bud , PK9/19 and silicon and change to flowering nutes . When I see my first amber crystal , I stop the Silicon , Big Bud and PK and replace it with Overdrive . After 2 weeks of Overdrive , I stop all additives and part A nutes , just giving part B ( mainly micro nutes ) ( an experiment Ive been working on ) <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant rather than dates to decide when to make the changes needed . <p> We all have our little routines that work for us . This is mine and I am happy with it . Other guys do things differently and if it works for them , who am I to disagree ? Good luck and long may it continue . <p> Ultimately , happy plants is what we are all after and if that take a week longer in my groom than in someone elses , it does n't  bother me and vice versa .

W 10986 @qwx420986 <p> Thanks for that I 'm switching to 12/12 tonight so this is good to know , just a quick question for anyone with the knowledge , I 'm currently using canna coco a&amp;b do I use the a&amp;b all the way through or do I fade it out when I introduce the boost ? <p> in my experience then if i flower from clone then i , ll meet what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed then i , m usually 2 weeks over unless they get at least 6 weeks veg and are mature going in to flower then probably about a week less than flowering a 3 week veg plant from seed <p> Thanks for that I 'm switching to 12/12 tonight so this is good to know , just a quick question for anyone with the knowledge , I 'm currently using canna coco a&amp;b do I use the a&amp;b all the way through or do I fade it out when I introduce the boost ? <p> Yea this thread pops up a few times every year because its a common nuube error . <p> The vital thing is to make sure you and the person you are discussing things with are singing from the same hymn sheet and all should be well <p> Eg " When did you put the plants into flower " well that would mean when did you switch to 12/12 so mistakes are often made . Personally I like the 12/12 as the date is fixed and not open to interpretation so its easier to work from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You should also be checking the trichs for when to crop not following a feeding schedule ... So many strains can take between 6 weeks at 12/12 in hydro ( Bubblegum for example ) to maybe 18 weeks so there 's little point closely following a feeding guide . It is exactly that " A Guide " <p> Most people tripping up over this have perhaps not studied the subject as much as they should have prior to starting but that 's understandable and we see it virtually every day on here with one thing or another . <p> Day 1 is Day 1 of 12/12 unless your plant is immature , the reason you carry on with grow nutes is because cannabis plants stretch in flower which requires Nitrogen . This stretch is triggered by the 12/12 light cycle and is a key part of the flowering cycle . <p> All my plants have been flipped mature and cropped using the breeders minimum grow date +1 week max , last crop of AK-48 I took at exactly 48 days of 12/12 . I have had one or two plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Last edited by mc6pack ; 16-02-13 at 09:44 PM . <p> " People say ' well you can abuse marijuana ' well shit you can abuse cheeseburgers too !

" ( Vince Lombardi ) <p> Here are my insights on that . If you have an 8 week strain , peak nutrient and water absorption are happening around week #4 and week #5 , so I would never starve my plant at week #5 . Now , on and after week #6 ( on an 8 or 9 week schedule ) plants start consuming less and less nutrients all the way up until the end . During this time you do n't need to feed as much or so frequently , unless you are using very aerated media . Now , it is important to understand that nutrients do n't feed the buds directly , they go towards the leaves were some are instantly translated into carbs which then go to the buds and other are stored away for later use in the leaves . If your leaves are yellowing up due to nutrient deficiencies in late flowering it means that the plant is draining out its reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means that the buds will not get all the energy they need -- which means that your yield will suffer . <p> I can agree with FEED LESS and LESS OFTEN , but not to STARVE your plants and then bring them back . It does not make sense on a biological or chemical level . Also , make sure that you are using quality nutrients from the beginning to ensure proper nutrition ; some of my all time favorites have been Complete Hydroponics , Canna Nutrients , AN , and from time to time House &amp; Garden . 10985 @qwx420985

Do n't overwater them ( maybe every 2-3 days depending on environment ) and start feeding at 1/4 strength with first watering . <p> That really depends on if he is using chemical or organics .

Install a 4 inch fan and filter . A small desk fan for air circulation and use passive intakes . <p> Since it 's going to be a 1 week job drying you do n't need a long term exhaust into a chimney , if the loft is big enough and has some air coming into it from outside or downstairs there 's enough in there for it not to go stale .

Its not a huge loft space , i suppose average for a 3 bedroom house , i can stand up in the centre , so that 's where the tent will be placed . there does n't seem to be any air coming in from the outside , but i guess i can keep the loft hatch open a little ( depending on smells ) . smell inside my own house is not quite such an issue , as opposed to smells permeating into neighbours loft area . <p> i understand leaving a couple ducts open on the tent to allow passive air ingress , but wo n't the small desk fan blow odours out these ducts before they have chance to go through the filter ? 10985 @qwx420985

Cold water dude <p> Then make sure your pots are draining well and the soil gets reasonably dried out before you water again . Water to run off each time now . You may want to lift your containers from the drip tray , I just used a couple of pencils under my pots . Makes the water drain easier and the bottoms of the soil dries out nicely . Plants do n't like for the roots to sit in soggy soil . The best cycle they can have is lots of water and feed , then drains out and a few hours later the air spaces have drained and the roots are happy . Roots need to have oxygen too .

@@46022092 @6022092/ 10988 @qwx420988 <p> World of Seeds Pakistan Ryder is a result of numerous experiments that had been carried out to create a new , strong and potential marijuana strain . The famous feminized seed of Pakistan Valley was back crossed with a Ruderalis and gave a start to Pakistan Ryder . This 100% indica hybrid instantly became a favourite in modern cannabis markets for her easy growing qualities and high narcotic abilities , some of which are incredible medical values . Pakistan Ryder marijuana strain enchants you with fruity/hardwood smell and fruity sweet taste as well as with very narcotic effect . Her dried products contain 21.2 % of THC . As a auto-flowering marijuana , Pakistan Ryder grows from a feminized cannabis seed flower in response to age rather than light cycle . She will grow vegetative for approximately 14 days then enter into a rapid , almost violent flowering period . For the next 55 days , she will branch out profusely , throw out pistils in their thousands , calyxes will swell and a coating of resin glands will make the mature plant glisten as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan Ryder automatic remains a great yielder , producing as much as 100-150 gr. per m2 when grown indoors . <p> The cross with a ruderalis also means that Pakistan Ryder feminized cannabis seeds can be grown virtually anywhere with the high tolerance to such risks as mould and pests . Balconies , patios , window boxes , indoors or outdoors , this connoisseur grade seed is now attainable for every marijuana grower . With a lifespan of a mere 55 days from seed to harvest , it is not only possible to get an early harvest of high quality marijuana but multiple harvests per season . Indoors , a perpetual harvest has never been easier to maintain . The increased height compared to earlier auto-flowering strains brings with it increased yield.Thinking of germing these and putting them straight into 11 litre pots and placing under a 400w hps but i 'm undecided on the soil to use , was thinking john innes number 2 but i wondered could this be too strong for seedlings to go straight in to ? <p> Would like to here from anyone that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , what are they like to grow n so on , this sounds like a really nice strain to grow with a good thc content i ca n't wait to get cracking.peace .

Atleast in the outdoor growing section <p> Soo I 'll start right into my problem for now . <p> Ive been growing before and just wanted to start a small plant on my balcony for some fungrow . I started at March which was much too soon as i soon knew , because the small amount of sunshine let my little fella grow buds just when she was about 30cm high . So if she likes its ok to do that , she 's been growing some buds now and i wanted to do some harvesting in the next weeks or days , who knows . <p> But here 's my problem ! i think she started to grow again now that there is enough ( or longer times ) sunshine . There are new leaves growing out of the buds which looks kind of weird , plus the leaves do n't  really look like her normal weedleaves .

The underside of the leaves do n't look affected . <p> I just checked out a hydro ph/nutrient table ( sorry I did n't note who 'd posted it ) and now I 'm thinking this may be a cal mag issue , since the ph keeps dropping to around 5.4 after it 's been adjusted to 5.9 , so calcium and magnesium are being locked out . <p> I use Canna Calmag to raise the local tap water from 40 to 200 TDS ( 500 ) before adding the Canna nutes etc . I also think that the ph is dropping due to the HPS being a bit close to the plants , causing them to overheat and take up more water than nutes , hence the ph drop as the res mixture loses water . I 've raised the light hood ( parabolic ) and will monitor the ph closely . 10985 @qwx420985

I 'm starting one soon , probally slightly smaller than yours , I was going to use one 125w cfl light but is what you have just as good ? <p> The only real expense was the extractor fan at 15 . You may get one cheaper if you shop around , I could n't be arsed , lol . The ceiling roses are less than 2 ea from B&amp;Q but I already had a few knocking about . The ducting was about 5 .

With soil i would make a batch of feed for them in the butt and then have a segmental timer with 5 min seg 's running a line to sprinklers on the pots to run for a short burst each day to stop em dying . or i would use a less powerful light like a 400 or summat to keep them from getting big and drinking lots resulting in death .

I guess it all would depend on the PH of your tap ? Sorry I 've just confused myself on this one I hope someone can chime in . <p> Can someone answer a basic question , Why does n't the ph of water matter when using organic nutrients ? I simply do n't get it . The biggest problems I have have had with soil is using organic nutrients when it goes acidic later in the flower cycle . Biobizz nutes being the classic example in my experience . So it 's ok to water with a feed in 5.0 in soil ? just because someone has n't had any problems , does n't mean to say others wo n't . Has someone actually tried using a oh of 3.2 or 9.8 or whatever using biobizz nutes in organic soil and had equal results to a textbook ph grow ? <p> The soil buffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . ive done a few organic grows useing plant magic oldtimers feeds . Tried a few different composts and never once adjusted Ph all grows where trouble free , apart from mites lol . <p> What people are doing is adjusting the water with a synthetic pH adjuster , either up or down , They contain salts , where as organic soils and netruents do n't  , The microbes adjust the soil , ( this is organics , any salts added to the soil will kill the bacteria in a sence , I 'm sure there can be some fluctuations in pH but that 's what the micro-herds or what ever its called do for the soil as such , buffer it . If you are conscious of pH with organics , use organic pH adjusters . <p> It depends if you 're keeping your grow 100% organic . If you 're using organic muck and nutes do n't  use chemical ph up and down in the water or any other chemical additive , the soil will buffer to the correct ph . If your grow is n't organic do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by adding chemicals , causes havoc with the micro herd but does n't kill it off completely so you get a poor plant . <p> An organic Ph up has been difficult to find for me , anyone have any suggestions ? Someone mentioned liq silicon , is it safe to use without harming the micro herd ? I 'm slowly piecing this together I think .. Tabbs was right when he mentioned about your location . I think hard water suits bio bizz without the need for Ph'ing as the acidic nutes will balance it out . The micro herd will buffer the Ph to a certain extent but going anywhere below 5.5 or above 7.5 you will probably run into a lockout . In my view the best option would be to flush through with water at 6.5 , molasses is a good option to lower the Ph while still replacing some of the lost food within the soil ( micro herd ) or you can use organic Ph down .

I feel the worst I have ever done in my whole life , except a shed load of my social anxiety has disappeared , I actually feel happy a lot of the time and this time I swear to you I am experiencing physical withdrawal rather than psychological which is the way cannabis is supposed to be , not physically addictive at all . <p> Again we all know that withdrawal causes night sweats , but I had that seizure and also my legs and back are extremely painful since stopping , and again I just had to report this as I would not wish this on anyone . <p> Please feel free to add any of your thoughts , opinions etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no cannabis , my breathing is better but the sweating is out of this world . <h> Physiological Effects of Long Term THC Exposure <p> Originally Posted by HazeyMan <p> ... having seizures from cannabis withdrawal ? ! <p> THC produces " epileptiform activity " in several regions of the brain . It has been show to be effective in reducing seizures related to epilepsy and post electroconvulsive shock therapies . If you are a heavy user your body and nerves have " habituated " , your nerves may react by " upregulating " some of the structures that are suppressed by the presence of THC . Sudden withdrawal can then produce a rebound effect in which your body becomes hypersensitive to the stimuli that THC was suppressing . <p> This is similar to the phenomenon in Alcohol use and withdrawal known as " Delirium Tremens " . Alcohol is GABA'ergic , which affects the parasympathetic nervous system . This is the part of your nervous system that help you to relax after arousal . Removing a stimuli ( alcohol ) that activates that relaxing system in your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal , it can cause " shaking , shivering , irregular heart rate , and sweating . Occasionally , a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death . " <p> While the CB1 and CB2 nerve receptors do not work the same as the receptor sites in Alcohol use , the same process of habituation with THC use can occur with long term use . You can expect things like Nausea , Sweating , Excessive Arousal ( anxiety states ) , and even flu-like symptom in your gut . In your case , you seem to have a significant reaction which included seizures . You might consider consulting with a doctor ( depending on confidentiality laws in your area ) . Your reaction would seem to indicate slowing usage over time ( if possible ) prior to discontinuation for long term usage to avoid these pronounced symptoms . <p> Often with Alcohol use , true addicts who are sober for quite some time that begin use again will fall directly back to the previous " depth " of dependence . Your body becomes permanently adjusted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if this is the case with THC exposure . <p> You can think of it like a path that you are walking down . The longer you " walk " into use , the longer it will take your body to " walk " out of habituation . <p> I hope to avoid long-term adjustment issues by taking breaks every so often . I suffer through skipping a few days every couple-3 weeks . Just not sure how to gauge that . I do n't seem to have a tolerance making me want more at any one time , so hoping I 'm at least on the right track . But I also suspect my perceived tolerance level might be just from using different strains . I keep around a dozen or so on-hand and cycle through them all in a similar 2-3 week period , basically never using the same strain more than 2 days in a row . <p> Anyone know anything about the effects of using either the same or different strains all the time WRT tolerance development ? <p> Is that moderately stoned 24/7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking almost everyday for 26 years .

@@46022133 @6022133/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Stripping Fan Leaves Off Autos <p> I think it is a great idea to remove the large fan leaves from autoflowering plants . Wanted to know what other growers feel about this idea . Today 's grow bulbs used have the ability to reach 18 " . On a plant that is almost 24 " , that 's about the entire plant as opposed to a typical , outdoor variety that gets between 6 ' to 12 ' tall . <p> I feel the fan leaves are for initial development of the stems whereas the secondary leaves are for the buds . The fan leaves also seem to block light from getting to the secondary leaves below them . Add to that today 's bulbs can shower almost the entire auto in light and it just seems to make sense to remove the fan leaves . What do you think ? Especially want to here from growers that have experience doing both and can attest to the efficacy of removing the fan leaves . <p> I would say we are just helping it along better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it is ? ? I just see removing the large leaves that started everything off as a way of getting more light to where it 's needed most . <p> I am hoping someone will chime in here that has experienced both precedures and can comment either way . <p> I have read an article by some grow guru who says after 6 weeks of flowering you should strip all large fan leafs off and this will increase your yield by up to 30% , he says after 6 weeks of flowering the plants do not need the big fan leafs as it starts to grow smaller fan leafs , I have not tried this myself yet but sounds intresting <h> The Following User Says Thank You to peartcart12 For This Useful Post : <p> I understand this is NOT a new discussion at all but previous discussions were about regular mj plants . I am curious about autoflowering mj plants as their small stature and the power of today 's indoor lighting brings in new factors not considered previously . <p> Right now my biggest plant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach 18 " of plant material . It makes sense to remove the larger fan leaves which block the lower half of the plant from the light . Instead of one large top cola and a bunch of much smaller buds , now I hope the lower budding sites will replicate the main top cola . <p> Like MC said , it 's a discussion that has been around for a long time but I am referring to the autoflowering plants coupled with the new lights . Lights are n't new but in the last 10 years they have become much more affordable to the layperson . Hopefully we will hear direct from an auto grower and find out either way . <p> I will be putting some autos under a pair of 600w gavita pro 's shortly for the start of the veg part but when into 6 weeks and decide to remove these fan leaves is it better the just pull off or cut with a blade ? <p> In my case I not only removed the fan leaves but the branches they used to reside on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the conclusion if it is beneficial to remove the fan leaves , which I compare to pruning a plant for better production . <p> So far , I feel pretty good about it .

Whole thing is getting bathed in light and most importantly is the lower bud sites are firming up ALMOST to the same size as the top , main cola . <p> MC you sound like the perfect person to try this out on . Sacrifice one of your autos on the alter of knowledge and strip away the large fan leaves after the plant is well into flowering and see what you think . You said you literally have 100 's of auto grows that never got stripped so it should be quite easy to compare a single auto grow with fan leaves removed . <p> I 'll of course take pics on harvest day of my auto but I 'm tellin ya right now all the lower shoots are on par with the top , main cola but you guys will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like the perfect person to try this out on .

Leaves grow for a reason ... you cut them off your plant does suffer , it grows slower , maybe more sprawny rather than more tighter nodes . <p> Would you chop your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as ' its got more space ' na would you fuck lol . <p> Grow 4 and do it too two but not the other two , I am right.the two you trim will be less sexy to look at and yield smaller ... I did it with my first crop , the two I did n't touch were better , hence why I do n't pick leaves now with my second grow . They stay on till the plant makes them come off . <p> Leaves are used to take in light and help photosynthesis ... Why spoil a method the plant does to live : / <p> Well ....... two reasons . The autos I am talking about only get about 2.5 ' high . Second reason is the high intensity lights used today cover 18 " of the plant which is almost the whole thing . An actually a third reason is from what I see in front of me . The bottom bud shoots of my plant are now the same as the top main cola . I 'll take pics during the harvest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> LIKE I SAID BEFORE ..... if we were talking about a 12 ' outdoor that is pumping out a LB of smoke I probably would n't care but we are talking 2 ' -3 ' that we are trying to get every gram out of ............. and it 's just fun to do things to our plants that make them more productive . I 'm only talking about the fan leaves which really is n't that many , I would never cut down the trim Christ , the trim is what the buds use to grow . The fan leaves in my lay opinion is what the already established stem used to be all it could be . Fan leaves are for the stem and the trim is for the buds . <p> I feel you on this one . If your not willing to experiment , then how would you find out if something new works . We hear a lot from people who say it 's not good to touch autos , but have you I have n't heard from anyone who actually experimented and tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the buds that are n't getting any/good enough light coverage to see why you should at least remove the leaves that are blocking bud sites . Unless anyone actually wants immature fluffy popcorn buds ? I was aggressive with it on my last photo grow &amp; they were ready on time &amp; the yield did not disappoint come harvest day . <p> I have also been removing quite a lot of leaves daily on my autos for the past week ( since they were about a month old ) &amp; there 's no way that it 's bothering them ! They 've continued growing rapidly ( gaining over an inch in 24 hours ) &amp; they regrow more leaves by the next day ! I use a pair of Ikebanas &amp; leave half the stem still attached , which leaves a nice surgical cut . Maybe a sick plant or a plant with unstable genetics might not like it , but I 'd go as far as saying that mine NEED it . Even at it 's most aggresive - there are still loads &amp; loads of leaves left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the only reason I do it either . There 's also the humidity/airflow issues when things get too crowded . <p> In my case I not only removed the fan leaves but the branches they used to reside on . Just seemed to make sense . We have n't really come to the conclusion if it is beneficial to remove the fan leaves , which I compare to pruning a plant for better production . <p> So far , I feel pretty good about it . My entire plant is lit up like a Christmas tree . Whole thing is getting bathed in light and most importantly is the lower bud sites are firming up ALMOST to the same size as the top , main cola . <p> The bigger fan leaves produce a far greater surface area of chlorophyll . Why would you remove them ? In my limited understanding of autos it 's generally not a good idea to top them/delay to get a bigger canopy . I understood with autos you want to get them as big as possible in the very limited veg time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter productive through my cloudy eyes <p> I have two autoCriticals in my greenhouse , one pruned and one left to her own devices . I just took a photo so you can see how subtle the difference are on the two .

Darco <p> Glad to hear it worked although I know some people said that it kept reading neutral i.e.6.5 even when the soil was acidic I would still test it with some juice from a lemon or some vinegar . Not sure what happens if the soil is to alkaline or it 's effects on the plant I 'm a newbie myself and have n't read up on that bit yet . I will in a bit though lol . Ok just had a very quick glance through the books I 've got and they say having the right ph balanced soil ensures that the plant takes on nutrients correctly if the soil is to alkaline or acidic it may lock out certain nutrients from your feeds that you give it . Basically if the soil/water is n't right you might get a nutrient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 0 ) But that was a quick 2 min read so I would take advice from more experienced growers I 'm still at the very beginning of this learning curve . Hope it helps mate . Hopalong <p> Hey Hopalong , I managed to get the B&amp;Q meter to read about around 6 / 6.5 PH which I believe is just right ? What happens if the soi is too Alkali ? What effect does that have on a Cannabis plant ? Darco <p> All plants on earth take nutrients from the ranges 4-8 . The closer you get towards 4 the more micro nutrients are available . The best pH range to stick to are 5-7 ... really anywhere between there should see you ok so long as you are pouring in enough food . The more alkaline your medium the less soluble P will be , which means it is likely to solidify in a high alkaline medium . so even though you pour it in the pH may see it become less available to the plant or even locked out altogether . <p> You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in soil , shoot for 6-7pH every feed and you should be dandy . Do n't bother checking run off , this is because in the run off will be all the nutes that have seeped to the bottom off the pot from previous grows . these nutes are at the bottom and not being used by the plant , pretty harmless but they will always be there especially if you feed hard . so run off will give you a false reading . it will tell you things are more acidic than they really are in the medium as a whole . 10985 @qwx420985

I have had them since the start of my present grow and have applied some mighty mites to each of the pots but they are still here .

I 'm going for a full blast of h2o2 then i think with a complete system scrub down , May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Springtails do n't usually appear in dry and clean places , which you clearly have to maintain . Although , there are times , especially during summer , when the conditions are humid , so moisture becomes prevalent . An infestation becomes is quite possible , given the humidity . You must have ready solutions in this case . Here are some of them : <p> Soap and Water - Washing with soap and water comes as the basic way to get rid or at least control springtails . The frothy mixture created by soap and water harms , not to mention drowns , torrents of springtails . The problem is , sometimes there are too many of them that a simple washing wo n't hold them off . Just apply this remedy when the pests do n't appear in thousands . vinegar Vinegar - Vinegar , being a highly acidic liquid , will burn through the pests exteriors , making it a more efficient solution than soapy water . Given the sheer number of springtails , you may need to pour it three to four times for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricey . Bleach - Bleach is a slightly corrosive substance that can instantly kill springtails . Mix it with some water then flood the pests ' source , which will probably eliminate hundreds , or even thousands . Improve Ventilation - Maintaining a cool temperature inside the house minimizes the appearance of moisture . Just leave your air-conditioner turned on when you 're at home and apply insulation on the ceiling ( Learn how to insulate a crawl space ) . The springtails will eventually switch locations , as they search for damper areas . <p> Each remedy works well against springtails , but if you are faced with a seemingly insurmountable number of them , better arm yourself insecticides . Insecticides <p> Just like any bug , a springtail is killed in an instant upon applying insecticide . These chemical-based solutions , sprays , or granules are poisonous to insects . With just a few applications , you can massacre many of the springtails lurking around your house . Some insecticide types work better than others , depending on where they are applied , so having more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> bifen granules Bifen Granules - Bifen granules are potent and can be used indoors and outdoors , making them a pretty versatile solution . Their effect also lasts longer than most insecticides . Each granule emits fumes that are harmful to springtails , which is why a 25-pound bag is enough to cover two acres of land . Apply these babies around your property and your springtail problem will soon come to an end . Just keep your pets way from them since the granules are poisonous . Insect Spray - Insect sprays work best when applied on cracks , crevices and hard to reach places . The poisonous cloud emitted will take out any pest that it touches , including springtails . Make sure you wear a safety mask when applying . Long exposure to the gas may damage your respiratory system . Liquid Insecticide - Bifen granules work even better when partnered with liquid insecticide . Not only does liquid insecticide kill springtails instantly , it also increases the effects of the granules . Spread the granules around the springtail havens , preferably near the exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you placed the granules . If the springtails are hiding beneath an object , simply lift it up and exterminate everything that 's moving . insecticide dust Insecticide Dust - Insecticide dust is highly corrosive , so you better wear safety gloves when handling it . Place a generous amount in a hand duster and blow the particles onto a springtail colony . Within minutes , the dust will eliminate them all . This solution is perfect for the smallest crevices . Fumigation - In extreme cases , in which the springtails number to over ten thousand , the only available solution is fumigation . Hire an exterminator to fumigate the area . The insecticide used contains powerful chemicals , which can eliminate all the pests in your home in just a few hours . It can damage your lungs , so you have to leave the premises while the exterminator is fumigating. 10985 @qwx420985

@@46022155 @6022155/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> EUPD , OCD - anecdotal effects of smoking while on medication . <p> So I 've been blessed with the neurology of a joke that is I 've had OCD since I was a sproglit . During childhood I had a short period of time on SSRIs which I decided myself to come off as they seemed to invoke suicidal &amp; self harming behaviour in me . At 14 I left school ( I did my GCSEs early so I could leave ) as I could n't cope with the environment &amp; structure that was there , as well as my school not knowing how to appropriately deal with my condition , effectively leading to neglect . I was a stay at home &amp; play WoW person except for a few times a week i 'd hang out up town with other dossers - I started smoking my greens about 15-16 at 16 I also decided to go into my current profession &amp; went to college - I 'm unsure if smoking weed was what got me to the headspace to be able to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that small period on SSRIs which had made me very anxious about medication anyway so fast forward many years and i 'm smoking on and off , mostly on studies all went well , work went well - at least every other Friday down my mates toking . Fast forward a little more and I 'm lost in work , I got no time to smoke because I 'm working almost every day ( after a couple of promotions and tons of responsibility ) so I could n't get high because I 'd be on call and could need to drive out to someone at any given moment and if I was n't on call I would be working anyway . <p> So I had a period of maybe 1 year smoke free - during this year my mental health declined rapidly , towards the end of it I was unable to concentrate , was hardly eating , constantly lashing out verbally and just not looking after myself , right up to the point where I was self harming during work - eventually I ended up off sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did for a while and got a little more stable and went back to work , but same thing - I worked for three months straight without a day off no smoking trying to keep myself busy while my headspace was getting clogged up with real nasty things . Until I ended up in hospital that was &amp; got some treatment there . <p> Back on meds now , since just before my hospital admission . So I 'm sure they have some effect on my thought process etc , however I have found that I am at my best when I 'm smoking regularly - not just when I 'm high but the times in between also . <p> I 've found that smoking regularly has a significant effect on my overall health in general - <p> While high : Brain slows down &amp; enables me to process my thoughts and feelings better without becoming overwhelmed . Gives good pain management ( neurological pain due to chronic pain condition ) which helps me to avoid taking opioid based painkillers which cause nausea in me anyway . Reduces my level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; fill in forms that I need to . Helps me to get a decent nightmare free sleep , as otherwise I 'm sleep deprived . <p> While not high but regularly smoking : Generally going outside more &amp; being more active Having a normal appetite &amp; eating regularly ( once a day or so is a lot for me usually ) Being more sociable , playing games online more &amp; hanging out in teamspeak even when not playing . Getting out more with my family , finding nice places to toke mostly . Taking better care of myself in general ( showering regularly , cleaning clothes &amp; tidying etc ) showering while high is the best shit . My mood is better regulated , I have measurably less ' episodes ' ( EUPD ) and my episodes of self harm are much much fewer than otherwise . <p> So my experience can be summed up to this : Smoking is better than any medication I 've ever been prescribed for my illnesses/conditions , mental and otherwise . I suffer no delusions that smoking can fix any of my issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symptoms , and I 'd rather not go without for my health 's sake . However smoking while on medication should by all means have the opposite effect , it should nullify the positive effects of medication &amp; exasperate my existing conditions , clearly for me that is not the case - but it goes against what I know professionally , as well as what I would be saying to any patient , co-worker , professional liaison , acquaintance etc . <p> Anyone else have similar experiences ? Or maybe the same type of conditions with completely different experiences ? I 'm curious to know people 's individual anecdotes as professionally I only come across " bad drug abused caused all these problems " cases , and I just ca n't believe that 's the case with my own experience . <p> I 'm actually due to be on DBT for a year minimum . The medication I 'm on is the long term kind where they do n't expect me to come off it . I would rather just keep taking it &amp; smoke casually ( every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not going to fix my chemical imbalances etc so I 'll keep taking my meds. 10985 @qwx420985

The stretch is the stretch . If plant doubles in height during stretch , it will do so in a scrog. and that includes both the horizontal and vertical dimensions before flip .

Unless it is a stretchy Sativa , I would allow ( 1.5 x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sativas could go 2.5 x 60cm . <p> However , if you use a rule of thumb that the plants will double in height then you should be in the ball park somewhere ... that said , some plants may triple in height , like I said , it 's not a cut &amp; dry question <p> But , a little bud porn for you to help .... here is one of Jesse Pinkman 's scrogs <p> " If it does n't matter who wins or loses , then why do they keep score ? " ( Vince Lombardi ) <p> It 's more about how you as the grower manage the stretch of the plant . As others have said the plant will try and go up , if you keep tucking it under the will grow out sideway and fill out the net . The trick is to manage this and when to flip from veg to flower so you can fill in your space . If you put " scrog " into Google and click on images you will see some very different interpretations . 10985 @qwx420985

Hopefully this quick guide will help you control the bugs safely . <p> How do bugs get on the plant in the first place ? - The eggs can be in the soil you use ... you can inadvertently carry the bugs in on your clothes , hands , shoes etc after being in the garden ... other houseplants bought from garden centres are often crawling with them ... or even your old dog could carry them in ... Suffice to say that there are several ways for bugs to get into your home and find their way to your grow room ! <p> There are two main bugs that invade our grow rooms , the first and most common is the Spider Mite ... Spider Mites are often red but in my experience can be anything from dark yellow right through to black , to the human eye they appear like specks of dust often living on the under-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tiny eggs and within weeks a few spider mites can become 1000 's ! The photo below shows a severe case of spider mite on the under-side of a leaf . The first sign of Spider Mites are usually tiny white/yellow specks on the leaves where the mites have been sucking/chewing , as shown here ..... Spider mites literally suck the life out of a plant , a severe infestation can make a plant wilt , grow poorly , and generally look terrible ! - Smoking buds covered in Spider Mites does n't do your health any favours either ! <p> Controlling Mites ... Controlling the mites on your plants is actually quite straight forward and there are a few options ... your nearest garden centre will stock a whole range of products and bug guns that will reduce the amount of mites on your plants , it will stop them reproducing and will kill the eggs ( to some degree ) , but make sure you read the label on the product CAREFULLY ! .... The product MUST state that it is safe to use on fruit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , Eat Tomorrow ' ... if you must use a bug gun then go for these ! Neem Oil is another good product and will control the mites well , it is regarded as ' safer ' than bug guns , but again read the label and follow the guide carefully . My own personal method of controlling Spider Mites is a spray gun filled with water , 1/4 tea-spoon of washing powder , a drop of washing up liquid and a sponge ... I literally bathe the under-side of every leaf VERY gently which removes most if not all of the mites/eggs . I do this once a fortnight and have very few Mite problems ! Apart from the methods above , there are allsorts of weird and wonderful concoctions that people say help to control Mites ... mashed up old tobacco and garlic is one that i read a lot ... but having never tried it ( nor ever wanted to ) , i ca n't comment on it . - Googling will bring up many more no doubt . <p> Unfortunately , Spider Mites are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to get rid of a plague of Spider Mites is to do away with your crop ( after harvest prefered ) and completely sterilise the entire room , including pots , all gadgets/fans/ducting etc before starting again . Diluted bleach or one of the many anti-bacterial products available in supermarkets will do the job . <p> Aphids ... Aphids can be an even bigger problem ! - A ' family ' of Aphids living in your grow room for just a week or two can virtually kill or seriously damage your entire crop ! As with Mites , Aphids come in all colours ... some are almost clear and difficult to spot , others are green or orange and some can be black and resemble ' ants ' . The first sign of Aphids is usually leaf damage , sometimes holes appear in the leaves , the edges look ' chewed ' or the leaves start to ' deform ' , the plant again wilts and the growth is seriously affected . Below is a pepper plant with the first signs of Aphid infestation ... note the deformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spider Mites , but thankfully are easier to control and eradicate using the same methods above ... One good ' spray ' should kill most if not all of the Aphids on your plants . <p> Remember .... ALWAYS spray or wash down the plants when the lights are OFF and do n't put the plants back under the light 's until the leaves are completely dry , else you will burn the leaves ! - And ALWAYS follow the directions on the pesticide bottles ... your health is at risk if you do n't ! <p> Hopefully the info here will help a few of you when the dreaded Mites appear ! <p> I have had problems with Aphids before - tried water and fairy liquid and rubbing each leaf but they were a bastard to get rid of . I even tried dressing up as a big ladybird and threatening them but they were cheeky fuckers ! ! ! Have bought a fruit and veg spray gun .............. just in case . <p> glad you made this thread grub , i noticed some tiny little white/silvery insect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow in but started them in jiffy 's ) the insect 's are pretty quick an sort of look similar to spider mites but there not on the leaf 's only the small bit of jiffy pad . <p> any idea 's on what they are/could be ? <p> ( i 've tried googling some pic 's but cant find anything , i might get the scope and camera out soon ) <p> Just one thing , systemic spray is ok if the harvest is n't due for 6 weeks plus , right ? So says someone in another thread anyway . Would that mean we could use stuff that ISNT safe on fruit &amp; veg if our crop was n't ready for a couple of months then ?

Mel Franks came up with the 100 N 100 P 200 K 60 Mg formula many years ago , and it 's just as valid today as ever . If you can keep close enough to these numbers all the way through veg and flower , you will provide your plants with all necessary elements , in the right quantities for vibrant growth . What most of the nutrient manufacturers ' try to hide from their customers is the fact that just about any plant food is as good as another . they understand better than we do , just how much money is to be had from the " NEW " gardeners . So , they have us buying 5 bottles for about 40 per grow . Mixing all the essential elements up into stupid configurations , so that you must use all the stuff just to get right ppms to your plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . For example ; Dyna-Gro Grow ( 7-9-5 ) ( NH4 ) 2.6% ( NO3 ) 4.4% Mg0.5% Ca2.0% Fe0.1% S0.05% Mn0.05% @10ml/Gal N 242 P 136 K 143 Mg 17 Ca 69 Look how high N and P are , yet K is low and Mg needs supplementing .

What that was showing you was the discrepencies that exist with these foods . Veg food with toxic looking levels of P , and flowering food with hardly any P. So , what is it ? How much is enough ? That brings us back to Mel with his 100 100 200 60 ppms . It 's impossible to know the exact amounts of each element for each particular stage , so many variables to consider . Here 's something to ponder on . How can so many people across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grow the finest dope ? No seperate veg or flower food . No Boosters or additives , just a one part .

Given the circumstances I was happy to pay twenty quid for something to smoke and if in a similar situation again i 'd repeat myself . <p> Here 's my story ... <p> A lad I know got in contact last week to let me know he was " in the trade " . He brought some of what he had and we had a smoke and a chat over a cuppa . It was n't up to much in terms of quantity . He 's yet to pick up a set of scales . <p> Anyway , we started talking figures and he reckons he 's paying 230 an ounce and picks up one or two at a time . If this was anyone else I 'd smile , nod and make a personal vow to never do business again ( dishonesty for the sake of it does n't appeal to me ) but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could 230 a pop really be the situation he finds himself in ? Surely a minimal amount of shopping around should easily knock 50-80 off that number ? <p> Buying such amounts is not something I 've had experience in for touching 10 years . <p> If you promise yourself you will never sell it , you can get by on 20 quid spend per ounce growing it under a moderate light , and never be out of weed .

With that in mind , you have totally been had at 230 per ounce . <p> trumptummy <p> 21-08-11 , 06:56 PM <p> 200 an ounce is the very maximum here and that 's for really very good quality weed it has to be said .

@@46022174 @6022174/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Prevention and Treatment of Powdery Mildew <p> Ok so we have all heard of this dreaded disease and some people including myself have had to deal with it so this is for anyone having to deal with the same disease or just interested in the prevention . <p> Powdery mildew is one of the most widespread plant pests . It tends to affect flowering plants and fruit trees or bushes ( roses , apple trees , etc. ) as well as cannabis . The spores are in the air or on contaminated plants in the garden and can easily be drawn into your grow room by ventilators . In internet forums and cannabis cultivation books you may find lengthy lists of possible treatments that look temptingly promising for a complete recovery at all stages of mildew infestation . But the authors have rarely tested these products themselves , and the compounds are seldom differentiated between those applicable only for growth , and those also safe to use during flowering . This guide is therefore specifically orientated towards publishing some first-hand experiences with a variety of fungicides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during growth and flowering in cannabis plants . <p> In warm , dry climate powdery mildew spreads widely . But we have also observed heavy infestations particularly after a long and wet winter . The symptoms even disappeared occasionally during a heat wave . It is therefore unlikely that powdery mildew only affects cannabis plants during a warm and dry weather period . <p> Powdery mildew can be detected by the white-coating on leaves and shoot tips , which succumb to the infestation by atrophy and eventually die . Only the surface of the leaves is contaminated by the fungus . Very heavily infested plants often can not be saved . Plants affected by this disease and wilting plants should be removed from the garden if you do n't want the spores to spread . If the infestation of powdery mildew arises during the last few weeks of flowering it is possible to control an infestation until harvest . A good fungicide can fully combat powdery mildew , but the treatment is often lengthy and takes several weeks . Mother plants and cuttings should be treated preventively so that valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive fungus taking second place only to bud/grey mold ( Botrytis ) . If you not only require a fungicide for preventive means , but also to combat an infestation , you may need to alternate between several products for the total period of treatment . In the instructions for use it is stated how often a specific compound can be applied per crop . Since fungicides allowed in organic agriculture can be less effective than synthetic products , all preventative management measures to reduce the primary infestation and to improve the microclimate should be exploited optimally . Fungicides are applied at the crucial stages in the development of the plant and the epidemic . Specific traits of the products must be taken into account for outdoor applications ( such as rain fastness and hazards to plant health under intense heat or sunlight ) . <p> Photo 4 : A heavy infestation can be difficult to contain . The mildew covers all plant parts and weakens plant defences . <p> Buying Fungicides <p> To begin with , its important to distinguish the criteria according to which fungicides for organic produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure not only safety measures for humans , but also for the environment : such as for beneficial insects , animals , and aquatic life . Secondly , the fungicide must be safe to use on a soft-leafed plant species such as cannabis and flowering plants in general ( if required for the flowering period ) . Therefore , the first step when purchasing a fungicide is to check the product information on potential hazards for specific plant species or flowering plants , human consumption , and the environment . <p> A fungicide should be purchased according to the following criteria : good plant tolerance not harmful to flowering buds effectiveness for medium to heavy infestation effectiveness as a preventive product not toxic for humans environmentally friendly ( pets , water sources , honey bees , etc . ) <p> Fungicides to avoid : sulphur copper synthetic fungicides and all other products not suitable for agricultural crops fungicides that will desiccate the leaves or flowers such as horticultural oils and salts <p> Introducing Effective Fungicides <p> Lecithin <p> One of the most promising are lecithin-based products . Commercial products based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control in central Europe since the product does not cause any off-flavours . It is also harmless to fragile young plants and , most importantly , to flowering marijuana buds . <p> Is milk the answer ? <p> diluted milk solution effective during vegetative growth when combined with other products . The idea to use milk as a biological fungicide came from the Brazilian scientist Wagner Bettiol . He experimented with different mixes of fresh milk in order to combat powdery mildew on greenhouse zucchinis and published his findings in 1999 . The Australian scientist Peter Crisp from the University of Adelaide tested this method among 40 different alternative methods to combat mildew on grapevines . He discovered that milk or whey showed the best results . The microorganisms in the milk combat the mildew . In addition , the natrium phosphate strengthens plant defences . Diluted milk has been reported as surprisingly efficient in the agricultural sector in Australia , but under central European conditions it is used only rarely on cultivars due to the poorer weather conditions . There is , of course , a big difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how promising such results look like , they must always be seen in the context of which cultivars require treatment . Since milk contains proteins and sugars , infection by grey mold ( Botrytis ) may be promoted after treatment . That poses a serious risk to flowering marijuana . For this reason it is only recommended to treat cannabis plants with a diluted milk solution during growth and preflowering . <p> Application For maximal effectiveness the treatments should be alternated weekly with another fungicide . Mix milk and water in parts of 1:9 . Spray the plant thoroughly on a sunny day . If no other fungicides are available apply 1-2x weekly . <p> Extract of Giant Knotweed ( Reynoutria sachalinensis ) <p> Giant Knotweed extract induces phytoalexins which infer resistance to powdery mildew and other diseases such as Botrytis . In other words , the extract helps the plant fight the mold rather than attacking the mold directly . We have not tested knotweed products yet and therefore the information presented here is only based upon scientific studies on a variety of other plant species . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large variety of cultivars respond favourably to the treatment . <p> Potassium Bicarbonate <p> Baking soda has been one of the basic fungicides in use to compbat powdery mildew , It was found that potassium bicarbonate is 25- 35% more effective than sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) . In addition , an effective " spreader-sticker " was needed to evenly spread and stick the potassium bicarbonate over a leaf surface to give it the ability to be a powerful fungicide and have lasting and preventative characteristics . <p> Garlic Extracts <p> GarlicGarlic is cheap and readily available . This has made it a favourite " home-grown " pest control , especially among organic gardeners . The volatile antimicrobial substance allicin ( diallylthiosulphinate ) is produced in garlic when the tissues are damaged during crushing or chopping the garlic . Allicin in garlic juice inhibits the germination of sporangia ( in which the spores develop ) and thereby acts as a fungicide . You can buy readymade garlic extracts that are very effective in three ways : as a natural insect repellent , as a fungicide , and plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using a homemade recipe . Garlic extracts are not suitable for seedlings and should not be applied under direct sunlight . <p> To conclude , its important to note that plant-pathogen interactions are a rapidly developing area among the plant sciences . There are constantly new results being published on this subject . Here a few promising selections of products in ongoing research studies that are easy to purchase : ? Silicon : increases plant resistance to pathogenic fungi possibly through an interaction with defence responses . Silicic acid may play a role in systemic resistance . ? Vitamin B1 : induces SAR when applied to vegetable crops and increased resistance to fungal , bacterial and viral infections . ? Riboflavin or Vitamin B2 : induces systemic resistance on tobacco and could perhaps work with cannabis too . <p> Preventive Measures <p> For ensuring plant health any preventive measures can be extremely important . Obviously , it is much better to prevent an infestation from the start especially when the disease is so aggressive and easily transmitted from plant to plant . These recommendations are based on practical gardening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a high resistance if you live in an area prone to mildew infestation ensure a good climate in the greenhouse and indoor ( ventilation , electric or gas heating required ) avoid the use of nitrogen-rich manure ( like fresh manure or unripe compost ) , avoid fertilizers high in ammoniacal nitrogen such as pure guano in powder and pellet form prevent white fly and aphid infestations and treat plants thoroughly if diseased , the sticky secretions from these pests cover the leaves and facilitate mildew which in some cases turns greyish-black do not grow too close to damp areas ( riverside , etc. ) increase the light intensity indoor if you are growing under low-light ( such as CFL , fluorescents , LED lamps , etc. ) use garlic teas and garlic sprays treat plants regularly with lecithin-based sprays remove or treat all infested weeds and ornamental plants on your property ; cut away infested twigs on fruit trees at the earliest signs of infestation spray down leaves with clean , chlorine-free water if they are covered in pollen after pollinating buds for seeds ( wait a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily turn moldy under high humidity and attract mildew <p> Tips for treating mildew keep enough distance between plants to prevent overcrowding use nitrogen rich fertilizer only sparingly and when absolutely necessary separate or isolate infested plants from healthy ones start treatments on time and repeat them regularly switch compounds so that no resistance occurs ( follow product instructions ! ) preventive treatment is important for high risk areas ( especially on mother plants , cuttings , young plants ) do not spray outdoor plants during strong sunshine ; apply fungicides indoors shortly before the dark period when using a new or innovative product do a test on one or more plants first to check if the product is plant friendly this is especially important during flowering to avoid unnecessary damage to the pistils , and for young plants with their tender leaves <p> Health Warning Infected leaves or buds should not be smoked or used for cooking ! 10985 @qwx420985

Its taken from Cannabis Connoiseur magazine , march/april 2010 edition which is an american publication <p> Kush - Origins of the plant , History of the name <p> The word " Kush " . is everywhere . In California it can be seen on t-shirts , billboards , and advertised down Hollywood Boulevard and the Venice Beach . <p> When describing high-grade , first-rate marijuana , it is a rare occasion that you hear someone in Southern California call their buds hydro , kind , dank or the fireno , even if it is the dank , or the fire , it also has to be " The Kush . " <p> Indeed , today , the big gimmick-word for all ganjapreneurs is : " Kush . " And everyone , from clinic owners to sneakers-salesman , are cashing in on the word alone : all too often , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not even close to Kush , knowingly , and other times , out of their own naivety . Because Kush , the word has become so overused and misunderstood , that the majority of the smoking community has forgotten , or does n't  know any longer what is and is not Kush and that Kush is not a street term applying to any type of high-potency marijuana , but to an actual genetic lineage of cannabis-indica plants , that originated in the Himalayan Mountains , and was , possibly , the oldest pot on the plant . <p> When the day comes that there is an organized field of academics dedicated to the research and study of marijuanas history , these cannabis culture vultures will begin their timelines and lectures on a mountain range within the Himalayas , located in the northern regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan . This area , along with India , is generally agreed to be the birthplace of marijuana . For centuriessince the 7th century B.C. , to be precise Kush , a stocky indica variation of killer ganja , has been grown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of this fertile region is the Indus Valley , home to a unique history of landrace Kush phenotypes that have survived for 1300 years within this region , a 500-mile stretch of the Himalayans called the Hindu Mountain Range . <p> Historians believe the area was given the name , Hindu Mountain Range , because by 7th century B.C. the predominant religion of this regions civilization was Hinduism . This civilization of Hindu settlers have , for eons now , have been growing small , ultra-resinous variations of Kush phenotypes , and in the past , indulged on the plant both recreationally and for religious rituals and meditation . <p> Over the centuries , this cannabis indica plants have maintained not only their spectacular high , but also their physical characteristics . Since five centuries before Marco Polo made his way across the silk path into Asia Minor , Kush has maintained her stocky , bushy structure , dark colour , earthy scent , and small , dense resinous buds . However , what have changed over the centuries are the preferred methods of smoking this delectable dank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably not out of the question for the ancient Indian manI found no data about peace pipes in the Indus Valleywhat appears to of been the forefathers favourite method of smoking Kush was not burning it down in flower-form , but roasting it as hash instead . When you understand the highly resinous and sticky nature of freshly cultivated Kush plants , making hash out them makes a good deal of since . <p> For that reasonthe resinous nature of the buds , and no doubt , the stellar hash high-- what the Hindu did with their buds was cut the newly finished plant at the stocks . After the cutting , they would break apart the sturdy branches of Kush colas and arduously rub these between his hands for a long period of time . <p> A delicate amount of pressure was used while he/she rolled the Kush branch and colas , which were placed in a bucket or container , which collected the tiny particles of weed matter that was falling off the entire stalkcolas , stem and all . These microscopic weed skimmings that were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outside of the resin-coated indica strain . This small matter of highly potent THC trichomes was then condensed into either a kief , or hashish , which , long before vaporizers and zigzags were invited , was the way cannabis made its way into the conscious of the ancients <p> ( Note : Each country in this part of the world has its own name for the processed finished product which has also survived over time ; for example , in India , the hash made from flower tops which is hand-rolled or pressed till very compacted , is called chara . The THC which falls of the plant after it is cultivated simply by shaking it , and is also collected in India , is a term which has really stuck over the centuries : it is called kief . ) <p> But how did the fabled Kush genetics make there was to the Western world ? Who is responsible for this trans-pacific passage of the Pakistani pot ? The answer : the strain-seeds were smuggled . By who is the real question ? Stoner lore places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who flew to the region , scouted out the seeds , procured a small collection , and smuggled them back into the United States . This is believed to of taken place in the early 1970s , with a massive number of crosses taking place out of a very small number of original landrace seeds since their arrival . <p> ( Note : For more information on the original American Kush seeds , take a look on the web at the many stories about : " The Thirteen Original Kush Seeds . " There is a take on this KUSH ORIGINS OF THE PLANT ; HISTORY OF THE WORD surfer-smuggling story that speaks of their being only thirteen original seeds which were , collectively , responsible for breeding some of the best strainsthe trains that would go on to create the modern " kind " cannabis market that developed sometime in the mid-twentieth century .

The etymological roots of the word Kush , are highly disputed and depend on which language you choose to believe it originated first . The cases for the origin of the word , and what it means , are as follows : <p> First Theory : Persian Roots : In a number of Iranian languages still spoken in the Hindu Valley Region ( a 500-mile stretch ) , and the areas surrounding , peaks and mountaintops often have the ending , -Kush , in their names . Kush , could deride from the Persian mountain term : Kush , and its attachment to the mountain population that grew the phenomenal phenotype . <p> Second Theory : Perhaps , salesman along the silk road were selling Hindu Kush , and even centuries back , it was known by the general public as the best type buds in the world . Maybe Marco Polo found some on his way back , and that would explain the real " spice " phenomenon of history we never really understood . <p> Third Theory : In the Fourth Century B.C. , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Macedonian-Greek rule lasted for three centuries , until its collapse was followed by a civilization of people referred to in history as Kushans , who were a part of the Kushan Empire , which had its capital near modern day Kabul . It is possible these people were getting so high off their own stash of Indus Valley buds they decided to name it after themselves . <p> Fourth Theory : In the ancient Scythian language , the Hindu Mountains were named : Hindu-kus , in which the word kus is defined as side , or region . Some argue that when the British took Imperial control over the Indian Kingdom , the word Kush might have become a corrupted English version of the Scythian term : kus . <p> Fifth Theory : Who really cares , this weed is dank and the word Kush is catchy as all hell . <p> The name Hindu Kush means literally ' Kills the Hindu ' , a reminder of the days when ( Hindu ) slaves from the Indian subcontinent died in the harsh weather typical of the Afghan mountains while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx420985

Filter ? <p> Hi all , <p> My EC reading of tap water fluctuates between 0.6 &amp; 0.7 , which gives me a problem as that means that I ca n't really give any nutes at this stage . I have given them a very tiny drop of plant start in 0.6 water , bringing EC up to 0.7 but that 's as far as I can go . <p> Is there a good way that I can start off with a lower EC ? I have n't filtered water before because I 'm not a plant but I 'm guessing that it would bring down the reading by maybe 0.2/0.3 , which would certainly help . <p> I guess mineral water is called that because it has stuff in it , so I 'm not sure that would be any help . Any advice / neat tricks would be appreciated . BTW , I 'm talking about seedling stage , not filtering water for my NFT tank And I do already leave water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottled tesco value water ... think the EC is about 0.3 i 'm sure it was murdock that mentioned that before , or do what i do for my carnivorous plants and use rainwater ... but got my best harvest to date using a water in the south east with an EC of 0.9 and never had any problems , but i was in coco and that buffers it a bit so i know this is different from your situation , but , my point is that i started seeds of in this water and added rizzotonic right away and they grew just fine , and they were all on an overall EC of 2.4 including background at full tilt .... did three grows in this location and never ever had a problem starting seeds with that water ... <p> but as i said either tesco value bottled water ( i think ) or water down your tap water with rainwater to get the ec down to say 0.3 so you are still getting some of the trace elements <p> yeah i agree about the CFL or a T5 for seedlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 tube jobby covers my perfectly and the spread of light is sooooo even .. my bro now uses CFL for the first couple of weeks of veg as well due to the tight internode spacing and how happy the plants are under them ... i 'm using leds now for veg on my photo strains and all the way through on my autos , the lack of stretch and healthy look of the plants has made me think i did the right thing <p> when the photo plants go in their own tent i will be using a MH bulb for the first time as well for the same reason , i 'm only in 1.8m tents so height is a concern lol <p> There 's a 5ltr bottle in Tescos of Ashbeck water , 1 pound 10 pence , not sure what it 's pH is ( I do n't remember it being low , maybe 7.8 ) but it hardly registers on my bluelab-trunch for ec - maybe 0.2 if you 're lucky . <p> The low impurities means that just two or three drops of pH-down will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're using hardwater nutes , then it will need bringing up with pH-up from about 4.8 - again two maybe three drops . <p> You do miss out on some very trace elements that are present in tapwater , I usually take my ( if I 'm using it ) tapwater EC of 0.8 and make it up to 1.8 to 2.2 , I 've never had any problems so I 'd guess you could even up that a bit for mature plants . <p> The EC and how much of it is background and how much is my nutes , is n't something I worry too much about , the real shitter is the amount of pH down it takes . Especially if you 're not using hardwater nutes . <p> Big squirts of pH-down are required to get my tapwater down to a sensible level - I prefer using bottled water and will use rainwater if I 've got it - that 's me mixing it up again ... <p> O God of earth and altar , bow down and hear our cry , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls of gold entomb us , the swords of scorn divide , take not thy thunder from us , but take away our pride .

@@46022190 @6022190/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Importance of trichomes ( Pot Potency ) <p> Been doing my research on trichomes to know when is the proper time to harvest and if I did n't look it up I 'd be very clueless being a novice grower . <p> I found this great blog on cannabis culture website . I thought it was a great read and would help a lot of novice growers like me understand the importance of the trichomes ( Pot Potency ) . <p> Marijuana is perhaps the only plant in history grown primarily for its trichomes . Whether used for hashish or marijuana the objective is the same : production and harvest of THC-rich trichomes ( crystals ) . Yet often the cultivator loses sight of the real goal of growing this plant . Bud size , density , coloration , flavor and odor are all of little value if they do not produce the euphoric sensations we seek . Trichomes and resins <p> Trichomes come in many shapes and sizes and are used by plants for many different purposes . Cannabis uses its trichomes for a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannabinoids to be effective , and others that do not . <p> The primary goal of any plant is to create and nurture seeds to the point where they will be viable for future growth . Trichomes help prevent seed damage from dessication , insects , animals , light degradation and fungal disease . Perhaps the most successful function of trichomes in the proliferation of cannabis is their attractiveness to humans . What better a creature to protect and spread a genus than the most advanced organism on the planet ? <p> An important thing to remember is that heavy trichome production is not necessarily an indication of a potent plant . Some hemp strains have moderate layers of trichomes yet pack only a headache . In drug strains a dense stand of trichomes is a sign that it could be of high potency , but certainly not a guarantee . <p> This is because the resins that flow within may or may not hold the THC and other cannabinoids that we are looking for . <p> Indica varieties often look more heavily crystallized than Sativas , yet typically do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known high-THC clone , THC level and cannabinoid ratios may change depending on environmental conditions . <p> What defines drug strain cannabis is the plant 's ability to convert cannabidiol ( CBD ) or possibly cannabichromene ( CBC ) into THC . If we as growers do not provide the plant with reason to make this conversion it likely will devote its energy elsewhere , to aid in its survival . <p> Environmental Influence <p> It takes high quality genetics to produce high quality marijuana , but genetics is only half of the equation . The genetic structure ( genotype ) only plays 50% of the role in determining the appearance and quality ( phenotype ) of a given plant . The other half is determined by environmental conditions such as light , temperature , humidity and soil nutrition . All these factors play a role in both the physical and chemical nature of marijuana 's trichomes . <p> The best way to take a look at how environment affects THC production is to look where on the planet cannabis has naturally adopted a high THC profile . As cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different traits to help in its adaptation to varied areas . The best drug varieties have always been found at equatorial or high altitude locations . The one thing which both of these variables have in common is high light intensity and a large amount of ultraviolet ( UV ) light in the spectrum . <p> Recent Swiss trials in outdoor plots of clones grown at different altitudes have shown that there is correlation between higher altitude and increased potency ( although there seems to be a trade off in yield ) . This likely means that THC-rich resins act to protect the plant and its seed from both higher light intensities and ultraviolet presence . It 's no surprise that cannabis has developed a chemical to protect itself against the Sun 's damaging UV rays , as they can be injurious to all forms of life . <p> Humidity also plays a role in plant resin production . Although some potent equatorial strains do seem to occur in high humidity areas , most high-test land races have evolved in drier areas , like Afghanistan . The aridity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent by the trait of large dense flower clusters . This would only be an advantage in an area of low humidity , as flowers will mold in anything more.2 <p> There are many examples of non-cannabis plants producing resins in order to protect themselves from drying out . The waxy coating on cacti and other succulent plants is a prime example . Marijuana flowered in humid conditions will often have a longer stalk on the glandular trichome than the same strain grown in drier conditions . While this may give the appearance of being very crystallized , it will likely contain less THC than the same plant grown in a drier environment . Another problem with longer trichome stalks is that the gland heads are more likely to break off during handling . <p> Flushing : pros and cons <p> Much time and thought has been put into the feeding needs of each part of marijuana 's life cycle , yet for some reason the final stages of resin development always seem to be ignored . But the vegetative period of plant growth is only setting the platform for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Flushing in particular seems to be something that is over-emphasized by many of today 's growers . Many growers " flush " their plants with straight water or clearing agents during the final weeks before harvest in an effort to improve taste and smokeability . The theory is that this forces the plant to use up stored nutrients that may affect these qualities . Although this is certainly true to some extent , what many are forgetting is that not all nutrients can be moved within the plant . <p> Nitrogen , which is the main factor in poor-tasting bud , can be moved within the plant . If not present in the root zone a plant will take it from the older leaves to support newer growth . Calcium , however , is a nutrient that can not be moved within the plant , if it is not present in the root zone it is not available for growth . Little research has been done on nutritional requirements of cannabis during the final stages of flowering , but it seems likely that calcium is vital as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages could therefore adversely affect trichome production . <p> This is not as serious of a concern for soil-based growers , as lime or other calcium sources which are mixed into the soil likely will provide sufficient nutrition even while flushing with pure water . But hydroponic growers using very pure water sources with little naturally occurring calcium could have problems . Flushing is certainly a valid technique , but is easily overdone and is not a quick fix for overfeeding earlier in the flower stage . <p> Some studies have shown that high potassium levels have a negative influence on THC production , which would correlate to the general belief that while hemp crops uptake more potassium than phosphorous , the reverse seems to be true for drug and seed cannabis crops . A study on how to minimize THC levels in hemp crops showed that THC levels in newer leaf growth decreased as nitrogen levels were increased . As no THC measurement was taken from floral clusters we can only speculate that the same would likely hold true in buds . This would also explain the good results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nutrient most easily flushed from the soil . Companion planting <p> Much research is still needed on the interrelationships of plants in the garden . Little is known about common vegetable garden plants effect on each other , let alone how they may react with cannabis . <p> Growing certain plants in proximity to each other has been documented to cause noticeable effects on growth , both positive and negative . The main companion plant that has attracted interest with underground marijuana researchers is stinging nettle ( Urtica dioica ) which has been said to increase essential oils in many plants . <p> Breeding for potency <p> Marijuana is unique from an evolutionary standpoint in being the only plant in history that in some cases has been grown and bred for over two decades under nothing but artificial light . It is very likely that there have already been some genetic changes that have taken place as a result of this . All plants , especially cannabis , will quickly adapt to a new habitat by adding or dropping traits over successive generations . With breeders doing potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 20 years there is great opportunity for drift from original genotypes . <p> Some " oldtimers " of the cannabis community have theorized that the use of high pressure sodium ( HPS ) light as a sole source of lighting has resulted in unconscious selection for lower THC parents during breeding . This theory is based on the assumption that ultraviolet light is a large causal factor in the plants production of THC . As HPS lights produce little in the way of UV , the lower potency plants could look the most vigorous in early selections ( before flowering ) as they would have a genetic advantage over high THC plants ( less wasted energy ) . <p> A common way of conducting a breeding program where space is limited is to start large seed lots and then select the best individuals for flowering . Vic High and others have done some preliminary research into creating high UV environments by adding tanning or medical UV lights to their regular lighting for early seedling selections . As most Dutch breeding is done behind closed doors it is unknown whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tricks of the trade <p> Delving through the history of marijuana cultivation you will find a myriad of techniques used to supposedly increase THC production . Much of this is little more than hippie folklore , but over the years some techniques have appeared which seem based on some amount of science . <p> Although some of the younger growers these days may never have used a metal halide light , many of the older set still swear by them as a complement to high-pressure sodiums in the flower room . With the advent several years ago of the Son-Agro HPS bulbs and others like it , which offer a higher amount of blue in the spectrum than standard HPS , many growers have felt that that they can do away with metal halides altogether . Growing strictly under sodiums has its advantages in terms of yield per watt , but is still lacking as far as a balanced spectrum when compared to a mix of HPS and halide . <p> Anyone that has ever seen a mixed light garden can testify that the healthiest , most crystallized buds occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the UV factor , as metal halide bulbs emit a fair amount of UV while HPS emit almost none . Most growers employing halides in conjunction with HPS do so at a 2:1 HPS:halide ratio . Many growers , especially those restricted to one light , have been having good success using one of the new enhanced metal halide bulbs such as Sunmaster , which have a more balanced spectrum than either sodium or regular halide alone . <p> Glass and plastic materials used in greenhouses and air/water cooled light reflectors will block most useful wavelengths of UV from reaching plants . Luckily , recent research has shown that allowing UV to enter the greenhouse has many advantages on non-cannabis crops , and so some European greenhouses are beginning to switch to UV transparent glazing materials . Trade names for some of these products are Planilux , Diamant or Optiwhite . Plastic made from polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) also transmits UV-B ( the type that we are looking for ) . Traditional greenhouse coverings such as polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) , fiberglass , polycarbonate or regular glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning ensures that your plant will be at peak THC content , as cannabis has shown THC fluctuations peaking in morning and dropping during the day . Some growers leave their lights off for several days before harvest to increase potency . This seems to have some scientific validity as light has been shown to degrade THC , hence the morning peaks . As light is the degrading factor and the plant still has the ability to manufacture THC during darkness , leaving the lights off for a day or two before harvest likely utilizes the plants stored potential for THC conversion without any opportunity for it to be degraded into cannabinol ( CBN ) and other breakdown products . <p> Your magnifying glass is your friend.Your magnifying glass is your friend.Traditionally marijuana has been harvested when the pistils die and the calyx starts to swell into a false seed pod . These days the best growers are getting much more detailed in their harvesting criteria . They take a close look at the trichomes themselves to judge peak harvest . Evidence that this is the only real way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tundra , which ripens resin glands while most pistils are still alive and white . This seems an odd twist of evolution but proves that the pistil color and ripe glands do not necessarily have any correlation . <p> A small 25x or more pocket microscope , which can be picked up inexpensively at any electronic store , works well for taking a closer look at trichome development . What we are examining are the capitate stalked glandular trichomes , which will be a round gland head supported on a stalk . The coloration of these gland heads can vary between strains and maturity . Most strains start with clear or slightly amber heads which gradually become opaque when THC levels have peaked and are beginning to degrade . Regardless of the initial colour of the resin head , with careful observation you should be able to see a change in coloration as maturity levels off . <p> Some cultivators wait for about half of the heads to go opaque before harvest to ensure maximum THC levels in the bud . Of course nothing tells the truth more than your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what 's right for you . While you may be increasing the total THC level in the bud by allowing half of the glands to go opaque , the bud will also have a larger proportion of THC breakdown products such as CBNs , which is why some people prefer to harvest earlier while most of the heads are still clear . <p> Indica varieties usually have a 1-2 week harvest window to work with , while Sativas and Indica/Sativa hybrids may have a much longer period to play with . <p> Kali Mist : It looks good , but does it have phat trichomes ? photo BargeKali Mist : It looks good , but does it have phat trichomes ? photo BargeGlandular conclusion <p> With the growing popularity of personal hashmaking through precision screening , many growers are starting to pay closer attention to the development of glands .

Excellent choice ! Scrog or SCREEN OF GREEN is one of the most productive and easiest ways to grow indoors . Now let 's not get this confused with the Sea of green method . SOG involves no training nor does it have one item a scrog always has . A screen . Scrog has been around for many years . Before HID 's were introduces many used floro 's with this method with good success . Now let 's talk about the scrog for a little bit here . What is a scrog ? What is screen of green ? Well , it is just that . A screen is the main character of scrog . It is usually made of wire or something sturdy enough to hold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it about 2x2inches in size so that the plant mater can easily grow up through the wire and be supported by it . The wire is secured between the grow medium and the lamp at a distance determined by the size of your lamp . We will get into that later . The plants grow through the screen about 3-4 inches and then are pulled back under and spread out where YOU want them to grow . Its as easy as that folks . Its a great way to grow . Let me put it this way . I have tried untrained methods like SOG and have never come close to the yield I get with a scrog . Okay , sounds easy right ? So , what are you waiting for ? <p> Getting Started This is the hard part . Getting started . Damned if it ai n't for me man . I spend hours thinking of shit before I do it . lol Anyway , this is n't rocket science . If you 've already got an area where you established plants growing you are halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesh great ... 8 notes cheap as chips .. i have used the same screen twice , steam cleaned after harvest . <p> Remember at least 2x2inch squares . You can use chicken wire as well or even some tightly strung rope but I would suggest wire . You need something strong to support the buds and hold back the canopy growth . The screen needs to be cut to size . The size of the screen is determined by the size of your lamp . Remember that to get the good bud formation you want from 50 watts per square foot so your screen size should not exceed that . Check the examples below . <p> 150hps screen size 1.75ft x 1.75ft <p> 250hps screen size 2.25ft x 2.25ft <p> 400hps screen size 2.91ft x 2.75ft <p> 600hps screen size 3.45ft x 3.45ft <p> 1000hps screen size 4.4ft x 4.5ft <p> If your screen exceeds the 50wpsf thing a little . That 's perfectly okay . Just do n't overdo it . lol Now once you 've determined the size of your screen and cut it to size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Just a few screws will hold it in place . Your mounting a screen . Not a twenty pound wall painting . lol ..... Wait just a minute ! You need to figure out where to set the screen . First , a few questions to ask . Is your lamp air cooled and what size is your lamp ? These two questions determine how close you can get to your canopy . This is very important stuff . The closer you get the better off you are . If you do not have air cooled lamps then a simple fan blowing between the canopy and the the lamp should do the trick . Okay , now let 's set that screen . Here 's some examples of screen settings for hps 's . These are not exact settings . They are just a baseline idea . If you can get your lamp closer . Good for you . If you ca n't . That 's okay too . Do n't worry . If you 've got the right watts per footage they will produce . <p> Your Plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule is one plant per square foot of screen . I go with as few plants as I can whenever possible . One side of my flower chamber is almost 3x3ft . That 's almost 9 sqft . I only have 6 plants under there and the screens are pretty full . So , the rule does not always need to be followed . Having less plants can be a good thing if they happen to discover your illegal activity .. lol ..... Remember with fewer plants you will have to veg a bit longer but be patient and hang in there . Its well worth the wait . <p> Spacing Let 's talk about the spacing between the plant medium and the screen . This space will need to be large enough to allow you room to manipulate your plants during the training phase . I usually use around 8 inches . Some people use more/less . Eight seems to be just enough for me but when working in a 3x3ft space it is still a tight space for a big guy . lol ..... <p> What Is The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about your plants a little bit . What kind should you be growing in a scrog you ask ? Hmmmmm . Well , any kind your heart desires my friend . That 's right . Most any plant strain can be grown without much difficulty using a scrog . The secret is in the screen . Some strains require more training than others but that is the only difference . Heavy yield indica 's are excellent scrog candidates but the unruly sativa can really shine with proper training and timing . <p> Hydro or Soil ? <p> So , how are you going to do this scrog ? Is it going to bubble , flow or just sit there ? Here 's some things you may consider before your plants get tangled up in the screen . <p> Hydro : No real problem here . I prefer to scrog with a bubbler system over soil any day . The problem lies in the flush . I explain below . Soil : Soil grows and scrogs are a wonderful thing . Organic buds rule . One problem I ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the grow . Well , with the plants tangled in the screen . One can not just transport to the sink and flush . My soil buckets drain into catch pans . Then I have to drain the catch pans . Takes a while but it works . Hydro is much easier though . <p> Okay man , you just did something that will almost double your yield in the next sixty days . So , how do you feel about that ? The screen is set . Now its time to move on to other things . Let 's take a look at what 's going to happen when these babies start to grow through the screen . <p> Managing the Scrog Grow You have done some things that are a little out of the ordinary from your usual grow regime . Things look a little different . A wire screen has invaded your grow space and it looks weird in there . Maybe you even have a few inches growth through the screen . What in the fuck am I gon na do now ? lol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun begins and were the beauty of scrog growing starts . <p> Vegging : Here is where a lot of people make mistakes . They get in a fired up hurry and get confused somehow . Flip their shit over to 12/12 way to soon and wonder why their screen never filled up . At that point the screen is nothing more than a support system for the plant . Normally one would veg a plant till the screen is 70-80 percent full before switching over to the flowering cycle . Having knowledge of how much your strain stretches is helpful when determining when to switch to flowering . For example : If one had a very stretchy sativa . You would want to start flowering her with much less of the screen filled . Just the opposite for a nice stunted indica . Timing has a lot to do with scrog . We go over that soon . <p> Pulling It Back Through : Okay , so you 've got some growth through the screen . Should have about 3-4 inches aye ? Do n't be a pussy here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do later . Reach under the screen and pull that branch back under the screen and place it where you want it to be . Even if it takes tying it in place with the plastic twisty ties . Now I could really get technical and shit and start with the be sure there is an inter-node in each hole of the screen but it really does n't matter man . Just get the growth under the screen first . In the next few weeks . You will see were to guide the new growth to best suit your needs . <p> Training : This can seem brutal to some . lol ........ Scrog is not natural growth for the cannabis plant . I am sure of that . It must stress the shit out of them the whole cycle of life . Imagine taking a plant that usually grows anywhere from 3-12 feet and making it grow in a space no larger than 2 foot . Training begins in the pulling it back through section . Try to situate your main branches towards the barest parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually be the largest bud in the bunch . Use some kind of uniformity to your laying out of the branches . Crisscross/ zigzag whatever you use . Remember there 's are going to be a lot more branching when flowering kicks in high gear . So allow some room for that as well . Lesser buds that are now exposed to more light are then encouraged to grow upwards toward the screen through some leaf trimming . An often debated subject but one I feel that is useful in the scrog method . <p> Leaf Trimming : Now we need to chat about a touchy subject . Leaf trimming . Like I said above . Scrog ai n't  natural for cannabis . At least I do n't  think it is . Crammed in such a small area with all those leaves . Well , somethings got ta give and its not going to be bud . lol ...... Here 's my rule on trimming . If the leaf is in the way of light for a bud site . Then it needs to be removed . Sometimes I tuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I remove it . Now , when do I do this ? Usually when I do a training session . Right afterwards . This trims away leaves and allows the new sites to get light . You will be surprised at how fast they will respond . Use good judgement when trimming . To much is not a good thing here . Trimming continues into flowering ending during the later stages of flowering . I have found it not to be harmful at all to remove large fan leaves from buds during flowering . If they are blocking light to other bud sites near by . Its all about light penetration and bud sites in a scrog . <p> Timing : Timing is critical when it comes to a scrog grow . You must be paying attention to the progress of your grow in order to know when to induce flowering . Knowing what strain you are dealing with and what the growing characteristics of the plant are is very helpful when it comes to timing . I cant express the importance of having a good clone base for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to early . You will have a lot less of a yield . However , if one was to wait to long . The same can happen as well . An overcrowded canopy is just as much a mess . An out of control scrog is just that . A mess . Not something you want to deal with . Remember , the plants you start to flower are probably going to double in size . Stand back and get a visual picture of that in your head . Ask yourself some questions . If I start flowering now . Can I visualize how big they will get ? Do I have enough vegetative growth to start flowering ? Do I have to much ? Is it time ? Time to start flowering ? Okay , so you 've decided to start . Bravo ! You are going to be amazed at the buds that come out of this grow . lol ....... So , you have turned back the timer to 12/12 and it has been 4 days now . The growth from the stretch is starting to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots back under your screen and put them where you want them to be . A few more days pass . More growth . Now the decision part comes into play . Just how far over the screen do you want your buds to be ? If you stop training them early in the stretch . They will grow a little above the screen ( maybe 3-6inches depending on the strain ) . If you continue training them until they start to top out . They will grow only a little more and most of the bud will form right in the screen . This technique is great for those stretchy sativa 's . However when doing this method keep an eye out for mold and try to have as much air flow between the buds as possible . I have done it both ways and they are both awesome . It may take you a grow or two to get the timing down to where you want it but once you do . I am sure you will be pleased with the results . <p> Clones/Seed Grows : Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few questions . I suggest clones for scrog growing over seed any day of the year . Why ? With clones you usually already know the characteristics of the plant and how it will perform . With seed its usually a guessing game as to which pheno your going to get unless they are true F1 seed . Plus with seed you do n't know the sex yet . Ever tried untangling a male from a screen ? Not something I would suggest doing . lol ...... Anyways , if you grow from seed . Be sure you have cloned the lot and know who your girls are first before going under the screen . This will save you alot of hassle later on . <p> Damage Control : If you move branches around and bend'em . Eventually somethings gon na give . Do n't freakout . Its not the end of the world man ..... lol ... Cannabis is an amazing plant that can recover from a lot of damage naturally without help from humans but in this case ya want to help if ya can . First aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just support her wound and leave her alone . She will take care of it on her own . Unless you break her completely in half she can be saved usually . You can splint the wound or support it with some heavy gauge wire around the stem . If the break is not that bad and the branch can somewhat support itself . Leave it alone . In all cases . A knot will form at the break and most times an explosion of growth will happen above the damaged area . At times even new growth sometimes sprouts from the knuckle formed . <p> Flowering Cycle : Once a few trimmings are done and all is set in place flowering in a scrog is pretty uneventful. lol ...... Good time to start thinning out your undergrowth . I take clones around 20 days 12/12 . If all that I need root . I clean out the undergrowth around day 35 12/12 . Now if I need anymore clones . I can tak'em at this time . All the rest . Its butter making time ........ Oh yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your hard work . <p> Undergrowth : I mentioned it above but thought I should mention it again . The undergrowth is not that big of an issue here . Its an area that should be kept clear of dead leaves and you should also ensure that proper ventilation can get through the canopy via the undergrowth . If it cant . Then thin out some growth . This is an area that is dim and often humid . An open invitation for not so good things to come visiting aye ? Some people have mentioned putting a light down there . Why ? There 's no need for a light down there . There are no buds to be harvested there . Just stems that support the canopy . If one were to put a light there they would just be adding to the congestion of leaves already growing . Not good . It is a good idea to clear out your undergrowth as your scrog takes shape and you have taken the clones that you need for the next grow . Trim all remaining sprouts left on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to crazy here . Leave a little growth . Use some common sense here . Take out the sites you know are not going to make it to maturity . This will help the plant direct more energy towards the larger buds instead of wasting energy on the smaller ones . <p> Ventilation : Here 's an issue that can not be overlooked . Once a scrog has been established it is a leafy sight to behold . Air circulation becomes critical as the buds begin to form and things start to get packed in the box . 24hr air movement is suggested 7 days a week . Better safe than sorry . Mold sucks . <p> Even Canopy : Maybe I should not put it in those words . Your canopy does not have to be perfectly even . Just close . The idea behind this is even light distribution . We are looking for a field of buds here not a forest like in SOG . If a dominate bud is allowed to overtake the canopy . It is defeating the purpose of the scrog . Tame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . You want a somewhat even field of buds to deal with . Not a forest of untamed trees . The even canopy is easy to accomplish if you have been following the steps outlined above . TrickyTip : Occasionally you will have a stretcher that decides that she wants more light than the rest of her friends . This often happens when the branches are competing for light . If one gets out of hand there is a simple solution to taming her back into the fold of the others and possibly giving her a burst of growth . Reach under the screen and find her stem . Half way up her stem start to pull her back through the canopy till she is even with the rest . Now where she is bent . Crush her at the bend with your fingers . Do n't smash it in half . Just crush the stem so as it would not be able to support itself if it were to stand alone . As mentioned above . It will heal with vigor and you have solved your canopy problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used this method twice love it , but i do n't train the plants under the screen , I use flexible pipe cleaners to hook the the stems of the plants to the screen and train the plants across the screen instead of under . so far i have found this easier as your not tucking the pants under the screen just the hook .. so you will not snap any .. <p> but problems came last time as i unhooked the pipe cleaners , to unleash the beast i was having skin head buds as they went mental .. do not unleash the beasts ... <p> This information is for growers using the ScrOG ' ' or Screen of Green ' ' method in mini or micro cabinets under small HPS lights , in the range of 70 to 250 watts . I wo n't spend too much time on 400 , 600 and 1000 watt grows , as that 's outside the scope of my experience . <p> Small HPS lights , alternatives <p> Small HPS lights are perfect for growing cannabis in restricted space conditions , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity of any suitable lamp for cultivation , and produce a spectrum that is favorable for flower growth . The spectrum is not the best for vegetative growth , but that is n't really important to scrog growing , as the vegetative period is so short . Lights as small as 35 watts are available by stripping components from security lights commonly available at discount hardware stores . 250 watt lights can produce as much per foot in scrog conditions as 1000 watt lights in room growing . A single 70 watt light can produce enough for an average pot smoker in a space as small as 1 sq . ft . <p> MH lights are available in small sizes , but they produce less light and more heat than their HPS counterparts , and heat is an important consideration in cabinet-style growing . Some growers like the MH spectrum for vegetative growth , but there is no real vegetative period in most scrog growing . Some believe the MH spectrum produces tighter buds . I tried a 250 MH and found it to be very hot and much weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion bulb has performed better than the MH with the same ballast . <p> Regarding fluorescents , the light to heat ratio is even worse than an MH , and I am not aware of any situation in micro and mini growing where I would favor them over small HPS lights ( see second part for a discussion of small-scale fluorescent scrogs ) . Compact fluorescents have been quite popular on the boards recently , and they look quite bright to the eye , even the 20 watters . But the plants are n't fooled , and the dull yellow glow of the small HPS lamps is manna to cannabis . <p> Note that these lights are quite weak compared to 400 , 600 or 1000 watt lights used in production growing . Intensity means that the light can be farther away from the plant and still be bright enough at the bud surface to produce . Intensity is necessary for tight bud formation . <p> To get the most out of a small HPS light , you must keep the bud sites within the productive range of the bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a 250 watt light , that circle of light extends out about 20 " from the lamp . For a 70 watt light , the maximum distance is apparently around 8 " . A group of tall , skinny plants under such a light would only be properly lit at the very tops of the plants , leaving the bottom parts shaded out and in a low intensity light field , producing small , lightweight buds at best . <p> Ideally you would like all the buds within that magic circle of light intensity , and you would like that sphere of light completely filled with buds . How can that be accomplished ? <p> The scrog method <p> The essential detail of the scrog method is a screen , usually poultry netting , typically suspended between the planting medium and the lamp . The plants grow up to the screen and then are trained ' ' under the screen , resulting in a flat table of plant growth , a field rather than a forest . Because all the buds are growing at the same height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective circle of light from the lamp , maximizing production from the space . It 's really that simple . <p> Before discussing the method in detail , let 's explore the other alternative for small HPS lights , the plantlet sea of green method . <p> Sea of green <p> The plantlet sea of green method was developed to maximize the speed of cannabis growing in limited height situations . In a typical sea of green setup of this type , clones are planted at densities as high as 9 per sq . ft . Within a short time after being established , the lights are switched to a 12 hour dark period . What happens to the planted clone ? <p> The clone could just sit there , stretch a bit under the light regime , and flower , producing a tiny little bud with a couple of seeds . But that rarely , if ever , happens . Instead the clone takes off in a rush of growth , forming a woody main stem and branches . If the plant is suitable for sea of green growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most indica dominated plants stop short enough to be grown using this method . That process is at the heart of the sea of green method , as it results in the smallest possible plant flowering in the quickest possible time . <p> Why does the clone act in this manner ? The actual process is subject to debate . Your author suspects that the clone reads the light switch as fall , and has a mechanism that recognizes that it 's too small to produce seed . So the clone goes into a furious growth mode that stops when the plant reaches a minimum height set within its genetic software , and then flowers . Others argue that the clone 's response is just a variation on the normal stretching process that happens when flowering is forced in any size plant . For purposes of the discussion here , it does n't really matter why the response occurs , just that you can rely on it . <p> The problem with the sea of green method under small HPS lamps is that it produces a number of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . The plants crowd each other out and shade the lower portions , which in any event are too far from the light source . As we discussed above , tall and skinny is not productive under a small light . I grew initially using this method , based on books and magazines that I read before designing my 250 watt system , and it worked well for many years , yielding just over 1 oz. per ft . Not bad , but it can be so much better . <p> Note that in the mid-90 's , the term sea of green ' ' started being applied to much larger plants and grows , even multiple 1000 watt installations over room-sized grow tables , with 3 foot plants spaced at one per foot . It seems the original meaning of the term , the SSSC plantlet method , has been almost forgotten . <p> Basic flat , fast scrog <p> The screen method used by pH relied on a long vegetative period for the plants to cover a large area of screen held close to a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same sort of growth process that occurs in a plantlet method sea of green plant , and is very fast . The screen should be set about 8-12 " above the planting medium , if possible . There are two purposes for that gap . First , you have to get your hands underneath the screen in order to handle the plant shoots and to remove excess growth shaded out under the screen . Second , there needs to be sufficient space for the plant to branch . Branching is essential to scrog . I prefer a space of about 10 " for a 250 watt light , but some growers prefer shorter gaps for smaller lights , as little as 4-6 " . <p> Note that the screen does not have to be absolutely flat , and there are good arguments for dishing the screen to match the curvature of the light field . I do n't radically dish my screen , but I do tie down the middle of the screen to prevent the screen from being pushed up , which would be counter-productive . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1 plant per sq . ft . Experience in using the method with various types of plants may result in more or fewer plants , but 1 per ft. is a good starting point . Note that plant density is much lower than for plantlet-method sea of green . That means fewer clones to manage and fewer plants to be holding in a bust , a factor in sentencing guidelines . <p> Why clones , by the way ? By the time you find out which plants are male and female from seed , it would be impossible to extract the males from the foliage wound into the screen and fill in the gaps with female shoots , without a real mess on your hands . Seed plants also waste several inches of height before a mature stem section is reached from which branching can begin , whereas clones branch right from the medium . Height control is typically a limiting factor in cabinet growing . With female seeds it may be possible to grow a predictable scrog by raising the screen height , making up for the wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . I have no experience in scrog from seed . <p> The clones are established and kicked into vegetative growth . Assuming an 8-12 " gap , just about the time where the growing tips penetrate a few inches above the screen , say at two weeks , the lights are switched to a 12 hour dark period . Ideally a response similar to the sea of green method kicks in as explained above . Instead of stopping and flowering , the plants take off , filling the screen with growth . At a density of 1 plant per ft. , it usually works out that the plants stop and crown off ' ' just as the screen is filled . It 's really magic to see it happen . Note that this timing method is not universal . Different plants may require more vegetative growth , or perhaps even less . My advice is to start by forcing early , because overgrowth creates an unproductive canopy , more salad than buds . <p> The timing is so critical . You must be around during this period to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure all gaps in the screen are filled , one bud site per screen hole with standard poultry netting ( 2 x 3 inch holes ) . I have no position on removing fan leaves in general , but in a small scrog grow , fan leaves would overwhelm the neighboring buds , and normally they are removed . Get a good sharp , clean set of pruning scissors and just leave them with the grow . You 'll need them every couple of days during this period . Note that some growers disagree , so feel free to experiment . I 'm no expert on the matter , but I haul out tubs of leaves and get pretty decent results , I think . <p> Training really is n't difficult . With a limber plant I usually let the shoots grow vertically above the screen and then pull them under by the stem , re-orienting the stem horizontally under the screen to line up bud sites with screen holes . You do n't have to tie anything down , as the upward pressure of the stem will nail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie off stems to the screen during the early phases of screen filling . Here 's what one grower has to say on the subject <p> I swear by twist ties and have a huge stock . They can be found just about anywhere . Purchase ties which are most flexible ( wire with the smallest diameter ) and coated with plastic not paper , as the paper will eventually mold . <p> So why twist tie ? Two reasons when training for in any screen application . <p> When initially induced to 12/12 , the main tip/tips that hit the netting are immediately trained 90 degrees perpendicular to the netting . This allows for the light to concentrate the most productive part of the plant , forcing the most efficient production the plant can dish out . Branches under the netting are allowed some time to reach the light , but less than half will see light because you 're concentrating on efficiency . The most efficient growth will occur where the main stem bends on a 90 degree and beyond , which receives the most light . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant hold the shape desired . Main stem usually around the second week ( give or take ) , and branches will always vary . Branches coming off the main stem parallel to the netting are spread as far from the main stem as possible making for a even canopy , more bud sites per square , and controlling overall height . <p> To a certain extent the buds freeze at a certain point and height/stem length slows . The canopy height is close to being established , but some plants are more vigorous than others and continue stretch beyond the rest of the crop . When bud training the longer colas are controlled by bending and tying down to the screen with twist ties . In extreme cases crushing/crimping is necessary . Moldy buds can be avoided by repositioning buds growing against each other . By using twist ties each bud can be positioned where air flows between each cola allowing efficient light dispersal within the canopy and better air flow . <p> Without ties ? Yield was lower . A few larger colas had to be tied down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing the light to be raised higher , lowering production ( This can be resolved by switching to a more intense bulb ) . Some branches grew buds with LONG stems between the screen and base of the cola to compete with the large colas . Hybrid vigor in some cases , or plants which tend to " stretch " more than others eventually straighten out the 90 degree angle exposing less area of the most efficient portion on the plant and eventually stretches to a point where more stem was exposed to direct light , above the screen than desired . A view from the bottom ( planter to the screen ) showed that efficiency could be improved . ' ' <p> Some plants have brittle stems , and are difficult to train . It is possible to bend a stem by crushing it lightly at the bend . So long as the structures in the plant that carry fluids are n't damaged too much , the shoot will heal and be just fine ( thanks to Uncle Ben for that trick ) . It may also be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future growth will be in several , more slender shoots . I have no experience in training a scrog grow by topping . <p> After the screen is filled all growth under the screen must be clipped off . Shaded growth quickly shrivels and dies , leaving ideal growth mediums for mold . Excess leaves and shoots should be clipped close to the stem , to avoid leaving stumps as mold sites . Robert Clarke recommends pruning away from the stem , but a lot of the standard advice has to be discarded when dealing with the special conditions of a scrog grow . The space under the screen is dark and humid , and you want as little plant material under there as possible . You will haul out buckets of leaves and excess shoots from a scrog grow , but the plants can take it . Clip away . <p> Subsequent pruning is really limited once the plant sets buds and stops growing . Some plants develop large leaves from the buds themselves , and if the leaves shade out neighboring bud sites , I find they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the flowering time in a scrog grow the maintenance level is near zero . <p> If everything goes well , the extra time required for the plants to reach the screen before the flowering period is lengthened by only about two weeks . No additional time is required to fill the screen , because that time is the same used by the sea of green method to add height . The plants end up just as long , but the growth is directed horizontally . Typically a flat scrog grow ends up resembling a tropical forest canopy , with all the buds in a thick carpet extending 8-10 " above the screen . The area underneath the screen contains the tree trunks that support the canopy , like piping connecting the root mat to the canopy . <p> Does it matter how the canopy is created ? Not particularly , in my experience . There does not seem to be a lot of difference between buds that would come from sites lower on side branches from those at the actual tip of the plant . For the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note that the buds grown in a scrog field are each a piece of what would be a vertical cola . Each bud grows up vertically 90 degrees from the stem . You are familiar with how a cola is made up of individual bunches of flowers connected to the stem in an overlapping spiral , producing a structure that looks like a single unit . In scrog , each one of those florets matures into a small bud in their own right , typically 4-8 " tall , about the size of a cigar . They are n't donkey dicks , and you wo n't impress the editors of High Times into featuring your buds in the centerfold , but weight is all we 're interested in , not appearance . As I say , it all looks the same in the bong bowl . <p> How much weight ? I have shown that it is possible to reach over 2 oz. per ft. with a suitable plant and enough light density . 400 watt growers have reported up to 2.4 ounces per foot in a flat scrog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box of screen , I did nearly 2.6 ounces per foot , measured by canopy area . I suspect that 70-75 watts per sq . ft. is about the minimum to reach that kind of production , but I do n't know for sure . Your results may vary , but certainly you will do better using scrog than small-scale sea of green at any light density . As an experienced plantlet-method sea of green grower , I feel comfortable stating that as a fact . <p> Anyone can reach the benchmark production numbers , but you must concentrate on filling the screen quickly and completely . If loose and tall would yield better , then scrog would n't work in the first place . You want the canopy to be low and tight , except on the edges , and one bud per hole . Screen fill density is all important to making weight . <p> What can go wrong with a flat scrog grow ? The worst thing you can do is to allow the plants to grow too long . You would think that excess growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in practice I find it 's difficult to recover from a badly overgrown screen . Plants that grow into and fill the screen seem to put on better bud weight than overgrown plants that are tied down and whacked back to fit . Error on the side of forcing early , learn from what happens and adjust on the next crop . <p> Vegetative fills , FIM and topping <p> The fast , flat method relies on the flowering stretch to fill . It 's the fastest , most reliable method , and the most likely to produce a short and dense canopy . <p> Sometimes it is not possible to use one plant per foot , particulary for grows with feminized seeds , where the grower can not afford room to clone and hold mothers . Some growers believe vegetative fills are beneficial , but I have n't seen the weight reports to prove it . <p> Other growers believe that topping or FIM treatment might be beneficial in producing more branching . I think that might be true for some stiff indica 's that do not branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches under the fast method at one plant per foot . <p> My advice is to stick with the proven method at least the first few times out . Make the benchmark weight , learn what that takes and then you can experiment . For growers who must make fewer plants cover the screen , be cautious and do not let the plant grow too long . Error on the side of short filling the screen the first time , and then adjust accordingly . An overgrown screen is difficult to recover from , particularly in the tight quarters in which a low plant density grow is likely to occur ( no room , no money , usually means a micro grow ) . <p> Interrupted flowering <p> Also known as buddus interruptus ' ' , the procedure is to switch the lights to 24/0 for a day or two about at the end of the fifth week of flowering , when the buds seem to stall out . It should only be done once during the crop , and for no more than two days . The best technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days to observe the effect , and then give it one more day if the buds have n't responded . This is not the same as double budding ' ' , as the plant is never actually kicked into vegetative growth . <p> If the plants react well , you will see tufts of additional flowering parts standing out from the sides of the buds like little towers . Done early enough , these extra parts should finish in time , and they will add extra weight to the crop . This technique can be particularly valuable in scrog , given the large number of smaller buds . <p> A caveat is in order , not all plants respond well . Some do n't react to the light change at all , and a very few may be disturbed into uncontrolled growth from the tops of the buds . You might be concerned with a tendency for male parts to be produced , but I 've been practising this method for a long time , and I 've never seen a hermie ' ' . <p> Bog methods <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dreamt up all sorts of ways to expand production , myself included in the mad scientist crowd . The most common variation is the bog ' ' method . <p> Bog for box of green ' ' . Added to the horizontal screen are vertical screens around the perimeter . Either additional plants are used at the edges , or the scrog field plants are grown longer , but either way , the additional foliage is allowed to grow up the outside of the vertical screen , taking advantage of wasted air space above the field . It also allows plants at the edge of the field to get into the circle of intensity from the bulb . <p> Imagine the light field as a circle sitting tangent to a horizontal line . Imagine your plant as a point on the line outside of the circle . How can the plant get inside the circle ? By going up . You might equate this method to an arena ' ' grow in this regard . An extension on the bog theme is spiral bog , first coined by chthonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add considerable vegetation , which is trained around the box in a laid-down spiral , like this ( but flatter ) : ////// . This method allows all the screen area to be densely filled with bud sites . <p> There are two ways to fill the vertical bog screens , as I mentioned . The first is to use more plants , which are added to the edges of the grow . When the horizontal scrog field plants are forced to flower , the plants on the edge are allowed to grow vertically like sea of green plants , the resulting growth being trained to the vertical screens . If the growth is too tall for the screens , it can be laid down at an angle , like a spiral bog grow . The advantage of this type of bog grow is reliability and speed , since the horizontal field is filled in exactly the same manner as in a normal scrog grow . The disadvantage is that the number of plants is increased to near plantlet-method sea of green levels . <p> The second method is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrog grow , or thereabouts , but to allow them to grow longer before forcing , around another week or two of growth seems to be about right . This process proved to be tricky for me at first , but once I piled up some experience in timing and training , I found the method to be superior . Several growers have been successful at 70 watts . Here 's what chthonic , a pioneer in the method , had to say about his experiences with 70 watt HPS lights : <p> The quickest and most successful approach that I have found to train a bog grow is to lower the horizontal screen to within 6 " of the soil and grow 2 plants per sq . ft. straight up to the vertical training screens . As it 's a box driven by a 70-watt bulb , the height from the horizontal screen to the roof is only 12 " . The plants grow unhindered 18 " from the soil up through a narrow band of the horizontal screen and onto the verticals until they touch the roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiral fashion /// around the vertical training screens . Spiral bog or s/bog . The cabinet is small ; spiral training is the only way to direct the shoots so it just happens ... <p> The spiral training can go one of two ways . The entire plant can be bent over in one direction and trained along with the rest of the plants in a clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion around the vertical training screens . Or the plant can be trained as it naturally branched , trained in opposite directions along the vertical training screens . ' ' <p> Finally , hollow screen forms do not have to be in the shape of square-cornered boxes . I 've seen one grower using small HPS lights who shaped his screen into a deep bowl shape , with the light suspended in the middle . Posts on ADPC describe inverted V shapes , and cylinder forms have sprung up at Cannabis World . A single correct ' ' way to do this probably does n't exist . <p> At this point , these methods are so new that every grow provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrog method is to get a few fast , flat scrog grows under your belt first to get used to the process . But do add the vertical screens regardless , and capture whatever excess growth you can on the verticals , as there is no reason not to handle as much growth as you can . <p> V-scrog <p> The final extension of this concept dispenses with the horizontal screen entirely . I coined the term for the method , v-scrog ' ' , for vertical scrog . Vertical screens extend from the plant medium all the way up to the top of the growing space . The light is not in a reflector at the top of the space , but is suspended vertically in the middle of a tube of foliage , approaching peg 's Rama concept for zero-g cannabis growing . Note that the entire light field is used , not just from the bottom half of the lamp and what comes off the reflector . The foliage area is stunning . Imagine a 2 x 2 cabinet with a v-scrog screen held 4 " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for maintenance . Suppose the buds fill up about 3 ' of the vertical screen . We 're talking 4 screens , each 4 ' in area ( 16 " x 36 " ) . Take off a couple of inches for corner overlap and a gap in the front for access , and that 's nearly 14 sq . ft. of screen in the same space that supports 4 ' of flat screen . Even if the production per foot were half , and it would be less due to the loss of the 3D flat scrog field , you 're still talking 3 + ounces per foot ! <p> Can that really be possible ? Not so far . I have grown two v-scrog 's that were mostly failures , but I have modified the growing space to correct the problems and I will continue testing sometime in the future . The problems so far involve the time needed to fill the screen area , which could reduce the production over time substantially , and the ability to handle the moisture load produced by the massive amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented trainer , but chthonic , Ultimate , Eugene and others have done very well in tiny vertical box forms with 70 watt lamps . <p> Even if production is n't dramatically better than horizontal methods , v-scrog is a promising solution to growing in very restricted height conditions . It might be possible to grow a productive crop with 150 and 250 watt lamps in as little as 2 ' , maybe less . Since the light-to-foliage gap is horizontal , the only absolute vertical needs are for the plant container and a gap between the end of the downward-pointing bulb and the planting medium . Plant growth could be controlled by training it across the vertical screen , which could be any reasonable height . <p> First-time growers , fluorescent lights <p> Scrog is not a difficult method to use , and new growers should not hesitate to try it . In fact , because most new growers are using small lights , often fluorescents , getting a reasonable harvest almost requires scrog , or a similar method such as paper-clip training or FIM ( look it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easier and quicker . FIM is probably a better method for larger lights , 400 and up , where the height of the bud wand can be handled <p> A good first choice would be a 70 HPS lamp or two in a space about 1-3 square foot , using soil or DWC . The cost of the materials needed is minimal , and the output from 70 HPS lamps is proven . You can expect to get 1-2 ounces per foot , and in presentable buds . <p> If fluorescents must be used , avoid compact bulbs and stick with tubes . As mentioned above , scrog as envisioned by pH was designed to be used with fluorescent tubes , stacking multiple grows in a single space to make up for the lower production . The design keeps the canopy flat and a few inches away from the surface of the bulb . Compact fluorescents tend to wrap the tube surface inside themselves , making the light from those surfaces available only by reflection . Further , by being compact they act as a point source without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube grow could be accomplished in a space as small as 2 ' square , to accomodate a series of tubes , or a footlocker-type space , maybe the bottom of a closet , to take 4 ' tubes . It would be wise in either case to mount the ballasts outside the growing space to help with heat . <p> Getting the most from a fluorescent grow requires keeping the canopy tight and close to the tubes . Use one plant per foot , an 8-12 " screen gap and force when the plants hit the screen , which will produce the fastest and most predictable screen fill , and will tend to keep the canopy in check . Using vegetative growth to fill the screen is an advanced technique , and I would avoid it unless you are restricted to a fewer number of plants by circumstances . <p> There are several myths floating around the boards about fluorescents vs . HPS lamps . It is often said that HPS lamps are expensive , but it is n't really so . Security lights containing HPS bulbs and ballasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballasts are available from online sources at very reasonable prices . <p> It is often said that HPS lamps are hotter than fluorescents , but that too is a myth . Fluorescent lamps , aside from corporate b.s. by Lights of America , are less efficient than small HPS lamps , and therefore produce more heat per watt . To say an HPS lamp is hotter in the context of growing is to say a burning match is hotter than a radiator ; it 's true , but which will heat a room ? A fluorescent spreads the heat over a larger area and therefore feels less hot to the hand . HPS and fluorescent tubes have an advantage in separate ballasts that can mounted outside the growing space . Compact electronic ballast fluorescents are more efficient than magnetic ballast tubes , but all of the heat they produce is confined in the growing space . <p> If you must use fluorescents , be realistic and do n't expect to be bowled over by the buds . Depending on the plant they will either be light and feathery , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harder buds with fluorescents , but only by stacking up a wasteful amount of wattage on a very few bud sites . If you would like to compare some fluorescent and small HPS grows by wattage , there is a link below that will lead you to a post that compiles the best near-harvest pictures on a non-judgemental basis . People get very heated on this board pro and con regarding fluorescents ( guilty ) , so look and make your own decision based on real grows . <p> Scrog growing works best with clones , but that requires a mother area which may not be possible for a new grower . Feminized seeds from Dutch Passion should work as well , though I would provide a couple more inches of screen gap to allow for the portion of the seed plant stem that will not produce branches . Branching is fundamental to scrog . <p> If it is not possible to produce clones or to acquire feminized seeds , then I would not use scrog . An alternate method would be to grow each seed in separate soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training or FIM to control height . When the males show , they can be removed from the growing area , and the remaining females re-arranged to best suit the light source . Using a plantlet method pretty much requires an HPS lamp to get decent production , as much of the growing surface will be vertical . Fluorescent tube lamps lack intensity , as they spread their light over a large area , and compact fluorescents simply lack enough punch to act as point-source lights . Use a small HPS lamp and keep the plants trained low and flat as possible , and you should yield at least an ounce per foot . <p> Basic design elements <p> There are essentially two classes of HPS lamps when it comes to scrog growing , the small security light ' ' types , in the 50-100 range , and larger lamps in the 150-250-400 range . The best way to plan your own design is to see what others are doing . Exercise the search engine and look for scrog grows with similar-sized areas and lamps , analyze their results and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held quite close to the canopy , as the effective range in which they will produce tight buds is limited . A 70 HPS has a range of about 8 " , for example . That means the distance from the screen to the light should be only an inch or two outside the range , to allow for some vertical stretch , and the distance from the lamp to the edge of the space has to be computed keeping in mind that the light is traveling on the longer diagonal out and down to the canopy . Using the standard of 50 HPS watts per square foot of canopy will produce good results , but I would shoot for more like 70-75 , meaning that a 70 would be perfect for a square foot of screen . If you wished to grow with two or more 70-100 HPS lamps , the lights should be distributed over the canopy , not bunched together . <p> The 50-70 watts per square foot rule applies to the larger lights as well , but as power increases the limit is more negotiable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 400 watt lamp has a lot of power directly underneath it . Asking a 400 watt lamp to light an 8 square foot area means skirting the lower limit of the lamp power , but for the areas close to the lamp the intensity is far greater . By keeping the canopy directly under the lamp short , and by allowing the growth on the fringes to get taller , one can leverage the power of the 400 to a larger space . 400 watt lamps are therefore an excellent match with an arena , or bog type of grow . It is also possible , but not confirmed , that 400 HPS lamps could produce better with a supercropping type method , like FIM , instead of scrog . It 's probably a close thing , and maybe a mixture of a horizontal scrog canopy under the lamp and FIM-type plants around the edges would be superior , a true arena ' ' grow . <p> The 150 and 250 watt lamps do n't have that kind of power , and the canopy must be kept relatively close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it can tighten up buds , and therefore a 2 ' x 2 ' space is about as far as you can push the lamp and keep the production per foot up . Because the area under the lamp is relatively small , using a bog or arena type of grow becomes more difficult , as the most productive area , the horizontal field , becomes pinched down . These lamps are probably better used with a basic flat scrog , although there is no reason not to allow some growth on the vertical walls if it can be arranged within the space . Certainly , in any flat scrog grow , you have nothing to lose by letting the very outside row of buds grow tall , even to the extent of using additional plants to get that result . I see a lot of flat scrog grows where the growth thins out on the edges with bare walls surrounding the bulb . Error on the side of higher plant densities , and use the outside space to your advantage . <p> Note that while the smaller security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a larger lamp 's light field they can be useful as supplements to balance out a light field and to add some punch . For example , in a 2'x 2 ' cabinet , a 70 HPS added to the empty end of a 250 HPS hood would provide a combination of 80 HPS watts per foot , and would illuminate the overall space more evenly . If you are inclined to try a small MH light , perhaps you could add both light and some spectrum balance . I 've also seen compact and tube fluorescents added as supplements , but that 's like lighting a candle in sunlight ; not much help , unless some extra heat is needed . If you 're adding watts , make them count . <p> Height is often a restrictive element when designing a cabinet grow , particularly if mother and cloning space is needed in the same space . An unshielded ( open bulb ) 250 grow is perfectly suited to a space 2 ' x 2 ' x 4 ' . But by using a horizontal shield of tempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat from the lamp can be confined and controlled , and up to a foot of space can be recovered by tightening up all the other elements as much as possible . Lexan or plexiglass sheets are available at discount hardware stores , can be cut with normal tools ( sawed , or scored and snapped ) , and are modestly priced . Designing such a grow means using an extra fan to cool each compartment space , or providing for airflow from the growing area through the barrier . <p> Designing a cabinet in terms of the vertical space needed is best done by working backwards . Start with the known dimensions of the basic elements , the height of the plant container , the medium to screen gap and the thickness of the lamp/hood assembly . That leaves the growing space above the screen , which is somewhat negotiable . If you keep your canopy low and tight , using the flowering stretch to fill the screen in the classic fast , flat scrog fashion , none of the buds will get much bigger than 8-10 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap between the top of the buds and the lamp for two reasons . First , obviously , the whole canopy must see the lamp . Second , the tops of the buds ca n't be fried by the lamp . Even with shielding some gap is necessary , as the tops of some varieties react badly to being in close proximity to an intense light source , producing thick stem growth that erupts from the bud tops . <p> Cooling and airflow are the final design element . Even with shielding there must be adequate airflow through the canopy to avoid mold , and to carry off the moisture load created by the plants . A 4 ' canopy under a 250 HPS will pull about a half gallon per day through the leaves , and that water has to be removed , regardless of the temperature . With the smaller HPS lamps probably muffin ' ' type axial fans are sufficient , available at many hardware stores . <p> Larger setups require more fan power , say about .5 to 1 CFM per HPS watt as a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirrel cage ' ' type blower , available from the same sources . Grainger has a nice selection at reasonable prices , with several different configurations to match the requirements of cabinet growing . Usually room has to be made available in the cabinet for the hardware , so look for designs that are compact and easy to mount in a given space . <p> Usually the fan is mounted to blow the air out , sucking it up through the canopy from an inlet into the box . It would be better in theory for the fan to blow into the confined space , to produce an over-pressure rather than a partal vacuum . But it 's easier to light-proof a space with the fan power sucking the door against the seals than to be fighting air pressure . <p> Fans for smaller grows can simply be controlled by the light timer , always on when the lights are burning . Larger grows with squirrel cage fans need to be controlled by a line thermostat . I would avoid the cheapo hardware store models and go with something decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air inlets , you may find humidity is the problem rather than temperature . In that case a line humidistat or a thermostat and humidistat in parallel might provide the best control . <p> Fresh or room air inlets should be a match with the space and the airflow . A general guide is to provide about .03-.05 square inch of inflow space per HPS watt . For example , a 3 " circular plastic tube inlet would be a minimum requirement for a 250 HPS grow . Air inlets and outlets need to be arranged to avoid light leaks into the growing space . Turning the air duct 90 degrees and avoiding reflections with flat-black paint inside the duct is sufficient . For example , a ABS plastic plumbing elbow seems to be popular these days . <p> The prototypical scrog screen is poultry netting , which consists of 2 " x 3 " irregular hexagons , about 24 per foot . Poultry netting seems to space out the buds just right , in my experience . I see other growers using various types of square plastic netting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire or fishing line . If you use square holes , I would tend to size them at about 2 1/2 " or a little less , but in no case would I go smaller than 2 " . Poultry netting costs nothing , but it does have the disadvantage of cut wire ends around the edges which always seem to be diabolically placed to slice up your hands and arms . Whatever you use , remember it does n't have to be very sturdy . Do n't steal growing space with wide wood pieces around the edges . Use something like a thin dowel , or stiff heavy-gauge wire to secure the screen . 10985 @qwx420985

So i 'd think caffeine is actually more dangerous than cannabis . <p> Yeah if all of these drugs were properly tested cannabis would come out on top every time , not just for being least harmful but also for being most beneficial when it comes to medicating people ( ie insomnia , chronic pains , MS , cancer , AIDS , muscular spasms and even arthiritus and depression ) <p> Let 's not get silly again people , cannabis should NEVER make it onto a list of ' dangerous ' or even socialy harming drugs NEVER , it does n't harm the user ( if vaped or eaten ) and helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway <p> If you want a really dangerous drug , then what about Bromo-Dragonfly . Its RC ( research chemical , technical legal as not yet made illegal ) that is taking in a dose of 200-800g ( around the strength of LSD ) which is less than 1mg ( 1000mg = 1g ) . Takes up to 6 hours to set it ( making overdosing potentially easier if you person taking it does n't understand this or sold as something else , such as 2C-E ( dose 8-25mg ) which happened in USA in 2011 which lead to two deaths ) and can leave you high for 2-3 days . <p> Oh yea it lethal when you overdose and lies is a real grey area of many countries drug laws ( due to being an RC ) . <p> Now that 's an example of a really dangerous drug , when you compare all that to cannabis you can hardly believe weed is illegal ! I believe making cannabis legal would decrease the amount of people taking RCs which would be a real plus . 10985 @qwx420985

What exactly is going on ? <p> I know all about trichs and that as I have done a huge amount of reading but there does n't seem to be much information about whether you should just harvest your developed bud and trim off the long white pistils ( which technically are its second set of pistils as the first set obviously formed to make the original buds ) or whether the effects of waiting longer would actually make extra bud mass connected to the already present buds . <p> hey goodbuddy a nice morning to you too my plant is a random seed in some weed I bought but I can tell it is definitely a sativa/sativa dominant ! There are lots of little buds and the pistils are orange and they look good to harvest ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no scope yet ) however huge straight white pistils have shot out of the buds almost as if they 're going to form extensions .

Adjusting ph before feeding in coco will result in feeding at the ph you set , this is not the same as adjusting the feed ph in soil as the buffer will return it to the ph set by the supplier . <p> Big Thanks everyone and for this post ! ! I think with many growers ( especially noobs like and inc myself ) this is probably a very important overlooked point ! ! when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffer for difficult strains ! ! <p> Thanks again chaps ... another notch on the graph of that big old learning curve ! <p> " Choice is an illusion , created between those with power , and those without " The Merovingian <p> i think some do n't  get how food ph and buffering means . lime will not set your ph it helps slow the shirt . that 's what buffer means . some seem to think it means no need to ph as the lime will fix it .... wrong your not feeding or watering it right if your ph is that hi above what you fed and watered with . run off should always be as close to what went in. if your not treating the medium right is n't any lime going to fix it . lime is n't to fix your food problems . its to set the final ph of the medium when we add multiple items to it . each item within the soil we buy has diff ph values . so once its all made they need to adjust it to suit our gardening needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think feeding at 7 pH and the lime will shift it to what it realy needs then you 'll never get full potential of the plant , it dosent work that way <p> need to be feeding and watering at 6.3 if its soil . could be why your deff. once ellement is to much and is blocking the others due to wrong pH and the run off rising .. it should n't be above what you feed <p> hi guys . i 'm just getting my head round ph , buffers in soil etc etc myself and now after reading good ol wert 's post all has become more clear . so i 'd like to thank wert for that and all who have put some info in on this . so i am thinking how best to find out what my soil ph is ? as i mixed several types together . <p> so i am thinking ( unless you have a handy sign on the bag lol ) to find the ph to adjust your feeds to can i just take enough water to give me a run off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say 7.3 then it is a good assumption to think the soil has buffered it up by 0-5. so , as above adjust feed to 6.1 because the soil will buff it up to 6.6 for you . i was just trying to figure out a way of figuring out how much the soil producers buffer goes up/down and here it was , as quick as that , the answer .... this site is the dogs man **30;1381;TOOLONG <p> that 's not how pH works . it moves the pH different each time depending how bad you where out . but it is n't a save all . buffer means slows the movements. , not stops them or moves them to a certain amount . all our bag soil new is about 6.6 to 6.8 or so . watering to much to often will throw out he pH also so has nothing to do with what some are thinking here . you feed pH at the medium you are in and to what food ellements you need . you do n't  move the pH to adjust the mediums run of ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That is not how i understand it to work.but correct me if i am wrong . Soil is phd when mixed to specific ranges for different plants.some berries like acidic soil and some lilacs like alkaline soil.if it were just a matter of adjusting your feed why would different soils be available ? The buffer in soil is slow release and breaks down with every watering , the amount added is tested to see how much is needed to balance with the natural ph of the compost mix . It is not easily leached out of the compost mix but will become less effective over time . If you water a plant that thrives on ph 6.5 in compost of ph 9 with water of ph 4 it will not be ok . <p> most soils are set close to 7 nutral pH new . some specific mixes are adjusted to suit plant needs . 99.999999% of the ones on the market are as i said above as most plants like that . there are many different soils for lots of different reasons but non i know because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . when some say its for a certain plant or berry its more that the food ratios in them are to the plants needs . <p> Most soils on the market are neutral8sh ph because this is an acceptable ph for most plants . Liming agents that keep a steady ph are not necessarily lime , wood ash and ground shells are also used to buffer the ph in soil , Sulphur is used to raise the ph for a more acidic soil . When all the buffer has been broken down and either used up or washed out over time the ph balance of your soil may be very different as nature takes over and the ph is changed by the fresh or older dead veg matter decomposing . That is why liming agents are put in to counter the fluctuation in your mix and keep the ph stable . If the feed effects the ph of my soil so dramatically why cant I feed my plants at low hydro levels of ph in soil ? <p> soil and hydro are 2 diff worlds . no CEC in hydro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most plant type fall within a close range and we dial it in tighter according to specific strains also . <p> your statement there is correct to how and what lime or other buffers do , but some confuse the term buffer and think its a fix it all .. its not . it will help hold stable pH but wo n't if we do n't  use right pH for foods and water . then your messing with how the medium works with its food to supply the plant <p> if you run within those limits then we are supplying all elements within our nute bottle at a good equal amount . if we do n't  use right pH to have an over all good balance of all elements in the bottle then one will be in a more abundant supply and supreses availability of other elements and we can show deffs and burns . some say its fine to let the pH drift all over , especialy hydro guys . but its not a good way . you do n't  want lots of nitro one day then next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even equal ballance of all elements . the elements in a bottle are set to work at certain pH numbers from the manufacturer and if you do n't  run them as we make them then you are wasting food and not proving the plant with everything it needs as it needs it to grow a plant to its full potential i run in soiless so i like 6.3 in veg then i lower in bloom as i need more p/k available to 5.8 to 6. i always try to set my pH within .2 of the same number each time . understanding how pH effects food uptake or availabilit5y let 's me save alot on foods and fix alot of deffs with just adjusting my pH slightly <p> i know many soil growers that never ph their feed and grow excellent plants , percy grower is a forum member that springs to mind . i never ph my feed/water and have found if the water from your tap is so bad as to effect your grow a simple ph'ing of it will not be a solution . if the water supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

I wanted to try and do things with as little nutrients as possible . From the last feed on the 18/12/16 I started to notice problems which did n't  go away . The leaves started yellowing alot more than I assumed when I first noticed a few weeks earlier that 's why I started feeding them the biogrow . Leaves had the mosiac patterns the leaves became brittle , leaves were yellowing and many had brown spots on . However with all the isssues the leaves were not falling of the plants . <p> I assumed at the time due to the yellowing I had that it was due to too much biogrow I gave it as I went from 0.5ml per litre to 1.5ml per litre , could that be the reason why I noticed such problems ? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days the problems mutilplied . <p> This is then when I either made a brilliant diagnosis or a total fuck up .

I know its 3 times the size you flush but its in my attic so not easy to flush properly . <p> SO .... <p> Week 4 ( End of week ) 6 litres water per plant no nutrients Week 5 6 litres water per plant no nutrients <p> The intial reason why I was vegging so long was because I wanted to get the 8 colas so topped etc a number of times so off course that would add a week or so easily to get back on its feet hahaha .... then with all the problems i got myself into made me keep wanting to extend the vegging time as i did n't  want to go into flower with the issues I was having . I have to mention at this time i also had noticed purple stems/petiotoles it may have been like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse pretty quickly . <p> The issues although bad still were improving a little bit . I only have a limited time before i run out of time to do a second grow cos my roof gets way to hot in the summer , I learnt about bud root then , until you have it you wo n't know that horrible feeling seeing it and ripping chunks of buds off . <p> I decided i would put it into flower and hope the change in nutrient requiremnts would help the problem go away . <p> Day 1 Flower 23rd January ........... <p> On the same day I went upto my grow shop and explained the issues i had which I have mentioned as the problems were stressing my head out . They advised me that I needed to use calmag and nitrozyme and foilar spray them too . <p> Things started improving all started greening up nicely and new growth was green . <p> Week 2 Biogrow 0.9ml/ biobloom 1.6ml per litre / calmag 0.9ml per litre ( I did not want to overdo nitrogen ) Week 3 ONLY water as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants made me think nute burn so only gave it water that was on the 8th Febuary <p> All of the above are all on of my plants . One of the critcal kush has some brown spots , very yellow leafs but newer at the top is more healthy , it has also streched a great deal . The stems etc are purple too however in last few days the new vertical growth at the tops of the cola stems are green so that is good news but the rest is very purple haha ... <p> Another critical kush has light green leafs mainly at the top and with the new growth all down cola stems having a good healthy green colour but yellow tips , again on all stems , petioles , leaf viens are purple . <p> The 3rd critical kush is a lovely colour compared to how it was a 2-3 weeks ago but still a slighty light green .. HOWEVER only some of the new growth has yellowing tips but other leaves leaf tips curling up and burnt looking/dead leaf tips . <p> The 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow tips and both have purple stems etc , older leafs yellowing/ fan leafs . <p> In regards to budding they are coming along fine considering all that has been happening . <p> I brought a PH pen the other day , I did a reading of the tapwater i use and it read 7.6PH , I know ideal it should be 5.5-6.5 . The last few days I have researched a great deal about PH in soil , nutrient absorbotion when PH is not correct ... mobile immobile nutrients etc but I have also read that i shouldnt try and adjust ph in soil as it can cause more problems . <p> The problem is that all these defiencies look so similiar it drives me crazy , the hours I have spent researching this is crazy , this message has taken me hours but nothing in comparision into all the searching i have done and the joints i have had to roll . <p> So I think it has to be one of the following **28;1413;TOOLONG or phosphorous defiency due to the purple stems etc . I just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to screw things up even more than it already is .

As long as I work out what I am doing wrong as I need to get one more done and that needs to start as soon as these ones are harvested or just dead . <p> 1st time I grew I did not give them any biobloom once in flower , i also overwatered massivley to the point saturation drowning every day . I got a few months smoke out of it . <p> 2nd Grow I moved box up into attic . It was a month into harvest , I had 6 Northern lights the buds got long and chunky , i topped them once .

@@46022204 @6022204/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> What 's the real point of germination ? <p> I do n't really understand the point of germinating . Every seed I 've ever planted never got germinated and it grew fine . I suppose if your going to spend a few bills on good seeds you do n't want to take the chance but is there any actual benifits to germinating your seeds ? <p> Germination is what happens to EVERY seed that grows . If it does n't germinate it does n't grow , end of . Its a basic principle of ' nature ' for better word . Please have a look at google or wikipedia and put your hard hat on quick <p> Paper towel , compost , rock wool , riot cubes are all diferent technique to get your seeds to germinate , its all the same thing dude . <p> Ok ya , I understand that mang . But I 've always just poked a hole in the soil with my finger and just dropped the seeds in there ' dry ' , coverd em up then water like normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering is what 's the benefits to using one of those methods . Is it just to guarantee a plant will grow ? <h> The Following User Says Thank You to Infamous For This Useful Post : <p> It 's not the Q it 's what was asked .. I no longer user paper towels I , pot my soil on the oven at 300F for an hour , let cool and pot and plant my beans I find my seedlings do better that way then any other way as the paper towel to easy to contaminate the seedling and kill it . <p> Germing a seed via the paper towel method vs the direct-to-soil method has very clear advantages &amp; disadvantages .. and you as a grower have to decide which is best for you in your specific groom . Which way we do it depends on a few factors but none so as important as whether or not we 're growing autos or photoperiod stains . <p> Why ? <p> Because autos do not like any form of stress at all , as they have a limited amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SO .. any stress on an auto , and this can mean something like handling it from paper towel to soil .. can harm its growth seriously and cost yield . <p> Does the PT method have some sort of magical effect that water in the soil does n't have ? <p> No . <p> In fact it ADDS risk to seeds and INCREASES the chances of them not germing . That 's a scientific fact . That 's because all the fiddling and handling we have to do adds stress , risk f disease , risk of transferring acid to the taproot . The second your finger 's acids meet the taproot it can wipe out its basic bacteria that are vital for it to grow , and we then either see no germination or a seed that dies shortly after we plant it in soil , it 's probably because its taproot was burned by our fingers while it was in and out of the paper towel . Then we start a thread here asking why our seedling dies the moment we put it into soil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel and that 's a major stress for it . <p> None of this happens in nature ( germing in soil ) .. yet humans like to think we know better and we love even more doing something that can be scientifcally proven to be faulty , just because " it 's worked for me " . I do that , too . Because I 'm human . I just do n't do it with seeds anymore after I educated myself properly on them . <p> My personal advice is go direct to soil as its a far , far more reliable and safer way to germ ya seeds . So long as you have moisture and temps of 25c or above a seed ( if it 's viable ) will germinate and come through the soil . <p> Why add an extra layer of risk to a grow and give yourself another thing to go wrong ? Do n't allow fear of a seed not germing be the reason that you harm it in a paper towel . <p> In summary , why do people use the paper towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace of mind &amp; an ability to physically see that our expensive seeds have popped . That 's all . But it 's a false economy because it 's only our mind that is eased .. not the seedling 's life . <p> Very well put Tabba , I 've never used the PT method cos I 've got big hands , carpel tunnel syndrome and poor eyesight lol . Plenty people swear by it so it obviously works for them . <p> Originally Posted by Infamous <p> I do n't really understand the point of germinating .

Welcome to the forum <p> Cheers mate and err .. yeah .. not the ideal combination to be handling delicate seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . <p> Same here . I 've had 100% success rate using PT but there were a few times where the root wound around the towel . Other than that no probs with the germing aspect itself . Just issues with stunted growth and entangled taptroots . <p> Oh yeah .. then there 's the issue of the root not knowing which way to grow because its sense of gravity is out of whack . Forgot about that one . <p> I ca n't really be trusted with handling seedlings either as I always seem to drop them in the hole the wrong way or touch the roots by mistake . 10985 @qwx420985

@@46022208 @6022208/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Roots coming out of my pots ? <p> ive been doing my first grow for 29 days now , i 'm growing in soil with 10litre pots which ive drilled with a series of holes , the thing is roots are starting to come out of the bottom of the pots , what should i do cut them or leave them alone , thanks for any advice . <p> Maybe should have started with a smaller pot , the roots grow straight straight downwards so I would imagine there 's still room left for the roots to grow and fill out the pot . Roots will pop out the holes but do n't usually grow much out of the holes as there is nothing there for them I presume . I 'd leave them mate , What you growing anyways ? <p> I beleive you can also use a couple of drops of Hydrogen Peroxide per litre of water to help prevent / treat root rot . <p> I usually add a couple of cap fulls to my " res " when I fill it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big bin full of water I leave in the room to sit to climatise and dechlorinate for a day or so before I water as I grow with soil not hyrdo . <p> Also I 've got a coupe of pots with roots showing myself , but since roots do not like the light , they will either recoil and grow back in or towards a dark place , or they will slow down growth at those particular roots I beleive . <p> Nothing to worry about anyway . <p> Also remember to allow your plants a drying out period between waterings . Not to the point the soil is mega crispy , but till it 's thirsty . A good trick is to carefully stick your " pointer " finger into the soil ( not near the main stem ) till it 's about half way in ( to the first main knuckle ) . If it 's dry where the end of your finger tip , then it 's watering time . <p> This allows for gas exchanges in the soil , so I am told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into thier flowering pots from rooted clone . The reason for this is that I want to encourage root growth to fill the oversized pots I deliberately chose on the understanding the more root space the better and the more roots the better and by underwatering and leaving drying out periods , this enocurages the roots to grow in search of moisture and food . <p> Flowering from clone , I chose 11 litre pots which are approx 5 litres more than the general size pots used for the same task . By deliberately overpotting , I 've hoped for a large healty root system which seems to be the case as my girls seem to have no complaints . <p> Your plants sound like healthy vigorous growers if you 're using 10 litre pots and you are 29 days in to the grow with roots trying to bust out of your pots already 10985 @qwx420985

@@46022214 @6022214/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Potassium ( K ) <p> Potassium plays a big role as well . Having good amounts of potassium in your plants helps in having sturdy and thick stems , disease-resistance , water respiration , as well aids in photosynthesis . Potassium is also found in the whole plant . It is necessary for all activities having to do with water transportation . Potassium is necessary for all stages of growth , especially important in the development of Buds . <p> Having to little of Potassium in your plants causes the plants leaves to show retarded growth and show a scorched tip and edges around the leaves . Plants may stretch and your branches can be easily broken or weak . Do n't  get this deficiency confused with iron , because it almost acts like iron but to tell the difference in the two is : for potassium the tips of the leaves curl and the edges burn and die . Older leaves may show a red color and leaves could curl upwards . Dead patches ( Necrosis ) can happen on the margins of larger fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn brown . The Older leaves will show different patches of color ( mottle ) and turn yellow between the veins , following by whole leaves that turn dark yellow and die . The plants overall growth slows down , mostly when they are in vegetative stage . To little amount of potassium also slows the growth of buds during flowering stages . Dark edges will appear around the edges of the leaf when the deficiency is starting to happen . When your Relative humidity is low , you can almost bet your going to soon get a potassium deficiency from your plants perspiration . Potassium can get poorly absorbed when having too much Calcium or ammonium nitrogen , and maybe cold weather . Having to much sodium ( Na ) causes potassium to be displaced . SO keep those in mind Parts affected by a Potassium Deficiency are : older leaves and leaf margins . <p> When you have too much Potassium in your soil , it can lead to big troubles , like salt damage and acid fixation of the root system , as well as too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show like a light to a dark yellow to whitish color in between the veins . Due to a molecular imbalance , potassium toxicity can cause a reduced uptake and lead to the deficiencies of Mg , and in some cases , Ca . Also leads to the other nutrients to not be absorbed properly leading to lots of other deficiency such as : magnesium , manganese , zinc and iron and can cause problems with calcium as well . <p> Problems with Potassium being locked out by PH troubles Soils with excessive Leeching and High ph soils and or water.Soils that are potassium fixated . An excess of kitchen salts ( sodium ) in the root system/enviroment . <p> Soil <p> Potassium gets locked out of soil growing at ph levels of 4.0-5.5 Potassium is absorbed best in soil at a ph level of 6.0-9.5 . ( Wouldnt recommend having a ph of over 7.0 in soil ) anything out of the ranges listed will contribute to a Potassium deficiency . <p> Hydro and Soil less Mediums <p> Potassium gets locked out of Hydro and Soil less Mediums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed best in Hydro and Soil less Mediums at ph levels of 4.7-5.3 listed will contribute to a potassium deficiency . <p> Solution to fixing a Potassium deficiency Any Chemical/Organic nutrients that have potassium in them will fix a potassium deficiency . Again Peters All Purpose plant food 20-20-20 , will cure the potassium deficiency , Miracle grow Tomato plant food , Miracle grow All purpose plant food . ( Only mixing at + strength when using chemical nutrients , or it will cause nutrient burn ! ) Some other supplements of potassium are : Wood ashes , which are fast absorption , Kelp Meal , which is medium absorption , Greensand , which is slow absorption , granite dust , which is slow absorption . Sulfate of Potash , Sulfate of Potash Magnesia , Muriate of Potash , which are medium absorption . FOXFARM GROW BIG HYDROPONIC CONCENTRATE , which is fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ) Earth Juice Meta-K , which is fast acting .

You need to use 3 times as much water as the size of the pot , for example : If you have a 5 ltr pot and need to flush it , you will need to use 15 ltr 's of water to rinse out the soil good enough to get rid of excessive nutrients ( salt build up ) . <p> Hi .

Op i started to remove the fan leafs last week and iv seen a big improvment in the lower bud sites the choice is yours mate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe cut one plants leafs to see for your self and leave the others alone just a idea . <p> Botany lesson time . Do you know how plants work ? Have you every heard of a process called photosynthesis ? Ok , here we go . ALL plants grow by a process called photosynthesis . They take CO2 , water , nutrients and most importantly light and turn them into sugars which are used to build plant cells . These cells can be flowers , stems or leaves . Miss out any 1 of the elements mentioned and the process can not take place . So what I hear the moaners say . The WHAT is , this process ONLY TAKES PLACE WITHIN THE LEAVES So cut off a leaf and you cut off the part of the plant responsible for making it grow ! ! ! Its like chopping a runners leg off or a boxers arm or a whores f*&amp;&amp;y . They are useless without it . <p> So , you want more light to get to the lower buds ? Bend over the branches and bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off . And Spot , have you experimented with clones removing fan leaves from some and not the others in side by side testing ? Unless you have you can not say " Not seen it hinder my girls yet " . I have done the testing and believe me , if you had , you would not have said that !

Lots of new growers make this mistake , thinking " only 2 weeks left , what harm can it do " . Well , I often see a doubling in cola size in the last 2 weeks of flower .

Good luck &amp; hope they all end up nice n fat 4 u &amp; hubby . W <p> yes woody i have i have bent fan leafs over on one of the girls and chopped the others fan leafs , we are talking about a few leafs here not every single leaf . With my trial on this to see what was best i fount the plant that i chopped the leafs of did better than the one where i bent the leafs over they ended up dropping the leafs that got bent at a later date not long after i bent them due to no light getting to them etc . Also would like to add the op is saying he is happy with the top buds and would like the bottom ones to get bigger and he is in the last 2 week of flower . I know how photosynthesis works woody but thanks for the info , most plants do n't get fed nutes or sugar subs the difference is we are substituting sugar/nutes etc for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . <p> Spot , the whole point of explaining the photosynthesis was not for you , but for those who do n't  know . For those who do , a refresher is sometimes in order to remind people . <p> As for sugars , I was not talking about the plant being fed sugars , I was talking about the plant creating its own sugars a la photosynthesis . <p> From my own experience of growing , I used to know a guy who swore by removing fan leaves from 3 weeks into flower . I listened to him but experimented on my own and after a couple of grows , he was asking me what I was feeding my plants for them to be so much better producers than the same cuttings he had . He had 20+ years experience to my 3 or 4 grows at the time . The only real difference was his removal of the fan leaves and my double his yield . He removed leaves much earlier than we are talking here . My suggestion would always be to position leaves so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this without breaking them or completely covering the leaf then you may as well take it off . Not something I would suggest but they are not my plants . All I can say for sure is I have never had a leaf die on me as a result of me moving it maybe I have been lucky for the last 25 years . <p> Ultimately , doing a little light LST even at this late stage may be the best option to get more bud from the lower sites . I have often trimmed the lower popcorn sites off so the plant can put its energy into developing the larger , more light efficient buds . <p> There are obviously differing opinions here , I know I prefer the one which seems to make use of plant biology . Ultimately , the only way of knowing for sure for yourself is to experiment with clones in identical , side by side tests . Having done this , I favour leaving leaves on the plant . W <p> Had to post my findings about the DO NT remove the leafs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this late of a stage to remove a few ( not all leafs ) at least give the op a option other than do n't do it as it 's BAD " not pointed @ u woody or any one else " . Take what you will from this post 's op and good luck with what ever you do , was just saying it 's not as bad as most people make it out to be to remove some leafs . Tried and tested by myself and other grows , the same as other methods are tried and tested . Hell i even remove popcorn at times . I see the fan leafs as vital to the vegging cycly but not so much for the last 1-2 weeks of flowering i just see them taking food and energy away from the buds where you can replenish what you have taken with nutes etc . IMO . I'v had many a big fan leafs turn yellow after a week of being tucked away might just be me being brutal not sure . <p> Just read the whole debate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at end and DO NT DO IT unless it blocks a big bud site and you cant bend the leaf then remove it , and woody buds grow from sunlight saw a paper on it somwhere could find the link if you really want so removing leaves is n't always a bad thing but only towards the end . but personal preference it will be like alot of growing <p> i agree with both sides , but the leafs grow for a reason , i have found that Trimmin lower branches , concentrates effort into the top buds . i am talking about Lollipoping , i do n't  reccomend removing individual leafs .... or tucking them if the bud needs more light it will grow longer or fatter ..... im sure plant knows best ! ! <p> However i have found that when growing an established strain you CAN remove branches and lower popcorn bud , all through flower without her turning to a ladyboy ! and see new growth in top buds within 24-48hrs , ..... great to chop a few lower branches with 3 weeks to go .... you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go the distance cause you 've ran outta weed ! ! <p> jus my 2cents , and the above applies to hydro and growing a tree ..... no idea if it works for soil ( probs not too slow ) or with a normal size plant ! ! ! 10985 @qwx420985

@@46022220 @6022220/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> A Guide To Cloning &amp; Revegging Flowering Plants <p> Hopefully this quick guide will show you that you can carry on a strain even when the plant has finished flowering ... <p> There are 2 ways to reveg your plants ... <p> Cloning . <p> The clone below was taken from the lowest stem on the plant after the rest of the plant had been harvested . She was dipped in rooting hormone gel , placed in moist compost then put in a regular propagator under 24/0 CFL lighting . <p> Here 's how she looked on day 1 ... <p> As you can see , she 's just a regular little bud that is ready for smoking . But we do n't want to smoke her , we want her to grow into a big , juicy plant just like her mother . <p> She was placed in the propagator and sprayed maybe once every 3 days with regular tap water ... nothing more . <p> 2 weeks on and we have the start of some growth ... It 's not a lot , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bud . But at least I know that the clone has rooted and it 's all systems go . <p> ok , another 7-10 days on and more and more single-blade leaves are appearing . At this point she comes out of the propagator and sits under the CFL veg light with her cousins . Here 's how she looks ... <p> All of the new leaves are single-blade which is perfectly normal ... The ' regular ' leaves will soon follow . I 've now stopped spraying her as there 's no need ... the roots are taking in the water and food now , not the leaves . <p> Another week on and her ' proper ' leaves are starting to develop and the real growth starts ... <p> Here 's how she looks a couple of weeks later after repotting , she 's now a regular vegging plant ..... <p> And that 's about it , she will now be kept under 24/0 lighting until I decide to flower her . I will repeat the process again after she 's harvested . <p> Complete Reveg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . <p> After harvesting a plant , leave a good few little stems/bud sites intact , as shown here ... <p> The soil is spent , all of the nutrients have been used up and it 's possible that the soil now contains toxins , so it has to go . With a good carving knife I cut a circle around the stem about 3 inches away and slowly pulled the old root-ball out . Do n't be too worried about damaging the roots as most of them will be removed anyway . After it 's removed I gave the root ball a good trim . When I 'd finished the remaining root-ball was about the size of my fist ... <p> The pot was filled with fresh compost and the root-ball placed in a hole in the middle ... <p> Lastly , the pot was topped up , watered with 2-3 litres of water and is now sitting in the veg room . In a couple of weeks the new growth will start . <p> And that 's about it ... So if you feel you might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant completely . Hack off the main colas , dry and sample them , but leave a couple of little stems at the base just-in-case . <p> I have some plants flowering right now so I could do this in a couple of weeks , just wondering though ... my plants had 2 weeks veg max , so given that it is best to clone mature plants is it worth my while cloning my immature flowered plants . <p> In fact i'lll probably just do it and see what happens i 'm sure the result will be smokable . <p> I have some plants flowering right now so I could do this in a couple of weeks , just wondering though ... my plants had 2 weeks veg max , so given that it is best to clone mature plants is it worth my while cloning my immature flowered plants . <p> In fact i'lll probably just do it and see what happens i 'm sure the result will be smokable . <p> I would n't say it best to clone mature plants , infact I 'd say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably more likely to succeed than trying to clone from a harvested plant . <p> The fact that you did n't veg your plant for long does n't matter mate . As long as you can find a nice little stem/bud to use as the clone you 'll be fine . <p> After reading this thread i went straight out today and bought some cloning gel , My thinking is I can cut ofF what will become a bud with stem on , from my bubblegum that 's been in flower 12/12 for two weeks.Now can I continue to go 12/12 and grow what I think would be just a single cola , Something like forest has grown , or do I need to use a 24hour light a revert it back to a veg state befor then going to a 12/12 . Sorry for the question grub , Thanks again <p> Thanks grub . I 'll give it a bash , the only thing that was stopping me was thinking my plants were n't suitable as they 'd only vegged for 2 weeks , and when I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get good clones ... ta for the reassurance , i 'll be trying this in a couple of weeks <p> After reading this thread i went straight out today and bought some cloning gel , My thinking is I can cut ofF what will become a bud with stem on , from my bubblegum that 's been in flower 12/12 for two weeks.Now can I continue to go 12/12 and grow what I think would be just a single cola , Something like forest has grown , or do I need to use a 24hour light a revert it back to a veg state befor then going to a 12/12 . Sorry for the question grub , Thanks again <p> The clone will grow just the same as the mother did mate . If the mother had lots of side-branches then the clone will follow suit . It is after all genetically exactly the same . It 's best to start the clone off under veg lighting mate until it is established with some nice new growth . If you go 12/12 from the off now that you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will just start budding and you 'll end up with a 6 " tall plant with one big bud . <p> As Grub said - It 's best to start the clone off under veg lighting mate until it is established with some nice new growth , But if you can continue growing that clone taken from a plant that 's already on 12/12 and in the very early stages of becoming a bud , I 'm thinking i could have a stack on tiny 6 " little " Bubblegum Buds " Hmmmmm Hope that 's right ? ? <p> it will just start budding and you 'll end up with a 6 " tall plant with one big bud . <p> That 's exactly what i 'm hoping for , I like it <p> If you take the clone when the plant has basically finished , the clone wo n't grow a lot more mate . Once a bud has reached full maturity it starts to deteriorate . I would give it a couple of weeks veg growth first before flipping to 12/12 . You will still get a short plant but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can continue growing that clone taken from a plant that 's already on 12/12 and in the very early stages of becoming a bud , I 'm thinking i could have a stack on tiny 6 " little " Bubblegum Buds " <p> Yes mate , if the clone is taken early enough into flowering then the plants will stay short . I would still put them under veg lighting though just until they 're rooted . <p> So the palnt i 'm using , Bubblegum , has been under 12/12 for two weeks only , Vegged for 4 weeks , Showed 1st white pistol at 8 days into 12/12 , So still not really forming any real buds , Early days still , If I cut off what 's to become a bud with some stem on too , Just put it under blue spec for 2 weeks then go 12/12 and I will end up with a short stumpy cola with basically no side branching ? But if I put the clone on 12/12 from the start and it had been on 12/12 for two weeks already it will continue counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the plant has basically finished , the clone wo n't grow a lot more mate . Once a bud has reached full maturity it starts to deteriorate . I would give it a couple of weeks veg growth first before flipping to 12/12 .

The fungus will not harm the plant but may indicate unsterile potting medium .

@@46022225 @6022225/ 10988 @qwx420988 <p> this has nothing to do with food at all . its room conditions . its to hit or to dry somehow . an upward curl is the plant trying to make shade on its stomata as its transpiring faster than the rate of water uptake . could be to hot . to low humidity no air flow <p> a down curl is opposite and is to wet . leaves are saturated and cant release or transpire water fast enough . again room conditions or to wet of a medium . this is effecting the food process not other way around . this makes stomata close and when this hapens we do n't  process foods properly <p> I agree with C.W.

W 10986 @qwx420986 <p> and for the excess nitro being the tip down make sure they know its just the very tip of leave and not all the serated edges . and its not relay to much nitro as a plant cant uptake more than is needed . its a deff or supression of other elements causing more nitro to show but she always uptakes that amount . it needs all elements to be at more even levels never seen an mg deff without the larger foods first . deffs happen in a certain order due to size of needs unless the nute bottle is n't mixed in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the line <p> We will have to disagree on this subject . If you go through the problems day after day in sick plants , around 1/4 of all the problems seem to be Mg def and with no other signs of deficiencies . The bottom line is , even with correct ph , I would suffer Mg def 's on every grow if I did not supplement the Mg in some way . Nutrient manufacturers do not put enough Mg into their products . I live in an area with " hard water " that has an EC of 0.15 . On the water companies website , the bit detailing what 's in my water , Mg is zero . Maybe in your grows you have not seen Mg def 's without other deficiencies but I can prove , with hundreds of problems , that an Mg def WILL occur even with correct ph if you are in a sort water area . Perhaps the hundreds of people who have thanked me for sorting out their Mg problems have all been wrong and the Epsom Salts sorted out something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show another way are wrong ? . why is it when 1 does it one way its the only way . never got that not even 1 ec is n't hard water . .15 ? . what meter reads that low in ec . hard water isusualy cal not mg also <p> C.W. , the definitive marker for hard water in the UK is 100ppm , loosely translated to EC is around 0.1 depending which scale you use . <p> On my water companies website , it declares my water as " Moderately hard " water . Are you going to disagree with them too ? You must be in the USA or some other place that has shit water if an EC of 1 is n't hard water . My point here is not really the hardness but what is actually in it . If you have zero Mg in your water , use standard nutes with no supplements , have a perfect environment including temps , humidity , ph , CO2 enrichment and a sealed room with AC and 9,000 lumens per sq ft ( which I have ran ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf 's and curling margins , starting at the bottom with some leaf tips going crispy ? N , P or K def ? No , it is Mg deficiency . If we are to listen to what you are saying , there would be a macro deficiency showing first , this is not the case . It does sometimes happen but not always and can not be relied upon . If you are talking about different methods , enlighten us ? Explain how you would resolve the above scenario without supplementing the Mg ? Macro deficiencies may show first in lab conditions but no one I know of grows in a lab . Just as a check , I have looked in Gorge Cervantes and Ed Rosenthal 's books and neither mention another method of correcting an Mg deficiency other than adding Mg in some way . Assuming the ph is correct of course . In neither book does it say that a macro nutrient deficiency will occur before the Mg deficiency displays . <p> This is NOT a matter of opinion as you have suggested , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed nor Gorge seem to have , I would be enthralled to read it ! As all those who suffer with Mg deficiencies would also like to . The bottom line is , and this is confirmed by reading almost any grow guide/book , nutrient manufacturers do not put enough Mg into their products . MJ uses a hell of a lot since it is central to the photosynthesis process . I can only assume that when you were testing the nutrients where you worked , you were not growing marijuana but something like tomato 's , which are not even related to mj ! <p> I am in Scotland , well known for having some of the best water in the world , very low in dissolved minerals . Glasgow has almost no minerals in its water , with an EC for many there around the 0.01 mark which is better than most R/O machines can manage . <p> Regarding the misinterpretation of curling up &amp; down pointed out by Missy , leaf margins curling up IS a symptom of an Mg deficiency . For those who doubt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem solving guides on different websites and it is mentioned in all of them . As I pointed out above , if the curling is at the bottom of the plant , Mg deficiency should be the first thing you check put . Other symptoms will also probably be present . <p> For the OP 's problem , I do think it is heat stress , however , if this problem is also present lower down the plant , be aware that it could be an Mg deficiency . <p> My apologies to the OP for the thread hyjack but I feel it is in everyones interests that people understand the facts and not just opinions . I am not speaking about my personal opinions here , I am talking about proven facts , backed up by almost every grow book out there . Peace . W <p> my ec is .1 and i said in another thread i have to add epsom salts to my mix or i DO get problems with mg deff , nothing else just mg and that 's why i add a little epsom salts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ec 1 is hard water . and no i live in bc canada best water in the world . 7 ph and 0 tds right from my tap . your discription of the deffs of pale and purple and so on is more than 1 deff. that 's how food works . cant have 1 without another , they all work together and effect each other purple stems can be nitro. pale can be nitro. can be temps . can be a million and 1 things . <p> the diff methods was a bit off .. more diff ideas of what deffs are what . ive seen so many charts that are so wrong since being online . if you get a minor ellement to go deff before a major then you dint something seriously wrong . almost always starts with largest needs first then down the line . poorly mixed nutes may cause a diff result though . <p> oh i see what now .. george and ed ... book writters not growers paid to say what they say by hi times . and old info to . they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if they used hops like everyone else did to get their info but , most i read from them is old info . they are salseman and owned by publishing companies . i guess they know more than a certified biologist or a nute manufacuring co ... <p> you guys are confusing the leaf curl with 2 diff things . one is serated edges like in pic and other is a full curl or the entire leaf . 2 diff reasons <p> go ahead hit with mg and watch it do nothing . and this curl wont go away now either but watch for new curling . <p> bit of what i 'm talking about and the effects .... <p> Who would have thought that gardening required a knowledge of hydraulic engineering ? We might have caught a hint from the old adage , though -- Horses sweat , men perspire , women glow and plants transpire . Transpiration is the method by which plants circulate water from initial intake at the roots up into the leaves , where it is then vaporized and released into the air . Plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supply nutrients for photosynthesis and move manufactured carbohydrates into storage . The movement of moisture from roots to leaf tips takes place through an intricate network of vascular tissues similar to human veins and capillaries . Moisture is extracted from soil through the process of osmosisfrom the Greek word osmos , meaning " a push . " Efficient osmotic pumps in the cell walls of feeder roots transport water molecules upward to stems and leaves , expanding the cells with water pressure . The drops of water that form on the stub of a cut stalk are evidence of this pressure . Fully expanded cells are turgid with positive pressure ( think of celery ) ; cells with a moisture deficit are flaccid with negative pressure ( think of wilted lettuce ) . Water molecules move through the plants vascular system from fully expanded tissues with high pressure , to flacid tissues requiring moisture renewal . Plants can react to conditions of environmental stress like intense heat or high wind by rapidly pumping water from roots into all tissues , creating sudden high pressure that threatens to burst cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excess moisture is vaporized and released through stomata , the microscopic escape valves on the undersides of leaves . The release of water vapour creates a low pressure void in leaf tissues , which in turn triggers a suction and pulling mechanism to aid osmotic pumping and get water moving upward again . The constant push and pull of transpiration is essential to all plants . On a summer day , a mature silver maple transpires approximately 70 gallons of water an hour ; a rose shrub transpires about 2 gallons a day . When rainfall and irrigation are insufficient , plants take emergency measures : stomata are tightly closed to prevent vapour loss and leaves curl inward to shade their surfaces from sunlight . Negative water pressure within cells turns leaves limp . If moisture returns , the osmotic pumps quickly restore leaf turgidity . But continued drought can check growth by inhibiting cell expansion and division . Growth may resume when water becomes available , but new leaves will be undersized and stalks shortened . Allowing plants to wilt repeatedly causes successive growth checks , which results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stress hormone that initiates plant dormancy . Herbaceous plants stunted by excess ABA may not resume normal growth for the season . Woody plants halt twig extension and begin selective flower bud drop . Avoid these consequences by monitoring the state of soil moisture in your garden and establishing a regular water schedule . Cover exposed soil with a three to five-inch layer of organic mulch to prevent moisture evaporation , keep plant roots cool and reduce the amount of watering necessary to prevent wilts , checks and stunts . <p> leaf curl is widely thought to be a protective measure taken by the plant to ward off the drying winter air and winds causing moisture loss . The leaves have tiny valve openings on the undersides called stomata . This is where the plant releases moisture . When the leaf curls , the stomata are concealed . The vertical drooping catches less wind than a horizontal leaf , resulting in less drying . <p> I ca n't be arsed arguing with you CW but there are new growers around so I will ! <p> In post #12 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .15 ? . what meter reads that low in ec " and then in post #16 , " i never said ec 1 is hard water " You do this all the time , contradict yourself . <p> I never mentioned purple , yet you use this to base your argument about the symptoms of a deficiency . The deficiency I described was Mg . My point is quite simple , an Mg deficiency CAN and WILL occur without other deficiencies showing themselves . <p> At no point did I say THIS deficiency WAS Mg def . What I said was , <p> " If there is the same kind of curl lower down , this is not related to heat ! If only at the top of the plant , yes , I agree it is heat . If however there is the same slight curl low down , it is more likely to be Mg deficiency . <p> Do you have a pic of the overall plant ? " <p> I do n't  need the lesson in transpiration or the Stomata but I am sure the newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> This line made me realise you are full of shit " oh i see what now .. george and ed ... book writters not growers paid to say what they say by hi times . " Let me say that again , you are full of shit and PAID by a nutrient company to rubbish other nutrient companies . " oh i see what now .. george and ed ... book writters not growers paid to say what they say by hi times . " <p> Are you saying George Cervantes and Ed Rosenthal are not growers ?

Cream of tartar ( one gram per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilogram ) may also be used . <p> The mixture is boiled for 20 minutes , and will convert enough of the sucrose to effectively prevent crystallization , without giving a noticeably sour taste . Invert sugar syrup may also be produced without the use of acids or enzymes by thermal means alone : two parts granulated sucrose and one part water simmered for five to seven minutes will convert a modest portion to invert sugar . <p> C.W. <p> 11-01-12 , 01:40 PM <p> jmmi has it right for the sugars. and yes they get the trace from it but there is already enough trace in our other foods and hence the name .. only trace amounts are needed so adding more dose nothing . there is also a slight tiny bit of the sugar that will cross the strip to be allowed in the plant . bu the , main reason for molasses is feeding microbes. yes table sugar is fine . i use it when i water all your carb boosters are Dextrose , arabinose , xylose , glucose , fructose , maltose <p> reason some use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar .. alot of boosters or carb bottles already have molasses in it <p> C21H30O2 <p> 12-01-12 , 12:03 PM <p> wo n't suguar mess up the pump on a hydroponic system if its not disolved correclty ? <p> prime <p> 14-01-12 , 04:47 PM <p> and what havoc would it play with ph ? <p> rndusername <p> 15-01-12 , 10:12 AM <p> At that stage of the grow would it matter that much ? <p> Anonymiss <p> 15-01-12 , 10:51 AM <p> Sugar wo n't affect the pH . <p> blazefor20 <p> 15-01-12 , 10:58 AM <p> Has anyone used sugar water earlier than the last two weeks or so for carbs ?

What it actually does is increase &amp; stimulate Beneficial microbial activity in the soil , which in turn enables the plant to use the available Nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the fact it 's like a carb boost , although that does help a little . <p> I saw someone say use white table sugar .... Never use White refined sugar , there are sulfides in it left over from the refining process , which will give your plants serious problems . If you do n't believe me do it &amp; see , you 'll only be disappointed . As for feeding Red Bull to your plants ...

I take them serious , but I have noticed some growers only believe the tests that agree with what they already know . Obviously the tester made a mistake if there is disagreement . <p> Nobody fibs and context shows who is likely to make a error copying the data . I trust any side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groom exists without having proved better than the alternatives . Nutrients have not changed in 12 years , neither has the technology changed much . Plants use the same nutrients now as they did 7500 years ago when agriculture started . Sugar in its refined form is a recent techlogical advance . This could be a game changer if it shows an increase . <p> My light tests involved a clone with four years familiarity and a control for every change to keep the season correct for both plants rather than just age based . Even though it is indoor . Unexpected results got run a second time . Suffering plants were mercy killed to make room for the next . <p> I want to see sugar tested , I just do n't have enough expectation of positive results to run it myself .

There is a type of plant like structure that does n't use photosynthesis and can absorb and metabolize carbohydrates from its surroundings , it 's called a fungus . So if you would like to grow fungus with your plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal way to accomplish this . While it is true that plants need sugar , they make all they need through the process of photosynthesis . Plant roots are not designed to absorb sugar , and table sugar ( sucrose ) added to the water will harm or kill plants because it reduces the availability of water . Sugar can also promote the growth of soil microbes which can also be harmful to the plant . The sugar is only for microbes living in the soil NOT THE PLANT ITSELF ! Plants ca n't diffuse carbohydrates accross the roots membrane , only nutrient ions . <p> If sugar could be used as a nutrient/feed then Garden Centres would be flooded with overpriced sugar products . <p> I have done the sugar test , and find no benefits . If you study your roots compared to a plant you did n't give sugar afterwards , you 'll agree . <p> wrasta <p> 05-05-12 , 12:16 PM <p> Hi m8 , I think it 's molasses you 're talking about , some people add throughout whole grow , I add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fattens up buds &amp; sweetens taste imo . <p> hi i 'm using canna pro soil , advanced nutes , can you tell what the correct type of molasses to use and dosage many thanks ps growing bagseed hybrid some sativa dom some more indica dom please help : D <p> hi new to this site hope you do n't  mind me butting in but i wanted to ask you a question . my babies are at different stages of flowering in soil ( some indica dom , some more sativa dom ) if i find some sugar containing sucrose , how many tablespoons or grams would you recommend per litre of plain water ? and a guide to the ammount ie determined by the week number , week 3 5-10g per 5L water etc just do n't  want to over do it : ) <p> Phineasfreek <p> 05-05-12 , 02:20 PM <p> Sucrose is n't the best carbohydrate to use really .

If you see these in your soil it means you have a healthy happy soil going on . Springtails are primarily detritivores and microbivores . There function in your soil is to help eat up microbes and decompose organic matter . Springtails also play a positive roll in the establishment of plant-fungal symbiosis by helping carry mycorrhizal spores throughout your plants biomass . found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil in the first place is beyond me as its canna pro soil mix bizarre <p> wrasta <p> 07-05-12 , 12:50 PM <p> has anyone ever had these bugs before ? ? ? ? ? ? ? are they really ok ? ? ? <p> Friday <p> 07-05-12 , 01:19 PM <p> has anyone ever had these bugs before ? ? ? ? ? ? ? are they really ok ? ? ? <p> Hi mate .

Sucrose 36% Invert sugar 20% Dry matter 80% Moisture 20% <p> brix 80 <p> pH 4.5 - 7 <p> K 3% Ca 0.8% Chlorides 1.5% P 0.1% S 0.5% Mg 0.5% <p> There 's also quite a large list of smaller % minerals . Pm me if your interested and I can send it to you . <p> I thought this might come in useful to some one designing their own nutrient solution . <p> To clarify molasses is NOT a complex sugar , complex sugars are those that can be digested down into simple sugars , the sugar in Mollases is sucrose , ( same as white sugar ) and is a simple sugar . <p> The unsulphured blurb is also utter bulshit , sulphur dioxide is bubbled through the sugar solution , one the risidule SO2 is in such small , almost undetectable amounts , measured in parts per million , or parts per billion . The difference between sulphured and unsulphured sugar is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declair it on the spec because it is in such small amounts , and some people do , because even though legally , they do n't have to because it 's in at such a small amount , they still do , just because they bubbled it through , and they do n't want to lie about it . <p> I 'm also going to take a second to explain where the name black stap comes from . <p> Firstly the cane are crushed to juice them . <p> Then the juice is boiled up to thicken it . <p> Sulphur dioxide is bubbled through it ( it helps make the white sugar , whiter ) <p> Then the sticky sulphured goo I 'd loaded on a spindle , and spun . In a large drum . <p> The white sugar , stays on the spindle , this is the main product , and quite pure sucrose , and all the shit left over forms a black strap around the drum , where it was spun out to from the spindle . <p> So molasses is as processed as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with lots of other goodness like potasium and magnesium , please look at the breakdown at the top . <p> Most of the Mollases is sold into the animal feed industry , and therefor is not fit for human consumption ( because strict food safety protocol and procedures , have to be followed and certified , for it to be classed as food safe ) an a little bit is sold into the distilling industry , for making gins and whiskys and rums and stuff . And a small proportion is sold to health food shops , this stuff is the most expensive as it has to be food safe . I hope this clears things up . <p> Also soft drinks are not just flavoured sugars , they have carbon dioxide added to them , which forms carbonic acid , which will play havoc with your pH . <p> Hope this helps . <p> Chronicgreen <p> 17-05-12 , 06:25 AM <p> i heard putting fruit juices on your compost can affect taste ? has anyone used fruit juices with there water just before harvesting ? <p> Chronicgreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Steel bangle <p> 21-05-12 , 06:24 AM <p> Fruit juice is high in citric acid , and very acidic .

But microbes eat the sugar , and the roots can absorb their poo . And the poo picks up minrals ( chelates ) and takes them in to the roots . In my experience , even though this is a way of giving the plants nutrients , and kind of against what flushing is about , it does not affect the taste of the buds , in a negative way the same as adding straight nutes does . I do n't know why it is not as harsh , because nutes are nutes , wether from microbe poo , or from a bottle , it is obviously something beyond my understanding of the science . <p> ganjaskunk <p> 26-05-12 , 07:18 PM <p> so wot about if you were to feed them both the malasses and table suget would they get best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause some complications ? ? ? ? many thanks in advance ! ! ! <p> Ganja Noob <p> 27-06-12 , 08:52 PM <p> Can you add sugar to a res or is it just for plants grown in pots ? <p> Evilscotsman1888 <p> 30-06-12 , 02:51 PM <p> gim me i got the munchies and love stew lol haha <p> captianzanax <p> 30-06-12 , 02:56 PM <p> i used to use sugar/molasses till my plants got diabetes <p> jimmi420 <p> 30-06-12 , 02:56 PM <p> Can you add sugar to a res or is it just for plants grown in pots ? <p> i would n't personally add to my rezz as it may get messy in your pipes etc and block them up <p> SallyThebitch <p> 05-04-13 , 12:20 PM <p> Google simple and complex sugars , if you want an instant booster go with simple sugars as i said suacarose ( table sugar ) is best for boost or even a can of redbull which are just simple sugars , inside your root are a band of cells called the casparian strip which everything has to pass through or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , in fact nothing can pass through unless its inorganic and broken down into ions if i understand it correctly . <p> Am growing in soil what sugar is best to add I have dissolved black treacle before worked quite nice red bull sounds wicked any other ideas ? <p> jimmi420 <p> 05-04-13 , 12:56 PM <p> Red bull ai n't  no good after looking into ingrediants a bit more , its got summink dodgey in it , but in soil unsulphered black strap mollasses or dextrose or tble sugar . <p> lhhip <p> 05-04-13 , 07:54 PM <p> Table sugar is not so good - it is a double sugar molecule ( disacharide - I know I 've spelt that wrong ) Glucose is the best as it is just under half the size , more easily digested/absorbed .

It got ta be unsulphered black strap mollasses from health food shops , 1 level teaspoon per litre <p> I suggest using citric acid/ascorbic acid as a plant carbohydrate .

Using things like TCA/Citric acid cycle or krebs cycle etc etc is all well and fair , but completely useless to the average grower . <p> I do agree that pure glucose would be the superior added carbohydrate , however I think it would be far superior with the added citric/ascorbic in terms of utilization . This is n't even considering the added benefits of complex organic acids , which is chelation of minerals for more effective utilization . <p> As for your consideration of pH . I find that Ascorbic acid at the studied hydroponic dose ( 0.5mM or roughly 3g in a 12gal res ) has little effect on pH overall . Citric acid definitely is potent on the pH change , but I find the pH depression to be temporary . What I typically do when mixing nutrients is to keep my sulfur on the low end of the range i 'm shooting for and citric at 0 , then pH down with the two until I hit the desired pH . I continue to use both as pH down until I figure my sulfur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I switch to purely citric until the pH is unmanageable ( I tend to need pH adjustment daily with just citric ) . It would make sense to add equimolar amounts of glucose with the citric acid during this . I will not use phosphoric acid for pH down since the optimal range is very tight were sulfur is quite loose . When I mix my nutes I know my pH is always going to start high since I tend to use a high amount of potassium ( and potassium salts are either neutral but more likely basic ) . <p> As far as feeding microorganisms and such , I agree with the concept . Many people think sterilizing the roots and medium regularly is the way to go , but this just let 's more aggressive and harmful organisms outcompete the friendlies . I was actually considering playing around and using a scobey in a res ( a microorganism disk used in making kombucha ) but I do n't know if the plants would be appreciative of up to 1% alcohol content in the res . <p> OmEgA-X1 <p> 05-05-13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm wrong , I 'm wrong for insinuating that citric/ascorbic acid may not be -literally- carbohydrates in my previous post . Citric/ascorbic acid are 5-membered hemiacetal forms of glucose , and are both monosaccharides . <p> A term applied to a group of substances which include the sugars , starches , and cellulose , along with many other related substances . This group of compounds plays a vitally important part in the lives of plants and animals , both as structural elements and in the maintenance of functional activity . Plants are unique in that they alone in nature have the power to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in the presence of the green plant chlorophyll through the energy derived from sunlight , by the process of photosynthesis . This process is responsible not only for the existence of plants but for the maintenance of animal life as well , since animals obtain their entire food supply directly or indirectly from the carbohydrates of plants . <p> The term carbohydrate originated in the belief that naturally occurring compounds of this class , for example , D-glucose ( C6H12O6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C6H10O5 ) n , could be represented formally as hydrates of carbon , that is , Cx(H2O)y . Later it became evident that this definition for carbohydrates was not a satisfactory one . New substances were discovered whose properties clearly indicated that they had the characteristics of sugars and belonged in the carbohydrate class , but which nevertheless showed a deviation from the required hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio . Examples of these are the important deoxy sugars , D-deoxyribose , L-fucose , and L-rhamnose , the uronic acids , and such compounds as ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) . The retention of the term carbohydrate is therefore a matter of convenience rather than of exact definition . A carbohydrate is usually defined as either a polyhydroxy aldehyde ( aldose ) or ketone ( ketose ) , or as a substance which yields one of these compounds on hydrolysis . However , included within this class of compounds are substances also containing nitrogen and sulfur . <p> The properties of many carbohydrates differ enormously from one substance to another . The sugars , such as D-glucose or sucrose , are easily soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paste-forming ; and cellulose is completely insoluble . Yet chemical analysis shows that they have a common basis ; the starches and cellulose may be degraded by different methods to the same crystalline sugar , D-glucose . <p> The carbohydrates usually are classified into three main groups according to complexity : monosaccharides , oligosaccharides , and polysaccharides . Monosaccharides are simple sugars that consist of a single carbohydrate unit which can not be hydrolyzed into simpler substances . These are characterized , according to their length of carbon chain , as trioses ( C3H6O3 ) , tetroses ( C4H8O4 ) , pentoses ( C5H10O5 ) , hexoses ( C6H12O6 ) , heptoses ( C7H14O7 ) , and so on . Oligosaccharides are compound sugars that are condensation products of two to five molecules of simple sugars and are subclassified into disaccharides , trisaccharides , tetrasaccharides , and pentasaccharides , according to the number of monosaccharide molecules yielded upon hydrolysis . Polysaccharides comprise a heterogeneous group of compounds which represent large aggregates of monosaccharide units , joined through glycosidic bonds . They are tasteless , nonreducing , amorphous substances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrolysis . Their molecular weight is usually very high , and many of them , like starch or glycogen , have molecular weights of several million . They form colloidal solutions , but some polysaccharides , of which cellulose is an example , are completely insoluble in water . On account of their heterogeneity they are difficult to classify . See also Polysaccharide . <p> The sugars are also classified into two general groups , the reducing and nonreducing . The reducing sugars are distinguished by the fact that because of their free , or potentially free , aldehyde or ketone groups they possess the property of readily reducing alkaline solutions of many metallic salts , such as those of copper , silver , bismuth , mercury , and iron . The most widely used reagent for this purpose is Fehling 's solution . The reducing sugars constitute by far the larger group . The monosaccharides and many of their derivatives reduce Fehling 's solution . Most of the disaccharides , including maltose , lactose , and the rarer sugars cellobiose , gentiobiose , melibiose , and turanose , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaccharide sucrose . Among other nonreducing sugars are the disaccharide trehalose , the trisaccharides raffinose and melezitose , the tetrasaccharide stachyose , and the pentasaccharide verbascose . <p> The sugars consist of chains of carbon atoms which are united to one another at a tetrahedral angle of 10928 ' . A carbon atom to which are attached four different groups is called asymmetric . A sugar , or any other compound containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms possesses optical activity ; that is , it rotates the plane of polarized light to the right or left . See also Optical activity . <p> Phineasfreek <p> 07-05-13 , 07:32 AM <p> Hey fella <p> I was n't picking an argument with you but I did find fault in your definitions , and I do n't need a lesson in biochemistry , for what it 's worth I spent three years studying it at university . My issue was more with the fact that it 's all very telling folk to use this , to use that but if you do n't tell them how much to put in - which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of them making up toxic solutions ( at least toxic to their plants ) . One thing i do understand are the habits of the majority of the growers on here - and for them 5ml in a litre ( we 're mainly - but not all - British growers on this site so to we tend to use metric measurements ) would n't be considered an unreasonable amount to add . Yes , absolutely citric and ascorbic acids are used in many commercial additives - Bud Candy for instance , but they 're used as trace elements . A 0.5mM solution is considered trace ( but again if you tell virtually anyone on here to make up 0.5mM of this , 3 micro molar of that , they wo n't have a clue what you 're talking about or how to make it - you have to specify exact quantities ) . So they would chuck in 5ml of acetic acid into their 5ml /litre of molasses . <p> You 're talking hydroponics , where the utilisation of mycorrhizzae and trichoderma are n't common place and are their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - if not killed by the addition of peroxide or other oxidising agents . But there are many soil and organic growers , or even folk like myself who grow in coco , hydroponically but add mycos etc and feed at lower dosages ( I 've rarely gone over 1.2EC ) to maximise on the benefits of friendly microorganisms . <p> Historically , much of the discussion about adding sugars has centred around what folk can use - table sugar , orange juice , coca cola , red bull , etc , etc - I 've been horrified at some of the suggestions . This is why I tend to tell people to use either unsulphered molasses , because it 's about the safest and most generally beneficial , or glucose because it 's the most basic of all the sugars , the sugar upon which all others are based and because it 's the one sugar that can be uptaken by the roots and cross the plant 's cell membranes . <p> rapid7 <p> 07-05-13 , 07:59 AM <p> i tried using just normal sugar all it did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minites for the water to even get through the top of the coco i really do n't  the sugar thing does much i do use molases and did so side by side and the molasses ones looked abit better <p> OmEgA-X1 <p> 07-05-13 , 05:34 PM <p> On the 0.5mM concentrations , for citric/ascorbic acid , that equates to 3.3g/12gal for me . Personally like I said I avoid citric and side with ascorbic since the pH flux with citric is incomprehensible sometimes , however I have read that plants can better utilize glucose with an equimolar concentration of citric acid ( for our purposes , let 's just say same weight ) due to one oxidizing the other in some beneficial fashion . I 'm actually in the process of replacing my ascorbic acid usage with calcium ascorbate , since tomatoes ( yea , I grow tomatoes , lol ) are much more calcium intensive and I want to phase out CALiMAGic with that calcium carbonate their genius formulator decided was the cheapest option . That also points out the other issue I have with citric . Citrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away with 0.5mM ) will precipitate out the damn calcium ! Ascorbate ions are generally extremely soluble ( Calcium Ascorbate is soluble up to about 520g/L ! ) . <p> I 've never tried the molasses thing . Heck I 'm just now getting into the swing of things trying to promote a healthy symbiotic medium and avoiding sterilization . <p> To rapid7 : Sucrose ( table sugar ) is n't really the best way to go . The solubility of it is great , so I 'm surprised you have any sort of deposition of it . My guess is that the medium is n't being flushed regularly , but then again I 've never used coco to grow so I ca n't be too helpful on that . <p> TempWoog <p> 12-05-13 , 10:02 PM <p> How much mollases is needed to be added per a liter of water ? <p> rapid7 <p> 12-05-13 , 10:10 PM <p> i use 1 heaped spoon to 4ltr of water put it in abit of boiling water first tho to melt it down <p> wrasta <p> 21-05-13 , 11:19 AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the comments some interesting stuff there : D since i have started my test try 'd a few different products even fruit sugar which worked to a degree but it gave me fizzy nuets lol not good , however there is one product i have found to be really good is tnc molasses comes in a canna style bottle so is easier to use and its un-sulfured etc etc get it in most good grow shops or flea bay but i must say its by far the best product i have used for packing on lots of weight , seemed to help my mates plants out a lot too as his were coco and a difference could deffinately be seen in the plants after man good shit imo XD so i would deffinately rate tnc molasses but as always what works for one person might not work for another so just try it and find out <p> grend69 <p> 21-07-13 , 07:54 AM <p> I use mollasis one tea spoon 800 mills hot water stir well then add that into 40 litre barrels leave 24 hours/48 hours then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week into flower then Ouse bloom nutrients next feed only then following feed is just bloom booster / overdrive .

I have suffered from migraines , clusters and tension headaches since age seven . There are a couple of factors to consider when analyzing effectiveness of cannabis to treat . 1 . ) THC coats the axons and dendrites of nerve receptors with a plaque like substance . This impedes overstimulated nerve cells from transfering misfiring impulses , a common finding in people that have migraines . Dr.s prescribe antiseizure meds for this very same reason and result . 2. ) cannabis in general is considered a Vasodilator and as such only is effective for those suffering migraines that relate to vasoconstriction . In my case , my brain dialtes and I need the opposite in meds . I require vasoconstriction , and drink loads of coffee and such to reach this end . There are other dynamics at play with Cannabis and physiology but those are the two main ones . This is the reason why Cannabis is effective for some all the time and preventative some of the time only for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketical .... my wife suffers from horendous migraines and recently she has been having a smoke in the late evening when she has had a bad one and its done nothing to her . 6 out of 6 times it has n't  worked and its been different types of weed every time . but ... i supose for some people it might work . if i have a bad headache i wo n't touch weed , on the very odd occation i will have one just to help me sleep through it . <p> GBK <p> 07-02-12 , 10:39 AM <p> Just saw this ...

It 's kind of a tough call at this point as to whether or not to give any nitrogen . Usually you be would be cutting back about now maybe even eliminating .

You do n't have the stored up nitrogen right now . <p> I think I might give it a little bit of grow nutes at least for another week if you do n't see foxtailing or some other problem I got a feeling you 'll see the buds start to swell real fast . 10985 @qwx420985

I have a 1.2 x 2.4 x 2.0 grow tent , 2 600w hps lights ( 1 in a cool tube and the other in a Air cooled reflector cool tube ) and a 6 " extractor kit and an extra 5 " extractor fan it also has a 4 " intake fan and a tower fan to circulate the air . <p> The set up i have is with the 6 " fan attached and sealed directly blowing into the air cooled reflector and the intake end of the 6 " fan attached to a short ducting and 6 " carbon filter . The 5 " fan is in the middle of the air cooled reflector and the cooltube , with ducting attached to the other end of the cooltube which then exit 's from the tent , into the ceiling and into another room . <p> i have the 4 " intake fan in the corner with ducting attached to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan circulating the air . <p> The problem i have is even with the 2 fans sucking the heat out into another room , the temperature is still to high . With the lights around a foot and a half above the plants the temperature is around the 35 degree mark so i have lifted the lights to around 4 foot above the plants and the temperature is on 31 degree 's . <p> I 'm thinking of putting a 16 " circular fan in there to try and knock it down a few degrees which will b ok as the temp will b about 28 - 29 but the lights are 4 feet above the plants . <p> The simple fact of the matter is that once you go over 27c the leave 's pores close and they pretty much stop absorbing CO2 . Once that happens .. it does n't matter how much light you have because it wo n't be being used for photosynthesis , so your plants will be better off and produce more bud if you just switch off one of those bulbs and rotate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's overkill to have 1.2kw in that tent in the summer with those CF 's and adding too many fans will cause overperspiration which can lead to all sorts of other problems .. <p> Options : <p> A ) Reduce the light B ) Get bigger extraction hardware ( 10 " ) C ) Fight heat problems and see the symptoms of nutrient defs when there are n't any <p> assuming your in UK .. really need to know what time your running the room .. ? if its during the day with summer round their will be a silly amount of heat ... endless battle if you ask me ! <p> nice setup btw <p> thanks , i am in the uk and i have the lights running 18 hours . they turn off at 1pm and come bk on at 7.00 pm so the light cycle runs all through the nite from 7pm to 1pm and i have the dark period in the afternoon/evening . I 'm not a noob at growing as have been doing it the last 10yrs , first starting with rooms then knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a perfect temp with 1 600w hps , a cooltube and a 4 " extractor fan so wen i got my 1.2 x 2.4 x2.0 tent i pressumed a 6 " extractor kit with a extra 5 " fan wud do the trick fine ... but it turns out i was wrong lol <h> The Following User Says Thank You to bushvar For This Useful Post : <p> i do n't think you were necessarily wrong by deciding to upgrade to a better system maybe made the wrong choice when it came to buying the right fans .. as most growers will tell you that their only a few fans on the market that will cope .. one of the most popular being RVK ( desinged for industrial use and 24hr use ) .. ones you should stay away from are TT fans and the cheaper gimmicks of more expensive models .. loose pressure very easily .. know from experiance unfortunatly .. <p> good thing so far is your running the room at night which means the temps going in should be low most nights ... Know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the lights lower so they do n't  stretch .. <p> Havnt got allot of experience with Hoods/tubes i 'm afriad .. very much new to growing itself .. I would maybe check the all the seals to make sure everything is air tight first , iv read that the glass hood sometimes are n't  air tight .. so could be that ? <p> next step- From picture the extra ducting between filter and 6inch fan seem un-nessecary to me .. try to shorten as much as you can .. <p> since you said your running at night &amp; so if th heat is still their .. i think your problem lies with the size of your intake fan or the over all amount of air being exchanged ... The info is around here ... got this thread for you too look at by Anonymiss which is really helpful <p> the chart has all the info + calc. so for e.g the airflow for one 600w light if you want the ambient temp of the room you 'll need around 1053cfm fan .... for 2 600w it will be quite high .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over kill ... I Assume the 4inch intake wont be enough to cope with the required air exchange rate for 2 600s .. also keep in mind .. length of ducting , no of bends reduces the pressure drastically .. there 's another thread for calculating effeciancy of your fan setup with all the info etc .. its round here somewhere ! .. some h/w for you <p> Another way is to work out the volume of your space and make sure your replacing ateast 1 or 2 x the volume of air in the room per minute ... <p> thanks for all the answers ppl but simba i 'm no good at all the calculating and measuring stuff so thanks for doing it for me . With ure measurment of 691 m3/h for twice the volume per min i 'm thinking a 8 " rvk fan should sort the heat issue out as the 1 's ive been looking at are 750 m3/h . I will also replace the 4 " intake fan with the 6 " fan so tht should hopefully blow enough cold fresh air in to knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abit strange as your setup seems fine .. if not sure maybe wait for someone more experienced to get back to you .. having said that , just realised tabbatha pretty much covered the main point earlier which only other option left imo which is to get rid of the 6inch fan and use something bigger .. maybe use 6inch as your intake as sugested and maybe attatch 5 inch to filter for extraction and move the 4inch between hood and tube and see or even better if you could get a 10/8inch rvk for extraction as mentioned above .... The room does look abit too big for a 6inch fan .. either way better of going for a rvk and ending up buying once . For piece of mind .. <h> The Following User Says Thank You to Simba For This Useful Post : <p> well i think i finaly got it under control .

Also check RH as high temps can reduce humdity .. you want it above 50% for veg .. can always place a bucket of water in the room to help raise humidity .. <p> Sure you can get temps lower then that tho , try playing around with the setup alittle more when free .. for now your good as like i said you in veg .. gives you time to correct everything before you move to flowering .. maybe upgrade the intake fan when you can .. should help allot more .. trial and error i 'm afriad ! .. sounds like intake is the only thing left ! if unsure best way is to just try it out .. sometimes its quiker then waiting for a reply which might not be as accurate as you want it to be as everyones setups is unique in so many ways .. with all the factors to consider which effect fans , duct , lengths , lights , room size etc ..... so getting the room dialled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only recently got my room dialled in , i think .. lol <p> good idea with starting a diary .. will be good that way you get allot more input from more experianced growers .. 10985 @qwx420985 
@@46022241 @6022241/ 10988 @qwx420988 <p> Introduction " Root rot " is a common waterborne disease that can seriously affect indoor and outdoor crops year round . " Pythium " is a generic term for several different root rot and stem rot fungus species ( including Pythium , Verticillium , and Phytophthora , and Fusarium ) . Root rot is also known as " damping-off " in seeds , seedlings and clones . <p> Pythium can rapidly infect crops in vegetative and flowering stages . Damage includes strain infection , reduced yields , and crop failure . Pythium is particularly damaging in high-density dwc / hydroponic / aeroponic systems , as these recirculating systems provide ideal conditions for rapid growth and spread of pythium spores . One infected plant can quickly spread rot to all plants if the system has an interconected irrigation system . <p> Dissolved oxygen , temperature and pythium The amount of dissolved oxygen ( DO ) in a nutrient solution depends on the water temperature . Cold water can ' hold ' more dissolved oxygen . A fully aerated solution at 20C/68 F is 9 - 10ppm ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubles for each 10C rise in root system temperature ( max 30C/86F ) . The dilemma for the grower is that with a 10C rise in temperature , root system oxygen requirements will double , while the oxygen carrying capacity of the solution will drop by over 25% ! <p> The nutrient DO is unable to supply the root 's oxygen demands , leading to prolonged oxygen starvation . Oxygen starvation will result in slow growth , mineral deficiencies , root die-back and reduced yields . Oxygen starvation will stress the plant , leading to an eventual attack by opportunistic pathogens , such as ever-present pythium . <p> Advanced : # Brown and slimy roots with a slight to strong rotting odor . Plant may appear healthy . # Reddish and swollen root collar , becoming blackened over time . Eventually the plant will fall over as all connecting tissue will have been ' eaten away ' . <p> Note : Root damage is permanent ; new root hairs can form , but damaged roots will not regenerate . Lightly infected roots may turn white again if treated promptly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress-free is the best " cure " against pythium . Pythium is almost impossible to 100% eradicate from an infected system ; this involves starting completely over ( with new mothers , containers , equipment , etc ) . An infected crop can be nursed along , and subsequent crops can still yield , provided the grower takes care to minimize the growth and spread of pythium in the system . <p> Starting with a pythium-free system is the best strategy : <p> Startup with a new crop : -disinfect the system . Manual scrubbing and bleach might be necessary . -add tap water -disinfect the water with strong h2o2 . It takes 100ppm to kill pythium outright , however this can also kill small plants . Wait 24 hours for h2o2 to dissipate to a safe level - do not add tap water to system ! Add only h2o2-treated water . -add nutrients and beneficial enzymes . The aerobic-loving enzymes will colonize the sterilized medium and system , hopefully displacing any anaerobic bacteria . <p> Soil tips : Improved soil is the first step to keeping root rot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeration will decrease the chances of root rot . Use only sterilized soil/soilless mixes or heat-treated soil before use . Removing the diseased plants and several inches of affected soil will slow or stop the spread of pythium . Avoid over watering , as saturated soil promotes anaerobic conditions . Remove and destroy roots and surrounding soil near infected plants . Use sterilized soil for transplants .

But you got to have negative pressure for it to work <p> With the help of another member on here i bought a filter for 23.99 on ebay ( only lasts a year cause its cheap ) and i have it inside my cab gathering the smell &amp; hot air , with a pc fan blowing the air out then linked to some foil ducting then another fan blowing out through a hole in the back of my cabinet . My plants nearly 3wks into 12/12 &amp; it started to smell about 4wks ago . I only have one plant so i do n't  know how good this info will be to u but mines now has no smell whatsoever . I spent about 45 in total buying bits &amp; pieces to fit my filter together &amp; it works a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one bed flat where my boyfriends kid sometimes stays over &amp; it needed to look discreet . I 've got photos in my diary if u wan na check it out . I 'll be surprised if urs do n't  already smell ! I had one and like i said at 5wks old still in veggin i could smell it ! <p> As suggested I sealed up my grow area , it took a while because every evening I noticed some light leaking through . Once it was all sealed up I bought a complete carbon filter setup from an eBay supplier . For 65 I got a 4 inch fan , a big fat carbon filter and all the ducting . Set it all up and it did clear most of the smell , but the fan is a bit noisy and I only set it to low power ( needs to be rewired if I want the high setting ) . Since then one of the autoskunk started to flower , and now there is a mild aroma around the room , but I 've had people come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now . Not sure what it will be like when all of the plasnts start to flower , I may need to up the fan 's power , but I think it will be too noisy . <p> For a bit of stealth , I have set the ducting exhaust to run up to the back of my computer ( not actually fixed there , just pointing at the fan hole ) , the idea is this , if anyone sees the ducting and asks " Why have you got that 4 inch ducting blowing in you room ? " I 'm going to answer " Yeah , that 's cooling my PC , since I overclocked the processor " . The fan is hidden under the PC table , so hopefully they wo n't investigate further ... <p> I 'd say it 's definitely worth investing in a carbon filter , but hiding the noise and ducting pipe is a bit of a problem . <p> There are plans on here for DIY filters .

Is it the process or type of plant the kif came from that makes the difference ? I was thinking of just hand-pressing it , but I 'm afraid of wasting loads as it sticks to my hands ... <p> the difference is , the soft squidgy black hash is made from trichs that are taken from the plant while its still alive and in full bloom ( notice how sticky a fresh resinous plant is ) .. traditionally the farmer rubs his hands over all the plants in the field ( or nowadays i think they walk through the field wearing a leather apron ) , collecting lots of sticky resin .. he scrapes this off and rolls into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea or whatever is tradionally used in that region , black hash is n't usually contaminated with the crap they put in soapbar , its made to the same recipe/methods by farmers who have being do so for generations and each hash is disticitive to that region .. like fine cheeses . <p> the solid hashes are pressed trichromes , from a cut and dried plant . the trichromes have lost thier water molecule and are no longer sticky . they need to be pressed or bound together . as the water molecule is n't there anymore , several differences in the dried trichrome give it a different colour and taste . <p> you can make some soft black hash with your kief. this is done by rubbing the powder between your fingers to heat up the trichromes , when they soften with the heat from your fingers they should bind together with pressure and the tiny amount of sweat secreted by your fingers . you will need lots of keif for even a tiny bit of hash. i believe this is called finger hash ( same name as the scrapings off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's a shitload of some really nice black landed somewhere around the north of the uk not too long ago , two types I 've seen , one normal sticky black .

This method is based on the volume of the grow area and is perfectly suitable for small grow rooms . <p> First calculate the size of the room in cubic meters ( m3 ) : Length x Width x Height in meters = size of room in cubic meters . <p> Then multiply the total m3 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . <p> Add 30% to this figure to allow for the inefficiency created by using carbon filters and lengths of ducting and the figure you will have is the air exchange rate needed in m3/hour for your grow area . <p> Because all extractors are sold with a m3/hour air exchange rate , it is a simple matter to select the correct size fan(s) you will need . For example , if you have calculated the air exchange rate needed is 450m3/hour then this could be achieved by using one exhaust fan rated to 450m3/hour or by using two fans , one for input and one for exhaust that together total this amount . If you use two fans ( recommended ) make sure that the exhaust fan is approximately 70% larger than the input fan . <p> 2 . This formula is used by commercial growers and is based on the number of lights used . This is recommended for medium to large sized grow rooms and guarantees the control of temperature regardless of the number of lights being used . <p> Extraction : <p> Take into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account at least 300m3 of exhaust for each 600w lamp <p> Add approximately 30% more exhaust to this to allow for the inefficiency created by carbon filters and lengths of ducting . <p> Intake : <p> Intake should be approximately one third to one half of the volume of the exhaust . ( If your extractor is 1000m3 per hour or less , use approximately one third of its volume for input . if your extractor is over 1000m3 per hour , use one half of its volume as input ) <p> i 'm not sure about the cf for ' x ' amount of plants any carbon filter should work , within reason , if it is matched to the fan <p> The more plants you have , the more particles will be in the air for the filter to collect the more particles for your filter to collect , the less time it will be effective for as each filter can only hold so much <p> use the same size cf as the fan you need , the fan size is detemined upon the area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken into account also remember to add 30% to the figure because of the carbon filter reduces suction <p> i agree , that 's why im asking how you determine what size or how many cf filters for say 10 plants , <p> example : i can fit a 10 " -12 " ex fan to a 2.4mx2mx2m grow room with 80-100 plants in the fan will be fine for the grow room size but what if it starts to give off smell before the end of the grow cos the carbon is all used up from just 1 filter and so many plants ? ? <p> you want 4 plants per sq meter per 600w hps you want 300m2/h of extraction for each 600w hps + 30% for the filter plant numbers have nothing to do with carbon filter size its all about how many watts of light you have or the size of your grow room 10985 @qwx420985

I grow in compost and keep the pots at the edge of the tray ( I set my pots in large collection trays to collect run off which then drains away to a drain in my garage ) .

Often times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the screen , sucking away nutrients but never getting above the screen to develop into good buds . <p> It 's not that it 's too high really .

And i rarely grow my plants to more than 2ft tall , Unless something go 's wrong and they stretch more than anticipated .

@@46022259 @6022259/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> heat stressed stretched buds ? ? What to do ? ? <p> Hi all , <p> I 've managed to stress my plants with too high temps and as a result at 5-6 weeks flowering the buds have stretched lots of long spindly shoots from the tops of the forming colas . <p> The strain to the best of my knowlege , ( I was given the cuttings ) is Lavender , and is supposed to be flowered in 8-9 weeks . I 'll include a couple of pictures taken about a week ago , I 'll take some more tmro , but they do n't  look a great deal different . To me they look miles off , and I 'm doubting whether they can ripen these tops . The strain is reputed to be a stretcher , and like a fool I did n't  find this out until I 'd vegd them too long . The result of this is that I had to do a lot of late training with dental floss to pull them over as head room was running out and I was already looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they were 3 weeks into flowering . The stretch slowed down and stopped over the next week . Then a couple of weeks later this mad stretching from the tops of buds started to occur . <p> I 'm pretty sure I got them too hot under my 2x600s and a 1k light , Ive now changed the 1k for a 400 , and with the downturn in outdoor temps the room temps are back under control . <p> The lower buds are firming up to be dense nuggets very sticky and about 50% brown hairs . The tops are spindly , loose and fluffy . <p> Has anyone experienced this late stretching , and can anyone tell me if I can expect these to fill out reasonably . I 'm suspecting not as I imagine stress at this stage would have had a negative effect on flower production . <p> Yes they do seem stretched a fair bit , although the lower buds are looking ok ! I 'd maybe give them a couple more weeks and see if they fill out a bit . Either way , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was about to answer this when I saw the date of it but wtf is this about ? ? " Well you 're a helpful jolly community eh ? " Yes we are , and if you put a question like this in the infermary you 'd get a quicker answer . I 'll give you a late answer just to show we are nice . This sort of thing can happen with moving your lights about . The buds get a bit heat stressed so you rase the light and thay strech to it . If you get worried about them then not bushing out try moving your light to the side but remember to keep the distance if your not using ecos for this and keep turning the plants . Also , I do n't  know the strain but if it has an amount of sat/haze then thay will strech and take longer . <p> Well I 'm sorry if I 've offended anyone , and maybe I should have been posted in the imfirmary . <p> The plants are 2 days into their 10th week on 12/12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 10 days , cos I found some mold . I 've improved the air circulation now and am on top of that problem , no mold for a few days now . <p> I 'm toying with the idea of giving them another feed on a low CF , and see if they want to take it up as the plants are begining to finish , in that leaves are turning yellow . <p> I think they might need another 10 to 14 days to help fill out the tops , but unsure if theyll go that long now they 're starting to turn , <p> The colas are starting to dense up frpm the bottom but still a way to go . <p> I 'm really sry I shouted at you m8 , you got caught in the flack from someone else and that 's my fault . I 'll have a read back now and see what I can see , though I 'm sure these lads have already said Nephros , is that pic the eagal nebula ? <p> looking pretty good to me m8 and as D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much about the yellowing , it 's quite normal if you 've stop the neuts now to get some . Sometimes your grow just goes longer than you think ay . sry again m8 <p> Hey Nanuk , no need to apologise for having ago , I probably deserved it , my stress and worry this end getting in the way . So please accept my appologies for not giving the site a fair go . <p> I 'm a bit stressed , I was busted last grow and would just like to get this one out of the way and clear . I was told when I got the cuttings that they would finish in 6-7 weeks flowering , which I assumed may well be 8weeks in reality , but here they are in their 10th week and still a way off . <p> Theyve been flushing for 9 days , cos I found mold and panicked , however I 've improved my air circulation and not had any for a few days . <p> I 'm figuring they have maybe 10 to 14 days to go if they 're to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the strength nutrients they were having before , and a half measure of PK13/14 . I 'll give this for a few days ( keeping a good check on the CF readings ) then put them to flush for a few days again as they finish up . The nutrients I 've been feeding is cana coco part a+b . Its an all in one nutrient that covers veg and flower period . <p> They werent that interested in me when they busted me , felt sorry for me I think . Told me not to say anything in interview that would be incriminating re what I do with it etc , and gave me a police caution . Even left me some weed at home . Despite saying I might not get so lucky if I was caught again , it was hardly enough to put me off growing again . They gave me the impression that a stoner artist with a home grow was not what they were really lookin for . <p> Nah , I just got ta keep my cool and do n't  wan na smoke immature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can . I 'm not used to growing a sativa dominant strain and found them to work in an oppisite way to an indica dom strain in that they mature from the bottom of the plant upwards , where most plants Ive grown before I 'm usually harvesting the tops and leaving the bottoms under lights for a week or so longer . The bottoms are ripe but my tops have a way to go yet . <p> Next time I 'm going to do AK47s in a scrog grow , I do n't  like the difficulty or time involved in these that I 'm growing now . Despite LSTing them with over 150meters of dental floss , they are all still taller than myself , reaching over 6 feet . If I could straighten all the bends and curves that they have due to the LST training I reckon theyd be well in excess of 9 feet . That 's a lot of plant matter to have giving off moisture in a spare bedroom , there are 15 plants . This is why I 've had a problem with mold as its been difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dense crop of tops . <p> I 've just adjusted it again today after finding a tiny bit of mold on one of the smaller tops at the side , there seemed to be a bit of dead air here ( no movement ) <p> I 've also got a bit of a spidermite problem . I noticed some mite damage when I first spotted some mold around the 23rd of sept . I kept my eye on them and they did n't  seem to be marching on me very fast so assumed the plants were quite resistant . I think taking nuets away has weakened their resistance as they started to yellow in the leaf . Today I noticed a little webbing on 3 of the tops . I hate fucking spidermite , lil fucking killjoys . I cant do much about it now and hope they do n't  overrun me at this late stage . I have n't wanted to spray em with chemicals obviously , but have n't even dared to spray em with a mild soapy solution to slow em down , cos of the mold issues I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affected leaves that I can get to with a damp sponge . <p> Well they 're into week 11 of 12/12 now and I reckon going on their development I 'd say they have another 2 freakin weeks to go . <p> I fed them a CF of 13 to 15 , which included a half measure of PK13/14 . I then flushed for a couple of days and today I 've given them a CF of just 8 . Ill probably give them a week of this if it stays stable . At the start of week 12 I 'll flush for another week and hope they 're then ready for the chop . <p> I seem to be keeping on top of the mold , I 'm pulling quite a few dead or dying leaves as they start to ripen up , but they 're largely mold free . I 'm managing to keep the humidity below 60% , but my dehumidifier is running most of the time taking 7 litres of water out of the air every 24 hrs . I 'm going to have to alter my extraction for the next grow , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A couple of pics below show that they 're starting to finish , quite a few leaves turning yellow ( I remove them as soon as they 're ready to let them go ) . <p> Sounds like you have everything sorted with the way you are going mate . It is best to get them dead leafs out of your grow space as soon as they die like you say because of the mold that can grow on them and then spread to your buds . <p> I would say you have about two to three weeks left looking at them mate . I would keep feeding them for another week and then start to flush for the last two weeks to make sure you get all the nutes out . <p> They are all looking very nice indeed mate and i ca n't wait to see them finished . <p> To help lower your chances of mold mate try and have your desk fan blowing over there tops and facing slightly up wards towards your lights to blow the heat away but at the same time not blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To help lower your chances of mold mate try and have your desk fan blowing over there tops and facing slightly up wards towards your lights to blow the heat away but at the same time not blowing on your buds because that will cause mold . <p> Yeah I 've heard this before , but do n't  understand it really . <p> I was having mold problems but then put the fans to blow into and onto the top canopy . Mold was occurring where moisture was collecting , and when I set the fans onto it its dried this and the problem up . <p> Having said that , I 'm sure you know what you 're on about , so could you explain it to me please , as I 'm reluctant to change things now as I appear to be on top of the situation . <p> Has anyone ever experienced a decline in spidermites without treating with anything ? ? I have n't before now , but I had a little webbing form on 2 or 3 of the buds , and even had them climb up a single yoyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing them by hand Ive seen no more evidence of them getting any stronger , ie no more webbing. , although you can tell they 're in there from the telltale marks on the leaves . <p> I started them to flush yesterday , day 80 of 12/12 , I think you 're right about needing the 2 weeks , in fact they may need longer so I 'm a little concerned they may be flushing a little early . I 'll keep an eye on them over the next couple of days and if I think its necessary I 'll give em some nutes for a couple more days . <h> some photos <p> Hi see what you think . Its a bit hard to tell the state of the colas from the pics , but many are formed from quite spindly buds , so I 'm hoping theyll fatten up a bit more over the remaining week or two . 10985 @qwx420985

I 've never met a single grower who 's never had ANY problems . <p> So do n't beat yourself up when growing problems happen . They happen to every grower ! <p> Just remember - how you REACT to problems determines whether you harvest ounces of potent buds ... or end up totally killing your plants . I believe that the way growers react to problems is a strong reflection of their ability as a grower . I believe a grower who stays calm and figures out solutions to problems is capable of becoming a true growing master ! <p> 1 ) Temperature &amp; Humidity - They actually matter ! <p> A good growing environment is crucial to the health of your plants . When the temperature ( and to a lesser extent the humidity ) is too high or too low for your plants , your plants will not grow properly no matter what else you do , and buds just wo n't fatten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant stress such as hermies . <p> Too much heat ( or arid conditions ) will generally sap the strength of your plant and force it to drink more water than normal for plant transpiration ( the process of water movement through a plant and water evaporation through leaves , stems and flowers ) . A plant drinking more water than usual can have unexpected consequences . Sometimes hot , dry temps can cause unexpected nutrient burn ( plant tips curl or turn brown from high levels of nutrients ) because your plant is absorbing more nutrients than normal at the roots , alongside the extra water . <p> If there is a particular source of heat that is harming the plant ( like a hot grow light ) , you 'll know because the leaves closest to the source of the problem will wilt and turn a brownish color . Heat or light-stressed leaves/buds can also get bleached and appear pale or white . <p> A generally too-hot environment can cause the stems of your plant to droop as if under- or over-watered , even when there 's plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from extreme heat stress for too long may not recover and sometimes are unable to straighten their posture and continue growing . <p> Watch Your Humidity , too - Just remember that high humidity can help young plants grow faster , while Low humidity is crucial to prevent mold during the flowering/budding stage . <p> Humidity is a term used to describe the amount of water vapor present in the air at any given place , and the amount of water in the air is related to the local temperature . <p> It is common for new growers to not pay attention to humidity at all , and this can sometimes cause otherwise unexpected and/or unexplainable problems . <p> Young cannabis plants seem to grow fastest when the the relative humidity in the 40-70% range . <p> It 's especially common for young cannabis plants to show false signs of nutrient deficiencies when the relative humidity of the grow area drops below the optimal range , especially when things get really dry . <p> If plants are grown in constant dry conditions , they can adjust and some strains will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're provided with plenty of water at the roots . <p> Young plants , new clones , and vegetating plants that are used to more humid conditions tend to be hit the hardest by a dry spell . <p> In the flowering stage , when possible , humidity should be kept below 45% to prevent mold and increase resin production . <p> When humidity gets too high , the plant pulls excess water in through the leaves and increases your chances for mold . <p> Younger plants are relatively resilient , but high humidity is especially dangerous in the flowering stage because the insides of the buds can grow mold or bud rot and still look fine from the outside at first . <p> Additionally , there is some evidence that maintaining a low humidity environment in the flowering stage will help buds produce more terpenes ( giving buds a stronger natural scent ) and more trichomes ( possibly even increasing the potency of your buds ! ) . <p> What to do ... Get a temperature and humidity monitor . Control heat by whatever means necessary and keep humidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most setups with grow lights will require that you vent out hot air using a fan and/or an exhaust system . If you 're worried about the smell of cannabis , make sure any heated air being vented outside grow room/house gets filtered to remove the scent of cannabis . For example , many growers choose to get a carbon scrubber to " scrub " all odors before the hot air is blown outside . By creating good suction with an efficient exhaust system and adding a carbon scrubber , you can basically eliminate all smells from the grow room , inside and outside of the house . <p> When the humidity is too low ( air is dry ) , it 's important to make sure you provide plenty of fresh water to your plants at all times . You may need to reduce the amount of nutrients you 're providing as the plants will drink more water and therefore absorb more nutrients through their roots than when the humidity is not as dry . <p> An oscillating fan will circulate air in the room as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots from forming , and a small one will cost less than 10/$20 . More about air circulation in step 4 of this article ... <p> When it comes to controlling humidity indoors , you may need to use a humidifier and/or a dehumidifier to keep the humidity in the optimal range . A humidifier adds moisture to the air while a dehumidifier takes moisture out . <p> Controlling your grow room humidity is one of the tricks that separates the expert growers from the beginners . <p> Here 's the most important things to keep in mind when it comes to the humidity of your cannabis grow room . <p> Ideally , your grow room will have a humidity of 60%-70% during the vegetative stage , and should be lowered to below 45% during the flowering stage . <p> As your buds fatten up , it is beneficial to continue to drop the humidity of the grow area , if you can , to increase resin production and cause your plant to product more terpenes ( the stuff that makes your buds smell great ) , though lowering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into problems . <p> During the last 2-3 weeks before harvest , I use a dehumidifier to dramatically drop the humidity of my grow area as low as I can , which also prevents bud rot during the last few weeks . <p> As an added bonus , dropping the humidity this way during the last few weeks of your plant 's life increases trichome production , so you harvest sparkly , crystal-covered extra-potent buds . <p> With the right tools , the task of maintaining humidity can be close to automated , and you will see huge benefits compared to the amount of time and money you invest . <p> When the air feels moist or humid ( or a humidity monitor alerts you to high humidity ) , it 's extra important to ensure that plants get plenty of air circulation and have lots of air movement . You also want to avoid letting leaves touch each other during periods of high humidity . You can fix constantly too-humid conditions with an exhaust system , fans , and possibly a dehumidifier . <p> When the air is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your plants grow hardened to the arid air , or you can use something like a " swamp cooler " to add humidity while also reducing the temperature of your room . <p> Outdoors , you have less options to reduce heat during a heat wave than growing indoors . You have even fewer options when it comes to controlling humidity outdoors . However , you are able to monitor your local weather via forecasts , and you can use that knowledge to help you prepare for whatever conditions are coming . <p> It is possible to partially shield your plants when you know the temperature is going to get hot . You can also adjust your watering schedule to make sure plants at least have plenty of water . <p> Some things to try when you know the weather outside is going to be hot or dry : <p> water plants in the evening or early morning to help prevent water evaporation during the hottest hours <p> increase shade to reduce the heat experienced by plants - you can use an old sheet or other cloth as a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shade Sail " which is made particularly to create shade outdoors . It 's important to remember that giving plants shade for more than a few days will make them less " hardened " to the sun , and you may need to reintroduce full sunlight back slowly to prevent them from getting shocked from the light intensity <p> move potted plants - luckily with potted plants , it 's usually easier to move them out of direct sunlight during a heat wave <p> take extra good care of heat-stressed plants - when cannabis plants appear heat-stressed , try to baby them as best you can , and offer shade during the hottest days . <p> When growing cannabis outdoors , too humid conditions are harder to battle than purely high temps . <p> It can often take a few weeks for plant to recover after a hot or dry spell , so prevention is the best medicine for outdoor plants . <p> If you are growing cannabis plants outdoors , you should also be paying attention to humidity when watching your local weather forecast so you can prepare when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , it 's important to remove wind breaks that may be blocking wind from hitting your plants , which will increase airflow around the plants . By making sure plants are getting lots of fresh , moving air , you can combat mold and other problems normally associated with too-humid air . <p> Avoid over-watering plants during very humid conditions , and try to avoid allowing leaves to touch each other . Cannabis plants lose moisture through their leaves , and two leaves laying on top of each other during humid weather creates a humid environment for mold to take hold . Some light defoliation ( removing leaves ) may be needed to help prevent leafy outdoor plants from laying all over each other when it 's too humid , possibly creating the right conditions for mold to grow on the leaves or buds . <p> Keeping outdoor cannabis plants in pots or other moveable containers can be very beneficial when growing outdoors if you live close enough to your grow spot , because it gives you better ability to move the plants if needed to react to weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's very little you can do in bad weather besides wait and hope . <p> 2 ) Cannabis loves light ! <p> When growing cannabis , the mantra when it comes to lights is usually " More is better ! " To be honest ... it 's true ! More light usually is better ! <p> You see , light is like " food " for your marijuana plants . When plants are growing very slowly , but are n't showing signs of other problems , the cause is often that they are n't getting enough light . <p> The amount of light you give your plants is strongly correlated with fast your plants grow , as well as how much buds your plants will produce during the flowering stage . <p> Many new growers do n't realize they 're not giving their plants enough light . As a very general rule , you will need at least 100W worth of electricity going into your indoor grow light for the successful growth of one plant to harvest , even with efficient CFLs or LEDs , and more is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faster Growth <p> If plants are growing very slowly , if they 're not drinking much water , or otherwise are n't doing well without showing any other major signs of problems , often the problem is the plant simply needs more light to thrive . <p> General rule for yields : 0.5g/watt for new growers , 1g/watt for experienced growers <p> As a very general and unscientific rule , a new grower who does n't run into major problems can expect up to about 0.5g of yield per watt of light . An experienced grower can expect about 1g of yield per watt of light . <p> This rule is referring to how many watts of electricity are actually being pulled out of the wall , not some sort of " equivalent " amount of watts . If an LED pulls 90W of electricity from the wall , you should plug that into the equation , not the claim that it 's " equivalent " to a 400W HPS light . Same for CFLs , if you have a CFL bulb that pulls 26W of electricity from the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it says " equivalent to 100W " on the front . <p> Of course , this rule varies quite a bit depending on the type of light , the strain being grown , the size of the plants , etc . However , it 's a good general guide if you 're not sure how much light you need , and it can help you decide if you might not have enough light for your plants . <p> To put that into perspective ... <p> 100W of light will net the average grower about 50g or yield , or 1.7 ounces of dried bud 100W of light will net the experienced grower about 100g , or 3.5 ounces <p> Keep in mind that there are many other factors that go into this , and this is not a guarantee as much as a general rule . Moreover , smaller lights tend to get better yields per watt than fewer larger lights . Lights that are kept closer to plants ( without signs of light stress ) will also tend to produce bigger yields and faster growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training methods you use to get your plants to more efficiently use your indoor grow lights will have a huge impact on your growth rates and final yields . <p> But can there be too much light ? <p> Unfortunately , more light is not always better . Cannabis plants can be fickle . You want to give them very bright light ... but not too much light . <p> When marijuana plants are young , they are weak and can not tolerate much light at all . Yet as they get older , and especially in the flowering stage , marijuana plants want almost all the light they can get . <p> The problem of too much light often occurs indoors , when your grow lights are too close to the plants . This essentially gives them their own version of sunburn . <p> Young plants , seedlings and new clones are especially prone to suffering from too much light . <p> When growing outside ... It 's uncommon for mature marijuana plants to get too much light when they 're growing outside , though young seedlings can still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or plants can get stressed if moved from relative shade into bright light too suddenly . <p> The intensity of a grow light that is too close will dry up a plant , and turn the edges of its leaves brown and crispy , almost like nutrient burn . <p> High Pressure Sodium(HPS) lights have the meanest reputation for ' light-stressing ' plants , but many of the newer , more powerful LEDs ( Light Emitting Diodes ) do it , too ! <p> How can you tell if there 's too much light ? <p> The main way you know your plants are suffering from light burn is if only the leaves closest to the lights are affected . <p> What to Do : Most importantly , pay attention to your plant and watch out for signs of light stress , which will only affect the parts of the plant closest to your grow lights . <p> For HPS , Metal Halide and CFL grow lights , use the ' back of your hand ' test . <p> 1 . ) Set up your grow lights and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm up ) <p> 2 . ) Gently place your hand - palm down - right above the tallest part of your plant <p> 3 . ) Wait 10-15 seconds <p> 4 . ) If the heat coming from the light feels too warm for your hand , then it 's going to be too much light for your cannabis . <p> LEDs generate very little heat , but can still light-stress plants , so it 's best to keep high powered LEDs ( above 90 watts ) at least 10 inches away from your plants . When the individual bulbs are bigger than 1W ( for example if it has 3W or 5W bulbs ) , you 'll want to keep the lights even further away , up to 2-3 feet for some of the newer , extremely powerful LED grow lights . When it comes to LED lights , I highly recommend listening to the specifications from the manufacturer when it comes to how far away to keep the lights from your plants . <p> It 's hard to make exact rules about how far LED grow lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so different , so start with trusted lights that are proven for growing marijuana , and just be aware of the possibility of light stress . Start LED grow lights further from your plants than you think you should , and slowly move lights closer each day until you 've found the " sweet spot . " <p> To determine if your plant is getting light stressed from LED grow lights ( or very high-powered HPS grow lights ) , you use the appearance of your plant 's leaves to determine if the lights can be moved closer . <p> Use extreme caution when attempting to move your grow lights closer , and avoid moving them more than an inch closer in a day , so you can watch the plant 's reaction . <p> 3 ) Nutrient Problems &amp; Root pH <p> Cannabis nutrient problems are often closely related to the pH at the roots of your plants . That 's because when the root pH is off , it can cause your plant to show signs of a nutrient deficiency , even if the nutrients are actually there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root pH in almost all growing setups for the best results . The only method of growing that consistently gets good results without monitoring pH is growing cannabis in composted super soil . The reason you do n't need to monitor pH in that type of setup is you are actually creating a workforce of beneficial microbes in the soil that act as the " middleman " to monitor the pH for you . They will automatically adjust the pH so that your plants can absorb nutrients unless your water is extremely acidic or alkaline . Unfortunately , without growing in composted super soil , it is important for cannabis growers to regularly monitor root pH to prevent nutrient problems . <p> Some growers get lucky and the pH of their water and soil happen to be just right without any additional adjustment or monitoring . Yet most growers will still achieve better growing results by monitoring pH , and knowing your pH will give you additional information to help understand when things are going wrong with the plant for seemingly no reason . <p> For those who are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , or for growers looking for a simple way to ensure that all grows go smoothly , there 's easy steps you can take to make sure your plants get exactly what they need . <p> Nutrient and root pH problems are easy to solve with the right information ! <p> What to Do : The goal is to give your plant exactly the kind of nutrients it needs to thrive , and provide the correct pH at the roots so your plants can properly absorb nutrients . <p> it 's important you learn a little bit about what kind of nutrients are needed by the cannabis plant during different stages of growth . These days , there 's lots of nutrient systems available that are specifically formulated for plants like cannabis , and they help take all the guesswork out and give your plants exactly the nutrients they need . It does n't have to be expensive to provide everything you cannabis plant needs ! <p> Now here 's what you need to do , depending on whether your growing in a soilless medium ( like coco coir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant roots directly in water ... <p> Potted plants ... when you believe there may be a problem with the nutrients or pH with your plants that live in a container , it is often a good idea to " flush " plants with 2-3x the size of your container 's worth of pH'ed nutrient water ( usually at half strength ) . For the best results with flushing , water should be able to drain freely from the bottom of your container . If water is not draining freely , or if it takes plants a long time to dry between waterings , you may actually have a problem with drainage . <p> This will replace missing nutrients in addition to getting rid of excess salts that build up over time which can mess with your pH or otherwise prevent nutrient absorption . <p> Hydroponic plants with roots in water ... when you believe there may be a problem with the nutrients or pH , it is often a good idea to completely change your water reservoir and replace it with fresh pH'ed nutrient water . When growing cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on at the roots is the " PPM " of your water . This is a measure of how much " stuff " is in the water , and can give you information about what 's happening with your nutrients and pH if you 're experiencing problems . <p> Because you 've just flushed your plant , provided the exact nutrients she needs , and adjust the pH to the proper level , you will clear up any possible causes of nutrient deficiencies . <p> Once you 're positive you 're providing the nutrients your cannabis needs , and you 've adjusted the water pH to the proper levels , you should notice any nutrients problems clearing up quickly . Remember , if leaves get damaged from a nutrient problem , it is unlikely that particular leaf will ever recover and turn green . What you 're looking for is that the problem stops spreading , and that any new growth appears green and healthy . <p> 4 ) Breeze &amp; Air Circulation . <p> Its important for air to be moving around your plants to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of fresh CO2 to achieve the best growth . <p> Having air moving constantly around your plants will also help stop pests from attacking your grow room , and will even help prevent mold ( especially the dreaded white powdery mildew ) . <p> When it comes to fans , do n't  point fans directly at plants - usually its better to be point fans at a wall to disperse the air , or have fans blowing over or the plant canopy . <p> Best case scenario is you want to set up your fan system so that all the leaves on the plant are gently rustling , yet no stems or branches are waving around from the force of the wind . <p> One of the reasons you need great air circulation is your plants " breathe " CO2 during the light hours , almost like we breathe oxygen . <p> Unless your plants are in a big open space with lots of air , or you are supplying your plants with CO2 , you need to have some sort of exhaust system to pull away hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . <p> An exhaust system does n't have to be anything fancy . At its simplest , an exhaust system can be two holes and a fan ( with the fan place in one of the holes pointed out from your grow area ) . Having a fan constantly pulling hot air out and bringing fresh air in from your intake hole will help ensure that your plants have the CO2 they need . <p> Because your plants need CO2 when the lights are on in order to function properly , a completely sealed off grow box is not good unless you 're artificially adding CO2 - your plants will suffer if they do n't  get enough CO2 in a sealed grow box even if the temps are completely under control . <p> Many growers like to supplement their plant with extra CO2 in an attempt to increase yields or growth rate , but it 's important to note that the amount of CO2 found in regular air is plenty for your plants unless you have extremely powerful grow lights ( 1000W HPS , high power LEDs , etc ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air before your plants have maxed out on the amount of light they use will not help plants grow any faster , and high levels of CO2 are dangerous to humans so you could be doing more harm than good by adding CO2 if you do n't have the right setup . <p> For most growers , a proper exhaust system and a few strategically placed fans is all you need when it comes to air circulation . <p> 5 ) Maintain Healthy Roots . <p> In a metaphorical sense , the roots are the heart of your cannabis plants . <p> When roots become sick , the health of the entire plant quickly falls apart . <p> Yet sometimes , cannabis plants with sick roots show no signs that there are any problems until things become grim . <p> Luckily , it 's easy to check for issues and even easier to solve them with one of a few options . <p> To check for root problems , smell the root area of your plants . Go on , no one 's looking ! <p> If you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water comes out . The water that runs out the bottom should generally have a neutral smell ; a ' stinky ' smell is an indicator that your plant may be suffering from ' root rot ' or other problems . <p> Some tips for healthy roots <p> Water potted plants properly ! Make sure water can drain freely from potted plants , and do n't  water too often <p> Make sure that roots get access to plenty of oxygen . With potted plants this is accomplished by making sure the growing medium is relatively loose and has plenty of extra space for air ( many growers add more air pockets by adding extra perlite ) . In a hydroponic setup where the roots are growing directly in water , generally the more bubbles the better , as this dissolves lots of oxygen directly in the water . Water that is a lower temperature can also hold more oxygen than water at a higher temperature , which is why controlling temps is so extra important in hydroponics setups ! <p> Certain supplements help keep roots healthy ( more info below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything besides soil , coco coir , etc ) , know how to take care of your plants in their growing medium ! For example it can be difficult to grow cannabis in something like straight perlite unless you maintain a water reservoir because perlite can not hold any water - straight rockwool is bad for the opposite reason , it holds onto a lot of water and not enough air . Your plant roots can not ever be allowed to dry out , and they should also never be sitting in stagnant water . Roots need a mixture of moist conditions and plenty of oxygen to make sure plant grows as fast as possible . <p> What to do : <p> If you think you may have root problems , here 's what to do : <p> 1 . ) Address the problem that is causing the root problems <p> Possible Triggers For Root ProblemsHeat - cannabis is more likely to have root problems at higher **25;1512;TOOLONG potted plants - too much watering tends to cause root problemsBad or no drainage - roots will " drown " when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you provide cannabis plants with enough water to get at least 20% extra runoff water every time - if you 're not getting 20% runoff out the bottom when watering it means you need to either improve drainage or give more water each time ) Hydroponics - Root problems are caused when there 's not enough oxygen in the water , usually caused because there is n't enough bubbles and/or aeration <p> Cannabis Plants With Root Problems Show Many Symptoms <p> Cannabis may appear overwatered or droopy <p> Curling or cupping of leaves <p> Wilting - either individual stems wilt or the whole plant may wilt <p> Leaf yellowing <p> Brown spots / Burnt spots <p> Other strange nutrient problems <p> Brown or slimy roots - this is often a sign of root rot <p> Smelly runoff water ( smells rotting or musty ) <p> Leaves may start dying and falling off rapidly <p> Plants drink much less water than usual <p> Certain strains are more prone to root problems than others , but good root practices will allow every plant to thrive ! <p> 2 . ) ( Optional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feed . <p> Aquashield is my favorite root supplement , it 's cheap and will build up colonies of good bacteria that out-compete the bad bacteria and actually promote plant growth . <p> In addition , the beneficial bacteria will offer protection for those times when the temperature of the grow area rises at a time when you ca n't control it . When I first got started with bubbleponics , I had a few tough bouts with root rot , and Aquashield has saved my plants many times . <p> Over the last few years , I 've tried many " good bacteria " products including the ( $$$ ) Great White and Subculture B additives , but no product has ever worked as good for at maintaining healthy roots as super cheap , readily available Aquashield . <p> Another common root supplement is kelp extract for roots , usually provided as a small amount of liquid fertilizer that contains seaweed kelp extract . These types of supplements can help protect against heat stress , but may not be suitable for many hydroponic setups as the organic material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mold <p> Growing marijuana hydroponically is often simpler for beginners , because this automatically eliminates many of the bug problems growers run into when growing in soil . <p> So many growers struggle with bugs , and just by growing cannabis with a soil-less medium like coco coir , you dramatically reduce the chances of bug infestations . <p> However , even when growing hydroponically , the right conditions can make your cannabis plants themselves , not the soil , a breeding ground for bugs such as whiteflies , caterpillars , spidermites , and gnats . <p> When growing in soil , bugs are a common pest to marijuana gardens . <p> Mold can be just as annoying as bugs , and can be contagious between plants in the same room , and even the same house ! <p> As with bugs , your soil-less growing medium is relatively safe from mold when growing with hydroponics , so only the plant and its environment need the treatment . <p> What to Do : If you notice any signs of bugs or mold , do n't wait . Act quickly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers are spider mites . They actually have earned the nickname " the borg " because of their ability to seemingly come back from the dead and take over an entire grow room or destroy a whole crop . <p> When you believe you have bugs , the first step is to identify what type of bugs or pests you actually have . <p> For many bugs , pests , and molds , SM-90 is miracle cure with a uniquely delicious citrus scent . It 's perfectly safe for humans and animals , so you can use it even when you 're just a few weeks away from harvest . <p> Mix 1 part SM-90 to 5 parts water , and mist the leaves of your plant ( I use a mister ) when the lights are off . <p> This will stop mold and shield the treated parts from further mold infestation . SM-90 also deters many types of bugs including caterpillars , gnats , spidermites , aphids , and other creepy crawlies . <p> SM-90 kills most bugs/mold instantly on contact , and will protect your plant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dead bugs after your first treatment , then mist the plant once more for an armor-plated plant . <p> Also consider adding an oscillating fan to your grow room to get air moving over the leaves . <p> As mentioned in step 4 , good air circulation and a slight breeze is not only good for the plant by itself , but will also disturb bugs AND prevent excess moisture on the leaves which acts as a major deterrent for mold . <p> 7 ) Still Not Sure ? Here Are Your Next Steps ... <p> Going through the previous steps will solve quite a few different problems you could be running into , but what if none of the ones mentioned so far seems to apply to your problem ? <p> If you 've gone through all the above steps , and you 're still having an unexplained growing problem , the following list of common plant problems may help you discover exactly what you need to do next ... <p> Boron Deficiency <p> Calcium Deficiency <p> Copper Deficiency <p> Heat Stress <p> Iron Deficiency <p> Light Burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nitrogen Deficiency <p> Nitrogen Toxicity <p> Nutrient Burn <p> Over watering <p> Pests , Bugs &amp; Viruses <p> PH Fluctuations <p> Phosphorus Deficiency <p> Potassium Deficiency <p> Root Rot <p> Spider Mites <p> Sulfur Deficiency <p> Under-watering <p> White Powdery Mildew <p> Zinc Deficiency <p> Congratulations ! <p> By now , you 've obtained the knowledge to give your plants a crucial and important check-up to ensure that they can live to make you some great cannabis .

@@46022262 @6022262/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> The Exodus Collective : History of UK Cheese <p> The Exodus Collective : History of UK Cheese <p> Say the word Cheese and most growers will understand exactly what people mean ... a specific type of clone only cannabis . Mention the word Exodus however and most people will think of a chapter in the bible and not the Free Party movement which helped fashion the future of cannabis culture in the UK during the early 90s <p> The Exodus collective were a group of like minded people from Luton England . The Exodus Collective openly campaigned for the immediate legalization of cannabis during the late 1080s into the early 1990s . As part of their campaign for a sane drug policy the exodus collective challenged the criminalization of cannabis by openly smoking and growing cannabis . The exodus collective also helped spearhead the underground Rave Scene in the early 1990s by organizing free rave party once monthly . A unique feature of the exodus collective and exodus raves was the NO DEALING policy which was strictly adhered to at events . So much so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drug dealing they could act upon . One police officer actually praised the exodus collective or there sensible approach to drug use . The Exodus Collective also managed there own Fair Trade policy at events . The collectives own price policy ensured that no one was making excessive profits from the sail of food and drinks at the parties . Following a series of Free Partys several plots of farmland were occupied . An abandoned hotel , and empty warehouse and so on . The idea was to clean up the local neighbourhood a series of community projects . The land became known as HAZ manor ( Housing Action Zone ) . UK cheese The exact origin of cheese is hotly debated by cheese fanatics online . Some suggest that it desends from a packet of Skunk#1 by sensi-seeds others indicate that it came from a packet of skunk#1 from sacred seeds . All do agree however that cheese is a clone of skunk#1 from the 19 80s . <p> During this time sam the skunkman who is accredited as the original breeder of skunk#1 had moved from California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding his Skunk#1 line . Sams skunk was called skunk because it omitted a strong pungent smell when grown or smoked . Similar to that given off by a skunk . Growers in Holland loved sams skunk because it yielded more and finished sooner then other strains at the time . The only problem was the smell ! ! Landlords were reporting growers and people were busted all over . Sam the skunkman intestinally bred out the smell in favour of a sweeter smell Over the next few generations the skunk smell was intestinally lost . <p> The Exodus collective obtained a packet of seeds before these changes took place . The seeds were sown out and cuttings were taken . The clones were freely distributed among the collective . On flowering out one of the plants the collective discovered it had a very special smell . Folklore suggests that there was a slight panic to fint a cutting still in veg so genetics could be preserved for later . Further investigation found that an old lady still had a few plants growing on her bathroom window . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese clones were distributed freely as gifts from the exodus collective . Grateful home growers still distribute the original cheese to home growers for free . <p> If you grow/use medical marijuana you are a criminal , to be classed as a patient you need to buy drugs from the goverment . Cannamancan . <p> Category Articles of Interest New Strains 0 Since its first appearance in the UK over 20 years ago , the 1989 UK Exodus cheese clone has become increasingly popular to grow and to smoke within the British cannabis community and it has also travelled far abroad and is now probably on every major landmass on the planet and is testimony to its huge popularity . <p> The actual genetics of The Cheese originated from a Skunk#1 female that supposedly underwent a spontaneous mutation , it was radically changed at the genetic level and is called a sport by plant breeders . This changed its chemotype/resin profile to the very flavoursome very rich taste enjoyed by so many today . It was then passed on to the Exodus collective at Haz manor in Luton , Essex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exodus was a major part of UK dance culture and the rave scene in the 90s and was a real thorn in the side of the authorities as they put on massive partys and usually on the ruling elites massive country estates and farms , something the then Conservative government under Thatcher tried hard to suppress . And it was from Haz manor , an old hospital or nursing home the collective renovated , that The Cheese was disseminated into the wider cannabis community . <p> So The Cheese existed as an elite clone for many years until Big Buddha from Birmingham took a non dominant Afghani to use his actual words , and crossed it with the Exodus clone and back crossed it , meaning he grew out the seeds from the first cross and took pollen from the males and again pollinated the Exodus Mum and is why it is called an incestuous back cross . He repeated this several times and produced what is known today as Big Buddhas Cheese . Others soon followed and there are now many Cheese hybrids , like Space Cheese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some having cheesy qualities and some having very little resemblance to the original as it is almost impossible to breed all the qualities of the Cheese into seed form , especially when using a different strain as the other parent and especially with the low plant numbers and limited space most cannabis breeders have to work with given the current political climate . <p> There is however one company , Kaliman Seeds , whose principle breeder , Rockster , has produced a strain called Cheese#1 and is the result not of a cross with another strain but is the result of another mutation , a spontaneous sexual reversal ( google it , it happens ! ) where a female Exodus clone when put into flower grew out as a normal , healthy male and not a hermaphrodite and when used to pollinate sister clones produced seed that when grown out produced a perfect representation of the Exodus clone as Cheese#1 is genetically identical to the original and this makes it totally unique amongst all the available Cheese strains out there and is the only Cheese strain that totally does what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is The Cheese and can not be picked out in blind taste tests and yields about 30% more than the Exodus clone . <p> This has been borne out in extensive independent testing with the results to be seen on many online cannabis forums and within its first 6 months of trading Kaliman Seeds has won 3 cannabis cups , the latest being at the 11th Canarias Cup , an event in the Canary Islands where Cheese#1 won a 3rd prize trophy in the Copa Pro or Pro Cup , an all comers category with more entrants than all other categories combined and had almost 500 people attending on the day and so is one of the major cannabis events out there . Rockster entered this particular event as the judging is done over several days , unlike most other events that do it all on one day and which is a terrible way to judge cannabis ! It might be fun trying 10 strains at one sitting but no way can you judge the various merits of individual strains objectively and was why Rockster jumped at the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So the secret is out , if you want perfect cheese from seed it is now finally available <p> if you want the real cheese then buy kalimans rockster cheese lol there goes all the love of what the true exo is all about , its a clone that is freely passed around for the past 20 years but now people can finally cash in on it lmfao so sad <p> if you want the real cheese then buy kalimans rockster cheese lol there goes all the love of what the true exo is all about , its a clone that is freely passed around for the past 20 years but now people can finally cash in on it lmfao so sad <p> Going to have to agree with you on that seymore ... however it is nice to be able to get hold of similar genetics it does kind of undermind the ethics of exodus . <p> This is a great documentary about the exodus community , if u can stand the bastard presenter . <p> hi can i just say this is not a one of plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dam in 93 i paid 35fl me thinks and a pkt of sensi skunk same price and i got one out of a pkt of 15 none the wiser at the time unfortunately so to say or even think that this is a one off is laughable like there was only one ak47 cherry pheno EVER lol.all the best <p> yeah if you know of the exodus history you will know what they stood and what the clone actually represents and why passing the clone around is a respect of what the movement was about and a way of keeping the vibe alive <p> obviously we now live in an era where egos rule and money is king what people stand for no longer matters as long as you have a phat bank balance , why would you even wan na dis-respect something that stood for freedom and love <p> hi cannaman well 10 thank 's ( more coming ) says it all good info for those who do n't know about the cheese and you right there 's more than 2 lol.the people with it just do n't distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skunk#1 offered by sensi ai n't what it used to be as in different plants.did neville take the parents with him when he left ? have sensi lost the original parents ? 2 valid questions imo.but personally if i was looking at finding something that resembles cheese today i would be looking at a strain called shit by mr nice as if neville did take the parents i ca n't think of anyone who he would trust more than fellow aussie shantibaba who he is very good friends with and also a breeder.all the best <p> hi cannaman well 10 thank 's ( more coming ) says it all good info for those who do n't know about the cheese and you right there 's more than 2 lol.the people with it just do n't distribute clones which is understandable considering the hobby lol.i personally think the skunk#1 offered by sensi ai n't what it used to be as in different plants.did neville take the parents with him when he left ? have sensi lost the original parents ? 2 valid questions imo.but personally if i was looking at finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strain called shit by mr nice as if neville did take the parents i ca n't think of anyone who he would trust more than fellow aussie shantibaba who he is very good friends with and also a breeder.all the best <p> wtf are you chatting bruv , everybody i know who has the orig clone will happily pass it around which is why its still alive today <p> yeah if you know of the exodus history you will know what they stood and what the clone actually represents and why passing the clone around is a respect of what the movement was about and a way of keeping the vibe alive <p> obviously we now live in an era where egos rule and money is king what people stand for no longer matters as long as you have a phat bank balance , why would you even wan na dis-respect something that stood for freedom and love <p> just my opinion <p> hi seymour buds got to agree bud well said.in this day and age the golden rule is.it 's the man with the gold that rules.which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the opposite infact.all the best <p> wtf are you chatting bruv , everybody i know who has the orig clone will happily pass it around which is why its still alive today <p> hi seymour buds it is saying i had that plant in seed form not cutting so there 's 2 i know of.all the best ps good on you for doing what was a generous thing by the exodus crew recieve the clone and pass it on to at least 2 fellow growers yeah ? 10985 @qwx420985

Towards the end of flowering the vast majority of leaves are yellow . Can anyone she 'd any light on this ? <p> Difficult to diagnose without pictures but it sounds like nitrogen deficiency which can sometimes happen if you start to use bloom nutrients when you switch to 12/12 . If you continue to feed with grow nutes until they 've stopped stretching ( around 2 weeks ) you should find they remain green until you begin to flush . <p> Having yellow leaves at the very end of your grow is a good thing tbh , means your flush is working and the plant has used up all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" I 'm not trying to be rude but for the last time you 're buds are n't growing cos they 're not getting enough nutes . The dampness of the coco is irrelevant it 's the amount of feed that matters and the plants will use that every day cos coco does n't store nutes like soil does .

Judging on the amount of nute burn you have , which is evidenced on the leaf tips , I would reduce the amount of nutrients in the mix so your EC reads between 1.4 - 1.6 max but feed more often than you are as per illearths advice . <p> I do n't wish to get into a debate about the watering frequency of coco or disagree with anyone , but I 've been growing in coco for around 7 years , never grown in anything else and like yourself I water every 2-3 days when using big pots , more often in smaller pots . Some people water little and often , ( drip feeders for instance ) personally I prefer to flood my plants and give them a couple of days to use up the solution then flood again . Its all about personal choice so long as you do n't  let them dry out completely , there 's no right and wrong imo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of N which is why your fan leaves are yellowing early in flower and continue to do so throughout the grow , eventually dying and falling off . Very difficult to tell from those pics as they 're mature buds , and should be yellowing at this stage . Do you have any pics from earlier in the grow when the trouble started ? Would make a diagnosis much simpler for anyone trying to help . <p> No earlier pics unfortunatly . Illearth67 - I was n't trying to say that I know better ........ just that I thought that as the soil was remaining damp then I thought that they were n't over fed . If that could be the case , I 'll certainly give feeding every day a go next time round , thanks for the suggestion . I did n't think I 'd get nute burn with a 2.0 max EC but I 'll stick to 1.6 next time then ............... it 's all a learning curve ! Thanks for the advice all . <p> I 've been having very similar . Perfect through veg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellowing spreading fast . <p> Judging from the way its appeared to happen in my place and my mates in mainly the intensest light parts of the room , and after going through all sorts of nutes trials and what not , I reckon for me it could be as simple as bleaching due to light being too close . Ignore the heat stress side of things , I reckon you can have bleaching without heat stress , and this time I 'm trialing putting my lights up a bit . <p> You mention the difference between yours and your mates is the fact he has a cooltube type light and so there is a pane of glass between the light and plants . <p> Could potentially just be a little too close mate , not a definite but a thought to consider , espec given your mates is the same bar the reflector . 10985 @qwx420985

I 've looked at the lowriders ( #1 and #2 ) and was wondering if you lot know of anything else ? <p> Fems preferably , so I do n't have to dick about too much pulling the boys out ! <p> Sea of Green is meant to be done with female cuttings all from the same mother so you have uniformity of growth . Doing it with seperate seeds is just growing them out normally and hoping that they all grow in the same fashion , just a normal grow . Cheers <p> Whilst traditionally I would agree , this is an extract taken from cannabis-seed-banks.com : <p> ' Sea of Green ( SOG ) is the theory of harvesting lots of small plants , matured early to get the fastest production of buds available . Instead of growing a few plants for a longer period of time , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in less time . Thus , less time is required between crops . ' <p> So tell me why this is n't possible with autos ? They are generally quite small , they mature early , and you could generally get them closer than regular strains . <p> Plus , I seem to fail miserably at taking cuttings , so this seems like a good idea .... <p> your better off buying 1 female seed very cheap ! vegging her for a few weeks untill she 's really bushy ! then skin her for her cuttings ! Bommmb ! you have as many plants in a SOG as you want bro ! to achieve a single cola you 'll have to trim off all lower nodes before flipping into flower . <p> In the mean time , I 'm hovering around Big Buddha 's ' Automatic ' , so maybe when my scrog is finished I 'll get this one going . It 's a crying shame I wo n't be able to do a diary on it though , as it 'll be a bit over the 10 plant rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space provided , so I 've tried the scrog , and now I 'm gon na have a go at an Auto SOG . <p> Taking cuttings can be quite easy , depending on the strain , some will root a lot faster than others , once they have a nice little root mass going on you can pop them in soil and treat them like normal seedlings until they get their veg on again <p> One thing above that people neglected to mention was the time it will take .. to grow out a mother ( hoping she 's good - if you do n't have time to flower her first ) To get 20 decent sized cuttings you 'd need 4-6 weeks of Veg time . Then another 2 weeks to root cuttings . So say that 's 8 weeks - you could have An AF-SOG pretty much ready for harvest by then/ <p> And all in one space .. If you go the route of keeping mothers and taking cuttings &amp; flowering at the same time .. you will need two grow areas . <p> To answer your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , as they are supposed to be single cola dominant .. but all of mine were pretty branchy and bushy . <p> Lr*1 - the potency is n't there if you going to be smoking on it for a few months Lr*2 - whilst a very nice smoke .. and fast flowering , can be branchy too . <p> growing out a tent full of autos is gon na cost you alot more money in seeds than a cheap CFL will to keep 1 mother ! plus taking cuttings you 'll get a perfectly even canopy , with seeds you can get different phenotypes and your canopy can end up all over the place . yes a mother will take you 6 weeks to grow but once she 's big enough , the jobs done . and you can root cuttings in 7 days if the conditions are good with a heat mat that 's my opinion anyway <p> I used to do ak47 autos in a sog set up . Now if you grow a few auto AKs and give them plenty of room they will branch like crazy and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sog set up its very different . The lower leafs are covered by the top of the canopy and the energy is absorbed by the leafs on the top canopy . The leafs below that are not being lit up and not receiving light energy . not photosynthesizing . You will still get lower growth but very very little . The way the lower leafs grow is by stealing energy from the upper leafs . All this makes for very little lower growth . Some would argue that its not a good thing as the upper leafs and cola is losing energy to compensate the lower leafs and will prune the useless lower leafs . I just leave them ! Anyway getting back to the auto aks , What you will find is that they just grow taller and from the top canopy upwards you just get one extra tall main cola .

Rather than being truthful about the issue , Rhino made claims that they used to be Phat and now they are Rhino , as if Phat became Rhino under their tutelage . How does Rhino say this on their site ? <p> " Recently there has been a copy right issue regarding the name Phat filters we used to use . Due to the success of the court order we had to re brand our filters . " <p> Hmmmm , that is quite a stretch ! Rhino , you did n't  rebrand " your " filters . You never owned or manufactured Phat filters in the past so you did n't  rebrand anything . You simply used to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters and call them Rhino and the two do not come from the same factory ! Due to the success of the court order , you decided to trick the consumer to attempt to keep the business away from the REAL manufacturer of Phat filter , the real owner of the brand . Furthermore , you attempt to deceive the consumer into thinking that Phat filter became Rhino . Well , it did not . Phat filter is still Phat filter and being sold world wide . Rhino is a new brand you made to satiate your lust for money . <p> Lie : We do not manufacture filters under the name Phat filters anymore . <p> Fact : You never did Rhino . You never owned or operated a filter manufacturing facility , period ! You never manufactured Phat filters ! <p> Lie : Nobody can buy charcoal from Ti-West Australia . <p> Fact : Anybody can buy charcoal from Ti-West Australia <p> Lie : Ti-West mines the best charcoal on planet <p> Fact : The Ti-West charcoal being used by Rhino has an Iodine test value ( test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mg. /gram . Much better charcoals can be purchased from any mine in the world including Ti-West . To increase the Iodine test value of a charcoal , you simply activate it more but this was too costly for Rhino so they settled on a mediocre charcoal at best . The iodine test is the ONLY significant test to determine the efficacy of charcoal for adsorption , whether that charcoal be pelletized or virgin . <p> Rhino , if you want to pretend to take the high road after selling illegally branded Phat filters , why not tell the consumer the truth ? Tell the world that you created the brand Rhino to try and keep the real owners of the Phat brand from accessing a market you stole from them in the first place by selling the illegally branded Phat filters . <p> Rhino , do you use RC 48 or RC 412 charcoal ? You claim to use both ! You do n't  even know what this means do you ? Evidently not because you claim to use both mesh sizes when one size encompasses the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charcoal ? Oops ! Yes , you must activate and re-screen the Ti-West charcoal at a third partys facility in order to get RC 48 now because Ti-West no longer makes it ! Do you really know about charcoal , Rhino filters ? You simply copied what you were told to copy by the accountant for the illegally branded Phat filters and now you think you have a good filter ? How many accountants know how to make charcoal filters ? Is this your professional team ? <p> Rhino , what are you going to tell the court when asked why you deceived the public in such a determined and nefarious way ? The only thing world class about the Rhino is the world class lies told to market the product . <p> Adambomb <p> 04-07-11 , 06:44 PM <p> if they 're so shit why is mine still great 16 months after purchase ? , tbh i hav n't tried any other filters and mine is due for replacement soon i 'd guess , i was just gon na replace like for like but if there is better cf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you buy them ? genuine q ! <p> Tester <p> 04-07-11 , 06:49 PM <p> I use rhino myself mate no smell at all so i know what your saying , just thought it was an interesting read <p> Notorious WD <p> 04-07-11 , 06:50 PM <p> I 'm with you bomber , i have a rhino in each of my tents and supremely happy with them ! <p> Adambomb <p> 04-07-11 , 07:01 PM <p> maybe it 's someone with sour grapes who wrote that ? ? there does seems to be alot of bitchiness in horticultural world , du n no why like , i think growing ( or smoking lol ) weed calmed me down alot to how i was like 2 year ago so i just get on with life and smoke that shit in me own little bubble , ca n't imagine meself even gi'in a feck enough to write a letter like that tbh lol , you ca n't beleive everything you read online , although it does influence your thinking to be negative of people and things in a way , like satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more i will continue with the rhinos most likely until summet better gets invented , dey priddy good mon . <p> Notorious WD <p> 04-07-11 , 07:08 PM <p> exactly , ive already said on here before i was looking at 2 years for affray for hitting a lad who punched my mate on the sly . if it were not for the birth of my kid i 'd be doing bird , then i discovered the wonderful bliss of ganja and now i do n't  give a fuck about anyone or anything other than my family and chilling , i feel at one with myself now where as i was always on edge before ... <p> anyway back to thread , rhino 's are the best on the market for the hobby grower and i cant see anything knocking them off their perch anytime soon . <p> Anabolic <p> 04-07-11 , 07:48 PM <p> That article or 80% of the forum and I 've used a RHINO in the past <p> I know who I believe <p> RHINO PRO are top of the range filters <p> Anonymiss <p> 04-07-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OP which says that Rhino filters do n't work , just that their advertising copy is of dubious accuracy . <p> Tabbatha <p> 04-07-11 , 08:36 PM <p> Hey , tester . <p> May I enquire as to where you found that article ? <p> : ) <p> Law Abiding Citizen <p> 04-07-11 , 10:10 PM <p> sorry mate but that 's bull shit , iv used cheap filters ( not worth a wank ) did n't  finish a grow ! ! , mountain air and rhinos and tbh rhino the best only becos they last about a grow longer but i easy got 2 yrs from both , I 'd LIKE TO NO WHATS BETTER THO ? ? ? ? <p> jobby2812 <p> 04-07-11 , 10:20 PM <p> May I enquire as to where you found that article ? <p> First link in this google search : LONG ... <p> Adambomb <p> 05-07-11 , 03:37 AM <p> I do n't see anything in the OP which says that Rhino filters do n't work , just that their advertising copy is of dubious accuracy . <p> aye yeah , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i missed that entire point rendering my entire statement useless and pointless like lol , what i should have said was nowt hence my new avatar lol . <p> well done for guiding a stoner back into the light of the real world where it sucks and he 's always wrong lol . <p> UsuallyWasted <p> 05-07-11 , 07:22 AM <p> who gives a fuck as long as they work , happy with mine anyhow . <p> Spetsnaz <p> 05-07-11 , 08:40 AM <p> Yea my Rhino kept 100% of the smell in so they definitely do work well . <p> Tester <p> 06-07-11 , 06:07 PM <p> just through google tabba who ever done it set up a blog about it , just google rhino lies its the 5th link down <p> zen archer <p> 06-07-11 , 06:27 PM <p> Well guys , no doubt everyone happy with their Rhino filter .

While the debate continues on whether flushing is truly necessary or not , I 'll just say this , I 've smoked weed for over 30 years , I 've been growing for 20+ and I always flush and would always advocate flushing to others , if you 've ever had a bowl that sparks or leaves a dark ash , that 's unflushed nutrients/salt , I believe it affects both taste and quality , IMVHO , only truly organic gardens can get away without a flush <p> The following article by Kyle Kushman ..... <p> " Curing is a lengthy subject . I believe the art of curing is more difficult to master than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To begin with glass jars are the only way to cure properly . Unfortunately they are clear , so find a spot in a closet or corner of the house that is dark and free from large temperature variances . <p> Drying must be done properly before curing can begin . If drying is not done properly by quickening , over drying , under drying , or anything else , curing can not even be attempted . Buds should be dried to a point that may not burn perfectly in a joint . It burns well , but it would have been tastier if the bud had been left out to dry for just a few more hours . That 's all it would take for it to turn crispy . It still has a little spring in it . <p> Place buds into a glass jar . The jars should be full to the top to expel the majority of air . You need air and some moisture as they allow the aerobic bacteria to come to life . They will consume chlorophyll and make your buds smoke smoother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The trick is to leave the proper moisture content in the bud , in relation to its particular density . Relative humidity and air temperature when jarring will play a role as well . The presence of air , light , and water are all that 's necessary for these bacteria to spring to life . Leaving just enough water and air to allow the bacteria to feed on the chlorophyll , but not enough to proliferate throughout the jar . When they run out of air , they die . So opening the jar is counter-productive to curing . Although it is necessary to pinpoint whether or not you got it right . <p> If you do n't  leave any moisture in the buds there will be no true cure , one that increases potency through a rotation of the THC molecule by slowly removing the water . The best way to learn is to jar a half dozen or more jars of the same size , at the same time . Date the jar , and in a week crack it open . <p> Catch the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the curing gases . If you smell the slightest whiff of ammonia , you left too much moisture in the buds and this curing attempt is done . Remove all the buds from the jars and dry them out completely . If however when you crack the jar , you smell sweet heavenly ganja , then close it up . Repeat the process in a week to check the progress of your cure . If you 've kept the jars closed for a full two weeks and the odour is 100% free of any ammonia smell , your probably home free . <p> I have cured buds for 6 months that came out as fresh and pliable as when they went in . Although 2-3 weeks is enough for a good cure . I do n't  fully appreciate the bouquet of most strains after a month of intense curing . You can keep buds sealed and curing for up to 2 years . Although that will take a lot of practice . " <p> My personal preference is to hang dry in either a large mesh net or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a net/mesh remember to turn the buds regularly , temps between 20-24c and humidity between 40-50% is desirable , too low and it 'll dry too quick , too high and it 'll take too long and be prone to mold , use a fan to circulate the air , but not blowing directly on the buds , depending on the conditions , 5-7 days , then in to rubber sealed jars , store jars in a cool , dark place , cubby hole , wardrobe etc , open/burp the jars for 15-20 minutes 2 x daily , exchanging stale air. , even after a week you 'll notice a big difference in the smoke , burns more evenly and is smoother on inhaling , taste better and more potency ... hope this is helpful to someone 10985 @qwx420985

There is nothing to say that you will get bud rot if your only sticking the stem in water as is done in my link 2 posts above . Your not getting the buds wet and on top of that it is no different than if you were to clone . Your only supposed to put the stem in water so the plant can carry on drinking as effectively you have cut the roots off . This in turn helps the plant to use up what nute it has stored and then during the dark period some of these nutes will end up going back down the stalk when the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between doing the emergancy flush and hydro is in hydro the plant still has it 's roots . Also with the emergancy flush your only trying to keep the plant alive for the last 3 or 4 days . <p> Obviously if your doing hydro in the first place then there would n't be the need to do an emergancy flush as all you would do is empty your res and fill it with plain water . <p> Remember there is more than one way to skin a cat as they say . No different to growing cannabis . There are several tried and tested methods to growing it . No one way is the correct or even the best way . What might work for one person might not work for the next .

Sarah Flowers has been growing for over 14 years &amp; is a well respected member of the cannabis community - if her way was n't giving her an ' edge ' she would do it our way instead . <p> jobby2812 <p> 16-06-11 , 09:01 PM <p> Right I have managed to watch the video with sound and all she talks about is doing pretty much the same as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has sadly passed away . I can tell you he had been growing for a fair few years and certainly knew his stuff . Like I said before your only putting the plant into water for around 3 days . On top of that it is only the stem that your putting in water . Your NOT getting the buds and leaves wet . Why would that cause mould ? ? ? <p> For future reference if your desperate to chop and have n't flushed then you can do an emergency flush . To do this chop the whole plant at the base ( just above the soil level ) . Stick the plant/stem into a bucket of water ( buds above water level ) . Have a couple of air stones constantly bubbling away to keep oxygen in the water . Change the water twice a day if you can . Do this for 3 days . This should help flush the worst of the nutes out of the plants . <p> I sort of get it , but just do n't see why somebody would choose this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17-06-11 , 08:56 AM <p> The idea behind it is if you time your flush on your plants wrong . Say you happen to check the trics and you see the plant is ready for the chop but you have n't started the flush . Instead of flushing the plant for 2 weeks you can chop and do the emergency flush . Same again if your looking at the plant and you think it 's getting near the end so you flush as normal . You then find out she has another couple of weeks to go . So instead of starving her for those last couple of weeks you can feed and then do the emergency flush . <p> I would say I am suprised not more people are doing the emergency flush but I know I do n't do it . It 's not because I do n't know what I 'm doing . It 's just I do n't have the facilities to do the emergency flush . <p> MC <p> 17-06-11 , 10:12 AM <p> If you are all so scared of a bit of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll really fry your noggins ; ) <p> old skool toker <p> 17-06-11 , 01:53 PM <p> lol " may help in getting rid of the worst of the nutes ect " says it all , it do n't  work properly ........ basically if you forget to flush yer plants you have been watering and mothering for the last 2 months then as i say your a loonpole at the very least lol ......... you , d be better off leaving it in the pot and flushing over night ( would shift much more nutes than 3 days in a jar ) ..... one things for sure guys some things work better for others , and i respect that , so peace to you all , we have and are allowed an opinionbut mystery when i harvest my monster i , m not educated to grow , the 15 oz it has on it now with 4 weeks to go , will be flushed traditionally , beside , s i ai n't  got that many jars .... lol <p> MC <p> 17-06-11 , 03:17 PM <p> Hey , no problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously taught you everything that there is to know about cannabis , growing , flushing , harvesting &amp; curing techniques . <p> " A closed mind is like a closed book ; just a block of wood " - Chinese proverb . <p> Mr Swilly <p> 17-06-11 , 03:24 PM <p> but why would you want it to use water when ur supposed to be drying it , we do n't  just chop down our shit and throw it in a cupboard and forget about it do we , we ventalate it and keep humidity out so not to cause bud rot , so i just do n't  understand putting it in a vessel of water(humidity) were not talking cloneing which is totaly differant unlike someone has said , the clones like humidity when you put a clone in water its not using the water through the stem its taking it in through the leafs as humidity , the same priciple can only be harmful to a bud which does n't  like humidity ...... peace <p> Like flowers the plants uptake of water should continue and it will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . One bunch of coriander in a waterless jar , one bunch in a jar filled with water . see what happens in a few days . This will prove that plants can remain active without their roots , albeit not for an extended time . The plant will just continue drinking as long as it can , a few days i reckon . The chance of budrot is not increased , fluid travels up the stems does it not ? I love learning new things and this one i will deffo be doing on future crops .

As a chemist , microbiologist and grower , I can tell you that post harvest flushing of buds does indeed work . The cannabinoids are not water-soluble but the excess nutrients in unflushed bud are . Soaking your buds in distilled or RO water will actually leach out all of the water soluble components that lead to a harsh smoke , while leaving behind the precious cannabinoids . Completely submerge the buds and change the water every day or two to maintain the leaching effect . You will see the water go merky and green , which is caused by the removal of nutrients and chlorophyll ( water soluble ) . Of course , special care must be taken to ensure that there is no bud rot once the buds are removed from the water . I like to place the wet buds in a dessicator that contain drying stones ( anhydrous magnesium sulfate ) . Be sure that the buds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isopropyl alcohol ) and not touching the drying stones . Rotate the buds as much as possible . If done correctly , this technique can turn harsh unsmokeable bud into a nice clean smoke . You lose a lot of the flavour , but if the bud is not flushed , the bud probably tastes like crap anyways . You will see that your ash is completely white and the smoke is extremely smooth . I 've done this numerous times and it has worked wonderfully . Of course , if you grow your own bud , flush before harvest , but this technique can turn garbage unflushed bud to a clean and smooth smoke . This technique can also be used to remove unwanted ' green ' flavours from bud being used to make edibles.

@@46022319 @6022319/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Blackstrap Mollasses - A Whole Load Of Info ..... <p> Hi Thc tokers . <p> Here is a whole load of info on the Blackstrap Mollasses we use in grows . Hopefully it will help someone like it has me in better understanding " why " we use them in Cannabis plants .... <p> some of the weird things from the past folks ate for a reason , and blackstrap molasses is one of them . perhaps because of the heath benefits : This chart graphically details the %DV that a serving of Blackstrap molasses provides for each of the nutrients of which it is a good , very good , or excellent source according to our Food Rating System . Additional information about the amount of these nutrients provided by Blackstrap molasses can be found in the Food Rating System Chart . A link that takes you to the In-Depth Nutritional Profile for Blackstrap molasses , featuring information over 80 nutrients , can be found under the Food Rating System Chart . <p> Blackstrap molasses is a sweetener that is actually good for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped of virtually all nutrients except simple carbohydrates , or artificial sweeteners like saccharine or aspartame , which not only provide no useful nutrients but have been shown to cause health problems in sensitive individuals , blackstrap molasses is a healthful sweetener that contains significant amounts of a variety of minerals that promote your health . <p> Iron for Energy <p> In addition to providing quickly assimilated carbohydrates , blackstrap molasses can increase your energy by helping to replenish your iron stores . Blackstrap molasses is a very good source of iron . Particularly for menstruating women , who are more at risk for iron deficiency , boosting iron stores with blackstrap molasses is a good idea--especially because , in comparison to red meat , a well known source of iron , blackstrap molasses provides more iron for less calories and is totally fat-free . Iron is an integral component of hemoglobin , which transports oxygen from the lungs to all body cells , and is also part of key enzyme systems for energy production and metabolism . And , if you 're pregnant or lactating , your needs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs for iron . Just 2 teaspoons of blackstrap molasses will sweetly provide you with 13.3% of the daily recommended value for iron . <p> A Spoonful of Molasses Helps Your Calcium Needs Go Down <p> Blackstrap molasses is a very good source of calcium . Calcium , one of the most important minerals in the body , is involved in a variety of physiological activities essential to life , including the ability of the heart and other muscles to contract , blood clotting , the conduction of nerve impulses to and from the brain , regulation of enzyme activity , and cell membrane function . Calcium is needed to form and maintain strong bones and teeth during youth and adolescence , and to help prevent the loss of bone that can occur during menopause and as a result of rheumatoid arthritis . Calcium binds to and removes toxins from the colon , thus reducing the risk of colon cancer , and because it is involved in nerve conduction , may help prevent migraine attacks . Two teaspoons of blackstrap molasses will meet 11.8% of your daily needs for calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent source of copper and manganese and a very good source of potassium , and magnesium . <p> Copper , an essential component of many enzymes , plays a role in a wide range of physiological processes including iron utilization , elimination of free radicals , development of bone and connective tissue , and the production of the skin and hair pigment called melanin . Numerous health problems can develop when copper intake is inadequate , including iron deficiency anemia , ruptured blood vessels , osteoporosis , joint problems such as rheumatoid arthritis , brain disturbances , elevated LDL ( bad ) cholesterol and reduced HDL ( good ) cholesterol levels , irregular heartbeat , and increased susceptibility to infections . Using two teaspoons of blackstrap molasses to sweeten your morning cereal and the coffee or tea you drink during the day will supply you with 14.0% of the daily recommended value for copper . <p> That same amount of blackstrap molasses will also provide you with 18.0% of the day 's needs for manganese . This trace mineral helps produce energy from protein and carbohydrates , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a healthy nervous system and in the production of cholesterol that is used by the body to produce sex hormones . Manganese is also a critical component of an important antioxidant enzyme called superoxide dismutase . Superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) is found exclusively inside the body 's mitochondria ( the oxygen-based energy factories inside most of our cells ) where it provides protection against damage from the free radicals produced during energy production . <p> Like calcium , potassium plays an important role in muscle contraction and nerve transmission . When potassium is deficient in the diet , activity of both muscles and nerves can become compromised . Potassium is an especially important mineral for atheletes since it is involved in carbohydrate storage for use by muscles as fuel and is also important in maintaining the body 's proper electrolyte and acid-base ( pH ) balance . When potassium levels drop too low , muscles get weak , and athletes tire more easily during exercise , as potassium deficiency causes a decrease in glycogen ( the fuel used by exercising muscles ) storage . Simply by adding two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can supply 9.7% of your potassium needs for the day along with a healthy dose of carbohydrates to burn . <p> Calcium 's balancing major mineral , magnesium is also necessary for healthy bones and energy production . About two-thirds of the magnesium in the human body is found in our bones . Some helps give bones their physical structure , while the rest is found on the surface of the bone where it is stored for the body to draw upon as needed . Magnesium , by balancing calcium , helps regulate nerve and muscle tone . In many nerve cells , magnesium serves as Nature 's own calcium channel blocker , preventing calcium from rushing into the nerve cell and activating the nerve . By blocking calcium 's entry , magnesium keeps our nerves ( and the blood vessels and muscles they ennervate ) relaxed . If our diet provides us with too little magnesium , however , calcium can gain free entry , and the nerve cell can become overactivated , sending too many messages and causing excessive contraction . Insufficient magnesium can thus contribute to high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart muscle or the spasms of the airways symptomatic of asthma ) , and migraine headaches , as well as muscle cramps , tension , soreness and fatigue . In two teaspoons of blackstrap molasses , you will receive 7.3% of the daily value for magnesium . <p> Switching from nutrient-poor sweeteners like white sugar or corn syrup , or from potentially harmful fake sweeteners like aspartame or saccharin to nutrient-dense blackstrap molasses is one simple way that eating healthy can sweeten your life . <p> Description <p> The truth behind the phrase " slow as molasses " becomes apparent when you reflect on molasses 's thick , viscous , syrupy texture . Featuring a robust bittersweet flavor , blackstrap molasses helps create the distinctive taste of dishes such as baked beans and gingerbread . Blackstrap molasses is very dark in color , having a black-brown hue . <p> Blackstrap molasses is just one type of molasses , the dark liquid that is the byproduct of the process of refining sugar cane into table sugar . Blackstrap molasses is made from the third boiling of the sugar syrup and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucrose has been crystallized . <p> History <p> Molasses has been imported into the United States from the Caribbean Islands since the time of the early colonists . In fact , it was the most popular sweetener used until the late 19th century since it was much more affordable than refined sugar , which was very expensive at that time . <p> In some respects , molasses has had a rather sticky history with at least two important historical events centering around this sweet food product . The first is the Molasses Act of 1733 , a tariff passed by England to try to discourage the colonists from trading with areas of the West Indies that were not under British rule . This legislation is thought to be one of the events that catalyzed pre-revolutionary colonial dissent and unrest . <p> It is not often that a fateful tragedy occurs that centers around a food , but unfortunately , in 1919 , one such event did occur . The event is referred to as the Great Molasses Flood and occurred when a molasses storage tank holding over two million gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the city streets of Boston , Massachussetts , traveling as fast as 35 miles per hour and creating a thirty foot tidal wave of sweetener . Unfortunately , this was not a sweet matter as twenty-one people died and significant amounts of property was destroyed . <p> Blackstrap molasses gained in popularity in the mid-20th century with the advent of the health food movement . Today , the largest producers of molasses are India , Brazil , Taiwan , Thailand , the Phillipines and the United States . <p> How to Select and Store <p> Look for blackstrap molasses that is unsulphured since not only does it not contain this processing chemical to which some people are sensitive , but it has a cleaner and more clarified taste . Blackstrap molasses made from organic sugar cane is also available in some markets . <p> Molasses should be stored in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator or a cool , dry place . Unopened containers should keep for about one year , while opened containers should keep for about six months . <p> How to Enjoy <p> For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few Quick Serving Ideas : <p> Adding molasses to baked beans will give them that traditionally robust flavor . <p> Basting chicken or turkey with molasses will give it both a rich color and rich taste . <p> Safety <p> Blackstrap molasses is not a commonly allergenic food and is not known to contain measurable amounts of goitrogens , oxalates , or purines . <p> Nutritional Profile <p> Blackstrap molasses is an excellent source of manganese and copper . It is a very good source of iron , calcium , potassium and magnesium . In addition , blackstrap molasses is a good source of vitamin B6 and selenium . <p> For an in-depth nutritional profile click here : Blackstrap molasses . <p> In-Depth Nutritional Profile <p> In addition to the nutrients highlighted in our ratings chart , an in-depth nutritional profile for Blackstrap molasses is also available .

@@46022321 @6022321/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Keeping a Happy Mother Plant <p> A mother plant is there for one thing and one thing only . Cuttings . Lots and lots of lovely cuttings or " baby chimps , " as I call them . If you grow plants that are sensitive to photoperiod you 'll want to let her bask under at least 18 hours of light per day so that she remains permanently in vegetative mode . She just grows and grows and never flowers , providing you with all the cuttings you need . Pretty amazing stuff when you stop to think about it . So you see , it does n't  take a genius to figure out that a mother plant is the central pillar of any productive indoor gardening operation . <p> So why is it that so many of my fellow gardeners neglect their mothers ? ( Heheheh I 'll let you fill in the gaps on that one ! ) Time and time again I find them in a right old sorry state , sprawled out and legging up in a dull corner of a vegetative room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage at the bottom and untrained gnarly growth everywhere . ( What a terrible image ! ) These offenders ( and you know who you are ! ) think that all keeping a mother plant entails is to whack her in a 15 litre pot and fill it up with their chosen growing medium oh and occasionally feeding it when she starts to wilt . Its a crying shame . Too often the attitude is " keep the mother going " rather than " keep the mother thriving . " I do n't  know about you , but its plainly obvious through good old common sense , let alone science , that the health of the mother plant has a direct bearing on the health and future yields of the scores of cuttings she produces ! <p> Dedicate Some SpaceExperienced growers have a dedicated mother room or tent . They do n't  mind giving up this space and using the extra power because of the many benefits and conveniences that having a mother plant to hand brings . For one thing , growing from cuttings is way faster than growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting over into flowering at any point , whereas you have to wait for a seedling to mature before it will do the business . Seeds also cost money , sometimes quite a lot of money , and they are often fairly unpredictable . On the other hand , you can be sure that all cuttings taken from the same mother will perform in the same way , so you know exactly what you 're going to get every time . That said , make sure you choose a goodn ! You 're after a vigorous plant that yields well , resist pests and rot , and is pleasing to all the senses ! Furthermore its a real bonus to have a mother plant that produces cuttings which are easy to root . Even plants of the same genus can vary incredibly some taking twice or three times longer to root than others . So you definitely want to take rooting time / ease of rooting into consideration . <p> Choosing a systemRight then , we 've established that you really , really need to take care of your mother plant . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at friends houses in big pots and them being fed passively with drippers or a watering can . But if you really want her to thrive , the best choice is to treat her to her very own active hydroponics system . A Waterfarm , Aquafarm or similar single top feed bucket system is an excellent choice and it certainly wont break the bank . Also , its a far more hands-off method . After you 've filled the top bucket with well-washed clay pebbles , all you 'll need to do is keep the reservoir topped up and change the nutrient solution every week or two , and that 's about it . I have the drippers on constantly especially when the mother is well established as they can be very thirsty buggers . The growth is incredibly fast in these systems , meaning you can take lots of cuttings and your old dear will replenish herself in no time . Using a hydroponics system also gives you more control over the nutrients available to your mother plant . For instance , some growers like to decrease the levels of nitrogen available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taking cuttings , claiming it promotes faster rooting . <p> Taming the BeastAs I mentioned earlier , its all too easy to allow your mother to become out of control . As you take more cuttings from your mother plant it will become bushier and bushier . Where you remove one growth tip to take a cutting , two will take the lead in its place . And two become four , and four become eight , etc . Eventually you end up with the mother plant equivalent of an afro . You can either do some serious remedial pruning , or start afresh by turning a cutting into a new mother plant . When taking cuttings , think like a hairdresser and try to shape your plant so that most of it is under a good amount of light . There 's no point in letting a mother plant get too tall and pointy take these tips out and try to develop a candelabra-shaped plant instead . <p> Candelabra <p> The perfect shape to aim for when pruning your mother is a candelabra . This allows the most growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LightingRemember , even if you 're not using all the vegetation she produces , your mother plant needs to thrive . Its this intrinsic health and vigor that your cuttings will take with them when they become plants in their own right . Remember , your mother plant " sets the pace " so she needs to bask under lots of light . The dull corner of a veg room is far from ideal . If you have a separate vegging chamber , do n't  be tempted just to stick her in there . For starters , your mother plant is likely to be a vastly different size to plants that are in early veg she needs her own dedicated light . Many growers use 125 250 watt compact florescent units or some go the whole hog with a 250 400 watt metal halide HID . Its unlikely that you 'll need anything more than this unless you 're growing up a monster and if this is the case perhaps its worth considering growing more than one mother ? CFLs need to be placed closer to the plant . For this reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wide dispersing reflector is more practical . <p> Keep Things FreshAfter prolonged use a mother can become incredibly bushy , making it more difficult to take good sized cuttings . At this point its worth considering replacing your mother with a cutting from itself . This is a good time to give things a real deep clean rinse out the hydroponics system that 's supporting the mother with a mild bleach solution . Remember that disease and pests on your mother will invariably be passed to any cuttings taken from her . So look after her ! Depending on how well you take care of her , she will keep going and going for years before those characteristics you love her for start to wane . " How long ? " you ask . Well , this is difficult to say . Some growers change their genetics every 6-9 months . I know of others whove been using the same chromosomes for as many years ! But here 's a rule of thumb : as well as diminishing yields , a particularly telling sign is rooting time . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ten days , and suddenly its taking two weeks or more , you may want to consider sourcing some fresh new genetics from seed and starting over . <p> 18 or 24 ? <p> The jury is still split over whether mother plants prefer 18 hours of light a day or 24 . Certainly its more natural to allow your plants to have some " dark time " and your mother room lighting electricity costs will be reduced too . Its less hassle to just plug a light in rather than faff with timers ( and maybe electricians ) so a lot of growers take the lazy option of 24 hour light . Some Dutch growers I know even claim that it produces more vigorous plants ! <p> Mothering Tips * Dedicate a standard sized grow tent to your mother plant . Use a control unit , and a 5 or 6 inch extractor to maintain temperatures at 73 to 82F ( 23 to 28C ) and relative humidity at around 60%. * Do n't  grow your mother plants in coco coir . After a few months it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrient for continued growth . * Rotate your mother plant from time to time to ensure more even growth . * Remove all dead leaves . Check right inside the mother plant as she gets bushier. * If you insist on growing your mother in a pot , periodically check the roots to ensure the plant is not becoming too pot bound . If this is the case , use a sharp , sterile knife to remove around an inch of the root ball ( messy business ! ) and re-pot in a larger container . It looks brutal , but your mother will thank you for it ! * If you are growing your plant in a hydroponics system ( recommended ) make sure you keep the reservoir topped up and check that the pH is always around 5.8 . Completely refresh your nutrient solution every 7 10 days . * Use a grow light rich in the blue spectrum like a metal halide HID or a CFL . The 250 watt Enviroglow is a great choice . It screws directly into the reflector no need for a ballast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for the blue version for growth ! * If using CFLs , remember they do not give off much heat . They work best a lot closer to your plants than a standard HID light . <p> Mother Plant Shopping ListOk , so you 've decided to grow up your very own mother plant ? here 's a list of things I think you 're going to need : <p> * A standard-sized grow tent . The Homebox is a great choice . Also , the Homebox Light ( not designed to be lightproof ) is a good budget option as a mother plant does not require set amounts of complete darkness . Size assembled : 39 1/2 by 39 1/2 by 78 3/4 inches ( 100 by 100 by 200 centimeters ) . * 1 x Top Feed Bucket System , e.g. Nurticulture Flo Gro FG500 , or GHEs Waterfarm / Aquafarm . All these systems use a ring dripper that ensures a wide dispersal of nutrients to all parts of the root zone . * 1 x 400 watt HID lighting system with a Metal Halide lamp and a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range also features a dedicated vegetative light ( 6.5K ) . * A pair of Ezi-hangers to hang and adjust your lights . * S hooks to attach your Ezi-hangers to the top of your grow tent . * Clay pebbles . * Extraction kit : 6 " carbon filter + fan + ducting <p> Inflow : Passive should be fine through the grow tent venting . If your mother plant becomes very large , you could supplement this with an RVK100 style fan . Blow fresh air in at the bottom of the tent . <p> * Control unit ( automate inflow and extractor fan speeds to regulate temperature and humidity ) . * High quality vegetative nutrient pack . Ask your local hydro store for advice on the water quality in your area and make sure you buy an appropriate nutrient . * Hygrozyme is a personal favorite of mine for keeping mother plants ( as well as vegetating cuttings ) in tip top health . It helps to break down any old root mass and stimulate fresh new growth . * Trichoderma or funganic powder beneficial bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have your humidity , pH and conductivity ( nutrient strength ) meters ! If not make the investment ! * Cheap and affordable " auto-top up " systems are available if you are planning to go away for an extended period . * Do n't  forget scalpels , rooting hormone , propagation media ( e.g. rockwool cubes ) and propagators for taking all those lovely , healthy cuttings ! <p> So good luck everybody and remember : look after your mother and she will look after you ! <p> you absolute leg end , i have just bought a dr120 literally an hour ago ! for my current grow , and i was thinking of going perpetual by means of a mother in my old tent ( once i find a suitable candidate ) , but had no clue of how to go about it.problem solved.if i could thank ya twice , i would have nogood. good well timed shit man . <p> you absolute leg end , i have just bought a dr120 literally an hour ago ! for my current grow , and i was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent ( once i find a suitable candidate ) , but had no clue of how to go about it.problem solved.if i could thank ya twice , i would have nogood. good well timed shit man . <p> yeah mate , i like a good bit of info to read through.i just instinctively skin a j and get stuck in innit.i think this kind of posts are worthy of bein stickied so it does n't get lost in the archives mate . <p> yeah mate , i like a good bit of info to read through.i just instinctively skin a j and get stuck in innit.i think this kind of posts are worthy of bein stickied so it does n't get lost in the archives mate . <p> yes I defiantly agree mate it should be made a sticky but not up to me lol .. hope one of our good mods can do that for us .. <h> The Following User Says Thank You to up2nogood For This Useful Post : <p> yeah that 's some valuable info there man follows on nicely from you post about clones and answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a stick as i dare say it wo n't be the last time i 'll be calling on the info in here <p> yeah that 's some valuable info there man follows on nicely from you post about clones and answers all the questions you could possibly have . def should be a stick as i dare say it wo n't be the last time i 'll be calling on the info in here <p> I 'm a newbie grower and today I selected my mother plant from my three beautiful girls .

A look at hard and soft water and suitable feeds for both . Also includes detail on pH adjustment of fresh and running solutions , preparing rockwool slabs for use , and water and feeds for soil . <p> Water <p> For most indoor growing applications whether growing in soil or with hydroponics , tap water is the best water to feed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water can be dissipated by standing the water in a container open to the air for a few hours before use ( 12 to 24 hours ) . Sometimes excess chlorine can make the leaves twist and contort out of shape , so we would always advise allowing your water to stand before adding to your system or watering . <p> Apart from the excess chlorine , tap water is excellent to use . Whether it is hard or soft water , its clean , bug and bacteria free and should give you no growing problems . Do not use de-ionised or distilled water and always choose tap water over rain or well water . <p> Hobby pH Meter <p> The pH of tap water will vary from 5.5 to 8.5 . For practical purposes the lower the pH the softer the water and the higher the pH the harder the water . Added chlorine will also affect the pH , so let it dissipate before testing . Before adjusting the pH , add any necessary feed as this may also affect the pH . <p> Soft Water <p> Soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of calcium bicarbonates and other light atoms and ions in the water . You can use the pH of your tap water as a guide when choosing whether to use a Hard or Soft water hydroponic feed . If your pH is between 5.5 and 7.7 then your water is not hard enough to use hard water feeds and you should use only soft water or universal feeds . <p> Soft Water feeds do not generally affect the pH of the nutrient solution upon make up , so some pH adjustment may be necessary to get the nutrient solution to around pH 6 . Phosphoric Acid is generally used for small pH down adjustments and Potassium Hydroxide used for small pH up adjustments . A small pipette or two may be useful as only small amounts are needed . <p> Universal formulation feeds like Aqua and Genesis Nutrients will work well in any water , although these and other universal feeds do affect the pH of the solution upon make up . These feeds cause the pH to drop slightly , making them difficult to use in very soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard or very soft water and as a result we only recommend using it if you have mid-range water hardness . <p> The more calcium bicarbonates and other light atoms there are in your water , the harder it is and generally the higher the pH . For Hydroponic Nutrient purposes , hard water feeds are only for people with very hard water with a cF 8 ( 500ppm total ) or more and a pH of about 7.8 or above . If your tap water pH is below 7.8 then use soft water or universal feeds and adjust the pH of the final solution to around 6 using some pH down . <p> Hard Water feeds do affect the pH of the final solution and therefore save any pH adjustment until after the feed has been added . Because hard water has a high pH , addition of a hard water feed will automatically drop the pH of the solution and reduce the amount of pH down needed . <p> ****Do not adjust pH of water or feed solutions for soil or compost. **** <p> When growing in hydroponics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrients in the solution are readily available for absorption by the roots . This means keeping the pH of the nutrient solution between a range of about 5.5 to 6.5 . In re-circulating hydroponic systems , make all new solutions between this range . The pH will generally rise over the next few days but avoid adjusting the pH every day even if it goes slightly out of range . Adding too much acid ( pH down ) is much worse for your plant than being slightly out of the optimum pH range . <p> If you are using a lot of acid to reduce your pH , but your water is not quite hard enough for hard water feeds , you may want to consider using Nitric Acid as a pH Down in vegetative growth . This affects the solution less than phosphoric acid although more is needed . Alternatively try changing feed next crop to a universal feed , which will help keep your solution pH down and buffered . <p> pH in slabs <p> Rockwool For the first few days growing in rockwool cubesor slabs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it settles down . Soaking slabs for 24 hours in a pH 5.5 solution ( with appropriate strength feed added ) to help stabilize the slab a bit before use . <p> Water and feeds for soil/compost mixes <p> De-chlorinated tap water is the best choice of water . Rain and well water can be used although we do not recommend it and de-ionised or distilled water should never be used . With the buffering capacity of soil and the larger and different pH nutrient availability range in soil environment , pH adjustment of any water or feed solutions is not necessary and only adds un-necessary elements to the water and feed . <p> Consequently there are no hard water and soft water soil feeds , just universal ones which will work well in all types of water . <p> Bio-Bizz nutrients These are 100% biological , natural and a popular match with the All-Mix compost . <p> Terra This mineral based feed is a clear solution and ideal for automated irrigation systems unlike most other soil feeds which would block pumps and lines . Also gives excellent yield and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil feed you choose to use , with big or heavy feeding plants under high light conditions , we recommend you use some of our popular bio additives like Bio-Bizz Alg-A-Mic , TopMax Bloom Stimulator and Bio-Bizz Root Juice , or alternatively the BCuzz Range of boosters and bloom stimulators . <p> easy to find ! <p> copy and paste:stoned-smilie : <p> metsys datom <p> 13-10-11 , 03:50 PM <p> here 's one for ya .

If you were to get problems further into the grow which were due to a ph problem but looked like a deficiancy of something else , at least by ph'ing from the start then this could be eliminated . <p> Me being a tight fisted old git , I get my soil from poundland , 99p shop or whatever my mate gives me from his allotment , as he runs it . The mixtures I use are sometimes a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn . <p> When I fill up my bucket from the tap , the ph range is 7.5 , after letting this stand for about 24 hours with an occasional aeration stir , the ph goes up to 8.5 . As I do n't use commercial nutrients , I make up my own concoction and top up with the water from the bucket , the ph reading I get averages at 7.2 , whilst I could let the microherd buffer the ph differance in the soil I prefer to adjust this to about 6.5 using Apple Cider Vinegar before adding the feed . <p> My daughter 's boyfriend and most of his mates all have their little grows and I get to hear all the problems encountered and when he was round my place the other day taking a look at my little beauties just put into flower , the comment was ' Jeez , I 've never seen plants looking so damn healthy ' . <p> So - to ph or not to ph - whichever works for you the best , then do n't rock the boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  bother ph'n my tap water and i ended up causing lots of problems ... my tap water is 7.7 guess what ? nute lock out , I wont be making that mistake again . <p> Just to quote what you said - The micro herd do not buffer the ph of the soil , ( which I incorrectly said ) although they are constantly breaking down organic matter that may affect ph , the thing that buffers ph is usually something like garden lime that is put in to stabilise the ph at a particular level . When the soil gets old the buffer is used up and the ph becomes less stable .

I " supercroppped a thai plant of mine at the 7th node 6 weeks into veg today and virtually snapped the stem in half ..... its got a few strands holding it . Just wana know if it should recover or not ! ? ! <p> You 'll be very surprised at how well they can recover mate . At worst you can always top it just above the node below the snap - if that makes sense . Then you could root the top dead like lolprovided it not already <p> just gona hijack this for a second ...... I " supercroppped a thai plant of mine at the 7th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem in half ..... its got a few strands holding it . Just wana know if it should recover or not ! ? ! <p> hmmm touch and go mate .. if only a few strands I do n't think it will survive .. when cropping you have to put pressure all around the stem for support ... and do it slowly .. but to be fair I do n't think it will .. <p> when ive done mine , i just bend them straight over no messing about doing it carefully , the stem will have tears on it where you do it and the first time you do it you will think you 've fucked it , but as grasshopper says it amazing how they heal <p> bent them over this morning , about 6 inches from top on the 3 taller ones and hung nuts attached to wire from the tips . alas the nuts were too light and by the time i came home from work they 're growing up again with a 2 inch dogleg in the stems oh well gives me 2 more inches b4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less how i did it this morning , the fuckers are just super quick at recovering so i may have to tie them down next time . they 've almost trebled in size since the flip , so hopefully they 're done stretching now . <p> here 's the aftermath of my failed suppercropping . As advised just topped it at the node under the snap . Will it recover ? should do i rekon . Also this slag must be 7 weeks old maybe more and nooo sign of sex .... what gives man ? <p> haha , you shud get two new tops off that np , you can do a 24hr blackout to sex it , at that age it will show in 2-3 days if you need to know fast , and lookin at the height i would get it on 12/12 soon man , you have more stretch on top coming . with a harsh top like that you should get 2 fat buds there , especially with a week to let them start b4 switching , you may be more happy 10985 @qwx420985

On one hand you are right about ph not being an issue.but there are limits to this . the main rule being that if you are using chemical nutrients PH is absolutely important . certain chemical elements can only be taken up by the plants @ certain ph levels.if you have a sterile soil due to chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into deficiency problems sooner or later . On the other hand in a living organic soil ALL the elements and nutrients are already in the soil in abundance and the plant itself releases exudes which trigger certain soil microbes to chelate ( or release ) the nutrients the plant needs at any given time no matter what the ph of your soil.PH is no longer an issue . this process takes all the guess work out growing for us , trying to guess what the plant needs &amp; puts it in the hands of who knows best .... the plant.What an amazing process . All that is left for us to do is make sure are micro herd is kept moist and well fed with different soil amendments such as kelp meal , alfalfa meal , neem meal , glacial rock dust , ect . If you are interested in this i would recommend reading a book called " Teaming with Microbes " it is loaded with valuable info . if you have any other questions i would be happy to answer them to the best of my abilities 10985 @qwx420985

So I recommend you get a few different stones to try . <p> Only problem I see with your setup is your rad . At a minimum get some insulation between those buckets and the rad . You may want to try to box in those buckets with rigid insulation or put a rigid sheet between the rad and wrap the buckets in blankets . If you could box in and get cool airflow around those buckets it could also help . <p> If you have a chiller then disregard that last bit . Do n't try growing microbes , bennies , until you know how to grow weed .

W " <p> 4 weeks into flower will cause some plants to have their leaves go pale and yellow .. some will some wo n't , if you think the leaves are over 50% bad then just take them off .. nothing to be too worried about , you have been feeding them as well <p> While I agree many strains can yellow quite a lot after 4 weeks of flower , there could be an issue . For example , I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once into flower , they atart feeding bloom without realising they should also still be using grow . So , I would suggest you post some pics and give us some details of your feed regime , method of growing , ph , EC , temps , lighting and humidity . W 10986 @qwx420986 <p> ok growing in soil/pearlite mix with a 400 w hps its a cupboard grow so humidity out the window or cupboard door as it were had no problem during veg used good soil so did n't  wan na over feed them .. Since flowering have been using terra flores for soil and has been fine , have given an organic feed just incase .. like i said before have another plant same feed that 's green as you like ! it is alot smaller as did n't  like being topped so maybe has n't  used as much of the soils natural nutes . Was hoping like uptonogood said that some go yellow quicker than others ( thanks dude ) like i said i 'm brand new first 2 i tried . will post a pic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic and over feed coz less is more with feed so i hear but do n't  wan na starve the poor buggers ! got 2 pics from the other day when was n't as bad and side pofile so may be hard to tell .. will post them for the time being and get some more up later today .. thanks alot everyone <p> you can sort of see it starting at the bottom but like i said seems to be spreading i 'd say 20-30% of the leaves are turning yellow ... could it be it need more organic feed or is it natural ? thanks again <p> No plant should be showing yellow leaves at 4 weeks flowering and if it is it 's not being fed adequately or has some other problem and looking at your plants see they are calling for a bit of nitrogen . <p> Which organic feed are you using ?

Sounds very similar to my issues . And the feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've been having as my suspect and exactly why I 'm trying this grow with Hesi . Sounds like the same issue here . <p> greenhorn , take a look at my last few diaries , see if you think yours are the same . I just looked at yours , very very similar . I reckon within a week on the same feed , that will be a very yellow plant judging by how quick it used to take over mine . Lovely and green one week , a little bit yellow , next week bam . It usually gets very worse overnight one night , you come back and are like , SHIT , what the fuck happened . Good luck with it mate , on the plus side , still always yielded well , but I hate the yellowing , its so unattractive if nothing else , but mainly you just know the plant is n't as happy as it could be . Lastly , this is almost always how mine starts and then in the past I 've tried using epsom salts and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotting . <p> hey up in smoke yeh had a couple of yellowing leaves jus thought it was the old ones dying off , put em to bed and when i got up like 20% starting to turn ! ! checked out your diary man very helpful ... as you said seems other people having probs at 4 weeks with yellowing when using terra .. that fact+terra low in N=has to be the N that is the prob as rockster and woody kindly pointed out ( cheers guys ) guessing there is a big boost of the use of N around this time ( will need to read more ) and glad to hear you still got good yields Smoke , but like you i just want the little buggers to be happy while alive coz i 'm hopefuly gon na be very happy at their cremation will keep and update on this thread with pics ect ... and will do a diary next time and keep with the grow feed aswell as bloom as woody suggested and see if i cant keep it green ! cheers everyone <p> Having had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never joined the dots ! ! I think the answer is that during the first 2 or 3 weeks of flower , so much N is used from the soil but not replaced by the CTB nutes , that come week 4 , there is nothing left in the tank for them . I have experienced it myself with Bio Bizz nutes . As Rockster pointed out , these are very low in N. The answer with BB , as it says on their website , is to carry on using the grow nutes as a kind of 2-parter . I am sure I read somewhere that with Canna Terra Bloom , you should not start using it until week 3 of flower . <p> Either way , when we see people with yellowing around week 4 , there is a good idea what is causing it and how to solve it . For anyone using these nutes , do n't  start using bloom until week 3 . W <p> My last grow ( also my first ) I used the full Biobizz range on my grow ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alg-a-mic , BioHeaven , Grow , Bloom , &amp; Topmax toward the end ..... Also I fed nutes on every single feed apart from one mid leach a the final flush . Toward the end I was adding well over 10ml/L of nutes yet I only had some minor yellow tips in the last week or 2 before flush . <p> I 'm only a noob my self , but as I skipped through the I built a picture up of a slow nitrogen deficiency slowly getting worse . People Use Epsom salts , but as I was n't a member here before jumping in with my first grow I did a bit of personal research ( and actually reading some bottles lol ) and found the BioHeaven to be high in Nitrogen ... so used that all the way through with no problems . <p> " Choice is an illusion , created between those with power , and those without " The Merovingian <p> ok have done a little research on yellowing leaves , my prob was low N in my feed but still wanted to kno what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of growers say to remove as they take up energy to repair the leaf .. while others say that the energy that is there is going back into the plant so to leave them . So thought i 'd ask science lol hope this helps anyone else who is wondering and checks the thread as i was very confused from a site sciencemadesimple haha here goes <p> The leaf has actually been preparing for autumn since it started to grow in the spring . At the base of each leaf is a special layer of cells called the " abscission " or separation layer . All summer , small tubes which pass through this layer carry water into the leaf , and food back to the tree . In the fall , the cells of the abscission layer begin to swell and form a cork-like material , reducing and finally cutting off flow between leaf and tree . Glucose and waste products are trapped in the leaf . Without fresh water to renew it , chlorophyll begins to disappear . <p> As the bottom cells in the separation layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the top of the separation layer begin to disintegrate . They form a tear-line , and eventually the leaf is blown away or simply falls from the tree . <p> could n't find anything about the energy used repairing leaves but if damaged may take less to heal the stem you cut than the leaf itself but ca n't be alot in it . So if naturaly turning yellow coz old , its no longer feeding the plant so leave it on cut it off it dnt matter haha there 's 2 hours i 'll never get back ! i guess , off would win for more light and circulation .. Was a normal gardener lol for 10 years ( just maintenance i 'm no titmarsh ) and would cut away all dead , dying and diseased the 3 D 's but the dying only applied to whole sections of the plant i.e if the roses stem was slowly dying down the stem you would remove as its in a battle to try survive , this would then concentrate its energy to the rest of the plant but i 'm pretty sure this does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tho , we just chucked on some shite and watched it grow ! and never cared as much about how big the rose buds were this stuff is more like science and i was never very good at biology ! so as grump said if its got some green keep it seen ! if fully yellow lose that fellow ! or something like that 10985 @qwx420985

After reading your post he was more open about the incident . I think it was just one of those cases where he did n't  want to have to admit that Dad was right . He had been smoking one variety or another and yes , he has had the same stuff you named . Wanting to die was to end the misery/hell that the shit had him going through on that trip . He s been off the stuff since and after several weeks he has pretty much returned to his normal state . It was a semi- lucid moment after taking the pills that he was able to text his mother .

I find the difference between herbal incense/legal highs and weed is that I have to be careful with the herbal and legal stuff ( like Black Mamba ) - it 's easy to go too far . I first smoked a smallish amount ( the amount I 'd use with a preferred incense or legal ) , and found it did next to nothing - a slight physical numbness and tiredness that was over in an obscenely short amount of time -maybe I was sober in 15 minutes or so . Because I was dissatisfied I smoked just shy of a fifth of a gram with tobacco . I did n't freak out , though I can understand that the effects would be intensified and drawn out if you went over the edge , and I merely felt an exaggerated form of the same numbness and demotivation . It was n't a form of ' high ' that I enjoyed at all . Obviously , no legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that euphoria or enhanced thinking you can with weed , but most create a pleasantly unusual physical numbness and a feeling of decreased awareness that can be quite enjoyable . This simply did n't make me feel happy or relaxed . Just a bit stupid and demotivated for about 40 minutes , and that was after a healthy dose by my standards . <p> I would echo your plea that nobody takes the gamble , simply because it is clear ( from your account and many others ) that this stuff has the capability to pull you into a very nasty place , even causing medical emergencies , and that , from the point of view of someone who had a ' good ' experience with this , it 's just not worth it .

@@46022342 @6022342/ 10988 @qwx420988 <p> I 've also been reading up on breeding , really interesting stuff it 's something il definitely be giving a try in the near future . Not so much true breeding just a few strain crosses I 'd like to have a go at . The F stands for filial .. The original mother and father are P1 so for example P1 x P1 will give you an F1 ( or first filial ) the first generation of both parents . Then an F1 x F1 will give you an F2 ( second filial ) . Then selecting the best two with matching traits from the F2s and crossing will give you an F3 ( third filial ) . Good luck with the breeding nirvana <p> Outbreeding or producing hybrid seed is the practice of crossing two plants from different genetic backgrounds . An F1 ( make the 1 in F1 superscript ) hybrid is a first generation cross of two true breeding plants . F1 varieties are the most sought after plants available because they grow approximately 25 percent faster and larger than other crosses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offspring of F1 plants are called F2 and the offspring of F2 plants are called F3 etc . The subsequent generations after F1 do not experience hybrid vigor . F1 hybrids from seed companies must be brought back to true bred plants before they serve as consistent breeding stock . <p> NOTE : Most often growers do not breed , they cross plants without stabilizing any particular plant , or developing true breeding strains . Once they find a plant they like , they take clones of it and grow it out under lights . Often this is process is confused with breeding . It is much more difficult to select plants , stabilize them into true breeding plants and produce F1 ( make the 1 in F1 superscript ) hybrids . Often when 10 seeds purchased from a disreputable seed company are planted , the result is 10 plants that all look different , so beware ! 10985 @qwx420985

Ill look into that vics thingy too , cheers for the tip . Ive been misting the room with water to try and raise it but it only goes up for half an hour then plummets back to to the 40s , same thing with hanging damp towls around it .

One cheese run i did would look all sorry unless i upped the hum to 60+ . However this time round those same genetics but just 1 plant of it and it seems to really like it low .

Fresh seeds have a healthy embryo whose cells are filled with water . But excess water causes the cells to bloat , depletes oxygen and leads to the tissue rotting away before the seed embryo can germinate . Old seeds have lost water in the cell tissue , the embryo starts to shrivel , which is why germination rates drop the older the seeds are . Therefore , old seeds ( ie. 3+ years ) can soak up more water before adverse conditions cause them to rot . This is one of the main reasons why various seed stock reacts differently to pre-germination methods .

@@46022346 @6022346/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Fans of the wardrobe <p> hi people i aiming this thread at wardrobe growers as i just built 2 one for veg and prop , one for flowering.i have grown many times before but never in such a small space.i as most people only have a small budget to spend on the vitals.so far i have built up the smaller wardrobe , it has a very old pl4 that only just fits like it was made to go in there it lights 100% of the space.i painted the inside with flat white paint as i think mylar to be overated , i used it once but the first time i got overspray of bug stuff on it it stained and when you try wash it it goes all wrinkly.so paint is better imo.i bought coco and proper seeds.i cant understand people growing stash seed , the availability of good seed banks gives us wardrobe people a good choice of strains that are only going to stay at a workable size.try and mix but look for strains which have the same phenotype.that way a bug or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my favorite strain is afghan1 i have grown it for years and i have a good handle on its growth patterns.i made my own seeds of the best of these some years ago and have kept 20 seeds for about 6 years , did n't  expect that many if any at all would germ.most of them did ! ( 15 out of 20 ) so i picked best of the bunch and am currently vegging my new mother.just shows what a brilliantly resilient strain this girl of mine is.also bought d.p. automazar for while the photoperiod babes are vegging.trying afghan x kush and w.w. x b.b. just one of each which i plan to grow in a method i developed years ago which is similar to scrog but instead of a screen i use a trough and bamboo frame to grow the plants horizontally along the frame by tieing and bending to produce a long flat plant that gets even light and put my big lamp within 3 inches to get very best bud.i have just built a new hopefully cheap to run light for my flowering wardrobe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought brass batten mounts and 3mtr of cable , using an old car stereo case as the mounting point for the bulbs wired them in series with a 3 amp fuse.and a polished metal tea tray as a reflector.works out just around 35 quid to build it and being tailor made should be perfect to light my space . so the 140quid one in the hydro shop can stay there and i can use what i saved to buy some more seeds ! ! ! ! had strict budget set by her in doors of 230 quids for all to grow.this was the price of a growtent that was very basic that she wanted to get me for xmas.but i still ca n't understand how you explain a tent in the middle of your spare room . wheras a wardrobe is expected.i no it takes a bit of work compared but i think from the stealth point of veiw the wardrobe wins hands down.my next trick is to sort out a good filter as we live in a bungalow with neighbors both sides and the smell is what gets loads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small extractor fan which copes at the moment with the pl4 but i may need to redesign this when the big light goes up.anyways hope someone found this worth the read.any advice or questions gratefully received ! ! ! <p> Thanks Duke , this thread is just the sort of thing I was looking for . I 've never grown anything ever ever ever , and I 'm planning to now , and I 'm also planning to use a wardrobe ; so to read of the exploits of an experienced grower whose now getting stuck into a wardrobe himself is excellently useful . My plan is to use a HPS light , so I 'm curious as to why you 're using CFLs . I want to grow a Power Plant , which has loads of African genetics , and is consequently hungry for the old photons , and is supposed to hanker for HPS . ( According to Jorge Cervantes , who is a fan of the strain . ) Do you just reckon it 's over the top for a wardrobe setup , or what ? Cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , i do n't  run a big exhaust fan just a home made heat exchanger fixed to rear of wardrobe so it ca n't be seen.that can cope with the heat of cfl but not hps.i have built my own light as was not impressed with the crappy made shit they turn out at the hydro shops.i figure that my light being tailor made to fit 100% perfect and light 100% of the space i have , with the right combination of bulbs ( 6 in all ) putting out just 450watts uses very little electric.but if you carefull and watchfull you can get the cfl so much closer and not burn the plants.if you keep to the same height either scrog or as i use a small bamboo frame and grow the plants along horizontally you get every bit of the plant lit to the max.i may put in more bulbs later but for now i am very happy with what i built , i used real good quality fittings , bulbs and cables , i now have total control over my heat issue to.and it cost less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match bulbs to suit the stage of my crop.i may get smaller overall crop but i grow for quality more than quantity.i tried my digi camera in my gr but shit so gona buy new one and try again.thanks for the interest us wardrobers should stick at it ! ! ! <p> Yes , it 's a totally cool way to grow ganga . I look forward to seeing your creation when you do get a proper camera . I 'm going to take a much simpler approach of course , ' cos I 'm just starting out -- plants , soil , light , the basics -- but I have an eye to the future as well .

Power Plant is a mainly-sativa hybrid , derived so they say from South African dagga . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep an eye on it coz ' once it 's in flower it grows like an Apollo rocket apparently . Fortunately I 've enough room in my wardrobe to accomodate it . I hope .

@@46022357 @6022357/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> John Innes Composts Explained ! <p> John Innes Composts <p> John Innes is not a manufacturer of compost , they are a range of composts developed at the John Innes Institute , named after John Innes , a nineteenth century property and land dealer in the City of London . On his death in 1904 he bequeathed his fortune and estate to the improvement of horticulture by experiments and research . The result was the establishment of the John Innes Horticultural Research Institute initially at Merton in Surrey , but now located at Norwich . <p> The essence of these composts from today 's point of view is that they are based on loam . There are several formulae , depending on the use of the compost : JI Seed Compost is for sowing seeds ; JI Cutting Compost is for rooting cuttings ; JI No 1 Potting Compost is for pricking out young plants ; JI No 2 Potting Compost is for potting on ; JI No 3 Potting Compost is for established plants and shrubs ; and JI Ericaceous Compost is for plants which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of the ingredients in John Innes is briefly as follows : - <p> Loam <p> Loam is the most important ingredient in the compost as it provides the main " body " of the compost . It also forms the base of plant nutrition by supplying clay , which has a cation and anion exchange capacity , that is , it absorbs and releases plant nutrients as required . Loam also contains essential micro-elements and some organic matter which provides a slow release of nitrogen to the plant . <p> Peat <p> Sphagnum Moss Peat in the John Innes Compost increases the total porosity and improves both the aeration and the water-retaining capacity . Peat decomposes slowly into humus . <p> Sand <p> The coarse sand or grit is used as a physical conditioner to allow excess water to drain from the compost and thus prevent water-logging . It also helps to provide stability for larger plants . Fertiliser <p> The compound fertiliser in John Innes Compost provides a wide spectrum of plant nutrients needed for balanced growth , including : - <p> Nutrients are typically sufficient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed should be given . <p> The mixes All ingredients of the main constituents are by volume . <p> JOHN INNES SEED COMPOST : The traditional mix for sowing almost any type of seed , with sufficient nutrient for early development . May also be used for rooting soft cuttings . 2 sterilised Loam 1 Peat 1 Sand The loam and peat is put through in 9mm ( 3/8 in ) sieve . For each cubic metre of mix , add 0.6kg ground limestone 1.2kg superphosphate <p> I must admit , I did always wonder how lots of different brands seemed to have a stake in JI . Now I know . Cheers Ik . Just a shame a lot of manufacturers do n't say how much JI they use when they say " contains JI " , sometimes I think they just put a teaspoon in a 60l bag and get away with false marketing . <p> I must admit , I did always wonder how lots of different brands seemed to have a stake in JI .

Who knows hey mate , all i do know is soil containing JI is damn good stuff . <p> One of the ingredients that appears in all but ericaceous compost is ground limestone ( lime ) , usually in the form of burnt and then finely ground seashells . <p> The effect of putting most nutes into compost is to send it acidic and lock up the nutes into the soil making them unavailable to the plant . The acidic soil effectively kills the good bactreria that act on the nutes , the nutes are normally broken down into " useful " ( available ) food for the plants . Lime increases the Ph of the soil back to neutral ( 7.0 ) and this provides a nice medium for the bacteria to thrive . <p> The Hydrponic growers seem to be more " tech wise " with Ph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil is only 3-5 on fleabay ( or Greens ) .

Keep training for anything between two and three weeks depending on the stretch of the strain . For beginner scroggers , I 'd recommend getting a good sturdy screen with about 1 inch by 1 inch grids . A good metal fence is good . And then a couple of inches above that main screen , you put some netting . This will help support the buds later on , and also give you a guide to train them . When they reach the top screen , retrain that branch , let it grow to the screen again , an retrain . It 'll help keep track of what needs to be trained . <p> Also I would n't say lolly pop them , but do a good trim on the bottom third of te plant a week before flip too .

Go to 12/12 . <p> You should not need any feed right through these stages .

I only give mine flower nutes at around week 6 for a couple of weeks ( yes I get nute burn but getting a handle on it ) . Just all depends how hot your soil is to begin with .

@@46022376 @6022376/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Yield per m2 <p> Hey guys , Just wondering , whenever you look for plants/seeds to buy the yield of the plant is always displayed in m2 . My query is , how do the plants companies/ breeders get to this out come . How many plants do they put in a square metre ? ? I use 600w hps and assume that would cover a square metre , so does that mean I am gon na get 500g or whatever the supposed yield of the plant I buy , from my 600w . I find it confusing because if I used bigger or smaller pots would determine how many plants I get into a square metre . Also do they come to that conclusion from soil or hydro . I do n't think you get enough info from seed breeders/companies . Can any put any light on this confusing subject .

That 's why I said 8 <p> As for how long etc , for best way to keep times minimum , you 'll need a vegging cab . <p> I veg mine for about 6-8 weeks from cuts rooting under a 250cfl , I top at about 6-7 nodes so they do n't get too tall .

So in total , an 8 week strain they will be in the 12/12 room for nearly 10 weeks . So half the room filled up every 5 weeks , crop 4 plants every 5 weeks . <p> If you only use the one space , then you get 8 plants worth of weed , every 4 months ( 6 weeks veg , 10 weeks flower ) So basically half , veg cab does n't need to be that big either , only room for 4 plants that will grow to 18 inches and a propogator ( for your cuttings ) <p> Also make sure you flower for a full term or your yield will be drastically affected .

@@46022379 @6022379/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> Type 's of Growing Medium 's <p> Selecting the appropriate growing media to use is an important step in producing a quality cannabis plant . Most of the media used by growers consists of combinations of peat moss , perlite , vermiculite or other organic constituents . Regardless of what a media is composed of , it must provide the basic physical and chemical properties required for plant growth . <p> When growing marijuana outdoors , soil or a mix of soil and compost is what is used . When growing indoors , a soil or soilless mix can be used , though some growers often prefer to grow hydroponically using different mediums . Marijuana is often called weed and like a weed it will grow in almost anything you can think of . As long as the roots have room to grow , are kept moist and are supplied with oxygen and nutrients the plant will thrive . <p> Below is a simple explanation of some of the different mediums commonly used . <p> Soil <p> Soil is a good medium , it is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should compact when you squeeze it and break apart easily when you poke it . Cannabis plants like a soil that drains well and has a pH of about 6.5 . If the pH is too extreme then the plant will not be able to absorb nutrients properly . The pH can be raised by adding hydrated lime and can be lowered by adding sodium bicarbonate to the soil . The lime is slow acting so add it during the fall or at least one month before planting . Perlite , vermiculite , and sand can be added to soils that drain poorly . For indoor grows , using a sterilized soil is a must so as to avoid insect and other unwanted infestations . <p> Perlite(white) and vermiculite(tan) are soil conditioners . Perlite look similar to vermiculite but the later contains small amounts of nutrients . It 's ok to use perlite on its own but vermiculite is best used in small amounts mixed with other mediums . <p> Soilless Mix <p> There are many kinds of soiless mix 's containing a vast assortment of ingredients . Most contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most soiless mixes retain water well and have great wicking action while still holding a good amount of air , making them a good growing medium for a variety of hydroponic and organic gardens . <p> My prefered soiless brand is called Pro-Mix and is readily available in hardware stores . It is comprised of a canadian sphagnum peat moss , perlite , vermiculite , and limestone mix ( for ph adjustement ) <p> Rockwool <p> Rockwool has long been among the most popular growing mediums available . Originally used as insulation it was called " Mineral Insulation " and was later developed for gardening in Denmark . <p> The shapes vary from 1 " x1 " x1 " starter cubes up to 3 " x12 " x36 " slabs , with many sizes in between . While versatility and ease have contributed to its popularity , there are several disadvantages to this type of growing medium which should be considered along with the pros before deciding on whether or not you want to use it . <p> Clay Pellets <p> This man-made product is often called grow rocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by baking clay in a kiln . The inside of the clay pellets is full of tiny air pockets ( much like lava rock ) which makes this a light weight medium . <p> The pellets are great for ebb &amp; flow systems or other systems that have frequent watering cycles ( clay pellets do not retain much water so they need to be watered often so that the roots of your plants do not dry out ) . The rocks are often mixed with other growing medium(s) to increase oxygen retention . <p> Expanded clay pellets are rather expensive but they are one of the few kinds of growing medium that is easily reusable , which makes them a good choice for the long term . After you harvest your crop you can wash the clay rocks to remove all the old roots and then sterilize them with a 10% bleach and water mix ( one part bleach to 9 parts water ) . The grow rocks can also be sterilized by using a mixture of Hydrogen Peroxide and water ( use 1 or 2 teaspoons of 35% food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coconut Fiber <p> Coconut fiber is rapidly becoming one of the most popular growing mediums in the world . In fact it may soon be THE most popular . It is the first totally " organic " growing medium that offers top performance in hydroponic systems . Coconut fiber is essentially a waste product of the coconut industry , it is the powdered husks of the coconut itself . <p> There are many advantages - it maintains a larger oxygen capacity than rockwool , yet also has superior water holding ability than rockwool which is a real advantage for hydroponic systems that have intermittent watering cycles . <p> Coconut fiber is also high in root stimulating hormones and offers some protection against root diseases including fungus infestation . Dutch growers have found that a mixture of 50% coconut fiber and 50% expanded clay pellets is the perfect growing medium . <p> One word of caution about coconut fiber , you must be careful when you purchase coconut fiber . There is a commonly available , lower grade of coconut fiber that is high in sea-salt and is very fine grained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results when used in a hydroponic system . <p> It can be used for hydroponics and soil grows ( As soiless medium or as a soil ammendement ) <p> Sphagnum Moss <p> A completely natural medium that is used as a major ingredient in most soiless mixes . Sphagnum moss can also be used by itself in a hydroponic system . Sphagnum moss makes a good fluffy growing medium that retains a high percentage of air and retains water well also . <p> The major problem with this growing medium is that it can decompose over time and you can get small particles that can plug up your pump and ( or ) drip emitters if you are using a recovery type hydroponic system . <p> Pea Gravel <p> This growing medium has been used for years and works well . Many or the earlier hydroponic systems that were commercially available to the public were gravel based ebb / flow type systems . <p> Pea gravel supplies plenty of air to the roots , but does n't retain water , which means that the plants roots can dry out quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel is its weight , it 's very heavy , and toting it around is difficult . <p> Pea gravel is usually fairly cheap and easy to find . You can easily reuse gravel as long as you wash and sterilize well between crops . After you harvest your crop you can wash the gravel to remove all the old roots and then sterilize them with a 10% bleach and water mix ( one part bleach to 9 parts water ) . The gravel can also be sterilized by using a mixture of Hydrogen Peroxide and water ( use 1 or 2 teaspoons of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide per gallon of water ) . <p> BLava Rock/B <p> Lava rock has been used successfully for years , it is light-weight and retains a fair amount of water in it 's holes and pores . It is used most often in ebb &amp; flow systems with frequent watering cycles . <p> With a good selection of first rate growing mediums available lava rock is used much less often these days . The drop in popularity is due mostly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root damage to the plants , and in most areas of the world it can be hard to find lava rock that is not chemically treated . <p> Sand <p> Sand is the hydroponic medium that raises the most eyebrows . I do n't like it personally because I feel that its small grains make it harder for the root system to develop . It does , however , hold moisture extremely well , and cleans easily ? you can reuse it to your heart 's content , sifting it through a screen after each growing session . I would say the coarser the better when using sand , but that 's just me . <p> Sand is wonderfully inert and is obviously pretty common . It has a tendency to hold salt more than does pea gravel , so be sure to flush it with pure pH balanced water on a regular basis . <p> When mixed with perlite , sand is a great medium to grow in , I 'm told . Just watch that it does n't foul any workings you might have in place to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're burning out water pumps like crazy , you now know why . <p> Oasis cubes <p> These lightweight pre-formed cubes are designed for propagation . A very popular medium for use when growing from seed or from cuttings . This product has a neutral pH and retains water very well . <p> The cubes are meant to be a starter medium and come in three sizes up to 2 " x 2 " . They can be easily transplanted into practically any kind of hydroponic system or growing medium ( or into soil ) . <p> Jiffy Peat Pellets <p> These peat pellets are designed for propagation . Also a popular medium for use when growing from seed or from cuttings . <p> Peat Pellets made of Canadian sphagnum peat moss permit abundant aeration , uniform drainage and easy root penetration . Peat Pellets are made with small amounts of lime ( balances pH ) and fertilizer ( to help seedlings get started ) . These compact pellets swell up when water is applied to form round pre-dibbled growing pots . The peat is held together by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when roots push through the netting . Transplant shock is greatly reduced because the entire pot can be planted without disturbing the roots.These also come as a mix of peat and coco and they also come in the for of cubes . 10985 @qwx420985

Eric 's was the worst one , very horrible stuff and full of hate . Dylan 's was more depressing , most about how he hated himself , how ugly he thought he was and how he want to kill himself and other people , etc . <p> Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold made several home videos which have been kept tight under wraps since Time magazine blew the cover off of them without consent from the families of those who died .

Time called the tapes the shooters ' " final word , to all those who had picked on them over the years , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner demons " . <p> When Time 's reporter Tim Roche got access to the tapes , he wrote an article for the magazine on December 20 , 1999 , he said that there were five video tapes - the " Basement Tapes " . After the article hit the public , the families of the victims threatened to sue Jefferson County for the breach -- the families had n't even seen the content and here it was , staring at them from the pages of a magazine the whole world could read . Jefferson County quickly allowed the families to view them before they hid them in the vaults indefinitely . <p> Supposedly " the basement tapes " containing motives for the School Shootings have never been realeased for fear of copycat crimes .

Eric Harris adjusts his video camera a few feet away , then settles into his chair with a bottle of Jack Daniels and a sawed-off shotgun in his lap . He calls it Arlene , after a favorite character in the gory Doom video games and books that he likes so much . He takes a small swig .

Just because I put a 10 week strain in 12/12 does n't mean it is going to start to flower on day one if already presexed . It still takes time for the plant to change the growth hormones to flower hormones . That strain went 12 weeks before I harvested it and it could have gone longer if I had n't gone on holiday . <p> ' there was a young man named jobby , who haboured an illicit hobby , with renknowned growing fame , he put our plants to shame , that bright young man named jobby ' <p> A lot depends on how long you veg for and if you 're growing from seed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have vegged until the plant has reached maturity then it 'll already be showing pre-flowers anyway .

Took it out of the polystyrine box and cracked two of the tubes ! <p> Plugged it in nonetheless . Half the tubes still work , so I guess I at least have a 125w cfl , ( which I reckon is just enough for one plant ) .

Will I be poisoning my beloved plant ? <p> Believe it or not , I was using a 25W ( 1200 lumin ) from Tescos . The plant got really bushy and those white hairs are there - big leaves - really healthy . I wonder if it was so effective ' cos the baby bulb was in one of those almost spherical , glass white shades which kinda covered the plant completely ? It 's a big ol ' shade . <p> Anyway - bad news then . <p> Hmmm 27 down the drain and another 27 to spend then .

It should be though , especially if the tube was broken outside the grow space and there was time for the mercury to dissipate , and if you have n't inadvertantly sprinkled the phosphor over the plants . ( The phosphor may still contain a small amount of mercury . ) <p> well I have used a damaged one for ages , just like yours , couple of tubes out and I 'm still alive so I would not sweat it tbh . Still , I ought to replace mine really but there 's no way it 's particularly dangerous imo . <p> Having come this far in a first grow ( which sounds like it 's gone well ) , I 'd either : <p> 1 - Tape up the cracks and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case the control gear does n't like it . 2 - Get a couple more cheap 20/23/30 Watt lamps and add those , until you can replace the broken one . <p> Right , I 'm being sensible .

I did a little research on it &amp; discovered some interesting facts about it , People do n't  realise how dangerous it is , if you breath it in it can cause serious health problems . <p> Have you ever heard the saying " mad as a hatter " ? , well that comes from the 18th century when mercury was used in the production of felt &amp; bowler hats , where the hats were lined with mercury contaminated felt which caused mercury poisoning &amp; that made the hatters go crazy , check it up on the net . Once in the body , whichever way it gets there , its stored in the body mostly in the joints which could/will cause a deformaty later in life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attitude &amp; learning difficulties in them , also kidney &amp; liver problems in all ages of human . <p> So before anybody jumps down my throat about this , as i said ive had to deal with this stuff &amp; IT IS an enviromental hazard &amp; highly toxic . <p> In its vapor state , this is when its the most dangerous . It does not dissipate quickly , it is a heavy metal , it settles in fibers in the carpets/flooring or clothing &amp; will contaminate anything it comes into contact with . So contaminated item/s must be removed &amp; destroyed , that 's what the ES did to the stuff they took away with them . If its in the carpet everytime someone walks over it or the temp in the house is high enough it becomes airborn , vaporised &amp; can be inhaled . <p> Its fine when inside an enclosed sealed unit but not outside it in a small contained room/building , it would be ok if it was outside the house because it would evaporate into the air or disappear into the soil . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermometer was enough to do permanent damage to a human &amp; that 's why you do n't  get it in home or medical thermometers anymore , its some chemical red shit that reacts to heat &amp; cold . <p> Where in the house did it break ? Was it on a carpet , lyno , laminate , floorboards or concrete flooring ? . <p> Sorry if that worries you m8 but better safe than sorry i always say , maybe its time people started to learn what their working with and how dangerous it can be , because i think its in quite alot of bulbs &amp; they do n't  label things telling you that there are potentially dangerous enviromental toxins contained in the innocent looking product/s or what to do if it breaks . <p> Rant , history &amp; enviro lesson over . <p> Disclaimer <p> Anything that i post in this forum is purely fictional &amp; to be considered as a lie , any picture/images that I post are not captured by myself and are available freely on the internet.I do not condone or promote the smoking or cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preservation of the cannabis plant for the use/s by man . <p> And yet my uncle , who had access to these things , used to give us little jars of it to play with ( perhaps about a teaspoonful or two ) .

The levels are very low in newer lamps ( T5 , etc. ) , but older ones had more . Manufacturers should , and are starting to , label them and include instructions on how to handle breakages , and on safe disposal ( broken or not ) . <p> The usual practice/advice for breakages seems to be : Open the windows , leave the room , close the door , wait fifteen minutes . Go back and , using gloves , carefully collect the pieces and wrap them up . Dispose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves , by taking them to a recycling point/civic amenity . Never put them in with your domestic waste . <p> Its crazy what they put in products for everyday use , dangerous &amp; toxic substances all around us &amp; you never hear of it until something goes wrong .

I am using soil with biobizz nuts . I stoped using the micro elements few weeks ago because I finished the bottle . <p> Looking frosty mate ! Yeah , I had the same problems , but in veg . I took woody 's advice and used a diluted solution of Epsom Salts ( Mg sulphate ) as a folier spray , it took a few days but my ladies are looking lovely now , apart from abit of nute burn . ( leaves dipped into the feed by accident .

I 'm gon na be awkward here , meainly because I am not a fan of thread hyjacking but mostly because I think your question deserves its own thread . So , I 'm gon na repost the question in sick plants if that 's ok . <p> Bodyplan , Since you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sorting this now . The foliar ES will work for you , just watch your humidity does n't  shoot up . Mix 1/2 tsp of Epsom Salts in hot water , then dilute to 1l and spray the plants 2 days running , once each day , then stop ... This should stop the problem getting worse . I would suggest sprinkling half a tsp on top of the soil too , this will act as a more long term measure to prevent it coming back . <p> Usually , I would not be suggesting spraying in flower , bud rot etc but if you watch the humidity does n't  go over 50% , spray early during the light cycle , you should be ok but NO spraying after 6 weeks , far too dodgy . <p> Since you have got this problem , it suggest you have soft water , which means you will have this issue with most of your grows . So , add 1tbl spoon of ES per 10l of soil to prevent it happening . Alternatively , if you mix around the same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a ph bbuffer and Mg source ( this is what I use ) <p> Listen guys it pains me to say this but there is some fast and loose diagnosis and advice being given here . This plant does not have Mg def and the yellow tint in the pics is caused by the grow light . If you do n't believe me go to this thread and look at the first pic you wo n't see a greener LONG ... Most of the leaf tips are pointing down not up which is a classic sign of Nitrogen clawing and that is what is " wrong " with this plant . Bodyplan has been feeding this plant all the bioboizz nutes including the Grow at 3ml/litre which is far too much Nitrogen as I have told him on his Diary . For the record pic 3 is slight nute burn . I 've been growing for 17 years and have seen it 1000 's of times . Nute burn always appears at the edges of leaves but not necessarily the tips if you get what I mean . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compare it to pic 3 you posted above it 's obviously the same thing . Bodyplan your plant is not seriously i 'll so do not spray epsom salts or anything else on her . It 's up to you but most growers including me like to restrict the amount of Nitrogen during flower cos the plant is not growing vegetation and does n't need it . My advice is to cut the Grow nutes down to 1ml/litre and check the pH run off next time you water cos you may have a salt build up making the soil too acidic . <h> The Following User Says Thank You to illearth67 For This Useful Post : <p> Thanks for all the help illearth67 , I keep learning a lot from you !

No sign of popping up so I had a poke into the soil a while ago to see if there was anything going on . 2 of the seeds had loads of tiny white maggot things wriggling around them , some of them moving in and out of the crack along the seeds One of the seeds had a small tap root but it did n't get very far probably due to these little shites . Any advice on what they may be ? I guess those 2 seeds are dead now ? The third one did n't seem to have any bugs but it had n't shown any signs of germinating . The pests look like tiny white worms , could n't see any legs or anything on them . Sorry the pics are not higher quality . <p> A day or so after I started germinating the seeds , I found a little white bug crawling around the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . That bug was bigger than the ones I found today , and I 'm pretty sure I saw legs on the little fucker . I did n't get any pics though coz I just killed it straight away . But one possibility is that these smaller ones could be the eggs of that bug . <p> The soil I am using is just regular soil from my market . Had been watering the seeds/soil every couple days with tap water . I have a 2-week-old pineapple express in the same soil and it does n't seem to have this problem ( touch wood ) . <p> sounds like it could be fungus gnats , make up some tobbacco juice to water the soil with and put a layer of sand on top of the soil , that , ll suffercate them , or put some sticky traps on top of the soil , and the lavre loves potatoe peelings put some on the surface and that will attract it , a few choices lol if it is fungus gnats <p> Cheers Pieman , that 's very good advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyone know if is possible to see those black heads with the naked eye ? From what I could see today , I did n't see any black heads . But you ca n't tell that from the pictures I uploaded , sorry . My camera was set to capture smaller images and I forgot to change that setting beforehand . <p> Another possibility is that they are " symphyla " . I 've been thinking more about that first bug I found just after I started germination , and from what I 've read today that bug looked like a symphylan . I guess it could have been in the soil I bought and then laid eggs . I really do n't know though , am just throwing ideas around . <p> Whatever they were , they were concentrated only around the seeds . I guess they were feeding off the seeds , the little shites . I may have to consider ways to sterilize my soil before using it . If anyone has advice about this I 'd appreciate if you could let me know . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> you can bake your soil mate , that 's the best way to sterilise it , i , ll send you a good chart , see if its on there , i , ll pm it or i might get bollocked for putting link on here <p> thanks Pieman I got it . That 's a great link . Just flicking through it , I saw a pic of what I think was the bug I first saw first in my pot after I started germinating . They call them Symphilids . Must be from the same family as the one I mentioned above . This is what they say : <p> found mostly in soil composites that have not been cleaned , like soil that has additives in them such as animal manure .

Cheers to Pieman for one of the links . Should be helpful killing the little buggers ... <p> " Small pests that are tan to white colored and look like centipedes .

And nematodes . " <p> " Repression : Reduce the moisture of your soil to the bare minimum . Symphilids burrow deep underground when they sense drought however they will not entirely leave a food source . Dry conditions will force these root chompers deeper into the ground and away from the central root ball of your plant . Root damage will continue , but in a less dangerous location . Ironic that watering is the simplest detection and drought is the stopgap . Predators : The symphilid is native to new zealand and little is known about their biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a effective predator that will work across species . The symphilid moves too quickly for predatory mites to be effective . Manual Removal : Alas , the recourse of manual removal against underground pests is always minimal . If you sight these pests on the surface of your soil , kill them ! This is a slower moving infestation and killing a few females will aid your plant more than you think . Spray : Symphilids require very thorough soil drenching to eradicate . Other root munching pests do not have the depth capabilities of this creature , ensure your ENTIRE medium is soaked or you will see reappearance . Symphilids are resistant to oils and soaps and their eggs are tougher than any root predator in this thread . A simultaneous application of tobacco juice and neem as a soil drench has proven effective against the symphilid. 10 cigarettes per gallon of water , soaked until the water color is between tea and coffee is sufficient .

Occasionally , if a seed fails to germinate using one of the other methods , this can be a useful method . With old seeds , it can be best to " scurrify " them first . In nature , seeds are distributed throughout an area by being eaten by birds &amp; animals who then deficate them out elsewhere on their travels , ensuring the seeds spread far &amp; wide . While the seeds travel through the creatures gut , they go through stomach acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old time growers would use a matchbox with a layer of medium grit sandpaper on the bottom . The seed is then placed inside the matchbox and shaken . You will no doubt have read about rubbing the seed case with a piece of sandpaper , this is a far easier way to do it . <p> A common misconception among growers is that seeds like very high humidity , they do n't  , 40% to 55% is about right . Once the seedling it starting to grow , a rh of around 50-60% ensures good growth but propagators/humidity domes are not needed . The biggest drawback with humidity domes , propagators or covering with clingfilm is that they all create perfect conditions for fungus spores to take hold . SO you can end up battling problems before your plants life has really begun . With these seeds , due to the pc case they are being germinated in needing high air flow to keep the temps down to 78f , these cause the rockwool and root riot cubes to dry out within a few hours , so I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained , NOT to create high humidity . I do not put them in place until the seeds have cracked . <p> Heat mats are another " tool " I have seen used when germinating seeds . These too should be avoided unless you are germinating outdoors ( greenhouse ) over winter . The biggest issue with these is the substrate dries out from the bottom , making it more awkward to tell . This can result in the roots dying off while the surface of the substrate appears moist . <p> On to the start . <p> Glass of water method . ( GOW ) Quite simply , the process here is to soak the seeds in a glass of water , ph 'd to 6.5 This method is most useful for older seeds which can often take a while for the water to penetrate the outer shell . As a seed ages , the amount of water in the hull decreases , meaning older seeds may benefit from this form of germination . This method should not be needed with fresh seeds of between 3 months and 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once the seeds sink , it means that the water has got inside the shell and they need to be removed from the water ASAP to prevent " drowning " . I have some seeds that are over 15 years old . They have been kept in cool , dry places , so they should germinate . I occasionally grow one out but since they are real old school seeds , I like to keep them for posterity and providing the conditions are stable , these seeds can last for a very long time . I have read of seeds several hundreds of years old germinating , so these little things are indeed time capsules . <p> Paper towel method . ( PT ) A piece of kitchen rool is folded over and the bottom dampened with some prepared water . The seeds placed in the paper towel , which is then folded over to stop light getting to the seeds and another little bit of water poured over the top . It is important that access water is drained away so that air can also get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an ideal method to use since transplanting can shock the seedling and of course , damage to the tap root may occur . The other big drawback with this method is that lack of air can lead to the seed " drowning " and pathogens can take hold such as fungus . The big advantage of this method is that new growers are usually impatient . So being able to see signs of life after a day or two from your seeds is just great . Also , as with the GOW method , you do n't  waste medium on dodgy seeds . Though Rockwool or root riot cubes are only around 10p each , soil/coco , probably the same , ( I have never worked it out ) , over the years , adding in cuttings etc , this can add up . I hate throwing away something I do not feel I have had use from ( miser/ebeneezer and yes I hate xmas ) . <p> Direct Soil method . My preferred method when growing in soil . I use party cups for this method , prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason for party cups is simply they are small , so not much medium is needed as opposed to going straight into large pots . When using large pots for seeds , it is very difficult to guage your watering . Although larger pots are better suited to auto 's so they do n't  have to be potted up , I would still use this method , even for auto's. 2 clear plastic party cup have some holes drilled in the bottom to provide drainage . One is then covered in duct tape to prevent light penetrating it , the other is filled with the soil . The soil is then " tapped down " by simply tapping on a firm surface . Water is then added to the soil and tapped down again . The reason for clear cups is so you can see into the cups.P1040858.jpg 2 reasons for this . 1 , so you can see if there are air pockets in the soil and 2 , as the plant develops , you lift out the inner cup and can see root development . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am also using both Trichaderma and mycorrhizae in soil and coco . These little fun guys ( get it ? ) attach themselves to the root structure as it forms and extend the roots , if done properly , by as much as 100% opr even more . More roots = more flowers = more bud . The use of these is a little sub experiment , I have places layers in the soil &amp; coco , so it is a layer of medium , then a layer of myco , then more medium , then trichaderma , then more medium , then the seed , covered with medium . SO as the roots grow , they will come into contact with the funghi . Do n't  know if this will work but felt it was worth a try.P1040854.jpg <p> Directly into Coco method . Simply a process of filling the cup with coco , tapping down to remove air pockets , then placing the seed and covering with coco . It is recommended to plant the seed as deep as its length . These seeds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the pages of this forum , there are often comments about the seed case being stuck to the cotelydon or the membrane holding the cotelydon together , preventing them from opening . This is because the seed wasnt planted deep enough . The seed NEEDS to force its way through the medium to remove the shell and membrane and strengthen itself . Overall , this method is more or less the same as directly into soil . The main difference is once the cotelydon ( false leaves ) start to discolour/pale , it is time to start applying some nutrients . Formulex will be used as a starter nutrient . As with soil , Tricky &amp; Micky are being used in the same method . <p> Directly into Root Riot cubes . Simply a process of placing the seed into the pre-drilled hole . Many growers make their own hole but I have never found issue with doing this . Once in place , I tear off a small piece of cube to cover over the hole so the seed begins life in darkness . This is not squashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with root riot cubes is the speed they can dry out at if there is a lot of air extraction/low humidity . As the picture shows , I cover the cube with duct tape , simply to help prevent the drying out . Even if using the cups as covers as I do , they will still dry out in around 48 hours . For this reason , I would not use them for seeds . They are ok for cuttings , especially if your end medioum is to be coco or soil . On the other hand , though they can be used for hydro methods , I would not recommend because of their tendency to become soggy and retain too much water , which can lead to stem rot(sr) . I like my immediate root zone next to the stem to dry a little , simply to encourage the plant to send out more roots and prevent SR . <p> Directly into Rockwool method . There is little more to say about rockwool that has n't  been said already about the other methods . The positive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riot cubes and are ideal if your end method is hydro . On previous experience , I expect this to be the slowest method . I find rockwool great for cuttings but not so great for seeds . However , I may be doing something wrong in the process ? P1040859.jpg 10986 @qwx420986 <p> After 12 hours , the seeds in water have sank , so time to place them in their respective new homes . One goes into Rockwool , the other into a Root Riot cube . As with the direct methods , the seed is planted to its side , ensuring the seed case &amp; membrane are removed , then a piece of medium is placed over so the seed can start out in darkness . Nothing else to report <p> After 36 hours , one of the paper towel seeds has sprouted its taproot . Very carefully , with a pair of tweezers , I pick up the seed , tring to make sure I do not damage the tap root.Attachment 122615 Damage the tap root at this stage and the game is over . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not use the paper towel method . I am getting shaky hands and bad eyes , so delicate meanouvering like this is just too much of a liability for the poor seeds . As with the direct methods , the seed is planted to its side , ensuring the seed case &amp; membrane are removed , then a piece of medium is placed over so the seed can start out in darkness . <p> After 3 days hours , the second seed has cracked and is placed in its final medium of Rockwool <p> I can also see signs of life from the soil seeds with the R/W &amp; RR failing to show yet . <p> Due to Mycorrhizae and Trachiderma being used in Soil and Coco , I expect their growth to be much faster than R/W or RR . <p> After 5 days , all but one of the rockwool seeds have sprouted . I suspect I may have nicked the taproot on this seed when transplanting so I do what I tell people never to do and that is go digging around looking for planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if something goes wrong , I would demonstrate the consequences . I can happily do this because I did not pay for the seeds . On digging around , I found the seed has cracked and is opening out slowly but the medium was dry at the point in the cube . I gave it a little water , then re-covered over with medium and wait to see if I have killed it or not . If I have , as ever , the squidgy organic part of the process has failed ( me ! ) . Attachment 122617 The seedlings are growing nicely now . The coco babies are coming on much better than the other media , which has surprised me a little . I know how roots love coco but since I have only grown clones in coco before , this is a nice surprise . Roots are clearly visible at the sides of the transparent cup after just 6 days in there . <p> The soil seeds are almost as developed as the coco ones but roots not yet visible at the cup sides.Attachment 122618 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockwool cubes though both are very disappointing in terms of development in comparison to the coco &amp; soil ones . This may be because of the funghi I used but I like to think the coco and soil are just better for germinating seeds . This is the difficulty , trying not to draw conclusions from such a small sample but the roots clearly love that coco.P1040915.jpg <p> More progress for the coco &amp; soil seedlings with the rockwool lagging behind the root riot cubes still . The rockwool seedling got some water today , while the others all got a taste of molasses for the first time . Not too strong , just half a tsp in 1l of water , then ph 'd . Only a few ml was used in each medium . This is not to feed the seedlings , it is to feed the friendlies in the root zone . I am a firm believer that the healthier your roots , the healthier your plant will be . This leads to a solid basis for growing big fat buds . <p> It appears that yesterdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem better today ? That could be wishful thinking though ? <p> P1040917.jpg My plan is to take the seedlings through to transplanting to the next stage . With the coco &amp; soil , this will be dictated by the roots activity . Once the roots are starting to head down the pots , I will transplant . With the RR &amp; RW , transplanting can be much earlier , I like a good bunch of roots coming through before transplanting into an appropriate hydro setup . <p> The coco seedlings are now onto their 3rd set of full leaves , 4th just visible . The Root Riot have their 4th set of leaves pointing upwards but the root growth is not as prolific or the leaves themselves are a little smaller . The soil are more or less in between the RR &amp; Coco , with the r/w lagging well behind . With the rockwool , this is my fault , the medium is far too damp so the cover has been removed in the hope of drying it out a bit . I do not like squeezing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now also for fear of crushing roots as well . I do n't  want to shock the seedling . <p> With the nice mass of roots coming through the Root Riot seedlings , I would now be transplanting if I were keeping these babies . At this statge , if transplanting into soil or coco , I would sprinkle a little Trichaderma onto the roots and also a little mycorrhizae in the medium where they will be in contact with the roots . Likewise with the Rockwool , With a good bunch of roots , I would now be transplanting into their home . Depending on which hydro method I would be using , they would be going into clay pellets , probably ina netpot . The main point about transplanting is to bury the main stem up to around an inch below the cotelydons . This allows for getting to the lower branches later on if pruning ( when lollypopping for instance ) or for lst training . You do n't  want too much stem however , as this can result in thin weak stems unable to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now is the time to say goodbye to both root riot and rockwool seedlings . They have served their purpose . <p> P1040914.jpg If you look closely at the Coco seedlings , you can see the green is not as dark as on the other mediums . Also , the cotelydon are quite pale green . This tells me it is now time for these to be fed . The others still look ok , the cotelydon are still dark and the leaves are quite dark too . I will be feeding 1/4 strength Formulex ( 1.25ml per l ) with 1/2 strength RootFast ( 0.5ml per l ) and 1/4 strenth Nirtozyme ( 0.5ml per l ) . This sounds a lot of products and it is ! I want to encourage fast root growth as I see this as the key to large , high yielding healthy plants . I am also a bit of a product junkie ! These are optional of course and my main reason for using them is to demonstrate how and when to use them without going overkill . I firmly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want them to really thrive since I have decided to keep the Coco girls . <p> Day 13 , Disaster strikes ! While watering the seedlings , I accidentally touch the tube of the 300W cfl and it instantly blows . Damn . I go to get my spare 250W , Blue spectrum CFl and drop it . That is blown too . SO I have to return the seedlings to their former home of the pc case . The main problem with this is purely the lack of light . They were coming along nicely so now I have to wait until a replacement bulb arrives . Today is Thursday and the new bbulb wont be here until Monday or Tueseday . I am at a family thing over the weekend so I hope there are no more problems . <p> Back again and there were more issues . The soil seedlings dried out a bit while I was away . I had put extra bulbs in the pc case and turned the ventilation on but forgot to cover the cups . This dried them out fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guide . The coco seedlings have done ok , though I would have expected them to have more development had they remained under the 300W light . New light is here but I need to collect it . ( There is a good tip for you . NEVER have anything connected with growing delivered to your home address , especially lights , fans cf 's and seeds ) Tomorrow is transplant day for both . As you can see , the root mass on the coco is very good compared to the soil . However , since the soil dried out a bit and started eating itself , this will have shocked the seedling , causing the difference in development . Before the bulb blowing and me being away , they were neck &amp; neck . So this demonstrates how just a couple of days shock at this stage can hamper seedling development . The soil seedlings will now be transplanted into some buckets and be hardened off to go in a friends greenhouse , the coco ones will become my next grow . The coco ones will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the end result will be a sort of rdwc/water farm with coco . I just hope I do n't  get too much coco clogging pumps etc .

The salts were discovered imbuing the spring waters of Epsom , England , and are often used by gardeners as a folk-wisdom plant remedy . <p> As Cannabis is indeed a plant , and plants require nutrients , one common scourge of growers is the constant necessity of purchasing , using and dispensing of gallons of nutrient solutions . Various macro- and micro-nutrients can be provided in a myriad of forms ; however , these days , much more emphasis is being placed upon keeping Cannabis gardens as organic as possible . Well-maintained , clean , organic grow rooms and gardens tend to produce the best-tasting , highest quality buds , which are also safer for medical patients to consume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfate ( SO4 , an ester or salt of sulfuric acid ) in a gentle form that is easy for Cannabis plants to process - one that does not build up in soil over time . This home remedy is also simple to use , inexpensive and a highly-soluble supplement for organic Cannabis growers . However , Epsom salts are usually only applied to plants that are visibly lacking in magnesium , or strains that are typically magnesium-deficient . <p> Why do Cannabis plants need magnesium ? <p> Magnesium allows plants to uptake phosphorous ( P ) , nitrogen ( N ) and sulfur ( S ) from soil . Plants that are deficient tend to show yellowing leaves , which may remain green at the leaf veins . Magnesium deficiencies cause a different yellowing effect than nitrogen shortages or spider mite damage ; be certain to correctly diagnose excesses and deficiencies in your plants before adjusting your nutrients , or you may burn the plants while worsening whatever deficiency ails **39;1794;TOOLONG <p> Yellowing leaves with green veins may be a sign that your plants are magnesium-deficient . Magnesium facilitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The element also strengthens cell walls , assisting the plant in maintaining its structure and vitality . If you notice slow growth , a slight curling of the leaves and a yellowing of the leaf color ( typically beginning towards the bottom of the plant ) , there is a good chance that your plants are magnesium-deficient . These plant symptoms are often referred to within the growing community as ' praying for magnesium ' . Begin with small doses to test the results , which you should see in about four days . <p> Concerning Cannabis flowers - and potentially seeds - magnesium is essential to a healthy yield . Those growing either for or from seed should note that magnesium also plays a vital role in both seed production and germination . <p> Why is sulfur necessary for weed plants ? <p> In combination with magnesium , sulfur forms a sort of ' multi-vitamin ' for plants , allowing for increased uptake and impact of nutrients and minerals , and acting as a general prophylactic for your plants . Sulfur binds with the soil to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and potassium ( K ) to the plant 's roots , thus enhancing the capability of soil and added nutrients . The plant 's production of amino acids , enzymes and vitamins are all affected by sulfur levels , making the element essential to plant growth and development . <p> Rarely deficient in most modern Cannabis nutrients , sulfur also assists in chlorophyll production , helping gardeners to keep their plants green , vibrant and healthy . This and the aforementioned benefits are especially important for long-life plants , such as mothers or outdoor strains with a slow finish , as sulfur helps to sustain longevity and over-all plant health while protecting against environmental stress . <p> Technical growers should note that reverse-osmosis ( RO ) , ion exchange or distilled watering systems will effectively remove most sulfate from drinking water , which can easily be replaced with Epsom salts , if necessary . ( Growers in areas known for ' hard ' water will often give their plants extra magnesium . ) <p> How to Use Epsom Salts to Supplement Soil : <p> Whether growing in pots or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your soil before you have even begun growing any plants ; that is , if you are not already using dolomite lime as a magnesium source . Soil that measures a pH above ' 7 ' - or one that is high in potassium ( K ) and/or calcium ( Ca ) , which compete with magnesium for uptake by the plant - can be replenished via applications of the salts . Such soil may not react as well to a direct granular or dissolved application ; plants grown in this soil tend to respond much better to a foliar spray or full watering with Epsom salts . <p> Large-scale outdoor growers in the Pacific Northwest ( and gardeners in the Southeast ) often struggle with depleted local soil that must be turned and treated before cuttings or seeds can be planted . Prepare your substrate by mixing in one teaspoon of salts per gallon of soil , then planting seeds , seedlings or clones - magnesium sulfate can account for faster germination . If you prefer , you can wait until your seedlings are a few inches tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cuttings - which can be notoriously difficult to root in their new environment , depending upon strain and clone health - may potentially take hold more quickly and experience less shock as a result of this soil treatment . <p> Smaller-scale and indoor growers benefit more readily and consistently from dissolving the salts into water rather than soil . In a watering can or barrel , combine up to two tablespoons per gallon of water - first mixing the salts with a bit of warm water to thoroughly dissolve them . This can be given to the plants every four to six weeks , if necessary . <p> To apply a foliar spray , dissolve up to one tablespoon per gallon of water and spray Cannabis plants at the beginning of each cycle or when needed , focusing the majority of the fine mist upon the underside of the leaves . Avoid spraying your plants past the first few weeks of flowering , or while the lights are on ; if you must spray them during the ' daylight ' cycle , allow the plant to cool down before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps back on . It is more effective , however , to spray the plants when both they and the room are cooler in temperature . <p> Epsom Salts to Revive Mothers or Root-Bound Plants : <p> When plants remain for too long in the same pot , they can suffer from salt buildup and become nutrient-locked and/or pot-bound . An easy and gentle Epsom salt solution will dissolve the accumulated salts and allow the plant to regain healthy circulation by unclogging its root cells . This is especially effective in plants that require direct sunlight - a category in which Cannabis is firmly listed - due to the importance of magnesium sulfate in photosynthesis. 10985 @qwx420985

@@46022399 @6022399/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> The Bio Bizz curse <p> This is in response to a lot of posts I see regarding the use of Bio Bizz nutes &amp; compost here in the Uk ..... <p> Let 's see if I can clear up some of the confusion regarding the Bio-bizz nutrient range . Firstly you need to understand that when we grow using compost for our medium we need to look at the whole picture in terms of our plants requirements in the way of nutrition and where it 's going to come from . The nutes we choose is only part of the picture , you have to take into consideration the nutrient content of the compost and the water you use for mixing your nutrient solution . Bio-bizz nutrients are manufactured in Holland and are mostly formulated around their water which is very soft across most of the country , it contains very little in the way of mineral salts . Here in the Uk the water quality varies massively from hard to very soft , i 've seen Ec 's that range from 0 in parts of Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some supplementation will be required to replace some minerals in affected areas , see water quality chart below . This is why you see so many different results when using Bio-bizz in the Uk it 's mainly down to regional variations in water quality . <p> Let 's look at compost and what it does and what we require from it . Compost comes in many variations in terms of consistency and its pre loaded nutrient content . When choosing a compost you have to consider how much additional feed &amp; supplementation is going to be required based on what it contains and the stage of growth your plants are at . You need to decide how much control you want over your feeding regime , if you want full control over feeding then you want a very lightly fertilised compost like Plant magic soil supreme , Bio-bizz light mix or even a multi purpose seedling compost . If you do n't  want to start feeding from the off then you want a compost that already contains enough nutrients for a few weeks , a general purpose compost like B&amp;Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging baskets and planters as these often contain some form of water retaining ingredient which hinders the drying . You want to be running a wet &amp; dry cycle when feeding/watering compost the quicker it dries the quicker you can water again . <p> Nutes &amp; compost are just tools that are needed to grow our plants , we need to learn how to use and adapt them to our plants requirements based on the compost &amp; water quality being used . Bio Bizz are essentially organic nutes , these type of nutes need to be used in harmony with the compost . Your compost is alive , yes it contains millions of little helpful fellas know as the micro herd , these little guys are busy consuming organic matter that is in the compost and the nutes we pour in . They turn the nutes and organic matter into a usable form that can then easily pass into the root system . The plants ca n't use organic nutes directly like they do with chem nutes they depend on this complex interaction between nutes , water and oxygen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to Bio bizz nutes , they are a 2 part nutrient system that consists of grow and bloom components , the grow contains mainly N and the micro elements and the bloom contains mainly PK &amp; molasses , these nutes are meant to be used in conjunction with each other in the bloom phase so you maintain your micros throughout flowering . To me this seems to be a bit of a strange configuration given most 2 part nutes have a dedicated bottle for veg and another for bloom , this is where most folks fall foul of the Bio bizz curse . Another thing with Bio bizz is that they have changed their formula a few times in recent years and charts to match , some folks will be going off the old charts which causes further issues , they also give different guides for light mix and all mix . These charts ai n't worth a shit they have no relevance to all the various composts available and water variations here in the Uk . That goes for all grow charts regardless of manufacturer , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coco grows but the feed chart is a load of rubbish , you have got to tailor the feeds to your own situation and what the plants are asking for . Worth mentioning also is Ph , for some reason people read these forums and see the hydro guys talking about Ph adjustment and jump to the conclusion that Ph adjustment is necessary for all types of growing , well if you are growing in the Uk using the water from your tap then there is absolutely no need to adjust Ph when growing in compost , the micro herd in a well balanced compost is more than capable of buffering the Ph to where it needs to be easily .... <p> My conclusion is this ... If you 're in the uk and want to grow organically or just in compost generally then do n't use Bio bizz nutes go for Plant magic old timers grow and bloom , one bottle for veg and another for bloom its designed and formulated to work with Uk water and is a piece of piss to use . I recommend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of all mix which in my opinion is way to hot and takes the control away from the grower . <p> great now I 'm worried . I 'm on my first grow and as if there was n't enough to worry about , you throw this at me . Now I 'm worried about yield . I use biobizz all mix and bio bizz grow , bloom , and heaven and live in a very hard water area . What would you suggest now in my position . Is changing nutes now ( 10 days in flower ) a bad idea ? Is water softening also bad ? Is the extra calcium ok as long as you do n't see toxicity ? Worried now .... <p> All very good and helpful but maybe a more up to date map ? ? Copyrighted in 2001 <p> The chart is just to illustrate the variations of water quality in the Uk it does n't matter if its 2001 it 's still pretty much valid . <p> Originally Posted by kellya86 <p> great now I 'm worried .

Althogh I ca n't see it being faulty because it 's brand new and reads 000 in the air . <p> Roll on the RO system next week : D <p> Up to you if you wan na retest . Maybe your meter is fcked ? lol ; ) <p> C21H30O2 <p> 02-02-12 , 06:24 PM <p> lol do n't  say that i got 20 seeds ready for planting lol and i plan on having a smooth ride with these i 'm diong 4 seeds at a time <p> I just bought some Evian to test its ec .. yours showed 100ppm but mine shows 631ppm ! ! <p> WTF ! ! Am I being cursed by someone with a voodoo doll or sommat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I will add to all your theories now . <p> I will admit to not reading all the thread purely because I got the drift from the skimming through . <p> I too have a similar problem to you tabba , but much worse . I will put up pictures later just to prove what I 'm saying about my tap water quality . <p> Now I understand that some elements in the water if in too higher amount could possibly lock out others . <p> I have been growing inside for over 3 years , I use bottled water , the lowest background EC I have found is .4 . It does fluctuate I warn you now . Sometimes it can be .4 others .6 . I pay 49c per 5 litres . <p> Lasy year I carried out an experiment with my tap water . Last time I checked it had a background 4.3 EC . <p> I grew these outside last year on my balcony , with water straight from my tap into the pots . They had feed but not alot , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I found no signs of def , well no more than usual . <p> LONG ... and that 's a link to the whole gallery . <p> And in fairness my garden plants do n't complain . <p> So figure that one out . They do say however that our tap water is not fit for human consumption and not fit to bathe young children in . <p> Talpa <p> 04-02-12 , 02:38 PM <p> Taht 's what I plan to do .. or buy some ec calibration fluid . Althogh I ca n't see it being faulty because it 's brand new and reads 000 in the air . <p> Roll on the RO system next week : D <p> Up to you if you wan na retest . Maybe your meter is fcked ? lol ; ) <p> It should read 0.0 in the air as there is no electrical contact being made . Regardless of being out ? <p> Tabbatha <p> 04-02-12 , 02:45 PM <p> That 's what I was thinking and yes it does read a dead 0 in the air .. so I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be getting the harder waters in this region . Weird though because Evian all comes from the same place .. yet our readings are totally different . <p> : ) <p> Talpa <p> 04-02-12 , 02:47 PM <p> I will add as well , sorry for the multiple posts , I germ all my seeds from my bottled water , and like I said it has a background ec .4-.6 but I always add H &amp; G Roots Excelerator @ .3ml per litre . ( 1.5ml per 5L bottle ) <p> Due to the slight bit of N it has in it my EC goes to .8 generally . And as a rule in soil/jiffy pellets never really have any germing problems or defs . <p> I understand you grow organically and I wonder whether this is the problem . With the nutes not being readily available when they are applied ? <p> Talpa <p> 04-02-12 , 02:51 PM <p> make sure you get the right calibration fluid as well there all different . Check the manual first . <p> Tabbatha <p> 04-02-12 , 02:53 PM <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conslusion that my plants feed fine if they 're given fresh fishmix ( even at higher than the bottle dose ) , but the SECOND I go anywhere near anything that has calcium in it , even a small amount ( like seaweed ) , I see problems straight away . <p> I 've ordered a filter cos the RO system was out of stock today , and that 'll do because it will remove most of the hardness and thus lower my ec . Then I 'll test it and see if it makes a difference . <p> I no longer know what exactly is my problem as it stays fluid all the time and keeps changing .. but I 'm going to eliminate all the possibles and see what 's left . Give it a bit of the old Sherlock Holmes treatment : ) <p> Talpa <p> 04-02-12 , 03:04 PM <p> I have considered that , Talpa .. but I came to the conslusion that my plants feed fine if they 're given fresh fishmix ( even at higher than the bottle dose ) , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , even a small amount ( like seaweed ) , I see problems straight away . <p> I 've ordered a filter cos the RO system was out of stock today , and that 'll do because it will remove most of the hardness and thus lower my ec .

Have you been on you water authorities website and found the make up of you water ? <p> Tabbatha <p> 04-02-12 , 03:13 PM <p> Yes and yes <p> The one I wanted is more than adequate for what I 'd need .. and my water company reports are limited . I 've asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surprise : D <p> Talpa <p> 04-02-12 , 03:18 PM <p> I just read this as well because I know nothing about BioBizz or FishyFood . No offence meant by suggest your a noob , but not sure if this was possibly worth a try ? <p> Beginner 's biobizz nutrient advice <p> Thought I would throw this out there to all the newbies out there growing the herb for the first time and before the spend big bucks on nutrient and boosters . <p> I want to talk about biobizz 's fish mix and keeping it simple . <p> Organics is more forgiving than chemical nutes as it harder to over feed and suffer nutrient burn as the soil act like a buffer.So before even messing about with potting amendments just use this guide . <p> I have mentioned fish mix as it has been giving me and others proven results from veg to flower without bloom , potting amendments and mixing 2 or more nutrients . <p> You will need : Pots <p> seedling cutting soil/rooting cube <p> decent premium soil <p> fish mix <p> Start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strong in nutrient ) like root riots/rapid rooters or a very small pot of cutting/seedling compost . Dig a whole in the center of a large pot if going straight into final pots and fill with cutting compost . <p> ( they can not be left in there for long as there is little nutrient but this will bridge the plant from seedling to early juvenile as juveniles are less nute sensitive a 50/50 mix of seedling compost and hot compost can be used but trial it first to avoid nutrient burn/lockout but this will give more nutrient if your starter pots are bigger ) . <p> Plant into final pot of decent well draining hot compost ( I like non organic west+ adv or west+ adv with added JI ) for autos or small pot ups for photos sensitive . just add water for 2-4 weeks of veg cycle . <p> Then add fish mix 1ml per litre at every water for either the first week of flower or last week of veg ( to get the micro fauna ready ) then up feeding up to 1-3ml per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nute up fresh never let it sit about as it seems to go sour quickly <p> Then reduce to 1ml per feed for the last 7-10 days to reduce a possible build up but by the time this is broken down by the fauna I doubt the plant will use much of it saving expensive ferts with no loss of yield and a better smoke and yes heavy feeding on organics can affect the smoke . <p> So keep it simple guys on your first grow before making life hard as it will be tough figuring out what you have done wrong if you added a 101 items . <p> I do have other amendment I have used through trial and error which I may post later but your first grow is about reading your plants . <p> If your plants are very yellow early on add 1ml more fish mix each water or if they are curling down and are dark green reduce the mix by 1ml each water <p> Tabbatha <p> 04-02-12 , 03:25 PM <p> That 's perfect . Cheers mate . That 's actually how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batmix , using airpots + big lights means nutes are needed a lot quicker and a light dose of fishmix sorts out any yellowing lower canopy . <p> I think we can safely rule out oranic nutes , the soil or the groom being a poblem now .. so the only thing left is the water . As soon as I told everyone that I had a starting ec of 0.8+ they said " ah ha .. there 's the problem right there " . <p> So .. clean water is pretty much the last thing I need to be 100% on and then can truly know what all this crap has been about . And , frankly , it 's most likely because I have very little margin for error and keep crossing that line somehow . <p> Do n't worry though fella I 'm way past pulling my hair out and I 'm quite peaceful about it all these days . Just sort of taking my time and seeing what I can learn for the grow that will supercede all my previous attempts . <p> Include them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an example I 'd add nutes up to whatever figure incusive of nutes and water . As I understand it that 's the correct way ? <p> : ) <p> C21H30O2 <p> 04-02-12 , 03:47 PM <p> At end of this month 70 quid is going on one of those ubber ec ppm temp thing I ca n't afford to risk my pants even if I 'm only growing 4 <p> Talpa <p> 04-02-12 , 04:16 PM <p> At end of this month 70 quid is going on one of those ubber ec ppm temp thing I ca n't afford to risk my pants even if I 'm only growing 4 <p> Are you talking about a tri meter .

I love my EC meter it has never let me down , when ever I go to recalibrate it upon checking it is spot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for this meter . <p> I bought this as my EC meter back in 2008 never let me down . PH pens a different story but its still pretty solid . Even my Blue lab combo meter is showing 0.1 EC in my waterfarm , think I may have a root growing in it lol . <p> Anyway my tap water EC has got better , you 've obviously got my .8 ec lol . You ca n't see it in the shot but there is a x10 flashing on the display . <p> This was my point earlier Tabba , did n't want to blow your theories out the window . But I fed those outdoor plants on that water straight from the tap , no PH check just straight into the pots . <p> Two plants chopped early due to going on holiday and did n't want to just leave them . 8.5 oz between the 2 . <p> And yes an EC of 4.0 + .

I 'm under the impression it 's the length of the darkness that 's the trigger not the light ? A plant that is germinated and grown under 14hrs of light will begin to flower within 30 days of germination . A plant grown under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in a vegetative state . A plant that is in full flower and then is exposed to 15hrs of daylength will reveg everytime . <p> If you want to force flowering and then set them outdoors to continue flowering , then you cant place them outdoors before June 21 , the longest day of the year . If the plants are placed outdoors in flower while days are still getting longer , the plant will stop flowering and then begin to reveg once daylenth increases to about 14.5 hrs . <p> Here is a post I stole off another grow site from a grower named BACKCOUNTRY . Anyway , thanks a bunch BACKCOUNTRY . <p> Quote : <p> Does 12/12 mean anything outdoors ? Often I have seen new members ( or members mostly experienced in indoors ) post threads asking when 12/12 occurs outdoors . Often they say they are looking for the time of the season when their plants will start blooming outdoors , many times they are trying to use this date ( Sept 21 Equinox ) plus the strains indoor finishing time to determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that way , we know that most strains have started blooming long before Sept 21st , but there is even more reason why indoor finishing times ca n't be applied outdoors . <p> One thing to realize is that as the day lights length shortens , the plants speed up their blooming , since most plants start blooming long before 12/12 , outdoor plants will take longer to set into blooming and to finish than their indoor grown sisters would . So basically , unless you live very near to the Equator , indoor finishing times will not be applicable outdoors . Finishing times , Photoperiod , Latitude , and how it all works ! ! We all know the basics of vegging and blooming Cannabis ..... when the day is long and the night is short the plant concentrates on vegging(growing) , when the day length shortens enough , the plant starts to bloom . <p> But how does all this work ? Why does the same strain finish at different times in different parts of the world ? Does 12/12 really mean anything outdoors ? Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some growers ? What is a " Auto-flowering " plant ? <p> Let 's get into the meat of the subject shall we ? .............. <p> Photoperiod The first thing to cover here is Photoperiod- Photoperiod is the ammount of time there is light in a 24 hour period . In Cannabis growing , Photoperiod is typically shown like this- 12/12 or 16/8 , or 18/6 , etc . The first number is usually the length of the lighted period , the second shows the balance of the 24 hours that is dark . Outdoors the sun controls the Photoperiod . Its length changes through the seasons according to the movements of the sun in the sky , a matter of fact it causes the change in seasons . This brings us to ...... Photoperiodism Photoperiodism is the reaction of many flowering plants ( including Cannabis ) to changes in Photoperiod . Plants that experience Photoperiodism have pigment cells called Phytochrome that monitor the ammounts of light being absorbed by the plants ( specificly the red end of the spectrum ) , and the length of day . Signals from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow , bloom , and in the case of some trees , to loose their leaves and go dormant in Autum . <p> Most of these plants fall into three catergories concerning blooming times , that being- long day plants ( blooms as day gets longer ) , short day plants ( blooms as day gets shorter ) , and day neutral plants ( blooming is not according to light cycles ) . All Cannabis varieties are either " Short day " , plants or " Auto-flowering " ( known as " Day neutral " outside of the Cannabis community ) . So called " Auto-flowering " plants do not seem to take their blooming cues from the sun , and thus should be considered " Day neutral " , as most seem to be geneticly programmed to bloom according to age insted . <p> The Sun , Latitude , and why the same plants finish different times at different points on the globe <p> The year as we know it is basicly the time it takes for the Earth to make a complete loop around the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis , so that either the northern half or southern half(Hemispheres) have the longer photoperiod . <p> The shortest day of the year is called the Winter Solstice , this day occurs on December 21st in the northern half of the world , on the same day in the southern hemisphere they will have their Summer solstice , the longest day of the year . On June 21s it will be reversed , with the longest day of the year in the north ( Summer solstice ) , and the shortest day in the south ( Winter solstice ) . <p> Two days of the year are known as the equinoxes , one occurs March 21st and one on September 21st . These days represent the halfway point between the longest and shortest days of the year , on these days the day length is almost exactly 12/12 all over the world . If you are in the Northern hemisphere , Mar. 21 is the first day of Spring and September is the first day of Autum , reverse these dates in the southern hemisphere . <p> Latitude Latitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , they are spaced about every 111 Kilometers starting at 0 degrees at the Equator , and graduating north and south from there ( every 111 KM ) to the north pole ( 90 Degrees North ) and South pole ( 90 Degrees south ) . <p> At the Equator the length of day does n't change much from month to month , at both Solstices the length of day is about 12 hours , at both Equinoxes it is about 12 hours , almost perpetual 12/12 . <p> Now let 's take a look at Portland Oregon , this city sits near 45.4 N , which is about exactly halfway between the Equator(O) and the North pole(90N) . At the Winter solstice , the length of day is 8h 41m , at Summer solstice the day length is 15h 41m , and at the Equinoxes it is 12h 12m . <p> And now let 's look at Anchorage Alaska , this city sits at 61.2 N , a little over 2/3 of the way to the North pole ( 90 N ) from the Equator(0) . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer solstice the day length is 19h 22m , and the Equinoxes are 12h 18m . <p> As you move away from the equator ( either north or south ) , you see more distictness between the seasons and the length of days during those seasons . Generally the closer you are to the Equator , the less difference there is between the length of day on the Solstices ( the longest and shortest days of the year . The further you are from the Equator , the more difference there is in length of day between the Solstices , making the Summer shorter and shorter , and the longest day of the year longer and longer the further you go from the eternal 12/12 of the Equator . <p> The Photoperiod sensitive strains of Cannabis are each geneticly programmed to start blooming when day shortens to a certain length* . When these various strains are bred , they become acclimated to that latitudes photoperiod , they are bred to bloom and harvest before that areas climate becomes too cold and dark ( or wet ) , usally to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts agree that it is actually the length of the dark period that matters to plants . <p> When you take a plant that was bred in one location , and move it to a similar Latitude , say from 42 N to 43 N the plant should harvest at nearly the same time . But if you take a plant from 42 N to 50 N , its possible that the plant may not harvest early enough to beat Winter further up north . <p> Length of day Vs . Length of visable light When you see people describe outdoor Photoperiod , they often use the " Length of day " to describe it . " Length of day " is defined legally as the time between sunrise and sunset , the problem with using this figure is that it does n't count the visable light known as " Twilight " , that occurs before sunrise , and after sunset , the day may actually be 1 hour ( or more ) longer ! Cannabis plants do have a cut off point where they no longer consider fading light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is different for each strain grown . Obviously a full moon is not bright enough to affect Cannabis plants , but who really knows where cut off is ? <p> wert <p> 10-05-11 , 04:14 PM <p> it is very strain related . some strains will start to flower around the 14 hour mark , others , mainly sativas may take considerably less . there is no set time . <p> Mr Bloom <p> 10-05-11 , 04:29 PM <p> i thought it was when daylight gets under 12 hours ( sept 26th by a website ) or is it when it gets below 14.5 hours ( aug 18th ) <p> they are outdoors so obv all dependent on sunlight hours ! ! <p> thanks guys <p> Everytime I saw your username it reminded me of something but I could n't think what ... then it hit me : Alex Kidd - a game I used to play on my old Sega Master System LONG ...

I was curious if anyone has any tips for scrog growing . You can never have enough knowledge when it comes to growing the best plant ever . I have a 150 watt HPS light , FYI . Thanks . <p> Check out some of the hydro grow diaries on here , loads of great scrog grows . Its such a big subject , your best bet is to get a diary of your own grow up . That let 's you get loads of experienced growers to take a look and give tips real time <p> My plants have about 4 bud sprouts 4 inches above the scrog screen . But then I have about 8 other bud sprouts that are just at the screen height . Should I switch to 12/12 now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more during the veg phase , or should I keep going at 24 hr. light and let those sprouts get a few inches above the screen ? <p> Looking directly down at my scrog screen it is about 80% full . But some of the bud sprouts have not reached the screen yet , while other sprouts are already above it . The lowest ones are about 3 inches below the screen , and the tallest ones are about 4 inches above the screen . The average is basically right at the screen right now . I am just lining up the sprouts with plant ties and fishing line so they line up and go up the hole in the screen I want them to.What do you think I should do ? Thanks . <p> If it 's 80% full now , you 've left it too late . Cos when you flip and the plant does it 's usual 12/12 stretch , the rest of the screen fills in then . You 'll end up having to cut a few branches away . <p> The lowest ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest ones are about 4 inches above the screen <p> The idea is you keep pulling down the ones that grow taller , tucking it back under and moving it to a different hole on the screen a bit further away , this keeps the canopy even . So just keep tucking the branches down and moving them along further down the screen , you want it so the canopy is even . I 'm guessing the holes on the outter screen are empty . Move the branches that are 4 inches above the screen out to them , so only the tips will be sticking up out of them . Consider snippin off the tip of the main stem as you do n't want it growing anymore if the screen is that full so this help the plant focus on getting the little branches that hav n't made it through the screen up in to the scrog . Snip the main stem , then switch to 12/12 in a few days . <p> Snipping the tops of my tallest sprouts wo n't hurt or shock my plant ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen I can easily fill with the sprouts that are just about to reach the screen . I was just waiting for all the sprouts I was planning to concentrate on vegging to get clearly through the square I was going to send it up through before I switched to 12/12 . <p> I have lots of pics in my profile , check them out and you will see what I 'm dealing with . They are a few days old so the top sprouts are about 2 inches taller but you will get the jist of my situation . Thanks <p> What strain are you growing , so what sort of stretch are you expecting after you flip ? Having looked at your pics you really need to pull the bigger stems under the screen to level out the canopy more . Its also good to tidy up some of the leaves under the screen to improve airflow . You can always top or fim your main stems to slow them down and encourage the other stems as flygerian said , a plant can lose up to 40% without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the wild etc ) but it will slow them down for a day or two while they recover . You 'll find you will have to trim quite a few leaves when they cover budsites later on in the grow , and its worth losing any shoots under the screen that wont make it , they will only waste the plants energy making popcorn . But fella its looking good so far . <h> The Following User Says Thank You to adalicious For This Useful Post : <p> My 2 big plants are P91 and Afghani Bullrider . The smaller one is Great OG . Not so great if you ask me . Would that great OG plant have any chance of surviving if I moved it outside to soil . I have a great tomotato garder with good miracle grow soil and I could keep watering it with my nutrients I use in my hydro reservoir . Do you know if the plant would survive ? <p> The lower real small bud sprouts that are way under the screen , do you think I should just cut those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to the right length and spread throughout the screen correctly ... ready to go 12/12 ? <p> Also I can probably bend the highest sprouts back under the screen or tie them down sideways close to it and hopefully save them from having to cut them because they are pumping out shoot after shoot which I am hoping will relate to nice thick stalks of bud . What do you guys think ? <p> Anyone have a response to my question about the lower bud sprouts that are under my screen and do n't  look like they would produce much of anything anyway ? Should I just cut those off and let the plant use that energy for the veg stage on the big sprouts up above and that are right at the screen which get light from my 150 watt HPS .

The plant at every stem point looks like some pistols <p> I would be more worried about the deficiencies than sex just now . Best advice for any grower is to never flower a plant that is suffering deficiencies or stress . Because of the topping and deficiency , you have both . SO even if this were a more mature plant , you would probably be waiting a while to see flowers . If the plant is stressed or deficient , you are wasting light on something that frankly is not growing . If this were my plant , what would I do ? <p> That discolouration on the top leaves suggest a a immobile nutrient deficiency . With it starting at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best guess would be Manganese . The usual way to get an Mn lockout , in soil , is with a high ph . <p> SO I would test the runoff to see what ph the root zone is and take it from there .

Fuck that , I 'll just use the gas one from now on ! <p> Cool cheers dude , are PAR meters expensive ? ... and if I buy one then I will need everybody 's address who grows with LED 's so that I may visit them and smoke all their weed , I mean measure their PAR 's sorry ! ( I felt dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chart that tell 's me what level is optimal and for each stage of development . Help a bruva out someone ! .... <p> My Green Lamp DS300 has a peak PAR rating of between 1656-2330 @10 cm 's , 1116-1655 @ 30 cm 's and 781-1115 @ 60 cm 's , I just want to be able to compare that to the like 's of the Mars Hydro and be able to tell if those levels are under/adequate or over PAR ! ! ! <p> Cheers dudes and Dudets ( noticed a few female of the species here lately , hi by the way ) . <p> It is the rules the companies are following . The government regulators made it a law that LEDs must be labeled with their nominal power rating . This means a fixture with ten 3w emitters must be listed as a 30w unit . In real life if the LEDs were run at 3w they would fail in very short order , not in 50,000 hours but more like 5,000 . The manufacturers run the diodes and 1/2 to 2/3 power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit at the max . Several brands now list the actual output in the text of their ads , but not all . <p> The other difference that matters is the beam angle . A beam angle of 120 degrees has an intensity falloff four times as great as a 60 degree beam . This is directly related to penetration , even with two units of the exact same wattage the 60 degree beam will reach four times as far into the plant as the 120 degree beam . It seems most generic and less expensive brands use 120 degree lenses so they can brag a larger footprint even though this destroys any advantage LEDs possess . <p> My personal favorite after three years of LED growing is the Hydrogrow 336 PRO , 448 watts output with 57 degree lenses . Their service manager is a real dickhead but the product is unmatched so I put up with him . Second choice is the Magnum Plus . The magnum spectrum needs 714 watts to match the growth of 448 watts of Hydrogrow . Clones like Magnums better than Hydrogrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flux meter cost $300 USD . I am guessing this is considered a PAR meter as it reads 400 nm through 700 nm . I also have red , green , blue , and UVB meters that ran about $200 USD per each . I need a infrared meter with frequency selection , 740 nm has a totally different effect than 850 nm even though both are infrared . This is still out of my price range . <p> Did ya ever find the specs catch ? interested ... have you done a full grow with the mars 2 700w yet ? <p> Peace <p> Nah I mailed smokesara but she never replied , she never does though ! I 'd 've thought someone would have known here but it seems not . I would have bought a marshydro if I 'd have recived the answer because the mars do n't have lenses so would go great in the middle of my tent to just blast everything as the light 'll just go everywhere . Then I could have had my two Green Lamps on either side focusing directly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes mate , well first tip is do n't buy from anyone other than the manufacturer themselves as there are so many crap units floating about . But as for brands and models mate well as you know marshydro are lookin good based on the diaries that have been done recently . I would n't buy anything other than their newest model though , the marshydro2 's , obviously you want to get the amount of watts you are after so you need to buy twice the amount of watts that the model says unless it 's from Green Lamp then the watt ratings acurate , although from what I 've seen on ebay the marshydro 's are being listed with the real wattage in the listing so that 's an improvement . Buy the amount of watts that is equal to the HID wattage you would be happy with . <p> Good brands to go with are Green Lamp , marshydro2 , Grow Northern , Vipar are getting good reviews lately , Gro Blu Apollo 's , Advanced Lights Diamond Series XML150 have a fuking massive 10 watt diodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some good stuff but I have n't seen those in the UK yet although you can probably get them to export . A proper agricultural light from LilTomato Concepts will sort you out but I do n't know how high they 're wattages go . Black Dog have a great rep , Hydro Grow ( might be one word ? ... ) , Solid Apollo 's , Super Gro LED are supposed to be the Roll 's Royce of LED but I 've never read a diary myself . At the end of the day I went with Green Lamp because basically it had everything I thought was important in a LED and was UK based . Plus the manager 's a right laugh . Apparently they 're pullin in over three ounces so that that was good enough for me , although the older models were n't that great I 'd only go for the Diamond Series myself . <p> But then you have to remember that I 'm on my first grow with LED so everything I know is based on what I 've read . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for good grow diaries and see what 's shakin myself . <p> I 've never heard of any law dude , you sure mate ? ... most of us here are in the UK and I do n't think we have anything like that over here . <p> Sigh , I 'm American and do n't understand why our rules are not world wide and just assume they are . My martial arts instructor used to roll his eyes and explain that just being raised in the United States gave an attitude we could not escape . <p> I live in Alaska , the state just went totally legal , sales are flat taxed whether recreational or medical . Personal use is not taxed . Electricity is really expensive here and LEDs are my first choice so I watch power consumption closely . I save almost 30% on my electric bill and the harvests weigh the same . <p> I am in the process of upgrading now that the lights can not be confiscated . I have read all the commercials and am raiding the grow diaries for real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 , old clunky and out of date . 10985 @qwx420985

Iv got some growing in my usual batmix and some in autopots and the autopots are far more bigger and healthier . if you have a few quid to spare i reckon there well worth it , they are about 20 per 15ltr autopot and about 12 for a small res . But they are a piece of piss mate and i reckon they will easily pay for themselves with 1 grow . Iv enjoyed using them so much iv just got another 8 ordered with a bigger res <p> Sounds like over ferting to me are the leaves dying from the tips and spreading from there ? <p> If so defo overferting Mate <p> Be handy to see a pic or two , and go easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aswell , you only really need to use epsoms once at week 3 with organic feeds , and shouldent ever need it with a chem/hydro style nute feed . <p> Well there is two i 'd recomend , biobizz or the one i 'm using at the moment Plant Magic 's organic line , ive used Biobizz for over 15 years and swore by it , but recently Plant Magic started up in the UK , stoners making nutes in the UK for UK stoners , seems daft to not support them myself , i 'm on my first grow with the Plant Magic " oldtimes " organic range following the chart they provide on there website , I have friends also using the new Plant Magic range and nobody has a bad word to say about them thus far ! <p> Greens stock both biobizz and Plant Magic nutes , i 'd say buy the PM range over biobizz simply cos its British , however you will find a full biobizz feeding chart in the organic section here , and if nobody has put the Plant Magic oldtimes one up ill put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Im sat here now fourteen hours after taking a hit of black mamba . I had less than I fifth of a gram in a bong and before the bong was finished I noticed the effects . My perception was changing and I decided to lie down on the settee . Instantly the world changed , everything was loud and frightening . I remember trying to fixate on the tv , to try and hold onto something that I recognised and that was normal . I could n't keep a grip though and the world I fell into was one of pain , indescribable unceasing pain and noise . I was ripping apart at the seams of my very fabric of my being . I was in no world describable by human words or language . Only screams were heard and could be said.Imagine being in one of those bad dreams where you know that you need to wake up but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but there is no way . I 've used dmt in the past and the instant super intense trip that it gives you , is like the beginning but whereas dmt lasts minutes , this poison lasted and lasted . Being electrocuted with a million volts , being blinded and deafened by screaming noise . These would have been welcome relief , as they would have had a physical cause that could have been stopped . Where I was , there was nothing that could be done to help me.My wife was first alerted by a scream . It was a couple of minutes after having my hit . I screamed so loud , screaming I believe when my brain , realised there was no helping myself , no coming back from this . Twenty minutes she tried to wake me , to bring me into conciousness all the while I was trapped in this cruel world . I was fighting it though , I never gave up trying to wake . My senses were screwed but I could still hear the match of the day commentary and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , or whether I had truly crossed from this realm to another . Why could I hear match commentary when I was in hell . It made no sense . It was worse having the commentary than having silence . I 've come to understand it as different levels of a coma . Where I had to try and fight to break through to conciousness , travelling through each level as I got to it . First I had to recognise what I had to do to awaken to the next level . One world I remember the feeling of being curled into a ball , biting my knee through my jeans . Literally hoping that if I bit hard enough i 'd wake up . With the biting though I remember my teeth slipping off my jeans a moment too soon . Another world I was lay on the floor and my beloved beautiful wife was saying my name over and over . I remember shaking and screaming like I was trying to shatter into a million pieces . I remember the feeling of her wiping my brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move or talk . That 's how she remembers it too . Me fitting uncontrollably and then stopping dead . I wanted to drink . I desperately needed to drink . Water was the one thing I could think of and i was not going to stop . I somehow , god knows how managed to pick up the bowl she 'd been using to wipe my brow and drink some . After this my wife says I became more lucid got to my knees and started talking no language she has ever heard . I drank water like it was my first drink in a thousand years . I remember being on the settee and her saying to my mum , that I was having a fit . I realised I WAS having a fit and used this to break through to the next level . In my mind I was sat down in the brace position literally trying to turn inside out . I felt like I had somersaulted and the next thing I recall was at the side of my fish tank , one leg at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . Apparently I was sat down , I stood up , Threw myself into a forward flip and landed where I said . I honestly feel that the realisation that i was having a fit , was the key to escaping the nightmare . If i had n't  , If my beautiful wife had not said the word FIT then my mind would have been lost . That was the last of my total psychotic breakdowns . I managed to keep a grip of reality but it was still far from right . I was wanting to drink , and I picked up a bottle of coke and drunk all of it in one gulp . Shortly after I threw up all over the carpet and rug . I did n't care . It felt good . My wife says I improved a lot when I threw up . This is why I wanted to drink.I kept fixating on things like my wife 's ring , to see the inscription I could n't remember . The ambulance took fourty minutes from being rang . My mum rang it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time the medic 's arrived I was very confused but at least with it . I explained what I had taken and spent until four am in hospital . As time passed the poison wore off and I became normal again . My heart was racing that fast my wife thought it was going to stop when I was at my worst . Even in the ambulance my heart rate was 104 . Normally its less than 60bpm . I have elevated ck levels which are a sign of heart trauma . I 've been very lucky to survive this I feel . Its going to affect me forever . I 'm taking a six month break from any and all mind altering substances including my beloved weed . When I was lucid I went into the kitchen , threw all my weed into the bin . I 've pulled it out again mind you , but I feel that My mind and body needs time to recover and repair my perception of reality . In the past ive tried extasy , coke , lsd , mushrooms and dmt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you open your mind far enough , it will eventually fall out . Mine did . And I have the physical evidence to prove it . Tooth marks on my left knee , where I WAS biting that hard I punctured the skin . I must have done it in the time I was alone before the initial scream when my wife came running . Literally two minutes in and i 'd bitten myself and drew blood . On this stuff you are a danger to others and yourself . Please god warn everyone to stay away from this evil poison . i know i 'm an idiot for trying it , but that 's what we do . we try new things . if one person decides to stay away from these so called herbal legal highs , or research chems then my experience wont have been in vain . <p> Prime <p> When you do things right , people wont be sure you 've done anything at all. /I <p> ... I could still hear the match of the day commentary and it was frightening me ... Prime <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's some serious nasty shit there sounded like a *** trip gone bad .

I had about half a gram in a joint , Can I ask , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip , not a weed trip , but a real one ) ? That 's basically what it was , and you had a bad one . I 've seen people have *** trips for the first time and reacted very badly to it . The mind is more powerful than most people can imagine , and a real trip opens doors that would not normally be oped . Anyone can have a bad trip and if you have never experienced tripping a bad trip will be a really bad one ! ! The brain can not comprehend what 's happening to it as you 're removed from reality in every perceptual sense , mixing dreaming in to reality . Luckily due to my past I figured what it was the second I left my friends house with him to go to the shops and got to the top of his outdoor steps that lead down to the main road , I love heights but when tripping heights have a whole new perception and I realized I was coming up when I stood at the top of those steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one piece on trips so I was fine and just rode it out and enjoyed it .... it only lasted an hour or so , but tbh it was an un pure kind of trip and I 'd rather actually take magic mushrooms than this stuff . If you 've never had anything like this before I 'll warn you now you may have what 's known as a flash back ! When for what ever reason you will just start tripping again out of the blue ! usually lasts a few minutes , but it can come at any time .... If you do , what ever you do do n't panic ! ! Just know what it is in your head , relax , breath and it will end shortly .

On reading this I decide to tell the story from the beginning . <p> Back in the late 80s early 90s , a friend-of-a-friend of mine came back from the Sensi Seed Bank in Amsterdam with some seeds . <p> Most of the plants were males but 4 of them were girls 3 of the 4 were wankers and one was kind of OK . This plant was cloned and passed on to 3 or 4 different people who grew it alongside some Northern Lights and Silver Pearl plants in their well built grow rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been growing my own weed for about 25 years , 10 of them outside in the wild . <p> My best friend and I decided that we would build ourselves our own grow rooms but did n't  see the need for getting too technical so , we made them out of anything we could lay our hands on we called them " orange crates " coz that 's what they looked like . <p> As for lighting , we went on a commando raid to a local disused cement factory and helped ourselves to some Sodium and Metal Halide 400s . We made our own shades from some aluminium sheeting from a local scrap yard . <p> Now all we needed was some nice cuttings . I managed to get some N/L and S/P plants and also one of the Skunks . Most of the other growers concentrated on the N/L and S/P because they are good all rounders . <p> I think one of the Skunks went to Crewe and another to Cornwall . I quite liked the Skunk so I kept it going . Now over the next 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing do n't  know why it just did . It started to get really smelly I mean really stink . The smell would get everywhere and I was often creosoting the fence to try and mask the smell ( a little tip there for Cheese farmers , creosote or burnt toast ) . Cropping was a nightmare and I would n't even go out because people would often say " you stink " . <p> I was giving some of this weed to my close friends and they all loved it and , as the taste was changing it seemed the strength was too . This weed had become so strong and so smelly that it reminded me of something I had smelt before , but I could n't think what it was . Then one day the penny dropped . <p> When I was 17 or 18 and living at home with my parents , I would go out a lot with a friend who worked in a food essence factory . Some days I would see him and he would stink of all different kind of things : fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test tubes of concentrated liquids home and use them in my fishing bait ( the carp loved the vanilla ) . One day he put one under my nose and said " smell this one , its called blue cheese , and its a real minger " . <p> This was the smell I had been trying to remember . The weed smelt just like it and so she was born . I gave the weed the name " Cheese " . <p> The only cuttings I let out were to people who were incapable of doing their own cloning and only wanted a plant for their own garden in the summer months . <p> Another close friend of mine , known as " Of the Hill " , came to me one day and asked me if I would do him 21 cuttings as he was building a big lab for the Exodus people in Luton . I was a bit unsure of this as I did n't  know ay of these people but , I did it for him because he is a good egg and has dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , off he went with his cuttings and I did n't  here too much more about it , other than a good harvest festival was had . <p> " Of the Hill " arranged for a cutting to make its way to a coffee shop in Amsterdam in 2003 ( Home Grown Fantasy ) . It was cloned and put on the menu as Cheese and went on to claim 3rd place in the cannabis cup in 2004 . <p> I recently met an American at a Hawkwind gig in London who had heard of the Cheese in Washington . He had come to the UK to see Hawkwind and smoke Cheese . His face lit up when I pulled a big fat Cheese straw out of my pocket ! <p> Its kind of annoying really I wish I could have put a patent on the word " Cheese " in the context of marijuana but , its kind of difficult when things are illegal . <p> All over the place now I hear people calling all sorts of weed " Cheese " and I say to them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr Big Buddha ? I have plenty of respect for him , but the Cheese is not yours no matter what you call it and , as for crossing her ? She does need help over the years she has started to show signs of stress . <p> Growers will notice that some plants get brown spotty leaves during growing &amp; flowering that results I leaf drop . I do n't  know what the cause is , its not the soil , the water , the food , or the air quality ( possibly a virus of some kind ) , so I suppose a cross of some kind to introduce some new vigour to her would be a good thing so , like I said , respect to Big Buddha for trying . <p> So for nearly 14 years , the Cheese was living at only a couple of places but now it seems to be everywhere for people to enjoy . <p> I do n't  know what she has become some sort of mutant freak , but she sure hits the spot and everyone who smokes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the truth about the origin of Cheese . You can all rejoice that I kept her going for all these years and now you all know how it came about its name . <p> In the grand scheme of things its not very much , but I wanted to set the record straight . <p> Very interesting , thank you for sharing . I often wondered how any of the names came about cuz when i was young there was green , brown mexican , jamaican.tie weed , red bud , puma bud and Skunk that 's it . now there 's too many to count.I love it tho as I have been a huge cannabis fan since 14 ( young I know ) but grew up around a ton of bikers . <p> what a story to tell lol cheese is all that floats about round my area now , although its the equivilant to cheese slices rather than blue cheese , but i reckon my first ever grow was the real deal , iv never smelt or tasted anything like it since ! <p> So that basically confirms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bloke decided to rename . <p> hi grub yes most definetlyi had it . it could permeate brick walls . from a pkt of skunk#1 from sensi seeds in 92. you had to swim over and back in 92 as customs were shit hot lol.if you ordered by mail they were always crushed by customs ggrrr lol well mine were.so chip fat and a deep breath was the way to go.all the bestps i just chopped it and smoked it non the wiser as had some nl#5xhaze seeds to go in next the 93 cupwinner <h> The Following User Says Thank You to budalzir For This Useful Post : <p> exodus cheese is lovely but not so strong big buddha blue cheese is easier to grow and similar white cheese and psychosis are also improvements , stronger barney 's farm is crap swiss cheese is excellent Cheesus is very tasty they 're all prone to mould and mildew lots of buds smell like Cheese . it 's just a description of a particularly dank smell for example Killer Skunk is frequently mistaken for it round here none of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it early 1980 's in Nottingham , Bristol and Huddersfield ) which smelt like a raccoon that had been smeared with incense and left to rot in a warm cupboard and blew one 's noggin off still .

@@46022421 @6022421/ 10988 @qwx420988 <h> couple of RDWC questions <p> Hi all . I am in the process of designing my 2 pot rdwc system , which will be upgraded to 4 pot if succesfull . I have a couple of questions relating to the design , and if anyone can help out i 'd be very grateful . Now i sometimes over-think these things , but i have a question about the return pipes . Question 1 . is there any specific place i can place these return pipes , which may create some turbulence in the pots , which will prevent the roots from growin into the return pipes . Like could i create a swirlin motion inside the pots which would keep the roots in the pot instead of down the return pipes . I notice that most folks just place them in the centre of the box ? <p> question 2 . The feed tubes/ to the spray bars . I am lookin to put these in a square pattern around all 4 sides of the box , with a pipe into a tee fittin , then around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the next one . I presume that these are best enterin the pot so that there is the same lenth of pipe before the next tee , to keep pressure constant in the spray pipes . Like if the feed and exit pipes were at 90 dejrees to each other , then there would be more pressure in the " short pipe run " if you understand . Would i be reite thinkin it would be better if they were equal . I havny cut any holes in the boxes yet , so any advice is appreciated . <p> Also how do you size your nutrient chiller ? My boxes are 42 litre , which will probably have 30litres of nutes in it , and my res is 84 litre . I would rather buy the chiiller to suit the 4 pot set up , rather than have to buy another one later . <p> hi there mate , here 's a diagram of my system which was a 4 pot but i have no gone to a 2 pot as the yields are massive from 2 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubs to combat the suctions pulling the roots into the returns . I have found that it let 's them stay pretty much central . I would recommend a min of 32mm for the returns as it seems to create a good flow rate . if you want to create extra turbulance at 2 90 degree bends inside the res from the returns pointing at the surface and the flow will create flooms on the surface . G <h> The Following 2 Users Say Thank You to GUNIT For This Useful Post : <p> Or instead of pipes you can go with 18mm hose or something so you can move buckets where you want , why go with pipes =/ this rdwc in fact is much more difrent than mine lol , i have 18mm back in bottom , and 4mm pipe on the top brings water in . <p> hey mate when i was building my system i went with 7 65 ltr tubs 1 for res and was going to go with 42mm returns but was a little worried about the roots as was planning on vegging for 7-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the system about 2 weeks now and root growth is rapid to say the least so i think 32- 42mm would be minimum for a good veg to save problems later . I will be down sizeing my system to 4 or maybe even 2 tubs as growth is rapid i will be lucky to get a 5 wk veg let alone 7-8wk For mine i orig orderd a 300a chiller so it would n't have to work as hard as a 150a but i ended up with a 500a and it works perfect and my insulation on the tubs ai n't  great lol <p> Thanks for your advice , i appreciate it . Ive been speakin to Upton on another forum about this too , and will be puttin the return pipes at opposite sides of the totes , ( 32mm pipes ) , like you say Mr Unit . I 'm usin 200mm net pots , which will sit on top of a slab of celotes 50mm insulation I had some 40mm pipes and fittins , but put them back , cos i do n't  think i need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to use a slitely smaller pump , but a variable speed pump a jebao dc12000 has been recommended , and a hailea hc500 chiller . This is startin to be expensive , so it better be worth it I am likin the sound of the 90 bends towards the surface to create flooms . Mite try it out as it sounds like it will help . Am plannin an overflow back to the res too , in 22mm pipe , and will keep it near the top of the totes . I did think about keepin the overflow at at the water level , to balance out the levels in the pots , and make sure both totes were at the same level ? What do you think ? <p> And what nutes do you use in these systems . I been readin back and the lejend that is Heath Robinson used ionic ? What 's the crack , will these be ok ? I notice they are fairly cheap , which i like . I 've some cannazym and rhizotonic on order , and some canna coco a and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recirculatin system ? or would they <p> All i have to do now is order a chiller and a pump , and break out the hole saw . woop woop <p> i would keep the overflow slightly above your max level mate as you will find the majority of the roots sit close too the surface so they may grow into the pipe . I only use ionic myself mate , always have done and always will , the only other poduct i use is superthrive and even then i only use it during early veg to give the seedlings a kick up the arse . my pump is a hailea hx-8830 which is 3500 ltr/hr and it 's been more than enough for my 150litre 2 plant system . <p> Upton is a good friend of mine as we have been using this forum and others for years now so you 've been in good hands with my old friend . <p> I see you are planning on using spray bars , i designed the spray bar system many moons ago on breedbay and gave the idea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my original setup of just using at t-piece on the end of the feed pipe in each tub as it 's alot easier to setup and the end results have been pretty much the same with both systems . <p> here 's a pic or 2 of my system just to give you a few ideas of how i 've done it . <p> and this is the manifold i constructed to feed the plant tubs <p> i have a vid showing my flooming system but i 'll have to try dig it out after work , if you need any other info just ask buddy or pm me . G <p> Thanks mate , that is just what i needed to know . Here is a sketch of what i think i am doin . I have not shown the overflow , but will incorporate it . I hear what you are sayin about the spray bars too , but ive already the fittins boujht , so mite as well use them ( and ive only 3 tank connectors for the 22mm pipe ) 001Small1.JPG <p> Hey heizenberg listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and g is the triffid keeper I would n't go with the dc pump for your size system i would use the same pump as g have you read any of his diaries they are monsters ive never seen plants like his lol I 'm not to happy with the dc pump at min it does not seem to have the pressure of my 9000lpm hailea but is still doing what its supposed to it does run silent tho only a slight hum when on full power and my chiller deals with my temps easy and my system is 420 ltrs yours is not going to be half that so you would get away with a smaller one i only got the 500 because i bought a 300 and they were out of stock so they sent me a 500 for same price g has used this system for along time and worked out all the kinks so between him and upton you cant go wrong Good luck <p> your plan looks good mate the only issu i can see is your feed pipe as you are running the tubs in series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the nutrient solution reaches the rear tub . If was me i 'd run them in parallel by adding a T piece to the feed line near the pump so you can run a seperate feed to each tub which will keep the pressure up . G <p> So somethin like this , I 'm not sure that this is what you mean , but i get your idea that the pressure enterin the boxes should be equal So that the pressure would be equal when it enters both boxes ? I 'm doin the returns today , i will make templates first and go easy with the hole saw , cos i do n't  want to f*ck this up . <p> Chiller is ordered , no turnin back now , just a pump to order , still undecided which one . <p> Because i want to " future proof " the system , i am lookin at a 4000-6000 litre job . ( i remember readin that Hannibal said you need around 1000-1500 l/hr per tote ) and fittin an inline tap to reduce the pressure . the hailea HX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting excited about this now , ive always wanted to do RDWC , since i first saw Heath Robinsons modded wilma system , and i was startin to get bored of soil and coco , and havin to sneak around in the middle of the nite dumpin pot fulls all over the surroundin countryside . I also remember readin g g units epic lemon kush and delahaze diary all those years ago and commentin that i 'd never seen buds as big as that before . <p> It feels like it did when i first embarked on this growing journey , all those years ago , i just hope it works out ok . When i finally get this adventure started , i 'll post up a diary . <p> Thanks to you all for helping me out with this , i really appreciate it . <p> Went with the 6000 litre Hailea , HX 8860 which i actually got for a decent price 45 quid delivered . I will start constructing the pipes tonite , but just loookin at the speed fit fittings , they are a fair old size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i can also get some speedfit pipe inserts , which will hopefully help prevent leaks . These little dooh daahs fit inside the end of the pipe , effectively stiffening it where it goes into the fitting , helpin to secure a leak free joint ( it says here ) Or i mite just buy a heap of glue fittings and punt these offf to ebay . <p> last stupid q of the day , how do i join the 22mm pipe to the pump outlet.DO i need some sort of rubber adaptor or something . I think that 's it , cant think of any other questions just now , me brains frazzled enough as it is . <p> Cheers lads , the build is underway . I would n't have got this far without your help and encouragement . <p> I 've all the pipes pretty much made up and connected to the totes . with just the returns to sort out once i move it all into my tent . I will be usin one of the tent iintake socks to put the feed pipes thru , with the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to keep it nice and low .. I have some seeds soaking , and all bein well i should be ready to rock be the end of next week . <p> Hind sight is a fine thing , and if i was to do it again i would just use glue fittings on the spray bar , and probably used bigger totes . Would i be rite in thinkin that big totes would be easier to keep control of PH in , or is there any other advantaje in usin the larger ones ( maybe ive developed some tote box size envy ! ! ) 10985 @qwx420985

And is there anything i can do to fix the problem this late in the grow ? It 's a 10-12 week flowering strain so there 's probably less than 4 weeks left to get it under control . <p> This is happening on one plant ( the rear right one ) only and only at the top 5 " or so but it does seem to have slowed the growth of the rest of the plant aswell to a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures and text ) are merely hypothetical and should not be taken seriously .

I put in a thrermostatic heater last week whick keeps the temp minimum above 19C with extractor on 24/7 to keep RH at about 55/60 - it was way up before i done this .

RH is around 45% temps are 26 lights on and 20 off which is about perfect from what i 've read but there 's obviously something not quite right <p> I 'm pleased with this strain so far as there looking like really high yeilders ( supposed to be 750g/2m ) not to keen on the height of them though . Ca n't get the light any higher so if they grow anymore i 'm in trouble ... Judging from what i got on my last grow and how these look now i 'm guessing about 4-5 dry oz per plant living up to the hype so far . <p> I 'll go do some searching about this fox tail /last growth spurt thing now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tbh mate mine did the same thing and then filled out a touch , ur stressing over nowt mate , keep ur room exactly how it is , keep nutes andwater exactly the same and just enjoying watching it . they look nice well done mate <p> Mine did exactly the same thing when i grew the ultimate ... and from what i can see yours are in the exact same environment as mine were , right next to the air cooled light . The plant directly under the light had those symptoms and the other 2 did n't  . I 'm %100 sure it was the heat caused the buds to grow beyond a compact formation . I bet if u open the bud u theyr really stalky . If not its probs not the same issue but heat stress definatly stretches buds <h> The Following User Says Thank You to nige For This Useful Post : <p> Cheers for the reply 's I know i do n't have a light leak as i tested it when i first started the grow . As above i think it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just too tall . When you get close it looks like all the buds all over the plant has been heavily covered with sugar really sticky so hopefully it 'll be a nice smoke . <p> My other crop just finished drying today and i managed 35 oz from 8 plants That 's big bud feminised and the smoke seems SUPER strong ? I 've been smoking white rhino and blue cheese lately which i find quite strong yet the big bud blew me away . So much so that my friend actually whitied on it yesterday lol although it 's not as nice tasting as the other 2 it 's perfect as a bedtime knockout <p> i tried doing that variety and when i tried flowering , she kept growing and growing RLY tall and would not flower lol .

I hear people saying Canna is n't as good anymore in terms of the medium . I 've done loads of google searches which lead me to various forums where people are saying the opposite . Can anybody give me any ideas . <p> It is untested though as a new product .... If you want to use an established brand then Canna Pro+ has been the market leader for years and years ( but has gone downhill in quality recently imo ) . Plagron coco is superior and the bcuzz stuff is decent but they add too much N and other shit imo to the bcuzz stuff . <p> Google the vitalink coir is my recommendation - there nutes are high quality so I 'm presuming the coco is too . Big chunks for aeration sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vitalink stuff ) . <p> So do plagron make vitalink coco , and are they same people that do plagron batmix ? I was hoping that GREENS would have more than Canna coco and IWS coco as I have a massive order going on there ATM and ideally would of liked to get it all from one place . Does vitalink need pre treatment ? <p> you will have to look elsewhere than greens for the new vitalink coco or plagron stuff . <p> There are other sellers of these products in the UK that are as decent and reputable as greens though . I do n't think Plagron make the Vitalink stuff but who knows ? They are different companies tho totally ... Plagron is Dutch I believe and Vitalink are for sure a UK company . <p> its ok but canna pro+ is better imo . And so are most others ... its a bit compacted and still salty imo . <p> TBH I think I may just go with Canna pro+ . I used the canna aqua flores and vega last time , so I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked pon ebay at vitalink coco and all that came up was the nutes , not the medium and I was taken back by how many different coco nutes they have .

Maybe if I understand a bit more about these , I 'll use these with canna coir pro + <p> most deffo the canna range 100% ive had mate try the biobizz and the vitalink but they always seems to get defs using them and seem to have to do a plain water flush once a week .... but when switched to cannas its plain sailing ... think the canna is a pound or 2 more but worth it when using it with the canna range imho as always RESPECT <p> t b honest with you when a what time for me to buy a bunch of cocoa I did not feel like carrying a bunch of 50 liter bag .

I will say this , I will never go back to a traditional set up . This is the best grow I have ever done and I have been growing for awhile . I am also an owner of a Hydro Store in CA . So I have tested many products and many hood set ups . The set up is the cheaper then buying a conventional set up with hood and ballast and the long term savings is where it counts with bulb longevity and replacing the reflector for only 50 bones in two years and are in a new set up again . <p> I 'm running the gavita 600pro lights and so far so good .

The 4x8 footprint how far from your canopy were you to achieve that ? Do you expect at least 2 pounds out of the 1 light ? My local hydro shop has also started selling them in ducted Raptor hoods , do you think this would be beneficial ? What do you use for cooling ? Would a large window mount AC work for a home grow ? <p> I do n't  think the Raptor hood set up would be better . The Gavita Engineers I am sure found the best possible combo ....

Now I have NO fan on the hood of course ... that 4 " HO Can Fan has a 4X18 Charcoal Filter and a speed controller and is at about 80% all the time I turn it up a little or down a little if it is to cold outside and starts cooling the room .... My Second Fan is a 6 " can on a 6X24 Filter and that is on a Titan Mercury 4 .... Day Night Controller and it automatically adjusts the speed to keep the temp perfect ... to hot it speeds up to cold it cools down ...... <p> The Gavita produces very minimal heat .... remember the less medal the less radiant heat .... My Room with LIghts off is about 68-71 .... with lights on it sit around 73-79 .

I am growing now chiefly to make medicine for my wife to cure her cancer . I used to grow in a closet with florescent bulbs and a muffin fan and compared to today 's science , it was a joke even though I grew some really good stuff . Once I get her taken care of , I will light up and celebrate . Thirty years of drug testing is gone and I am one or two joints behind . <p> I am very interested in the Gavita 906050 Pro DE lights . Given the efficiency , there should not be a lot of heat , most of the energy going into light . However , I ca n't find good info about heat--or rather cooling . I see some cry-babies on Amazon whining about how hot these get . Obviously , they do n't seem to have any experience with the MH or HS lights and their vagaries are useless . I want to convert a large chest of drawers into a stealth cabinet and use this light to get the max lumens per ft2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a HPS or NH in a wooden cabinet that size and would rather be turning it into smoking kindling . <p> For those of you who have used this light , just how hot does it get ? I have be doing thought-experiments and thought-designs of building glass and metal box to enclose the light and running forced air . If there is one to buy that would fit the light , reflector , and ballast , I have not seen it . Maybe there is one for sale ? Where I live , one just does n't walk into the hydro store and inquire . <p> Another question is , how close can I place it to the tops/canopy ? <p> Also , I am big boy , so if I am on a fool 's errand , l can take it Possibly , I am asking to put too much light in too small a place . <p> Anyways , thanks for any assist on my query . May the pleasure of getting high and experiencing the awesome high that comes from just growing this weed be the only reason you have for growing . 10985 @qwx420985

@@46022435 @6022435/ <p> Now for the 1st time in 3 years i 'm about to start checking the PH of my waters and run off as well as my nutrient mix that are to go into the soil.I came across this on the Internet , So many people have copied and pasted it i 'm not sure who is the original writer is , But its a simple guide that I myself was able to follow and lead me into doing the checks that are essential for optimum health growth . <p> Potential Hydrogen Ions or pH shows the type of the soil that you have or amount of lime or calcium that the soil has . As a general rule , soils in moist climates tend to be acidic while those in drier areas tend to be more alkaline . When the measure of the soil is below 7.0 , then the soil is deemed as acidic , while if the pH measure of the soil is more than 7.0 , then the soil is alkaline in nature . All plants give themselves to different degrees of soil acidity and some plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the soil . Therefore its important that the soil have the correct pH balance to help plants grow effectively . If you have a county extension office nearby you can take a soil sample and they will give you the results of your soil . You can then take appropriate action . Alternatively you can buy a soil pH test kit and have the results instantly . They also sell soil pH meters that will give readings of your soils current conditions . This type of pH tester usually runs on batteries . <p> Its imperative to understand that soil is like a living organism . For healthy soil , it needs to be replenished on a continuous basis . If the soil is healthy , it gives natural protection to the plants that thrive on it as well as providing a security cover against the diseases , which may affect the plants . <p> How to measure the ph of your soil 's runoff <p> How to test the pH of your soil mix <p> Measuring the pH of soil is just as important as with hydro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pH to see if it is within the optimum range for growing robust healthy plants . Here I will try to explain my method of testing any soil / soil less mix , enabling me to spot any problems and correct them if necessary . <p> Firstly , wait till your soil has dried out and is due for its next watering schedule . Then take some plain water that you usually water your garden with , and adjust the pH to 7.0 . You must make sure that you know the exact pH of the water going into your soil , and the neutral 7.0 is best , but anywhere from 6.5 7.0 will suffice . <p> Then place your pot into a bowl of some sort to catch the runoff water , and then start to water your soil slowly ( with your pH- corrected plain water ) till the water starts to drip from the bottom . Its the first drops of water that will give you the best reading of your soil , so make sure to water slowly till you see the first droplets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water entering the bowl . Then perform the pH test on the runoff and compare it too your initial test . The results of the runoff test will likely be lower than your starting value of 7.0 . If this is the case , a small drop of 0.5 pH to 6.5 pH ( example ) would be ok and your soil needs no further alterations at the moment . But that 's not to say that it wont need any future tests at all , just not at this time . <p> Editors note : It may be beneficial to obtain an initial sample , as well as a full flush sample in seperate bowls . In addition , test several plants in the garden just to verify your results <p> What if the pH is off ? If your results prove to have dropped considerably , say to around 5.5 ( which can happen in late stages of flowering ) , you will need to add some lime into your soil to help buffer the pH back up again . <p> Remove the first inch or so of soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this task . Then sprinkle the lime into the pot , nice and evenly at a rate of 1 teaspoon ( 5 ml ) of lime per gallon of soil . Then replace the soil you removed earlier , and saturate the soil good to wash in the lime . <p> Do the same test next time your plants need watering just to check that everything is fine , if more lime needs to be added then just repeat the process again till you reach close to 6.5 7.0 with the runoff . <p> Ensuring that your pH is correct should be done throughout the life cycle ; this will help eliminate any nutrient lockout that may occur . I recommend doing this once a month just to keep the PH in check , and you should never have a problem with deficiencies caused by pH lockout . <p> How can I raise or lower the pH of my soil mix ? <p> Growing in soil and adjusting pH levels <p> A lot of gardeners have trouble with the pH of their soil . A high pH can lock out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiencies . The biggest mistake new growers make is to try and correct pH problems too quickly . The first step in determining if high pH is the real problem , is to pick up a good pH tester . Do n't be afraid to shell out the cash for a good one , it 's well worth it ! <p> Here are some recommendations : ( All sell for under $100.00 ) <p> 1 . Milwaukee makes two styles of hand-held pH meters . A small " pen " called the Sharp and the larger Smart Meter . Both are easy to use . The Sharp pens are splash-proof ( although not totally waterproof ) , and have a large easy to read display . They also have a detachable , replaceable probe . <p> 3 . Shindengen ISFET pH Meters are state-of-the-art pH pens and work with a totally different method of measurement . This pen uses a solid state Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor ( ISFET ) instead of the fragile glass electrodes used by traditional pH pens . They have replaceable tips that change from opaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is pH , and what do the terms acidic and alkaline mean ? The acidity or alkalinity of the soil is measured by pH ( potential Hydrogen ions ) . Basically it 's a measure of the amount of lime ( calcium ) contained in your soil , and the type of soil that you have . A soil with a pH lower than 7.0 is an acidic soil and one with a pH higher than 7.0 is considered to be alkaline . A pH of 7.0 is neutral . <p> Adjusting your soil pH : Once you have determined the pH of your soil with a good tester , you can amend the soil if needed to accommodate the plants in your garden using inexpensive materials commonly available at your local garden center . <p> Adjust soil pH slowly over several days time , and check pH often as you go . Radical changes in pH may cause osmotic shock damage to the roots . <p> Raising soil pH : ( to make it more alkaline ) It is generally easier to make soil mixes more alkaline than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dolomite lime , hardwood ash , bone meal , crushed marble , or crushed oyster shells will help to raise the soil pH . <p> by MisterIto In soil : add dolomite limestone to the soil ; use small amounts of hydrated lime . <p> Raising hydroponic pH : ( to make it more alkaline ) <p> In hydroponics : use potassium silicate , provides silicon at an effective doseage .

Then water the soil/lime mix and give it another stir <p> Best plan is to mix fine dolomite lime into your mix before planting . Fine Dolomite will help stabilize your pH ; however , if the ph becomes unstable or changes , you can then use Hydrated Dolomite Lime . Add some of the hydrated lime to luke warm water and give it a good stir then water your plants with it . Give the plants a good watering with this hydrated lime added and your PH should fall or rise back to 7 <p> Other Benefits of Dolomite Lime <p> Dolomite lime is also high in two secondary nutes that can often be overlooked by fertilizers ; dolomite is high in both ( Mg ) Magnesium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flushing to correct lockouts- Why and how to do it ! <p> This is a common question that comes up when troubleshooting , so I thought I 'd post up a little summin summin . <p> Why do you want to know your runoff pH ? Simple- it 's an indication of how your water , fertilizer , and grow medium are interacting chemically . <p> There are 3 measurements that are important to know when you are caring for plants growing in a soil or soilless medium . The first is the pH of your source water . Next is the pH of your nutrient solution after the fertilizers and supplements are added . Last is the pH of your soil . But that 's the hard one ! You ca n't just stick a pH meter in the dirt and get an accurate reading , and the cheap metal-probed meters that show this are usually not all that precise . <p> So how does one determine soil pH accurately ? With a runoff test ! First , measure the pH of your tap water and record it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.0 , exactly neutral . <p> Now place the pot over a clean rinsed container and pour enough water through the soil to start dripping out the bottom . Collect about 4 ounces of runoff water . Check to see if it is discolored as well . <p> Now , if you only have liquid indicator , which is just fine , pour this water into a clean small tube or the test vial that came with your pH testing kit.Add a few drops of indicator solution , shake , and read the color change . If you have a meter , simply stick the electrode in the water and read . <p> Let 's say that your runoff comes out at 6.5 . How did that happen ? The water passed through a more acidic matrix and dropped its pH . You can assume that your true soil pH is a couple tenths of a pH point lower than the runoff in this case- I 'd assume about a 6.2 . If it comes out HIGHER , just go in the opposite direction . If it came out 7.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from about 7.8 . <p> You want around 6.0-6.5 for a soilless mix , or 6.3-6.8 for soil . <p> Pics : 1- Propping up the plant over a container to catch runoff 2- POuring clean water through the soil 3- For liquid indicator , pour into clean vials 4- Check the pH against the color chart 5- Adjust the flush water if necessary <p> How to test the pH of your soil mix <p> Measuring the pH of soil is just as important as with hydro applications , but few people know how to test soil pH to see if it is within the optimum range for growing robust healthy plants .

I recommend doing this once a month just to keep the PH in check , and you should never have a problem with deficiencies caused by pH lockout . <p> just remember if you add lime to the soil to adjust it and the lime in it was still good you will possibly cause issues . if lime is still able to buffer it will rise on its own with just water as the more you pour in the medium . if it wo n't go back up and hold then its safe to add . when they make the new soil they do n't  just add any amount of lime to be in mid 6 to 7. its a calculation and adding more is messing with that and its cation exchanges ability .

I have only harvested once and cured the buds . After a few days in Jars my weed took on a smell I did n't like at all . I held out thinking something was going on and people were saying it was normal . After a few more days the good smell returned . <p> My guess would be it has something to do with the process of breaking further down the sugars and the chlorophyll . Though I could be dead wrong . <p> make sure they are dry when you put them in ive never had a musty smell <p> when i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type hay smell and once in the jars the smell returns in a week or two , do n't  jar them unless the stem snaps it shows you they are dry enough to jar , do n't  ever worry that they are to dry they soon rehydrate once in you jars , the moisture speads evenly though them once in the jars and do remeber to open your jars every day ( burping ) and turn the buds as well , if you do n't  burp you jars they can very easily get mold 10985 @qwx420985

They look healthy to me . I did air the room out a lot this week and the air from outside is a bit cool . I 'm going to let it stay warm and see if I notice anything . <p> From what I read it could be a few things , Root bound , cold air , PH balance . Hopefully it 's just the cool air . I did forget to check the PH balance on my last feeding too . Just going to keep the room warm and feed them with PH checked water . <h> The Following User Says Thank You to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured out my problem which is causing the stems to go red . I 've been using Dutch Master A + B Grow from vedge to flower and I did n't know there is Dutch Master A + B Flower which contains Nitrogen , Phosphorus and Potassium . <p> They have been in flower for 2 weeks living off A+B Grow for vedge state . This should be the cause then right ? <p> Mine are the same red stems , yer as above do n't  cut off anything , it nothing to worry about , I have perfect temps/humidity light off/on perfect ph/ec not root bound and they look great . I also feed a/b veg nutes 10-14 days into flower lowering it every 2 day and uping flower nutes at same time , I think its just a good sign that your going to have a bumper harvest , just go get a/b flower and let us all know how you get on . <p> I 'm such a stoner .. I 'm using the a/b Flower . I apparently used that for vedge ! I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot warmer now , it seems that there is some red gone in many stems just there are a few big fan leaves with red stems that seem to be turning yellow . I still never got batteries for my camera but as best that I could describe it is , Red Stem with big fan leaf that is turning yellow and seems to be droopy . <p> Could that be because I forgot to check my PH level on one feeding 3 days ago ? My PH level from the water faucet unchecked seems to be around 7.0 <p> I just fed them today with A+B flower at ec 1.0 with some silica and zone . I adjusted the PH level to around 6.0 . <p> So I should try lowering my nutes ? I just fed them this morning with 1.0 ec . That was a raise of 0.2 since my last feeding . Should I flush them ? Or should I just give them very low nutes in the next 3 days ? <p> i would carry on as you are feeding as you are 1,0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ def 's im using 2,5 ml of each per litre and the add 27 and silica both of these at 3/4 's ish dose for a ec of 1.5/1.7 in ro water in dwc and my plants look great . if you want a higher ec it best to move it up a bit at a time <p> when i change the ec i put it up at 1.0 at a time and it seems fine .2 of a ec is nothing to worry on for a riase 10985 @qwx420985

What will I do . Thanks for any help <p> If you 've seen pictures of mature cannabis plants taken with a macroscopic lens that 's zoomed-in very close , then youve undoubtedly noticed the many glistening translucent resin glands protruding from the buds , leaves , and just about everywhere else on the plant ( see " Stalking Trichomes " , CC #72 ) . Most marijuana growers and readers of pot magazines are quite familiar and some downright obsessed with these resinous outgrowths known as trichomes . You may have also read that the sticky coating of trichomes is home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you high and has all the medical benefits tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , cannabidiol ( CBD ) , and other cannabinoids . But have you ever wondered exactly what the trichomes do for the cannabis plant , or what biological purpose they serve ? <p> Evolution of Trichomes <p> In nature , only the strong survive , and it is hypothesized by biologists that trichomes evolved as a defense mechanism of the cannabis plant against a range of potential enemies ( 1 ) . Trichomes , from the Greek meaning growth of hair , act as an evolutionary shield , protecting the plant and its seeds from the dangers of its environment , allowing it to reproduce . These adhesive sprouts form a protective layer against offensive insects , preventing them from reaching the surface of the plant . The chemicals in the trichomes make cannabis less palatable to hungry animals and can inhibit the growth of some types of fungus . The resin also helps to insulate the plant from high wind and low humidity , and acts as a natural sun-screen in protecting against UV-B light rays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be man who has had the most influence on the plants development through many years of favoring strains that consistently produce more of these gooey resin heads . <p> Trichome Types <p> Trichomes grow in numerous shapes and sizes on many types of plants . The cannabis plant has developed three main types ( from NationMaster Encyclopedia ) : <p> Bulbous : This type is the smallest ( 15 to 30 micrometers ) . From one to four cells make up the foot and stalk , and one to four cells make up the head of the gland . Head cells secrete a resin , presumably cannabinoids , and related compounds that accumulate between the head cells and the cuticle . When the gland matures , a nipple-like protrusion may form on the membrane from the pressure of accumulating resin . The bulbous glands are found scattered about the surfaces of the aboveground plant parts . Pictured below . <p> Capitate-Sessile : The second type of gland is larger ( 25 to 100 micrometers ) and more numerous than the bulbous glands . They are called capitate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heads lie flush , appearing not to have a stalk and are called capitate sessile . They have a stalk that is one cell high , although it may not be visible beneath the globular head . The head is composed of usually eight , but up to 16 cells , that form a convex rosette . These cells secrete cannabinoids and related compounds that accumulate between the rosette and its outer membrane . This gives it a spherical shape . <p> Capitate-Stalked : Cannabinoids are most abundant in the capitate-stalked glands , which consists of a tier of secretory disc cells subtending a large non-cellular secretory cavity . During flowering , the capitate glands that appear on the newly formed plant parts take on a third form . Some of the glands are raised to a height of 150 to 500 micrometres when their stalks elongate . These capitate-stalked glands appear during flowering and form their densest cover on the female flower bracts specialized leaves that cover the seeds . They are also highly concentrated on the small leaves that accompany the flowers . The male flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less concentrated than on the female . ( 2 ) <p> Cannabinoids <p> Cannabinoids are a group of chemical compounds that occur naturally in the cannabis plant , first discovered in the 1940s . When consumed by humans , the chemicals bind to CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in the brain and body , causing euphoria and other effects . The broader definition includes three general types : phytocannabinoids , which occur uniquely in the cannabis plant ; endogenous cannabinoids , produced by the bodies of humans and other mammals , birds , fish , and reptiles ; and synthetic cannabinoids , which are related compounds produced in laboratories . Cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant include THC , CBD , cannabinol ( CBN ) , cannabichromene ( CBC ) , cannabigerol ( CBG ) , and tetrahydrocannabivarin ( THCV ) . <p> Inside the Trichome <p> THC and other cannabinoids are produced in only one place on the cannabis plant : inside the heads of the trichomes . How it happens : Organelles produced by the plant called Vacuoles which contain phenols , a chemical compound similar to alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organelle called plastids containing hydrocarbons called terpenes red , make their way up the trichome stalk green and combine inside the secretory cavity into a fibrous mat yellow . This concentrated mat is hit by UV-B light waves , causing the creation of cannabinoids . Since all of the psychoactive ingredients are produced inside the trichome , these tiny resin hairs have long been sought after by hash and oil makers and can be separated from the plant and harvested in a variety of ways ( 3 ) . <p> Potency and Tricomes <p> Many media outlets and politicians say the potency of todays pot has increased dramatically in the last 30 years , claiming it contains anywhere from 10%-40% THC . Most are dubious claims , as it is quite obvious that a sample of herbal plant material does not consist of nearly half THC , but there is still much debate on the issue of potency classification . One thing is for sure ; heavy trichome production does not necessarily mean higher potency , because the resins inside the trichome may or may not contain high levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage levels refer to the amount of THC in the oils produced inside the resin glands , but new studies show that cannabinoids other than THC also have distinctive effects on brain functions and cause correspondingly different effects on human cognition and psychiatric symptoms ( 4 ) . This makes gauging the potency or strength of cannabis plants very difficult , as different cannabinoid level combinations may induce different types of highs . <p> Dry Sift <p> There are many ways to separate the trichomes from the plant to make hash , oil and butters , or to smoke directly as dry-sifted kief ( see " How To Make Hash " , CC #69 ) . Fine mesh screens and products like BubbleBags assist in the extraction process . When it comes to dry-sifted trichomes , it is very difficult to completely separate the resin heads from the stalk and other waste product of the plant . <p> Click this bar to view the full image . <p> Click this bar to view the full image . <p> Amber Alert <p> So you have worked hard for 8 weeks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have invested time and dedication to get to this point . How can you tell when its time to harvest your gooey girls ? Well ' fire one up ' and let 's take a look at the best way to be sure you 're harvesting at peak potency . This article will help you understand what happens in the final weeks , so you can harvest for the specific type of high you prefer . <p> The harvest window is one aspect of the craft which , unfortunately , gets overlooked . As well , many growers simply do n't  have the patience to wait-out the last few days to insure max THC content . <p> Some strains are better harvested before their peak THC production and some are better harvested after their peak THC production . <p> Robert Clark wrote about trichomes and what they tell us in his book " Marijuana Botany " ; <p> " The elevated resin heads appear clear , since fresh resin is still being secreted , often being produced in the cellular head of the trichome . At this time THC acid production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the molecules are rapidly converted to THC acids , THC acid synthesis has not been active long enough for a high level of CBN acid to build up from the degradation of THC acid by light and heat . Terpene production is also nearing a peak and the floral clusters are beautifully aromatic . Many cultivators prefer to pick some of their strains during this stage in order to produce marijuana with a clear , cerebral , psychoactive effect It is believed that , in peak floral clusters , the low levels of CBD and CBN allow the high level of THC to act without their sedative effects . " <p> What the hell does this mean ? <p> When growing Indica hybrids , unless you want to end up on the couch , its best to harvest when the trichome heads are fully formed but before they start to cloud over and turn amber . This could take as little as five days or as long as two weeks , depending on the maturation time of the specific strain . If you allow an Indica to go too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , going too long is not a real problem for most people . <p> I like to study close-up photos taken with a high resolution digital camera ; however an inexpensive hand-held microscope works wonders . It almost looks like you are in an alien world when looking at resonated buds using fifty-times-power . <p> With the Sativa-dominant hybrids , you want to make sure that all the trichome heads are fully formed and also about thirty percent amber . Letting a plant mature beyond this point will risk flavor and the finished smoke may be harsh with very little " high " . There are exceptions ; Haze has three different harvest windows , all being very late into flower . It is every growers job to learn what he or his patients prefer in the terms of " high " . <p> This article will not address yields : if you are at the third stage of floral maturity with fully-formed trichomes , we can assume most strains have packed on all their final weight . <p> Use the guidelines spelled out below to help gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trichomes . <p> 1 . Fully-formed but still clear will provide a cleaner ' up ' high with less sedative effect ; this is the best window for heavy Indicas . <p> 2 . Fully-formed and turning slightly cloudy or milky ; this is probably the best time to pick most hybrids available today . <p> 3 . Fully formed completely cloudy or milky with at least 30% of the heads turning amber ; this is usually best window for the late maturing Sativas such as Haze . This is also a good window when using the plant primarily for Hash production . <p> Take for instance the Jacks Cleaner , harvested at 56 days ; all trichomes are still visibly clear with very few turning cloudy . At this point it has a very ' up ' high and an ' in-the-head ' buzz . I get some good visuals and the lemon flavor is sour and a tad tart . <p> The same plant , left just one more week at 63 days flower ; the trichomes have turned milky white and a good portion , about 30-50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taken at this time , the smoke is heavy and thick , the lemon zing has been replaced with a musty sweet lemon smell that reminds me of Lemon Heads candy . The high is now all body high and very much a sedative . We would smoke this only as our nighttime medication . It is almost an example of a plant taken too late ; however , we do this because of the medicinal properties she takes-on at this late stage . <p> Another example is Killer Queen . At 49 days flower , she has a candy-like smell and taste with that same ' up ' high . If you were to harvest her at 60 days flower , she becomes ' Super ' Killer Queen , with a more skunk-like smell and a thicker trance-like high . <p> The mistake to avoid is harvesting before the trichomes are fully formed ; most growers who use this method harvest when the majority of the heads are cloudy . Harvesting before this window will produce bud that is less potent , containing less essential oils and trepans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or green taste , even if it is dried and cured correctly . <p> Another good method would be harvesting some of the more mature buds , usually being the upper or main colas . This will allow more light to shine down on the lower portion of the plant , not only will the buds mature further but they will also pack on some extra size . <p> If you have a nice digital camera with a macro feature , try taking some close-up photos and use a photo editing program such as Adobe . This will allow you to zoom in close so you can see what the naked eye can not see . If this is not an option , Radio Shack and other electronic stores sell battery-powered hand-held microscopes for about $15 . <p> Take advantage of this information , it will help maximize the results of your favorite strain , or help you determine the harvest window of something new . <p> ?

I would imagine all the ratings with the fan and filter will be all good as you have decent gear and not cheap shit .

I 'll check the ducting is n't loose . I use a SMS temp fan controller so when lights are off an oil rad kicks in the fan slows which might not give a massive negative pressure . The filter was originally for a ruck 6inch high powered fan , but that was too powerfull so got some advice from grow shop an bought the lower powered ruck 6inch . So ca n't see that being the problem . <p> that 's the prob i 'll advice from grow shop if the fan was 150lL and filter was same then lowering the fan to a 150 a is your prob its not rated for said filter its not pulling anough air or pushing dipending on way you have it set ? <p> Just smelt the end of the extraction ducting an there 's no smell but the garage I vent the outtake smells a bit .

@@46022468 @6022468/ <p> At some stage all indoor growers will suffer some sort of bug infestation , hopefully this quick guide will keep you bug-free and your plants healthy . <p> Most bugs that infect Cannabis plants can not fly . They are accidentally introduced to the grow room by us , the growers ... but with a few simple steps and a bit of common sense we can reduce the risk of infestation . <p> Pots ... <p> Most of us keep our pots outside in a shed/greenhouse . Bugs will crawl all over the pots outside so when we bring the pots in to use we unwittingly bring the bugs indoors . Pots should be thoroughly cleaned and sterilized before bringing them indoors ... A kettle of boiling water and/or a diluted bleach spray will kill off any bugs . <p> Compost ... <p> As with the pots , bags of compost stored outdoors will attract bugs . Try to make sure opened bags are kept as sealed as possible . Keeping bags of compost in a black rubbish bag will also help to keep the bugs off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that regularly go outside can bring mites and other bugs into the house . Keeping all pets well away from your grow room will lessen the risk of infestation . <p> Other plants ... <p> Bringing in any plants that have been outside will almost certainly bring bugs into the home . Even flowers that the wife has picked and put in vases is a big risk . If a plant has been growing outside leave it there , or risk all sorts of bugs ! <p> Us .... <p> By far the main reason we get mites , thrips and other bugs in the grow room is due to us , the grower . Bugs and bug larvae stick to our hands , clothes and shoes ... before we know it we 've introduced them to the grow room without even realising it . If you 've been out in the garden enjoying the sunshine make sure you wash your hands and preferably change clothes before going anywhere near your plants . <p> Other bits and bobs ... <p> With a bit of common sense it 's possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bits and bobs you use in the grow room , like watering cans , secatuers , bean-sticks etc are cleaned thoroughly before use . <p> It 's impossible to guarantee a bug-free room , and at some stage most of us will suffer the problem , but using the advice above will greatly reduce the chances of an infestation . Also , between grows it 's always a good idea to empty your grow room and give it a good clean out with anti-bac wipes or a diluted bleach spray . The same applies to all of your fans and equipment . <p> Keep things clean and sterile and bugs should not be a problem ! <p> Happy growing ! : ) <p> WeeDroid <p> 24-09-11 , 06:15 AM <p> I would like to add something to this if I may . <p> Healthy cannabis will resist pests and such much more readily than a sick plant . While this seems very simple to understand , many folks fail on following through on this . The best example is air exchange and movement . You simply have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove excessive moisture . Pests and pathogens thrive in environments that are of poor quality for cannabis . <p> In addition , air likes to stratify by temperature and this further exasperates the stale air situation . Mixing the air is a key element to fighting pests as well . Likewise , compost teas need to be stirred as well as aerated . For a small space ( say a mother room ) a small clip on fan is plenty good for mixing . <p> Preventative measures like adding sticky bug traps before each grow season helps enormously . Clean and disinfect your grow area and equipment . Always keep spills and plant debris cleaned up . Bugs like finding weak areas of plants ( or perhaps dead leaf ) to strike and establish a home base . Then they spread to the rest of the plant . Keeping an eye out for early infestations is helpful as well . <p> WeeDroid <p> 24-09-11 , 06:25 AM <p> Keeping with the whole gas exchange and aerobic states modality , keeping your compost too wet ( over watering ) creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say .

However ... and I have only receintly learned this and it may be wrong so I am interested in passer bys opinions too .... but .... the clear trichs are mostly compostited by THCA the inactive acid form of THC , light is processed through the head of the trichrom and the resulting magnifacation creates heat which causes the thca to catylist convert to thc the active part we all want . when this catylist recaction occurs it turns milky white to block uvb radiation .

Either due to age of plant at harvest or by light exposure . <p> Now for harvesting , THC ' degrades ' to CBD/CBN . But that is n't a degradation per se , but a maturation surely . ? ? Pure THC is a bit of a mind f*ck long term and yet people still get hung up on it degrading . But is this a bit of a non-starter or what ? Are people too concerned with THC at the expense of CB 's . <p> And then for harvested buds , what does that degrade to ? And just how long does it take for that THC to degrade into an unusable/crappy grade product ? I doubt it being hours , or even days/weeks , more like months surely ? And what does that harvested and cured thc degrade into ? Surely just to CBD/CBN ? <p> Does anyone know , rather than just re-quote , how quickly it degrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thing . <p> I mean , just because for example , Georges thinks that clear/slightly cloudy , fully mushroom topped trichs are at peak point of thc production and signal of harvest time , and has published that , does n't mean he 's got it right does it . Especially as research indicates that a balance of CBD/THC is needed for the better smokes and reduced mental health risks ! <p> I have never worried about thc degredation ... my weed does n't tend to be round for long enough . i agree with you that i think people can be a bit THC obsessed rather than looking at the CB 's . I 've smoked some very high THC strains but have found the experience leaving something to be desired , CBD rich strains i find make me more ' stoned ' and i like being stoned .

Two of the main psychoactive compounds are THC ( Tetrahydrocannabinol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that a higher percentage of THC gives a more cerebral , lighter high whilst a higher CBD content gives a heady , lethargic body stone . During the flowering stage plants dramatically increase their THC content , towards the end of this phase the THC begins to degrade and CBD content increases . Trichomes look like tiny hairs and form on the swelling buds . They are difficult to see with the naked eye so use a decent magnifying glass . Trichomes produce resin glands which in turn produce resin , which is rich in THC . Initially trichomes are clear ; they then turn a milky colour with THC production . As the THC degrades into CBD the trichomes darken and turn a golden brown colour . The time to harvest your plants will depend on the desired effect . For maximum THC content , and consequently a lighter and more energetic high , harvest your plants when about 50% of trichomes have turned from clear to a milky colour . If you wait until the trichomes are mostly darkened to amber/brown you will get a heavier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the longer you leave it the heavier stone you 'll get . <p> but i thought THC degradation only takes place when the trics on the live plant turn amber not during drying or curing but i 'm probably wrong <p> Curing let 's the plants continue to dry slowly . The first week of curing affects potency in that it removes moisture within the bud evenly , so that virtually all the THC is psychoactive . Rough handling and friction from fondling hands will bruise and knock off resin glands . Even with proper drying and curing , brutal handling of harvested marijuana will diminish THC content . Does curing affect potency ? The very short answer is YES . It does affect potency in a very positive manner . Curing cannabis after harvesting for few days to several months will improve the potency , as well as the taste and texture of the buds . <h> The Following 2 Users Say Thank You to GBK For This Useful Post : <p> Initially trichomes are clear ; they then turn a milky colour with THC production .

A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If it was CBD that caused couchlock then I know a lot of people that would want 100% CBD but no they wo n't a high THC ? ? I think THC oxidization does help with couchlock but I do n't think it 's changed to CBD . If THC degrading into CBD then as on projectcbd.com it would lessen the effects of the THC and you would n't get as high letting a plant get amber . I know 9.77% CBD Harlequin I get less " high " and can do more . <p> Cannabidiol CBD is a compound in Cannabis that has medical effects but does not make people feel " stoned " and actually counters some of the effects of THC . After decades in which only high-THC Cannabis was available , CBD-rich strains are now being grown by and for medical users . The reduced psychoactivity of CBD-rich Cannabis may make it an appealing treatment option for patients seeking anti-inflammatory , anti-pain , anti-anxiety and/or anti-spasm effects without disconcerting euphoria or lethargy . Scientific and clinical studies indicate that CBD could be effective in easing symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes , alcoholism , PTSD , epilepsy , antibiotic-resistant infections and neurological disorders .

I also have family members with Seizure 's and THC can be very bad for people with Seizure 's . CBD has shown to lessen or stop Seizure 's . <p> Great thread , very interesting . I wish I was half as knowledgable about MJ as some of you are . I do try and learn as much about it as possible it is my hobby after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for x amount of amber trichs before we harvest , thinking we 're waiting for the THC to degrade into CBD . What is actually happening is more of the trichs are fully developing thc . Perhaps the trichs are still producing THC when they are milky so by the time a percentage is amber even more THC has been produced along side the new CBD rather than chopping at all milky when they could have perhaps produced a bit more THC ? Does that make sense ? I 'm pretty baked <p> To understand why the different strains may have different effects and help different types of medical condition its good to know the basic chemistry of cannabis.This is something most will already know , But if you do n't  here you go ! ! ! <p> The active ingredients of cannabis consists of : <p> * THC ( Tetrahydrocannabinol ) gets a user high , a larger THC content will produce a stronger high . Without THC you do n't  get high . * CBD ( Cannabidiol ) increases some of the effects of THC and decreases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low levels of CBD contribute to a strong , clear headed , more energetic high . * Cannabis that has a high level of both THC and CBD will produce a strong head-stone that feels almost dreamlike . Cannabis that has low levels of THC and high levels of CBD produces more of a buzz or stoned feeling . The mind feels dull and the body feels tired . * CBN ( Cannabinol ) is produced as THC ages and breaks down , this process is known as oxidization . High levels of CBN tend to make the user feel messed up rather than high . * CBN levels can be kept to a minimum by storing cannabis products in a dark , cool , airtight environment . Marijuana should be dry prior to storage , and may have to be dried again after being stored somewhere that is humid . * THCV ( Tetrahydrocannabivarin ) is found primarily in strains of African and Asian cannabis . THCV increases the speed and intensity of THC effects , but also causes the high to end sooner . Weed that smells strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of THCV. * CBC ( Cannabichromene ) is probably not psychoactive in pure form but is thought to interact with THC to enhance the high . * CBL ( Cannabicyclol ) is a degradative product like CBN . Light converts CBC to CBL . <p> As a grower , you can experiment with different marijuana strains to produce the various qualities you seek . A medical user looking for something with sleep inducing properties might want to produce a crop that has high levels of CBD . Another user looking for a more energetic stone will want to grow a strain that has high levels of THC and low levels of CBD . <p> In general , Cannabis sativa has lower levels of CBD and higher levels of THC . Cannabis indica has higher amounts of CBD and lower amounts of THC than sativa . So for example if you are looking for the pain reliving marijuana strain the Indicas are best known to do just that . <p> I really want a 99% CBD plant , I hope it will help with my asthma and I could take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have family members with Seizure 's and THC can be very bad for people with Seizure 's . CBD has shown to lessen or stop Seizure 's . <p> I 'm with you on that mate . I do n't like feeling out of control of my body or that something is making me feel different or weird . I want to relieve myself of any personal problems I may have and just feel happy and well in general without feeling like I am on medication . 10985 @qwx420985

Leaves dying and falling off bottom of plant <p> Hi there I have made a cupboard in my house in to a little grow room , the room is 600mm squared approx the plants have been growing to well germinated them on new years day and they were ready to pot about 3 days later and have been growing really well ever since , till now all the leaves on the bottom are wilting first then drying out and falling there are a few healthy leaves just falling off as well . Where the leaves are dying I am pulling them off and there are new leaves growing in there place . The plants are now approx from 60cm to 90cm tall and smell lovely , have been using baby bio when watering and watering every day like i said no probs till up till now . They have been potted for around 9 weeks now so is it time for them to flower can not see any signs of them doing this or do i need to change the light cycle for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to loose the crop after all this work .... Can add pics if needed but pretty straight forward now i am thinking about it wondering if doing something wrong for the flowering part ..... <p> lol your plants are 1m tall and still in veg There gon na be some beasts , you wan na hope there indica dominant or there gon na end up thru the roof ! ! <p> Flip the light to 12/12 to induce flowering , bearing in mind there gon na at least double in size when they stretchin flower ... <p> Also at that age ( 9wks ? ) they should be showing pre-flowers ... ? You had a good check around the highest nodes for pistils or dreaded balls <p> Hope this helps a bit <p> What size pots are they in aswell ? <p> No turn left unstoned ..

As well as being especially lightweight for portability , the handle on top of the machine aids transportation , whilst the fitted anti-vibration feet are perfect for optimum stability . This feature is specially designed for caravanning and camping , but also excels when used to power lighting or when using power tools . Equipped with an easy accessible on/off switch giving total control , even when starting the engine with the pull cord . The large tank gives almost 6 hours of operation on a full tank , but when refuelling is required , it is made easy with the mixing cap provided , which minimises on spillage .

You can buy the kits on ebay to convert them and its DIY and takes an hour tops ........... Just make sure the generator is compatible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A 10 KVA genset will use , what , maybe 2.5 litres per hour ? Even using red diesel ( if you can get it ) that 's about 2.00 for about 8 KWH , or 25p per KWH . That 's more than I pay for mains electricity . <p> How much does a unit of electricity cost you ? <p> At the moment , I think that running a generator will always be more expensive than mains , and that 's not counting the setup costs , which will be significant . A ( new ) 10 KVA set is likely to cost at least 4,500 , and very probably more . <h> The Following User Says Thank You to Anonymiss For This Useful Post : <p> Down in South Dorset where the cow shit lies thick , walkin along wiv my hand on my dick ... <p> Posts <p> 1,896 <p> Thanks <p> 2,376 <p> Thanked 1,658 Times in 974 Posts <p> i 'm not sure wot i pay .. maybe 15p kwh ...... but ..... it would mean that could quite happily run 10x600w without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... and u could grow 10 huge treessss ahhhhh <p> generator ok if out in the sticks but for a house grow no way , i 'm running a pre pay meter and got 2 tents on the go running 2 600w and a 400w hps plus all the bits and bobs fans , pumps , wilma 's plus my normal house hold stuff like tv , sky box , fridge and all the other things you run ia a normal house and it costs me 6 per day . <p> Down in South Dorset where the cow shit lies thick , walkin along wiv my hand on my dick ... <p> Posts <p> 1,896 <p> Thanks <p> 2,376 <p> Thanked 1,658 Times in 974 Posts <p> yea ... except there are a lot more hassle , as u would have to have the fuel delivered once per month etc .. where i live is pretty rural tho , so it would n't look to outa place with many properties having fuels delivered around : lpg and oil run central heating and desiel for agricultural use ..... what just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious wattage without the risk of the electric company alerting the boys in blue .. lol .. was just running around in my mind .. 24000w in my garage .. haha it would be like a ready brek garage ! ! i cud do a 10 plant scrog that would cover the entire double garage ! ! .. i could sleep on top of the scrog at lights off ... a bed of huge colas ..

My first tought was water deficency , I was watering every 3 days , 1.5 liters total for 5 plants . Does that sound normal for watering ? <p> The lower leaves defo look like n def , and lower leaf issues usually indicate a micro def which n falls into to . <p> The saggy upper leaves would say that the roots are over watered at the moment , usually underwater starts at the bottom ... or that they are root bound . They have been in there 3 weeks and they are not the largest pots .. . What size are they ? <p> I would recommend transplanting to 9L or 11L pots , this will cure possible root bound , plus they need bigger pots anyways . In addition this will cure any def issue or ec issue , and will with hold the need to feed for about 3-4 weeks . <p> When you water , let the soil dry out before watering again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots 2-3 inches in the ones they are in now and if it feels dry ( not rock dry ) then its time for water ...

Like I had mentioned man , watering in excess is just as bad if not worse then not enough water . <p> Once they are in their big pots let some water drain through the drainage holes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your finger in . Over watering is the most common mistake beginners make . heade that warning bro . <p> Repot , use your finger to tell when it 's ready for more water , and do n't worry about feeding the plant for about 3-4 weeks . Chances are after 3 weeks they are root bound ... When you take the root ball out look at the roots and if they are long and winding near the bottom that 's your problem . They are choaking themselves possibly ... <p> Take a look and good luck <p> And I hate to contradict you Rizzah , but he wo n't and should n't need to feed for atleast 3-4 weeks as the soil will have everything you need in it for that time . <p> They are in 5 liter pots , I will take your advice asap and go for larger pots .

If so it 's common for these ' first leaves ' to turn yellow ( and fall off ) , so do n't worry too much mate . <p> As the guys have said , repot into bigger pots , water when the soil is dry - ( 90% of the weight of a potted plant is water , so if you are struggling to find the ideal time to water wait for the pot to become light and easily lifted before watering ) . It 's better to under-water than over-water ... under-watered plants tell you that they 're thirsty by wilting slightly , over-watered plants can get root rot and diseases and the first you 'll know about this is when they die , seemingly inexplicably . Repotting with good ( nutrient rich ) compost should cure any deficiencies . <p> Grub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also seen on 2nd and 3th but not as much . I never put too much water but I think the drainage holes are too tiny and they kept the roots drowned between watering cycle . Nothing even came out leaking untill I started watering more recently . I definitly need to repot . Spacewise I will have problems so I am thinking of doubling the pot size only vertically . <p> I have another question , can anybody tell from the picture , when is a good time to switch to 12/12 ? I think a better question could be : what is the height/pot ratio of a plant this type to switch to flowering ? <h> Alright <p> Whatever u do do n't  panic , its nothing to really worry about , Its just the way it is , The plant is stripping the lower leafs of food to continue new growth , that 's all.I do n't  know the levels at what u r feeding them but most people take this as a sign to start feeding or to increase it a margin , giving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have a very healthy looking plant , I do n't  think ur over watering , just water every few days , if they become dehydrated u 'll know because everything will of flopped down , bad dehydration can cause leaf damage but this will rectify it self.U 'll figure out how often to water all by urself , its trial and error.I guaranty u 'll figure it out your self I would n't worry to much about repotting , 5 liters of soil is good , I usually just use 6 liters , Finished plants are about maybe a meter tall , I 've personally had no problems , But go with 10 if u want I judge when to flower by giving my plants a minimum of 4 weeks veg , I want to see my top leafs with 9 fingers or there abouts , if leafs on the very top have the same number of fingers as the node bellow or the node below that it means the plant is mature , but u can put them into flower before that if u want and it sholdnt do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on 12/12 your plants WILL double if not triple in size , U have to work out how big u can let your plant be a maximum size.Put your light up as high as it will go , measure about 18 inches below that , that 's as high as u can let them grow.Divide the remain hight by 2 if its Indica or by 3 if its sativa.This should be the max u have ur plant at when u go12/12 <p> Hope this helps , Happy Growing <p> Last edited by Iloveswissroll ; 10-03-09 at 05:27 PM . <p> Life is a lot like **30;1975;TOOLONG up .............. mmmm ......... swissroll 10985 @qwx420985

Green House Seed Co. catalog <p> Close sources say Arjan bred the SSH ( nl x haze x skunk ) in the Sensi Seed breeding rooms ( Cannabis Castle ) with royally bred Sensi strains . It 's basically the same exact thing as Jack Herer , but with one difference . Arjan had some reputed misunderstandings with Sensi Seeds , and took the strain with him , accidentally leaving behind his notes ( woops ! ) . The key difference is that Neville donated his special pure isolated " Haze " strain to the SuperSilverHaze which made it slightly better than Sensi 's version .

Ananda <p> ( To breed SSH you need to start with a ) NL5 Male . Haze female . The main trait(s) you are trying to obtain from the Northern Lights #5 is the short height and , if possible , the trichome gland production . The only characteristics you seek from the Haze are the high and flavour . Once you have a stable version of those two , cross a NL#5 . Haze male with a Super Skunk female , thus making it " Super " . The main reason Greenhouse Seed Co. created SSH was because a little while back quite a few people were upset with the consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed it with a Super Skunk to give it more stability and up the ante on potency . Plus , I 'm sure they needed something " new " to enter in the Cup . The difference between Jack Herer and Super Silver Haze cannabis seeds is the NL#5 is the male in the original cross of SSH , while Haze is the male in Jack 's original cross . From what I can recall reading Jack has a tendency to show a bit of favoritism towards it 's tall , lanky Haze father . The SSH leans more towards an Indica growth pattern due to the NL#5 daddy . ?

It is specifically designed to speed up and enhance the ripening process , while increasing the content in active principles of medicinal , aromatic and culinary plants . This type of formulation is referred to , in the greenhouse industry , as a forcing solution . Ripen is a mix of refined mineral salts and buffers , formulated by our laboratories with the greatest precision . Indeed , at this stage , accuracy is of the utmost importance : the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fragile and the assimilation process is greatly reduced when compared with the vegetative phase . <p> Ripen acts at different levels : It gives the plant a strong signal that it is coming to the end of its life . The plant reacts by speeding the ripening process , in a last effort to spread its genes . It forces the plant to reinforce its defences and thus increase its active principles . It brings to the plants all the mineral salts they need , in a form easy to assimilate . In case of a previous accumulation of nitrate or microelements , it helps metabolise these residues , which will improve the taste of the crop . <p> This nutrient has many properties : Outdoors , it enables you to quickly harvest a crop , before it is spoiled by a cold and humid weather . Indoors , it helps you harmonise the end of the cycle by speeding up the ripening of the slowest plants . In case of a severe infestation of fungi or insects , it allows you to accelerate the natural cycle and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases the active principle in medicinal plants . When you are growing a plant for its medicinal properties , this is the nutrient of choice to boost the concentration in the final product . <p> Application : <p> The last 10 days of flowering , dilute Ripen in water with adjusted pH ( between 5,5 and 6,5 ) <p> In Hydroponics : 4-5 ml/L - EC = 1,8 - 2,2 <p> In Soil : same concentration , every second watering <p> Ripen is an acid , it will lower the pH of your solution . Pour it in the water before adjusting your pH level <p> How to use Ripen ? Use Ripen to accelerate the maturing process of your plants , especially in times of trouble like cold weather , insect or disease attacks , and to increase their content in active principles . Follow the instructions on the labels and don ? t hesitate to contact us directly when needed . Application charts and nutrition programs , in soil and in hydro , are available . <p> When to use Ripen ? Use Ripen during the last 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the advantages to use Ripen ? Ripen allows to save a crop in case of sickness or cold late autumn , while increasing the content of active principles in your plant . <p> Where will I see the results ? Very quickly you will see your plant react . Its leaves will tend to become yellow and fruits and flowers will increase in size and weight . <p> Why use Ripen ? Ripen is an economical nutrient , concentrated , efficient and easy to use . In soil and in hydroponics . <p> LONG ... ******** <p> .. this is the stuff guys ! ! ! <p> what a difference it has made to my bigbud in only 7 days ! it took a few days to do anything , just Ripen in water , around 35ml to 10tres ( weaker than directed ) , ph 'd to 5.5-6.0 , a couple days passed without any drama , then the fan leaves start to pale , day 4 autumn colours from the smaller leaves before yellowing , day 5 i 'm noticing more trichs , day 6 and its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling ? , today at day 7 of Ripen its like flowering has commenced all over again ! the buds , not only festoomed with white snow , are swelling all over the plant- popcorn is growing , filling up the bare stems between the buds , now 80% orange hairs . the trichs stretching and curling , fighting for space are visibly to the naked eye white like snow , not icy or clear like glass . <p> i 'm hugely surprised at the effect Ripen is having on my plant , its making a poor result into something much better .. i have never grown such frosty shit- really ! this shit looks like its frozen . the plant is putting on weight faster than she has done at any point in the grow- amazing . i wonder how long i can keep her going on Ripen lol ! ! <p> i 'll contiune to update my later findings with this bottle of magic stuff ! <p> Goldmember : A shmoke und a pancake .

This makes it easy to control temperature in certain situations , keeps things bit quieter and also much cleaner a pest friendly place to work . <p> excellent looking job i have a 20ft shipping container in my yard down the back was thinking of doing this on half of it for a little grow last year but never got round to it ... the container is there years so not out of place cheers man ur grows are amazing cheers from ireland 10985 @qwx420985

Plants go through a seedling stage which can be about two to three weeks before they are even sexually mature enough to begin flowering . This is one of the advantages of clones , is that they have the sexual maturity of their mother , or father , plants .

Others have commented out loud that they think someone 's smoking the stuff . <p> It 's very easy to get pseudo-sciency , ( " i KNOW that what I 'm describing is MEDICAL FACT because i can FEEL it ) but I 'm convinced my weed-smelliness has today reached an all time high , coinciding with a period where I 'm fasting intermittently ( for diet reasons ) . And its not that my sense of smell has got better , because right now , dieting as i am and not smoking pot , i 'm chaining cigarettes like a frigging steam train . <p> Before I spoke to anyone about this , I though it was only me who could detect the weed smell , ( I assumed it was like the subtle , sophisticated scents you catch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dead animals and eggs in the sun ) . But apparently not . <p> I only first realised it when a stoner-looking guy at my Krav Magra group last year ( during a different quit-period ) said to his partner " someone quit weed recently " .

Also wet the pits of your t-shirt to reduce the funky skunky .

All are looking pretty bushy and spread out at the moment . Had a few problems with one of the C99 's who I overfed slightly and left repotting for way too long . Now is bouncing back fantastically though . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull around 2.5kg dry from a total of five plants . So this year am aiming higher for that sweet sweet 365 day smoke . Hopefully should start to cut some of the plants around the end of august until early october . <p> Living in the beautiful Balearics where the sun shines forever and the trees grow mighty . <p> Update time ! Not a great deal to report to be honest . All plants are growing beautifully and lapping up all the goodness from the sun . Temps here have dropped off a little bit so its a touch cooler and alot less humid , very welcomed as we had a rather intense heatwave throughout June . <p> I am now watering each plant , minus the church , 8 litres of water , daily . Theese girls are thirstier than a scouse lass in shagaluf . Everyday I give the little pots a lift to get a good guage on how much they need a water and come evening/watering time their pots are light and easily liftable . <p> Been slowing up on the feeding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day as they 're not looking like they 're showing any signs of problems or defs . Although I give them a couple drops of supervit in each 8ltr water container every day , seems like they love it . <p> Today gave them a full feed . 15ml of Hesi powerzyme in each 8ltrs of water , 20ml of NPK per 8ltr and the supervit . <p> The uploader here went all strange , only able to upload one photo . <p> Just showing the stem on the biggest G13 <p> One of the C99 <p> All are showing pistels and have been for around 2-3 weeks now . Nothing out of the ordinary , was the same last year , had me thinking they were flowering waaaaay before they actually where . <p> Gave the girls a feed yesterday , they 're now entering flowering so switched up the neuts from veg to flowering . All plants are still looking lovely , healthy and green . Pests are to a minimum to none . Always on the lookout for caterpillars though , fucking evil cunts . <p> Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the litter . Has n't grown out as much as the others , slightly gutted as it was my top grower last year . But still should pull a decent weight off it regardless . <p> Gave them all some extra supercropping to keep them as short and spread out as possible . The biggest G13 is looking pretty insane now . Big bushy bush bush . <p> Will upload some photos later in the week and give another update for those inclined . <p> i agree those fucking caterpillars will wreck ur whole grow if u do n't  stay on top them .. they ruined my season in 2014 and cut my yeild by more then half of what i should have gotten . the church will really start to get big once she switches to flower mode , or at least mine did . i have 4 plants that are showing preflowers right now which is earlier then before on a couple of these strains i have ran before .. i have given the ones that are flowering a dose of bud blood , gon na see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looking good tho right now .. cant wait to see those buds start filling in <p> The church is starting to strech now that its entering flower but no where near what it was like last year . It was one of the last to pop out , actually came out quite late but just never really sprang up like the others have . I think the super topping and cropping i did might have stressed it too much and it missed out on crucial growing time . Regardless Its not too much of a problem . Should still get some hench nugs from it as I did last year . <p> Caterpillers are cunts and as are my dogs . Do n't actually know what 's worse . Fortunatly the grow being quite isolated from nearby fields and the like limits how much they show up , which is great . When I was doing it in the wild couple years back they were a real pain .

The one on the left in the bigger pot is huge . The canopy is at least a metre and a half across . Definately growing these again <p> The other C99 . Just moved her to a new spot , she was kinda cramped up against the g13 's and all in all each planted a bit of space to let more light in . <p> Still not alot going on , babies keep on growing and growing . They seem to be tricking me into thinking they 're gon na bust into flower but then they 're all like " nah i 'm cool vegging in this beautiful sun for a little while longer . soz m8 " <p> Gave them a week of just water last week to give them somewhat of a flush just because why the fuck not .

Was super bushy and dense . <p> G13 , and the two C99s <p> The C99 's are still throwing out pistels quite a bit and looking like they really want to start flowering but hav n't really noticed much change since last update .

Weekly water changes should be a minimum 25% , as your filter is new up to 50% some weeks would be good .

The gravel may also start to take on algae , again the small plecs will keep the whole tank cleaner . They are cheap fish , be careful as some get big . have a google to see what ones stay smallish , ebay sellers have some very pretty ones but postage is normally quite expensive . They are really cool to watch as well . They do n't  normally swim about the tank , there are many youtube vids . Also a couple of tropical snails will move around the tank eating algae .

When cleaning the sponges or any other media you are not trying to get it shiny clean , you want to gently remove the built up grime , so no roughly squeezing or scrubbing . i find it best to fill a large bowl/tub with tank water ( best time to to this is when doing a water change ) and gently agitate the foam/media . <p> And bullshit pal you do n't need to wait 6 weeks for your water to balance I do n't know where they 've had that from <p> Sent from my SM-G925F using Tapatalk <p> Lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank before adding fish .

It appears to be a superb solution to my leaking smell issue . I thought I nailed it by swapping the Rhino Hobby filter for a Rhino Pro filter . But , after a few days I was still getting a whiff on the air outside to my disappointment . So , I am now about to experiment with this device . It will be a few months before I put an Ona block in the unit as im only just germinating my next Autoflower . For anyone interested I will update as I go . I did try replacing and inspecting my existing ducting but no holes or tears were present and my Black Orchid hood is the nuts so I doubt the smell is getting in through that . My only concern with this setup is how often will I be replacing the Ona block at 10 a time . Does anybody have experience with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the gel . And ideally someone who owns one of these pass through inline filters pictured above . Obviously I will only drop Ona blocks into the filter when my Autoflower is stinking up the place . Any opinions and input here would be appreciated . here 's a side view to give you a better idea of what this is IMG3458.JPG <p> High humidity allows for smell leaks through filters . Get the humidity in check and a good carbon filter and you have no use for the Ona block thing . A small ozone generator inside the ducting would be a better long term solution if you ca n't keep the humidity in check <p> Still seems strange needing extra equipment to stop the smell . Your Rhino Pro should get the job done 99% . I tested mine by having a joint in the same room . After a few minutes their was no smell in the exterior room . 10985 @qwx420985
