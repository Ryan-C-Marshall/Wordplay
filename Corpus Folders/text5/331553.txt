I guarantee when you walk in the door with this gift EVERYONE is going to be hoping they are on your holiday list this year . <p> In this holiday packaging project I combined one of our cake stands with two round boxes . I wanted to create an " elegant rustic " look so the burlap pattern on these boxes worked perfectly for me .

You can simply a knot with the ribbon or create a fabulous bow . I also tied a piece of twine to the smaller box as a decorative detail . c I wanted to create a natural woodland theme to my packaging so I added a bird with a clip to the top of my " cake " . d The next layer down , I added a floral element on the left side . e The next layer down I added a small grouping of silver balls and burlap " leaves " on the right side to balance the floral element above.Here 's another look at my gift packaging .

I added metallic gold and distressed white paint to the favour pictured above to match a boho inspired styled wedding . <p> Mini mason jars filled with succulents were included in the sweet table set up and on the guest table featured above . The gold painted mini mason jars not only compliments the gold cutlery and vintage china but they also add another personal DIY detail to the wedding . <p> Here 's the steps for making these succulent mason jar favours yourself : <p> Step 1 . It will take a couple of light coats of spray paint to cover the mini jars . Start by turning the jars up side down and paint the bottom first . Once dry , turn the jars right side up and spray again . <p> Note : If you are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add an extra coat of paint to some areas to make sure the container is completely covered in gold . If you are going to add chalk paint you do n't have to worry if there are a few areas that are not completely covered in gold . <p> Step 2 . Once the gold paint is completely dry you can add a thin coat of chalk paint using a soft dry paint brush . You want some of the gold paint to show through so you do n't want to paint more than one coat of chalk paint . <p> Step 3 . Once the chalk paint is dry it 's time to do a little sanding using a soft sand paper block . You just want to remove some of the chalk paint to reveal the gold paint below so do n't sand too much . The raised lettering on the mason jar is one area that you want to sand so the words will stand out . <p> Note : If you sand off too much of the gold finish it 's easy to fix by just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dry brush . <p> Step 4 . Before you prepare the jars for the succulent add your ribbon . It 's easier to do it now especially if you are using custom ribbon or tying a bow . <p> Step 5 . Mist the succulents well with water before planting . Add some small stones to the bottom of each jar for drainage followed by a small scoop of indoor potting soil . Move the soil around in each jar to create a space for a little succulent . <p> Step 6 . Place one succulent in each jar and , if necessary , add a little extra soil to fill . <p> If you make these favours a few days or weeks before the wedding , remember to water them . It might be a good idea to keep them in a humid area until your wedding day . <p> We love to see your completed projects .

@@44713192 @4713192/ <h> Friday , 25 May 2012 <h> tissue paper flower pom-pom tutorial and a give away <p> Was n't that a party last night ? We had another Creative Event in the Toronto store last night and from the feedback and emails that I have received , I think that everyone had a good time ! I was so proud to see everyone to go home with their completed projects - a fun resin flower ring and a beautiful tissue paper flower pom-pom . <p> As promised , here is a little tutorial that I created for making the tissue paper flower pom-poms . We are planning to make kits that you can buy complete with 8 sheets of coloured tissue paper , twist ties and instructions . They will be in the stores soon - I 'll let you know when they land ! <p> To start you will need tissue paper in solid colours of your choice , twist ties or floral wire , scissors and monofilament or ribbon ( to hang ) . <p> To create a large flower pom-pom use 8 sheets of 20 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stack eight sheets of tissue paper together . On the shortest side , start making accordian folds about 1 1/2 " for the large pom-pom and just a little more than 1 " for the medium pom-pom . You want to crease each fold as you go . When all of the tissue has been accordian folded , fold the tissue in half and crease again . <p> Step 2 . If you are using twist ties you will need to join two together to make one long twist tie . <p> Step 3 . Fold the twist tie in half and slip it over the centre of the folded tissue . Twist ( as shown above ) . <p> Step 4 . Now take the two ends of the twist tie and twist again to form a loop . This loop will come in handy later when it is time to hang the pom-poms . <p> Step 5 . Using scissors , trim the ends of the tissue into rounded or pointy shapes . You may want to cut a few layers at a time because the tissue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look perfect ... once you open the layers it will look great . <p> Step 6 . Separate the layers gently by pulling away from the centre one layer at a time . You do n't want to tear the tissue so take your time doing this . <p> Step 7 . After separating one half of one side , do the same on the other half of the first side . <p> Step 8 . Flip the pom-pom over and repeat steps 6 &amp; 7 on the other side . <p> Step 9 . And now you are ready to hang ! Use monofilament ( fancy name for fishing line ) or ribbon and attach to the twist tie loop that we created . <p> Here 's a couple of tips if you are making a lot of these for a wedding , party or special event . <p> ( a ) Make all of your tissue paper flower pom-poms ahead of time but only until Step 5 . Plan extra time to complete the majority of the pom-poms where you are having the party . The pom-poms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get damaged easily if they are piled on top of each other or stored in boxes . I 'd suggest making a few of them before the event so you know how to make them and that way you will have a couple of examples to show whoever is helping you to complete the final steps . <p> ( b ) I like to mix the large and medium sized flower pom-poms together with paper lanterns . Whether you are making everything in one colour , two colours or lots of colours , the varying sizes look great together . <p> Here 's some great examples of these tissue paper flower pom-poms that I have pinned to my pinterest boards . <p> Would you like to make one of these tissue paper pom-poms yourself ?

Or do you wait to do it all together after you have finished shopping ? Personally , I have always loved the gift wrapping part of the holidays the best and try to get the majority of it done early so that the presents are part of the holiday decor at our house . <p> I organize all of my packaging supplies in one place , pull out the bags of gifts I 've been hiding in my closet ( hopefully my kids are not reading this ! ) and then I make a pot of tea and turn up the music . This year I am going to be making a number of tissue paper bag toppers - pom poms and tassels .

You should have 3 " of uncut tissue in the centre of each sheet and fringes on either side . Using one sheet of tissue at a time , roll the tissue as shown above . 4 . Tightly twist the rolled middle section of each tassel as shown above . Untangle and fluff out your fringes so the tassels hang nicely.5 . Fold the tassel in half and twist to create a loop for hanging . Add a small drop of glue at the bottom of the loop to hold in place . <p> 6 .

I added metallic gold and distressed white paint to the favour pictured above to match a boho inspired styled wedding . <p> Mini mason jars filled with succulents were included in the sweet table set up and on the guest table featured above . The gold painted mini mason jars not only compliments the gold cutlery and vintage china but they also add another personal DIY detail to the wedding . <p> Here 's the steps for making these succulent mason jar favours yourself : <p> Step 1 . It will take a couple of light coats of spray paint to cover the mini jars . Start by turning the jars up side down and paint the bottom first . Once dry , turn the jars right side up and spray again . <p> Note : If you are going to leave the mason jars gold , you may need to add an extra coat of paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in gold . If you are going to add chalk paint you do n't have to worry if there are a few areas that are not completely covered in gold . <p> Step 2 . Once the gold paint is completely dry you can add a thin coat of chalk paint using a soft dry paint brush . You want some of the gold paint to show through so you do n't want to paint more than one coat of chalk paint . <p> Step 3 . Once the chalk paint is dry it 's time to do a little sanding using a soft sand paper block . You just want to remove some of the chalk paint to reveal the gold paint below so do n't sand too much . The raised lettering on the mason jar is one area that you want to sand so the words will stand out . <p> Note : If you sand off too much of the gold finish it 's easy to fix by just adding a little more chalk paint to the area using a dry brush . <p> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add your ribbon . It 's easier to do it now especially if you are using custom ribbon or tying a bow . <p> Step 5 . Mist the succulents well with water before planting . Add some small stones to the bottom of each jar for drainage followed by a small scoop of indoor potting soil . Move the soil around in each jar to create a space for a little succulent . <p> Step 6 . Place one succulent in each jar and , if necessary , add a little extra soil to fill . <p> If you make these favours a few days or weeks before the wedding , remember to water them . It might be a good idea to keep them in a humid area until your wedding day . <p> We love to see your completed projects .

Looking for some inspiration ? Would you like to include some easy diy projects to make the party a little more personal ? How about some party printables that you can download for free ? If you 've answered yes to any or all of these questions keep reading ! <p> For the next few blog posts I 'm going to share my ideas for hosting an anniversary party . I designed a number of printables for my party that you are welcome to use and personalize for your own party . <p> Inspired by my 2016 Kate Spade daytimer , the colour palette is black &amp; white with gold accents . Since the summer months are the most popular time of year to get married , I decided to plan the summer anniversary party at the cottage . Succulents , moss and natural wood elements added a rustic vibe to the contemporary the black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the sweet table . ( yum ! ) <p> Who does n't love a sweet table ? For this anniversary party I wanted to have a variety of different baked goods and a small cake . So I set up a small table and used wood market trays to organize the sweet treats . <p> All of our sweets were created especially for us by Bake Sale . They were amazing to work with and all of the baked goods looked ( and tasted ) great . I gave the Bake Sale team my ideas about the party decor , my printables and what kinds of baked goods I wanted and left the rest up to them . I was so excited to see all of the baked goods come together the day of the set up . <p> Lorrie 's tip : Save time and a lot of work by ordering baked goods for the party instead of making them yourself . Use the time you saved baking on making chalkboard signs and decor elements for the sweet table . <p> I really wanted a mini naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand that I made . The cake is sitting on a cake pad - not directly on the birch slab . Bake Sale added the mini faux succulents and agold " x " and " o " cake topper . <p> The cake is the focal point of the table so I used a variety of things to give it height . I started at the bottom by using two small , deep wood market trays to hold up one extra large shallow wood market tray that was lined with moss . Black and black &amp; white striped wrapping papers were used to create book jackets for old books that I then stacked in the middle of the tray . The birch cake stand was placed on top of the stack of books . <p> The art in the white frames are part of my party printables . The Mr. and Mrs. silhouettes can easily be personalized with your names before or after printing . I spray painted a metal " &amp; " in gold to match the other gold elements on the table . <p> Bake Sale created three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glass containers were placed on a long wood market tray lined with moss . The Mr. and Mrs. silhouettes from my printables were the inspiration for two of the cookies . I did n't want numbers on the third cookie , so it features the saying from my graphics ( minus the kissing Mr. &amp; Mrs. ) . <p> Lorrie 's tip : You do n't have to put all of the baked goods on the sweet table when you are setting up . For example , if you have 45 cookies just put out 15 to 20 cookies and keep refilling the containers so the table presentation looks full for most of the evening . This is a great idea especially if you are serving food outside . <p> Bake Sale created cake pops with polka dots to co-ordinate with my printables . I cut up our birch paper straws and used them to cover the cake pop sticks before placing them in the deep wood market tray filled with floral foam and moss . These birch straws have a two little hearts in the paper and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I also added chocolate bars to the sweet table . I wrapped regular size chocolate bars in gold metallic tissue paper before adding the wrappers from my party printables . <p> This large chalkboard sign was an easy diy project . The frame was found at a second hand store and painted white . I purchased a wood panel to fit the frame opening and painted it with chalkboard paint . You can enlarge the saying from my party printables to fit any size of chalkboard . I prefer using chalk markers instead of chalk on these kinds of signs so that my artwork does not rub off easily . You can find my tutorial for writing on chalkboards like a chalk artist here . <p> I used succulents and moss to create all of my floral arrangements for the party . Mason jars were spray painted with gold and black paint . I added Mr. and Mrs. forks and gold cake toppers into some of the floral arrangements as decorative elements . <p> The cottage ceiling above the sweet table was too high to hang paper lanterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arranged them underneath the table . Everything was placed far enough under the table that no one was stepping on them .

I used Krylon 's 18 kt gold plate spray paint on glass and metal elements for the party . Gold glitter tape was added to paper bows to give them a little extra sparkle . I thought about spray painting the imprinted Mr. and Mrs. forks that I used in this floral arrangement gold but I held off so that they could be re-used after the party . <p> You can make your own wood cake stand using a birch slab , a small wood bowl and a couple of screws .

@@44713221 @4713221/ <h> Tuesday , 28 August 2012 <p> Burlap is a wonderful fabric that can be dressed up or dressed down ... just like your favourite pair of jeans . I see burlap being used everywhere from home decor to wedding and party decorations in magazines , stores and of course , on Pinterest boards . <p> This a little project that I came up with to decorate my new home . I simply added burlap to assorted sizes of clear vases to create beautiful centre pieces . <p> Here 's my quick tips on how to do this yourself : <p> There are lots of different colours of burlap to use ... I like the look of the natural burlap for fall . I cut the burlap so that it will fit around the vase with a 1 " overlap at the back . If the burlap is taller than the height of your vase you can easily cut the burlap to fit . If the burlap is not as wide as the height of a taller vase then position the burlap on the vase so that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or both ) . <p> Use an elastic band to keep the burlap in place . Hint : place the elastic band in the area that you will want to add the ribbon accent ! <p> Note : I use marbles inside my vases so that I can arrange my flowers . You can see the coloured marbles peeking through the burlap because I shoot this photo with the sunlight in the background . <p> The last thing that I did was to add a simple ribbon detail . I love the eco organic cotton ribbons that we have available in the stores and online right now because they are so easy to work with . I used this pink double striped ribbon because it reminds me of vintage ticking fabric and it looks great with the burlap . A simple knot and a quick decorative edge to the ribbon and we are ready to add our flowers . <p> This is how I displayed one of my burlap vases . I wanted to create a centre piece to use on the kitchen counter . I added a stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I placed the vase of flowers on top of the books and beside the vase I added an old weathered bird garden statue . <p> I think this arrangement would be lovely at a fall wedding or party . If you want to do a similar look to this centre piece for a wedding or large party with lots of tables , you can usually find lots of inexpensive old books at second hand stores and ( library ) book sales . Instead of trying to find lots of old serving trays you could use our disposable wood serving trays ... just add paint or stain to match your decor . Then add a table number sign beside the vase ( where I have the bird ) and you have a simple diy table centre piece that is both beautiful and practical . <p> Friday night : Cookie cutter sandwiches and chips made a great late in the day snack while the we hung around the pool with friends after work . <p> Saturday : The kids had a mid morning snack with mini pancake muffins I purchased at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh fruit to make these as yummy to look at as they were to eat . <p> Saturday : Chicken sliders with pretzels for lunch . Got ta love mini sliders ... they are so easy to store in the freezer and when you present them in these wood serving boats they make last minute entertaining a breeze . <p> I loved how natural the serving boats look and although they are disposable , I was easily able to wipe them out and reuse them if they were originally used to contain food items like chips and candies that were not messy . <p> The wood serving boats looked fabulous with our mason jars ( available in stores only ) , daisy mason jar lids and paper straws . Adults seem to like using the mini mason jar glasses just as much as the kids . <p> Just in case you are wondering how I made the cookie cutter sandwiches ... here 's my tricks and tips ... <p> I used a star cookie cutter but you can use any shape you want . Just keep in mind the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my food first . Any veggies to be used as garnishes on the bamboo skewers are washed and set off to the side in small bowls . I usually cut all of the sandwich elements ( bread , cheese , etc ) separately so I do n't waste any food . ( Who am I kidding ? The kids and I eat all of the food scraps while we are preparing these ! ! ) Assemble each sandwich as you wish using the cut out shapes . <p> One tip that I do have is that many cold meats do n't cut well unless the meat is thick ... so I will cut the cold meats in between two slices of bread as shown in photo " two " above . Keep in mind that you do n't have to use the cookie cutter for every layer of your sandwich . Bacon and a little bit of lettuce would look great sticking out of a " turkey , cheese , bacon , tomato and lettuce sandwich " ... Yum ! ! <p> Another tip : If you are using spreadable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the cookie cutter bread shapes instead of making the sandwich and trying to cut it out like I did with the cold meats . It will save you time cleaning the cookie cutters in between each cut . <p> To make the veggie garnishes on the bamboo skewers I try to arrange the veggies so that the veggies stay in place on the skewers . You can see that I " tied " a piece of carrot ( I used a veggie peeler to create the long thin pieces of carrot ) between the cucumber and grape tomato . The cucumber slice kept the carrot from falling down . <p> To make the bamboo skewers stand up straight on a cookie cutter sandwich , you need to make sure that the sandwich is thick or the stick will fall over from the weight of the veggies . I usually make my cookie cutter sandwiches triple deckers . <h> Tuesday , 14 August 2012 <p> Our cotton canvas and burlap bags are a natural choice if you are looking for a cloth bag to package your products or use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I love that you can embellish these bags so easily and in so many ways . Depending on the look you are after , it is possible to sew , paint or stamp on these bags . You can even add iron on transfers ! <p> Keep in mind that iron on transfers or stamp designs with lots of detail will work best on the canvas bags . The burlap bags have a very open weave and work best with designs that are bold and solid and they will give you a worn or aged look similar to the type on the linen pillow in my first picture . <p> You can use stamps on the canvas bags and our canvas ribbons ( as seen above ) using permanent inks and clear stamps . I prefer the clear stamps so that you can see where you are stamping the image . There is an assortment of clear stamps , acrylic blocks for clear stamps and permanent inks in the Creative Studio at the Toronto store . <h> Saturday , 11 August 2012 <p> In my last post I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was helping with . My friends took part in Niagara-on-the-Lake 's Diner en Blanc . <p> Never heard of " Diner en Blanc " before ... do n't worry , neither did I until I started working on the project . Diner en Blanc started in Paris France over 20 years ago and you can learn more about the event here . Basically , it is a flash mob " dinner " and everyone is dressed in white and the tables are decorated in white . <p> We have so many different whites and I decided to combine them all from pure white to antique white . My secret for mixing different whites is to add lots of different textures when selecting materials . I used a vintage Paris theme featuring vintage textbook papers and bird motifs . <p> one . Here 's the wine charms that I showed you in my last post . Wine is a very important part of Diner en Blanc ! <p> two . We used our white trees as centrepieces and decorated them with birdcage favors ( spray painted antique white with tea lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed on old book pages . <p> three . Napkins are an important part of the Diner en Blanc tradition and we added an iron on transfer to ours ( featuring the text from a vintage postcard from Paris ) before we folded them and wrapped them up with handmade paper and ribbon napkin rings . These will be placed on each plate with the silverware as shown . <p> five . A nine foot table runner was easy to make using white burlap and assorted ribbons . I machine stitched all of the ribbons to the burlap including the diamond wrap . We weaved a couple of strands of lights through the burlap so that the table runner will light up during the evening . <p> There are a few other projects that we created as well and I look forward to sharing pictures of the final set up when I receive them !

Because I had to use the white resin flowers on all of the charms I added the guest 's first initial on the other side of the bottle caps using our Sticker You custom labels . <p> These were a very simple project and took us no time to put together . I punched a hole in each bottle cap* so that I could add a jump ring for the ribbon . I tied the ribbon to the jump ring with a knot and made sure that there was enough ribbon to tie onto the wine glass stem . Then we glued the small resin flowers to the back of the bottle caps using E-6000 glue* . <p> Once the resin flowers were dry we turned the bottle caps over and added the initial stickers that I created using our Sticker You sticker sheets .

We then added a thin coat of Inkssentials Diamond Glaze* to give the shiny resin like finish . It took about 6 hours for the diamond glaze to dry . <p> Tip 1 : If you are going to use the diamond glaze on the sticker it is important to print the sticker on a laser printer . If you use an inkjet printer the ink on the sticker will run when you add the diamond glaze . If you do not have access to a laser printer , then omit the diamond glaze step . <p> Tip 2 : You do not want to fill the bottle cap with too much diamond glaze because it will take all day to dry and you may find that the diamond glaze will leak where you punched the hole for the jump ring . <p> I designed and helped to create a number of other projects for this white themed dinner party and I will tell you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bottle caps , E-6000 glue , Inkssentials diamond glaze and 1 " circle paper punch are only available in limited quantities at the Toronto store . <h> Friday , 3 August 2012 <p> My daughters have always told me that " everything tastes better on a stick " .

I also thought that it would be easier to set the cookies down to dry if they were not completely covered in chocolate ( see photo below ) . You could cover the whole cookie if you want or use a different colour of candy wafer to tie into your party colour theme . <p> Hopefully , you will agree with me that " Oreo cookies taste better on a stick " ! ?

Here I cut the striped bag header in half , punched a hole and used twine to attach it to a clear loot bag containing a mason jar drinking glass filled with candy eggs and topped off with a small toy . Mason jars , daisy lids and paper straws are available in all of our stores . Organic cotton ribbon was used to close the top of the bag . I could easily stamp party guest 's names onto the cotton ribbon if I wanted these to do double duty as place cards . <p> Here 's another favor idea using a clear candy bag and the dot bag header . This time I filled the candy bag with a small jar of chocolate dip and a granny smith apple . Our 4oz quilted crystal jars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags ... fill these jars with homemade sauces , jams or body scrubs for unique party favors . <p> These clear candy bags do not have to be used for just candies or food products . Here you can see that I packaged a number of craft materials in this bag . These bags and headers would be great for packaging customer orders if you have a small business doing home parties . There is space on the " thank you " side of the header to personalize the header with a handwritten note . <p> I hope that you will check out our clear candy bags the next time you are looking for interesting packaging supplies .

I am one of those people that will buy beautifully labelled and packaged whatever ( even if it costs a little bit more ) just because I just love the look of the packaging . <p> I thought that I 'd share with you some of the packaging ideas that I came up with using some our gift card holders . Gift cards and gifts of money are wonderful ( and practical ) gifts and although throwing cash or a gift card into an envelope with a card will be appreciated , I think that these gift card holders show that you really put some extra thought ( and love ) into your gifts . <p> 1 . I had Father 's day in mind when I decorated this gift card holder with a satin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white picture of my Dad . I added a magnet to the back of the paper clip so that it could be reused on a fridge door . The kraft paper bag makes a great pocket for a tiny note card . <p> 2 . I used another bottle cap and a ( happy ) sticker that I created using the Sticker You custom label sheets to decorate a tin gift card holder . These tin gift card holders are one of my all time favourite gift card holders . Like a pair of jeans ... you can dress these little tins up or down ! <p> 3 . I showed you how to make these paper pops in a tutorial last Christmas . I made this one using another picture of my Dad and I on the bottle cap but I could easily recreate this same project using an engagement picture for a wedding gift or maybe an old kindergarten picture of a young adult who is now graduating from high school ( college or university ) . A larger paper pop is the perfect size on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . I 'm still finding lots of new ways to incorporate our resin flowers into my projects . I glued this small resin flower onto a large paper clip and used it to hold tags that I antiqued with distress inks to a ribbon . This gift card holder contains a magnet so I was able to add a ribbon of my choice to this card holder . <p> These are just a few of the many packaging projects that I will be showing at the Creative Evening this Thursday ( June 21st , 2012 ) in the Toronto store . I 'll be doing lots of demonstrations and afterwards everyone is going to making two of my decorative accents for free ! . I 've made up a few extra workshop kits and we still have couple of chairs to fill so if you 'd like to come , just send me a quick email before this Thursday morning !

I wrapped a wet paper towel around the ends of the stems to keep my flowers from drying out and then placed the stems into one of our clear candy bags . A piece of ribbon or twine was tied near the opening of the clear bag . ( see top photo above ) <p> 2 . Wrap a piece of kraft wrapping paper around the flowers so that it creates a bit of a cone shape . You can use a small piece of tape to hold the wrapping paper together if you wish . <p> 3 . Now wrap a piece of decorative wrapping paper over top of the kraft paper . The kraft paper will hide the plain white back side of the patterned paper and adds a decorative element with the double wrapping .

If you want a bolder look , you could have used solid wrapping paper in a colour to co-ordinate with your pattern instead of kraft paper . <p> I used a beautiful wrapping paper from our new watercolour garden collection that has just arrived in our stores and online . It works with so many beautiful colours you will be able to find lots of ribbons and tissue paper to co-ordinate with this collection .

The hardest part is waiting for the glue to dry between layers . <p> You can keep the wreath sweet and simple as I have shown above or you can add a decorative element to the centre ... <p> like I did with the my paper pops ! If you are interested in learning how to make paper pops , check out my tutorial here . I have Christmas messages on my paper pops but I could see changing these out for different holidays or to say happy birthday . I have a feeling one of these paper straw wreaths will make it 's way into a party theme next year . <p> Note : I used red striped paper straws but you can use whatever colour(s) of paper straws you want to match your decor . <p> I covered the front of the wood wreath with a piece of white cardstock .

Hold onto the smaller ( approx. three inch ) straws because we will use them in the next step . Glue the 24 five inch straws on top of and in between the first layer of straws . Be careful to evenly space out the straws , see photo 4c for a closeup of the spacing . Allow to dry before going onto step 5 . <p> 5 .

I glued them DIRECTLY over the three inch straws on the second layer . See the detailed photo in 6c .

Use white chalk markers to write words like I did or doodle a design on your pumpkin . If you are interested in writing words like mine and you do n't feel like your hand writing is worthy of doing this free hand - it is possible to trace words onto the pumpkin using the same techniques I have shown you on our chalkboards in earlier posts like this one .

The kit contains 12 kraft coloured paper boxes as well as an assortment of ribbon , lace and vintage printed papers . <p> Of course , I had to open one of the kits and make some samples for the new Creative Studio at the Toronto store .

I think that it would be too stressful to have to come up with 12 different ways to decorate the boxes so I decided to create three different designs ... <p> and I think that it would be easy to repeat these designs with the other boxes .

You can see and follow ? my pinterest boards here . Today I thought that I 'd share with you some of my favourite pins that feature diamond wrap . <p> Diamond wrap is one of the most popular items for wedding and I think that it is because you can incorporate this beautiful roll of " bling " in so many ways to so many different elements of a wedding or special event . <p> Here 's how easy it is to adhere the diamond wrap to the vases . I used a new two sided tape that is in the Toronto store right now called " SuperTape " . The tape is heat resistant so if you are going to use the glass vase with a candle you do n't have to worry about the diamond wrap falling off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap with regular scissors to fit your vase . It is easy to cut , does not fray and you can make the bands as wide and long as you want . I used two pieces of tape on each piece of diamond wrap and place them close to the two longest edges as seen in the centre photo above . When I adhere the diamond wrap to the vases I start at the front of the vase with the middle of the band and work my way around to the back . <p> The diamond wrap can be the only decorative element that you add to the vases as seen in the first photo on the left . It looks simple and elegant . <p> If you want to add another pop of colour and texture you can add a ribbon accent as I did in the centre photo . I used the glitter lame ribbon with wire so that I could just knot the ribbon and use the wire to create a bow like effect . <p> In the last photo on the right , I tucked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great option if you are trying to keep the number of elements on the table to a minimum . <p> I will be joining the staff of Featuring ...

We have stocked a number of diy stationery kits again this year that can be personalized and printed on a home printer . The stationery kits are ideal for weddings , birthdays , anniversaries or any event you are planning . <p> Tip for adding burlap and lace ribbon to a vase : Cut burlap to fit vase allowing for a little bit of overlap at the back . Hold in place with a neutral coloured elastic band . Wrap the lace ribbon around the burlap ribbon so that you hide the elastic band . Tie the lace ribbon in the back with a small bow so that the back looks nice . <p> here 's a close up of where I positioned the brooch on the vase .

I added a glitter heart to the chalkboard gift tag using the tutorial that I showed you here . <p> This last mood board is one of my favourites ... focusing on a natural mix of textures with a touch of black and cream . Any colour that you add ( such as the red , pink and white heart candies in my photo ) will just pop with this colour grouping . <p> Ordinary kraft boxes and bags can be easily dressed up for any occasion by adding burlap and lace details .

But before I start posting holiday ideas using all of our amazing new holiday products I want to share a sport themed party centre piece that I have been working on . <p> This was created for a football themed Bar Mitzvah . The adorable little personalized footballs were the starting point for this project . I used our rectangular glass vases and filled them with sizzle . The sizzle worked perfectly because it resembles a cheerleader 's pompom and we carry so many colours of sizzle that it was easy to co-ordinate with the team colours . <p> Iron on transfers and canvas pendants were used to create the table numbers .

Easter packaging and free Easter gift tags <p> Just in time for Easter planning ... here 's a fun way to package a small chocolate bunny and a selection of colourful candies in our clear air tight jars . These clear jars are great for kids because they are not glass and the kids can use them afterwards to store crayons , craft supplies or small toys . <p> Packaging instructions : <p> 1 . Gather your supplies . A large clear jar , a small solid ( or hollow ) chocolate bunny that will fit inside the jar once the lid is closed , small colourful candies ( I used M&amp;M 's in the limited edition spring colours ) , twine and assorted ribbons and if you want to use my free Easter gift tags you will need my download and either our Clean Edge 80lb card tags ( KP10 ) or cardstock paper . You will also need scissors to cut the ribbons . <p> 2 . I filled about 1/4 of the jar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar the candies may break - so be careful . <p> 3 . Then I gently inserted the chocolate bunny into the centre of the jar and continued to place a few more M&amp;Ms in front and behind the bunny to make sure that the bunny stood straight . You do n't want to completely cover the bunny so do n't add too many more M&amp;Ms ... it 's okay to eat a few of the M&amp;Ms if they do n't all fit ( I wo n't tell the kids if you do n't ! ) <p> 4 . Close the lid on the jar and now you are ready to tie an assortment of different ribbons to the outside of the jar as a decorative element . I used a variety of different kinds of ribbon ( satin , organza and grosgrain ) in an assortment of colours ( similar colours to the candies inside ) and all of varying widths . I did not tie the ribbons in any special order ... just start tying the ribbon onto the metal hinge and continue to tie on ribbons until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gift tag , you may want to attach it with a piece of twine as I did .

Our Toronto store has inventory of select shapes and colours of the Clean Edge cards in packages of two sheets . I love the Clean Edge cards and Exacto labels because they match our Options Wedding Favor Boxes so if you want to make tags or labels to match your favors these are amazing . <p> I created the download so that you have two options - 1 . print them on the " tag shaped " ( KP10 ) Clean Edge 80lb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2. print them on plain white card stock using the download showing the tag outline and cut them out by hand . <p> Here 's my tips for printing on the 80lb Clean Edge Cards . <p> 1 . I used my ink jet printer at home - my printer is made by Brother and is from their " professional series " model MFC-J6510DW . <p> Note : the matte coloured cards are laser and ink jet compatible , the metallic colours are laser compatible - so make sure that your home computer is compatible before you start printing . <p> 2 . I used the manual feed on my printer because the 80 lb Clean Edge Card was too thick for my paper tray and it got stuck the first two times I tried . I was able to print the metallic coloured cards on my ink jet printer but I know that they WILL NOT PRINT on ALL ink jet printers . <p> 3 .

Select " best quality print " and if you have a " vivid " colour mode select it as well so that the pastel colours do n't fade . <p> 6 . You want to use my " print ready " download for the Clean Edge Cards ... this version does not show the outline of the tag shapes ... you do n't want to print the tag outline . The art is made to " bleed " off the die cut edges ... that is so that if your printer is slightly off the art will still print to the edges . You want to keep this in mind if you create your own art for these tags on line . <p> 7 .

Each week , as I create , photograph and write about different ideas and projects using our products , I hope that I inspire you to get creative ... and hopefully , you will create something wonderful and inspire someone else ! ! <p> Today I am going to share with you some of the projects that I created for a birthday party . I made all of the sample projects using our new Make and Print Stickers . If you are in the Toronto store , you can see these projects on display in the Creative Studio section . <p> Sweet tables and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our birthday party has to have one ! I used Make and Print Stickers to create labels for our glass containers and twist top bottles . One of the labels was used to create a " sign " that I stuck into a glass container full of candy coated chocolates . Everything on the table should have a label or sign ... try to use your imagination and tie the words into your party theme . <p> I created the art for my labels in Photoshop and printed them on blank 8.5 " by 11 " sticker sheets on my inkjet printer . If you do not have computer software or the computer skills to make your own art do n't worry because the Make and Print Stickers have an instruction sheet that will help you to go online and create your stickers . Inside each package you will find a secret code that is unique to your stickers . Use the code on the Sticker You website and you will find creating your own stickers a fun and easy process . The website has lots of designs for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have licenced art from well known brands like Batman , Dora the Explorer and the Archies just to name a few . <p> I added paper butterflies to the labels to give them a little something extra . I cut the butterflies out of two-sided scrapbook papers using a couple of different butterfly paper punches . To give the butterflies some dimension , I folded the butterflies in half . I also tied pretty dotted ribbon and baker 's twine to the containers . <p> The little flags on the mini cupcakes were made using our lollipop sticks and patterned tape . <p> The cupcakes are displayed on wood serving trays . I know that the wood serving trays are disposable but do n't throw them out - I 've got lots of great ways to use these after the party ! ( More about that on another post ! ! ) <p> Our paper straws come in so many great colours that I could not pick just one colour so I used three . I knew that I would not need all of the straws for the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unique party decorations ... straw garlands ! <p> These straw garlands are so easy to make . I would suggest making them with the kids at the party for something to do . I will give you directions for the making the straw garland in my next post . <p> I used clear containers and Make and Print stickers to create the favors shown above . You can see that I added paper butterflies and ribbons on the favors so that they would co-ordinate with the other party decorations . <p> And the last project that I I wanted to show you was really the first project that I made for the party ... the party invitations . You can see that I used a bitty bag , a library pocket , a mailing tag and a sticker with the birthday girl 's picture to create the invitation . Assorted ribbons were tied onto the mailing tag so that it would not be missed . Information about the party was printed on a larger piece of cardstock and tucked inside the bitty bag . <p> Hey , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue paper and twist ties . I hung the paper flower pom-poms and some paper lanterns together as a large group using clear string but I could have used ribbon if I wanted another decorative element . <p> I 'm going to be making these tissue paper flower pom-poms at the Toronto store on Thursday May 24th at 6:00pm . Save the date on your calendar if you are interested in joining me . I 'll give you more details about other projects I will be doing that evening and how to register for the event soon .

Creative Bag has teamed up with the very talented Elle Daftarian of Petite &amp; Sweet and together we are creating a series of DIY YouTube videos that we know you are going to want to watch . <p> Elle Daftarian is the owner and creative director of Petite &amp; Sweet a lifestyle and event planning company . Elle creates one of a kind dessert table and stylized events . <p> You may also recognize Elle as one of the stars of Sugar Stars - a very popular reality show that airs on the Food Network .

Unfortunately , we do n't have these on our website but we do carry them in all of our stores . We have a great variety of different sizes and shapes and we are always adding new styles . <p> Candy Bags . Whether you use candy bags to package take home favors or just want to set out the bags for guests to fill themselves , you are sure to find lots of candy bag options to add to your sweet table decor . Bags with flat bottoms can be set up as you see them in neat little rows . <p> Baker 's Twine &amp; Chalkboard Tags . Use these to decorate plain candy bags and make them your own . Baker 's twine is available in many different colours and new colour combinations are always being added . We have a variety of different chalkboards with clips that are easy to add to bag tops ... add a name or thank you message to each bag to personalize ! <p> Linen Favor Bags .

Give your sweet table some height by hanging a fun bunting above . In my last post I gave you some tips and tricks on how to decorate our plain linen and burlap banners . <p> Here 's how I painted the banners above using inexpensive acrylic craft paint : <p> 1 . Trace a saying onto the bunting using a disappearing ink fabric pen and then use paint to write out your saying . I used a mix of black and gold sparkle paint in my example . <p> 2 . Paint the banner black - I used black chalkboard paint on mine . Then paint a few colourful flowers or whatever you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter or number to the blank space to personalize this banner over and over again with chalk markers . <p> 3 . Use painter 's tape to create stripes . Tip : I covered the entire banner with rows of painter 's tape and removed select strips of tape to create the stripes . <p> 4 . Using a glass as a template and a disappearing ink fabric pen , I drew out a polka dot pattern . Tip : I wrote what colour to paint each dot so I could work out my pattern before painting . <p> 5 . Paint each banner a solid colour if you want to keep this simple ! <p> Ok , are you in the mood for some sweets ? I am ! ! <p> We are working on a special sweet table project with Petite &amp; Sweet . Stay tuned for more details ! <p> Our linen banners are like mini painter 's canvases . They are easy to paint on and because the fabric more see through than canvas it is easy to trace elaborate letters onto the fabric before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , print them out on paper and trace the letters onto the banners using a pencil ( or fabric pen with disappearing ink ) . <p> Want to add a little more colour to your bunting project ? Paint our linen banners using acrylic craft paint ! It 's inexpensive to do and a craft paint is available in so many colours . <p> Tip : Paint one side first and allow it to dry completely before turning over to paint the other side . The paint will bleed through the fabric so make sure you cover up your work area . <p> I did a lot of experimenting with paints and colours on the banners . Here 's my burlap tester ! <p> Above are some shots that I took while I was experimenting with different products and techniques . <p> Top left : Trace lettering on linen banners using fabric markers with disappearing ink . Use a ruler to mark out where to place your letters before you start tracing . <p> Top right : Use clear plastic or glass containers to trace out circle shapes on burlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with straight lines but remember to remove the tape before your paint dries . <h> Tuesday , 11 March 2014 <p> In today 's post I am going to share a few Easter packaging ideas and some more of my free printables that you can download . Easter candies and sweets are usually very colourful and for that reason , I prefer to package Easter treats in clear candy bags and boxes . I designed the bag headers and candy wrappers using a chalkboard background so that the colours in the packaging would not take away from the items being packaged inside . <p> I did n't have a real cupcake on hand when I was shooting these photos so I used a cupcake that was crafted using baker 's twine and a styrofoam ball ( see clear cupcake bag above on the right ) . These cupcake bags are a nice option if you are looking for something unique to package cupcakes . The best thing about these bags is that you can personalize them with custom headers to match your colours/theme . I also found that the cupcake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside of the bag . Note : The back of these bag headers can be personalized with a chalk marker if you want to customize these packages yourself . <p> It is so easy to add personalized wrappers to mini chocolate bars and I do it all of the time . I buy these mini chocolate bars at Costco because they are available all year long and are available in milk or dark chocolate . Our 2 " x2 " x2 " clear boxes will hold 8 or 9 mini bars . A little sizzle on each side keep the chocolates from moving around . I often tie baker 's twine around the boxes but this time I used ribbon that worked with my Easter theme . <p> I 've shown you how to add the wrappers to the mini chocolate bars before on the blog but I 'll repeat it again here because it 's so simple . <p> 1 . Print the download for the wrappers on plain white text paper . Cut out the wrappers and add two pieces of two sided tape to the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chocolate bars as shown above and you are done ! <p> I added a chalkboard sticker to the bottom of the box - a nice option if you want to add a name or message to your packaging . Place the chalkboard sticker on the top of the box and use these as part of your table decor by placing one of these favors on everyone 's plate for Easter dinner . <h> Thursday , 6 March 2014 <p> Photo booths are still a popular choice for weddings and parties . They are a wonderful idea to keep guests of all ages entertained . All you really need is a backdrop and a few fun props . If you are thinking of adding one to an event that you are planning we have lots of photo booth supplies that will help you to get the party started ! Here 's some of my favourites .... <p> I recently created some props for a photo booth using our wood chalkboards on sticks .

I have been pinning pictures of paper straws from weddings , parties and sweet tables , so I know that I am not the only one who loves them . <p> One of the great things about paper straws is that it is very easy to personalize them . So with that in mind , I designed a page of pink and red flags as a free download . The colours in the flags match my pink and red vintage label downloads and would be perfect for a Valentine themed party . <p> Here 's a quick overview on how to attach these flags to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy weight paper on your colour printer . <p> 1 . Cut the flags out and fold each flag in half . <p> 2 . Add two sided tape to the back of 1/2 of the flag as shown . <p> 3 . Peel the backing off the tape . Position the flag on the straw or treat stick and press the flag together starting at the ends and working towards the ( fold ) straw/stick . <p> Personalized paper straws and treat sticks ... a simple and creative way to make your next event " your own " . I hope that you try this out ! Let me know if you use my flags - I 'd love to see them in use ! <h> Sunday , 15 January 2012 <p> Last week I posted about how to use the free download for my vintage labels on glass containers and vases . Today I thought that I show you some examples of how I used the same vintage labels to decorate some of the large bitty bags . <p> The bitty bags could be used as a treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as loot bags for a birthday party or favors for a wedding . <p> I used the vintage labels on the larger sized bitty bags but I wanted to show you the smaller bitty bags too because they are the perfect size for mini chocolate bars and I 've designed a mini chocolate bar wrapper that I will share with you later in the week . <p> ( a ) I used the vintage label with a manilla shipping tag , ribbon and a piece of glitter tape to decorate the first large bitty bag . I used a couple of pieces of two sided tape to keep the papers in place on the bag before I sewed the bag on my sewing machine . I used pink thread so that the stitching would stand out . I used this same sewing detail on all of the bags . <p> ( b ) I did n't use the vintage labels on either of the little bitty bags but I did sew the bags to seal them up after adding my mini chocolate bars . I used scraps of papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tag for this bag and attached it to the bitty bag with a small clothepin decorated with divine twine . I created the word " love " on the tag by cutting letters out of an old book . <p> ( c ) This is the other smaller bitty bag that I created . I punched a single hole in the bag above the stitching so I could attach a metal rimmed tag to the bag with a piece of divine twine . <p> ( d ) And here 's a close up of the last decorated bitty bag . I covered the words on the vintage tag with a piece of glitter tape and I added a fun little feather boa . Our mini feather boas have a peel and stick backing so they are easy to attach to just about anything . I can see this bag being used as a loot bag for little girl 's party . <h> Wednesday , 11 January 2012 <p> These fun little containers are sure to be a big hit at weddings and parties . We are just starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked goods and frozen treats . My kids and I made some on the weekend and we filled them with mini cupcakes . Here 's a tutorial of how to use these push pops containers with mini cupcakes ... <p> First you want to gather your supplies : push pop containers , mini cupcakes , icing ( food colouring if you want a coloured icing ) , icing bag with tip ( I used the Wilton Decorator Plus because I find it easy to use with the kids ) , and sprinkles . <p> 1 . I took the containers apart and washed them with warm soapy water before we got started filling them . That 's one of the things that I love about these containers - you can wash them out and reuse them again ! <p> 2 . With the container pushed up about 1/2 way , we inserted our first mini cupcake . The cupcake should be just a touch smaller than the container so that you can easily move the stick up and down with the cupcake in place . Tip : I found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than we wanted so I used a knife to trim off a little bit of the top edges . <p> 3 . I wanted these cupcakes to work for a Valentine themed party so we coloured our icing pink and used pink/red/white mini heart shape sprinkles. 4 . Next you will want to add your icining to the cupcake being very careful not to touch the inside edges of the container . If the icing touches now it will streak later when you lower the cupcake. 5 . Add the sprinkles . <p> 6 . The next step is to gently draw the stick down to lower the cupcake in the container and make room for the second cupcake . <p> 7 . Add your second cupcake , 8. icing and sprinkles . <p> 9. &amp; 10 . Add the top to the containers and you are done ! <p> I think that these would be so cute for a wedding . You could decorate the containers with ribbons or a decorative sticker to co-ordinate with your colours/theme . If you make these I 'd love to hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this post or you can send pictures to me here . I have a feeling that I will be making these again in the not too distance future ... I saw a cute recipe for push pop s'mores that I 'm going to try next ! ! <p> Do you live in the Toronto area ? Getting married soon or know someone who is ? Our friends over at Riche Bridal are having their annual Bridal Gown sale this week ! They have dresses for everyone in the wedding party up to 80% off regular retail . <h> Sunday , 8 January 2012 <p> Sweet bars are becoming more and more popular for weddings , showers , birthday parties and holiday get togethers so I thought that it would be fun to design some labels to add to some of our glass vases and containers . Since Valentine 's day is not too far away I decided to use red and pink as my colour inspiration . <p> I designed these labels in red and pink to co-ordinate with our bitty paper bags . I will be doing another post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bitty bags for Valentine 's day ! <p> The first step is to print out the labels on heavy white cardstock on your inkjet or laser printer . <p> Next you will want to cut the labels with a pair of scissors . <p> Simply use the coloured outline of the vintage label shape as your guide for cutting . <p> You can attach the labels to your glass vases or containers a few ways ... here are two of my favourites ... <p> 1 . You can tie the ribbon around the glass vase or container first . I simply tied a knot at the back and the ribbon stayed in place . Then I attached the paper label to the ribbon and glass using two sided tape.I used a narrow red ribbon with white stitching on my sample for a fun Valentine party but I was making this for a wedding I would have selected a wider satin ribbon for a more elegant look . <p> 2 . The other way to attach the labels to the container is to use a single hole punch to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut one piece of ribbon that is long enough to go around the glass container/vase and tie a knot/bow . Thread the ribbon through the two holes on the label as shown in the picture above and tie the ribbon in place with a knot at the back . If you are not able to tie the ribbon tightly enough to keep the ribbon/label from sliding down , you can add a small piece of two sided tape to the back of the label to hold the label in place before you tie the ribbon . <h> Tuesday , 3 January 2012 <p> Happy 2012 ! !

Pages from old books work well for a vintage theme . When you are selecting coloured papers , I recommend buying two sided papers for the flowers .

Cut your paper to either fit the size of the metal die ( if you want to cut all of the shapes on the die ) or to fit the size of the shape you wish to cut ( plus a little extra in case the paper moves slightly when you are cutting ) . <p> 2 . Open the Cuttlebug as shown and place the first " B " plate on one side of the machine as in the picture .

I 've used two or three pieces of regular weight scrapbooking paper when I have many pieces to cut and it saves a lot of time . <p> These steel rule dies can cut shapes from many different kinds of materials .

It occurred to me that I could create dry snow globe using our clear tin pails and by inserting a gift card sandwiched between two gift tags , the snow globe pails becomes unique gift packaging ! ! After the <p> gift card is removed the container becomes a decoration that can be displayed every year . <p> Note : As of this morning , we still have a few of the white bottle brush trees at our Toronto store in the Creative Studio but they are almost sold out . <p> My tree was a little to big for the tin container so I took the base of the tree off and used wire cutters to remove some of the bristles on the bottom of the tree . You will also have to cut the wire stem before you put the tree base back on . I glued the tree to the base using E-6000 glue . <p> I wanted my trees to have a vintage feeling so I added sliver glitter using gel medium . We sell Wendy Addison 's German Silver Pure Glass Glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little gel medium to the tips of the trees . Work quickly once you have added the gel medium and sprinkle the glass glitter all over . <p> Tip : I put my glitter into salt shakers because it gives me better control of the glitter . I also sprinkle the glitter over a container to keep the mess to a minimum and so that I can put the excess glitter back into the salt shaker . <p> I used our #5 kraft tags and cut them to size so they fit inside the tin container . You 'll need two tags if you want to hide the gift card - one for the front and one for the back . I used stamps and distress ink ( all available in the Toronto store ) to decorate and age the tags . <p> Then I used two sided tape to attach the gift card to the back of one of the tags . More two sided tape was used at the top of one tags to join the two tags . Then a ribbon was tie to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the tags/gift card out of the container . <p> Once the gift tags is complete and the glittered tree is dry you can position them both inside of the tin container . The tree will have to be off centred to make room for the tag . Use E-6000 glue to keep the tree in place on the bottom of the container . Once the glue is dry you are ready to add the snow glitter . You only need the white snow glitter to cover the bottom of the container and part of the base of the tree . Now , place the tag/gift card back into the container behind the tree . <p> I decorated the lid of the container using kraft paper , stamps and distress ink ... similar to what I did on the tags inside the container . You could cut wrapping paper or scrapbooking paper for a different look . I embellished the handle of the pail on one side with assorted ribbons as you can see above .

I also added a vintage paper detail inside the container ... it is the definition of " snow " from an old dictionary . <p> Tip : If you are not going to be present when the gift is being opened , you may want to write on the back of the gift tag explaining that they are to open the container and take out the tag to find a surprise . <p> These are so easy to make and I guarantee whoever receives one of these will think they are very special to you . <p> If you are interested in learning more about making dry snow globes for Christmas decorating , you can visit my personal blog here for another snow globe project . <h> Sunday , 16 December 2012 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that will make make your Christmas gift wrapping look extra special this year . <p> 1 .

We still have pipe cleaners in our stores but they wo n't last for long ! <p> 4 . If you have ever been to one of my Creative Evening workshops you know that I love using clothespins to attach decorative elements and gift tags to bags and boxes .

We have a few paper punches at the Toronto store in the Creative Studio space - I 'm using the one that looks like a gift tag shape this year ! <h> Wednesday , 12 December 2012 <p> I presented a number of wrapping projects at the December 6th Creative Evening Workshop . Today I am going to share with you some of those gift wrapping ideas as well as the downloads that I created for the iron on transfers , stickers and gift tags that I used . <p> As you will see , there are a number of downloads ! As always , my downloads are free for you to use for your personal projects only . My art is not intended for any commercial use . <p> 2 . A paper tag is added to a white paper bag that has been paper punched at the top and " sewn " closed with a ribbon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these in another post this week . <p> 3 . A long sticker and ribbon were used to close and decorated this tin container . I love these tin containers for packaging baked goods . <p> 4 . I showed you how to use our large rhinestone bucklesand ribbon to decorate a box in this post . We have since sold out of the letterpress tags that I used on this gift but you could easily use my round " ho ho ho " tag as an alternative . <p> Print these on blank sticker sheets and cut them out as indicated . The large rectangular shapes fit our tin gift card holders when you round the corners . The three long stickers can be used on our tin boxes as I have shown in the photo collage above or on a box or bag . <p> I also created the ho ho ho tags in black . I printed them as stickers and used them on the top of atin pail . Tissue paper was cut to fit the inside of the tin container to hide the contents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle . I 'll show you more ideas for decorating our tin pails in the next few days ! <p> I laughed the first time that I heard this saying . It sounded like something one of my girls would have said when they were younger . In this second group of gift wrapping ideas you can see that I used our glassine bags , boxes and tin containers with my chalkboard art design . <p> 1 . A gingerbread cookie is tucked inside this glassine bag and closed with a ribbon . I added a jingle bell to the tag as a decorative element . <p> 2 . A tiny bottle brush tree that was dusted with silver glitter glass is glued to a large clothespin that was embellished with glitter tape ( all available in our Toronto store ) . The decorated clothespin holds the gift tag in place on top of a ribbon . <p> 3 . Ornaments , decorative sprays and ribbons decorate a box wrapped with black paper for an over the top look . <p> 4 .

I am so looking forward to 2013 and all of the exciting things we have planned at Creative Bag for the new year . This week I 'm working on the set up of our booth at theTotal Wedding Show .

I especially love to see pictures that are emailed to me ! Honestly , who would n't like to receive an email from someone that is happy and inspiring ? ! So please keep them coming and I hope to see lots more in 2013 . <p> Here 's a few Creative Customers that have inspired me in the last couple of days ... <p> Adriana was at my December 6th Creative Event and was so inspired after the workshop that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogging about her projects . As you can see , Adriana 's gifts look amazing ! ! ! You can read more about these on her blog here . <p> Robin is a very talented artist who has shopped at Creative Bag for years for packaging materials and things she can incorporate into her art projects . I was blown away with her holiday decorating and how she used so many of our products in her holiday decorating projects . Robin added burlap , twine , printed tissue paper , felt ornaments and holiday sprays to family heirlooms and found objects to create the most heartfelt displays . I ca n't wait to see her holiday gift wrapping ! ! You can find more about Robin here . <p> Alicia ordered our canvas bags on line and created a sweet advent calendar for her little boy .

Stay tuned to my blog for the next couple of weeks and I 'll show you lots of great ideas . I have created some free holiday downloads and I will be sharing them as well . <p> We sell a number of different sizes of rhinestone buckles . They are perfect for weddings but I knew that I would want to do something " Santa " like with them for the holidays . <p> My Santa inspired holiday wrapping would be suitable for a child or an adult 's gift . <p> The beautiful Letterpress gift tag is only available at the Toronto Creative Bag store . It is sold in a small canvas bag with assorted sayings in the Creative Studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using red jute that I wrapped about the box a few times . <p> If you are looking for some gift ideas to help Santa fill some stockings , we have the cutest little hand warmers that are on sale for 2 for $5 . <p> Our Magic Gel Pocket Hand Warmers are excellent for outdoor activities and holiday gifts . They heat up when you need it at a click of a button . Simply Click the metal disc and a chain reaction takes place producing heat ! Reusable 1000 's of times , boil for 5 minutes in pot of water until the crystals melt and then it 's ready for when you need it again and again . <h> Friday , 30 November 2012 <p> In my last Creative Evening Workshop at our Toronto store , I talked about how easy it is to make your home look like a page out of a magazine by simply co-ordinating your home decor and gift wrapping projects . That does not mean that you have to go out and buy all new decorations or wrap every gift the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme that works for my family/home and try to keep my colours limited to just a few . You will find it much easier to shop for supplies and decorations and everyone will think that you had a designer help you decorate for the holidays . <p> To show you what I am suggesting , I created three different inspiration boards using pins from my Pinterest boards and then I created three project boards using my diy projects and our products ! First , here 's my Pinterest Inspiration Board - I called it Traditional : <p> Here you will see some new decorating trends like chalkboard art combined with burlap and natural elements and textures . The colours are earthy with traditional reds and greens , snowflake white and woodland browns . Now here 's my decorating and wrapping ideas using the Traditional theme and colour combinations ... <p> This is where everything old is new again . Your colours will be more muted and it 's okay if things are distressed or tarnished . But not everything has to be aged because it 's okay to mix old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few colours when you mix and match . And it 's all about texture so mix it up - rough and soft , shiny and worn - it all goes together . <p> I fell in love with our vintage inspired Carneeval collection as soon as I saw it and I had a great time designing projects that would work together as part of my vintage theme ... <p> You can see that my reds go from burgundy to bright red to burnt orange with this collection . Felt , burlap and woodsy elements that were used in the Traditional theme also worked with this theme and I mixed them with gold and silver glass glitter and the gold Moonlight in Paris bags and boxes . Vintage holiday graphics and old font styles are perfect with this theme . Distress inks make paper tags and cotton bags look old and worn . <p> This theme can be very sweet and child like or very sophisticated and elegant depending on how you approach it . The jewel toned colours are not what one would normally call traditional Christmas but they certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think Dr. Seuss and Cindy Loo Who , colourful candies and paper cut out snowflakes . <p> I combined our Celebration Trees and silver Moonlight in Paris packaging products for this theme . I used polka dots , stripes , glitter and anything that made me smile in these projects . The purest whites make every jewel toned colour pop . I showed you chalkboard art on the traditional inspiration board and I can see them here too . Snowflake paper punches make white paper bags and tags look more festive . Glitter accents and ornaments are a must for this theme . <p> I hope that I have inspired you to look at your Holiday decorating and packaging projects in a different way this year . As I finish writing this post and look out my window , I can see snow falling . Tomorrow is the first day of December and I know that tonight my youngest daughter will be pulling out the advent calendar that I made for her first Christmas 13 years ago . The countdown begins ! <p> By the way , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been starting to add lots of great packaging and party boards.You can check it out here ! <h> Thursday , 29 November 2012 <p> This paper straw wreath is a fun project that you can create in a couple of hours . The hardest part is waiting for the glue to dry between layers . <p> You can keep the wreath sweet and simple as I have shown above or you can add a decorative element to the centre ... <p> like I did with the my paper pops ! If you are interested in learning how to make paper pops , check out my tutorial here . I have Christmas messages on my paper pops but I could see changing these out for different holidays or to say happy birthday . I have a feeling one of these paper straw wreaths will make it 's way into a party theme next year . <p> Note : I used red striped paper straws but you can use whatever colour(s) of paper straws you want to match your decor . <p> I covered the front of the wood wreath with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the white cardstock , cut it out and glued it down using the gel medium . <p> Then I tied a long piece of baker 's twine to the wood form to make it easier to hang later . <p> I cut a second circle out of the cardstock with a 2 " hole in the centre to use as a guide when positioning the paper straws on the wood form . Tape was used to hold the second cardboard circle to the back of the wood form . Do not glue this paper to the wood form because we will throw it away when we are done . <p> The paper straws will be glued to the wood wreath form in layers . Every layer will have 24 straws that are evenly spaced to form the circular shape . <p> 1 . The first layer of straws are all full length . Position your first 4 straws , as shown in photo 1 , using a generous amount of gel medium . Allow to dry . <p> 2 . Now position 5 straws inside each of the quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close up in photo 2c . Again , wait for this layer to dry . <p> 3 . Cut 24 straws down to six and a half inches . These 24 straws will be positioned in between the first 24 straws and on the same layer . The second set of straws will line up with the inner edge of the wood form ... you can see a detail of this in photo 3c . <p> 4 . Now we are ready to build on top of our first layer of straws and start our second layer . Cut 24 straws down to five inches . Hold onto the smaller ( approx. three inch ) straws because we will use them in the next step . Glue the 24 five inch straws on top of and in between the first layer of straws . Be careful to evenly space out the straws , see photo 4c for a closeup of the spacing . Allow to dry before going onto step 5 . <p> 5 . The next 24 straws that we will add to the second layer are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spaces between the 24 five inch straws . As you can see in photo 5 , I squeezed one end of the three inch straw so that it could easily fit in between the straws on the second layer . See photo 5c . Glue each straw in place and allow to dry . <p> 6 . And now we are ready for our third and last layer . These last 24 straws are all full length . I glued them DIRECTLY over the three inch straws on the second layer . See the detailed photo in 6c . Remove the paper circle that was taped to the back of the wood form . <p> Once your paper straw wreath has completely dried it is ready to be hung up for all to admire .

If you are going to allow guests to fill their own containers remember to include lots of candy scoops ! <p> We have daisy lids in a few colour options and paper straws in lots of colour options ... add both of these to our mason jars to serve drinks or use as fun favor containers . 
@@44713318 @4713318/ <h> Friday , 28 September 2012 <p> Time for another one of my " free " downloads . This one is for Halloween and includes two different elements that will make your Halloween packaging " spook " tacular . Here 's what the download looks like : <p> Download the art here . Print these in colour on white cardstock for the best results . Note : This download is just for personal use . No commerical use please . <p> First , I created this fun little square tag . As you can see , there are four of these tags on the download.Cut them out , punch a small hole with a paper punch , add some twine and you are ready to attach the tag to just about any Halloween packaging project . Here 's what I did with some of the tags : <p> ? <p> 1 . Oreo Pops . I showed you how to make these tasty treats a few months ago . For Halloween , I used orange candy melts and Halloween sprinkles . The oreo pops were packaged with small food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to tie the candy bag closed at the top of the lollipop stick . The orange twine that I selected to attach the tag added that extra pop of colour to my packaging.2 . Marshmallows dipped in chocolate . I used the same packaging details for these marshmallow Halloween treats as I did with the Oreo pops . I showed you how to make the marshmallow treats for Valentine 's Day . Again , some simple colour changes and these treats can easily be adapted to any holiday or party theme . Tip : To create the " eyes " on the " pumpkin " marshmallow , simply cut licorice into tiny triangles . <p> 3 . Cupcakes . Here you can see that I added the Halloween tag to one of our clear cupcake holders with a dome lid . I tied the black and white striped canvas ribbon around the container and knotted the ribbon at the top . Using a small ( not mini ) clothespin that was decorated with black glitter tape , I was able to clip the tag to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you how I was able to get the clothespin to stay in place on top of the knot . The orange twine was added as a decorative element and to add some colour . We do n't sell the glitter tape on line but it is available in the Creative Studio of the Toronto store . <p> The other item that I designed for the Halloween packaging download is this bag header . There are two of them on the download . Simply cut them out and fold them in half . Tip : I use a bone folder to make sure that the fold looks professional . When you are ready to add them to a bag , slip a clear flat bag inside the folded paper bag header and staple close along the bottom edges of the header . <p> Depending on what you put in the clear flat bags ... you can adjust how much of the bag is seen by folding any excess bag inside of the bag header before you staple the header in place . As you can see above , I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my loot bags but they vary in length to make my packaging look professional . The back of the headers have a blank area so you can write a name on them . Which is a great idea if you are using these for loot bags at a party or on Halloween eve for family and friends . <p> I hope that you feel inspired to try some of these packaging ideas out for yourself . As always , all of these ideas can easily be modified to suit any holiday , party or wedding theme . I will be demonstrating these projects and many more at the Creative Bag Halloween workshop next week on Thursday October 4 , 2012 . Everyone will be making one of these projects too so if you are interested in joining us just let me know because we still have a little space left . <h> Tuesday , 25 September 2012 <p> I have been wanting to show you how to make one of these cute tulle tutu tee shirts for a while and thought that Halloween would be a good time to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these when she was 5 and she insisted on wearing it everyday for months ... <p> Here 's my little princess at age 5 ! Robyn is almost 13 and we still have the original tulle tutu tee shirt hanging in her bedroom . <p> What I loved about this is that the tulle tutu is sewn directly onto a plain white tank or tee shirt so it is one piece ! The tee shirt can be worn with a pair of shorts or pants depending on the weather . This is a great project for a Halloween costume for a child , teen or adult . But I can also see making these for all of the guests at a princess or dance themed birthday party . <p> Before I show you how to make these , I am going to warn you that this project involves sewing ! If you do n't like to sew please keep checking this blog because I will show you how to make a " no-sew tulle tutu " in the near future . <p> Note : 12 " wide tulle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wider tulle . <p> 1 . Measure and cut tulle . First you will need to measure your tee shirt to find out how much tulle you will need to cut . The tulle will be sewn to the tee shirt at the waist so you need to measure the tee shirt in the waist area . If your tee shirt has a lot of stretch , try to stretch the fabric a bit when you are measuring . <p> I measured the front of my tee shirt ( 10 " ) and multiplied that number by 2 to get a total tee measurement of 20 " . You want your tulle to be very full so you need to double ( for me that was 40 " ) or triple ( again for me 60 " ) your overall tee shirt measurement depending on how full you want to go . I only doubled my tulle measurement for the sample I am showing you but I think that the next one I make will be tripled . <p> I used 18 " wider tulle and cut two pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If you are using 12 " wide tulle you will not fold the tulle . And you will need to cut 4 lengths of tulle not two . <p> If you are using the wider tulle as I am you will need to fold your tulle in half length wise to find your centre point . I found it helpful to use a quick disappearing ink fabric marker to draw a line on the fold of the tulle . Pin the two layers of tulle together . If you are using four pieces of 12 " tulle , you do not fold the tulle - but you can pin the tulle layers together at this point . <p> 2 . You will need to sew the layers of tulle together so that you can add gathers to the tulle . It is normal to do this with two rows of thread but I found that by using a heavier weight , brightly coloured thread on the tulle that I only needed one row of stitching . This thread will be removed at the end of the project so by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you use your sewing machine for this step ( which I did ) use the largest straight stitch you can . Stitch directly on top of the line ( middle point of the tulle ) that you just drew with the fabric marker . <p> Note : 12 " tulle will need to be sewn about 1/2 " from the top of the tulle to create your gathering stitches . <p> 3 . In photo three , you can see that I have gathered the tulle . To create the gathers I pulled the top thread so that the tulle would pucker . You want to do this with the thread so that the tulle is evenly gathered . Be very careful not to break the thread as you are pulling it to create the gathers ! ! The final measurement of the tulle along the stitching will be the measurement of your tee shirt ( for me that was 20 " ) . Knot the brightly coloured threads at each end when you reach the required length so that the gathers will stay in place . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the gathers are evenly spaced . <p> 4 . Now the tulle is ready to be sewn onto the tee shirt . I found it easier to mark on the tee shirt where I was going to sew using the fabric marker . Remember the tulle is going to start at the waist area . Now line up the tulle so that the brightly coloured stitching for the gathers lines up with the line you drew on the tee shirt . You will want to start at the middle front of the tee shirt and line up the middle of the tulle . The two ends of the tulle will end up at the centre back of the tee . You will have to carefully pin the tulle to the tee remembering to stretch the fabric slightly as you pin . <p> 5 . Once the tulle is pinned in place and you are happy with the way that the tulle is gathered it is time to do the final sewing . This time you will use a white thread so that your stitching is not seen . Stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stitch right on top of the coloured thread . <p> 6 . Once you have finished sewing you will need to carefully remove the coloured thread with a seam ripper or pin . And now your tulle tutu tee shirt is ready to be worn ! <p> As I said at the beginning of this post ... I think that this would be sweet as part of a girl 's Halloween costume . <p> There are still about 15 seats available for the Halloween workshop that I will be hosting on Thursday October 4th , 2012 at the Toronto Creative Bag store . This project will be on display and you can see it up close as well as the other projects that I have been working on . If you are interested in attending just send me an email and I 'll add your name to the list . You can find out more about the workshop by clicking here . <h> Friday , 21 September 2012 <p> As you can see , I have been playing with blackboard paint and a number of products we have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloween themed party . Decorative plastic pumpkins , wood market trays and white paper doilies are easy to paint with the Martha Stewart blackboard paint that is available in the Creative Studio area at the Toronto store . <p> Here you can see my " before " materials . You can use a regular paint brush or a small foam brush to paint all of the items shown . I actually prefer the foam brush because there are less stroke marks and it 's quicker ! <p> I only used one coat of paint on each of the products that I painted using the foam brush . If you find that you need two coats that is okay too . I think that these little pumpkins would be great as place cards at a table for a Halloween themed party or for Thanksgiving ! If you add your guest 's name with chalk it is easy to remove the chalk and reuse the pumpkins again ! <p> If you like to use labels on your containers these blackboard painted doilies are perfect for Halloween . I tied ribbons onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using two sided tape . I wrote on the doilies before attaching them to the jars . And because I did n't want the chalk to smuggle when I was attaching the doilies I used white china markers instead of chalk . You get the same look as the chalk but it does not come off . <p> I 've shown you before that you can paint our wood market trays and reuse them . Here 's one of the deeper market trays painted with the blackboard paint and used to display Halloween lootbags . I found that the market trays dried very quickly and again only needed one coat of paint using a foam brush but you may want to add a second coat if you want to cover more of the wood grain . <p> Did you notice the Halloween bag headers and tags ? I created them for a download and will share them with you next week ... so stay tuned ! <p> Interested in attending my Halloween workshop on Thursday October 4th , 2012 ?

We also set up the dining room for our little bakers to decorate real cupcakes ! This was a huge success . I loved using the bakery boxes for everyone to take their treats home in . Their other take-home was their own apron , which I sewed from tea towels and pretty ribbon ; find the tutorial here . We served a lovely buffet lunch , which included pink lemonade , of course , with the perfect pink polka dotted paper straws . We also came up with the " Sweetest Sweet Table Ever " , a bakeshop dessert table which included lots of amazing treats that I baked up for the party . I loved all the cookies , and marshmallow pops packaged up in the perfect little cello bags , all tied up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cute cupcake details to mention , but one of my absolute favourite was the sweet cupcake flower centre pieces , love the little bow on top too !

After writing the post I ended up creating an invitation for a popcorn themed party for my daughter . The invitation was based on the graphics from our retro popcorn containers and today I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We purchased a popcorn maker last Christmas and my youngest daughter just loves to make popcorn with her friends . Serving the popcorn in our retro looking cinema style popcorn boxes and bags is going to take watching home movies to a whole new level at our home . <p> I am going to make a smaller version of the black board pictured above so that I can write what movie is playing when my daughter has her friends over . We sell Martha Stewart 's blackboard paint at most of our Creative Bag stores and that is what I use to turn assorted sizes of plain canvas panels into blackboards . My tip for painting with blackboard paint - use a sponge brush and keep in mind you will need to apply 2 or 3 thin coats of paint for the best results . I like to use a long table with a burlap table runner as a food serving station . <p> There are a number of different sizes and shapes of boxes and buckets for popcorn ... all of them look like authentic cinema style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of different ones and let everyone pick their own container . <p> If you are planning on giving out party favors , our popcorn boxes make a unique favor container .

You can view most of our glassware selection on our website . These milk glass bottles are one of my favorites right now . I do n't think I will ever get tired of paper straws ... they make every glass look " special " and with so many colour choices it 's easy to tie these into any party colour theme . <p> Thinking about serving more than just popcorn ?

I used paper straws and boots cut out of black cardstock to create these simple ( and funny ) little cupcake decorations . I have not figured out what kind of cupcakes I will be serving ... my daughter loved the red velvet cupcakes that I made to shoot this photo - but I 'm thinking maybe dark chocolate or carrot cake . <p> Here 's how I made these ... <p> 1 . I drew a boot shape on plain paper and cut it out . <p> 2 . Then I used the shape as a template with black cardstock paper . I drew around the shape once , then turned the template over and drew around it again to create left and right boot shapes . <p> 3 . Cut the two boots out of the black cardstock and set aside . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from a paper straw . Cut the straw pieces long enough so that you can insert one end into the icing/cupcake . <p> 5 .

Halloween themed loot bags using my headers <p> 2. black board market trays <p> 3. witch 's feet cupcake decorations <p> I have lots of other packaging , decorating projects and inspiration to show you that can be used for a Halloween party or adapted for a birthday party , shower or wedding . <p> I am working on my workshop goody bags now .

@@44713328 @4713328/ <h> Tuesday , 6 March 2012 <h> diy paper flower favor kit tutorial ( my mini workshop recap ) <p> First , I just want to say thank you to everyone who came out to Creative Bag 's Toronto store on the weekend to see me . I know that many of you drove into the city from the north , east and west ! I had a wonderful time and we will be doing more of these going forward . I loved sharing my ideas with you and telling you about so many of the great products that we have in the store ( and some that are on their way ! ) . If you have any suggestions for future events - please leave me a comment here on the blog or send me an email here . I 'd love to hear what you have to say ! ! ! <p> We had a great turnout for the paper flower mini workshop and many of you purchased the " diy paper flower favor kit " that I created to make at home . As promised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the flowers and put together the favor box . <p> In the kit you would have received a copy of my instructions ( see above ) , a round favor box with lid , a strip of rhinestones ( diamond wrap ) , two pieces of tulle , and paper shapes - one large scallop circle , three medium circles , two flowers and one leaf . In the next post I will give you all of the information regarding the tools that I used to cut these paper elements so that you can make more of these favor boxes for a wedding or party . <p> You will also need : scissors , two sided tape or glue dots , glue or gel medium and a water mister . <p> The first thing that you want to do is give the two flower shapes some texture and dimension . <p> Start by using a water mister to spray one paper flower . A light mist of water is all you need ... just enough so the paper will be easy to work with . Next , scrunch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that I surprised many people when I did this at the workshop . It will look similar to the photo second from the right . Then you want to gently open the paper back up so that you can see the petals again . Play with it so that you give the flower a more dimensional look . You can see the difference between a flower that has been scrunched and one that has not in the first picture on left . Do this to both paper flower shapes and set them aside to dry . <p> Now we will use the scalloped circle shape to make the next flower part . First you will need to cut the circle into a spiral shape as you see in the first two pictures on the left . Mist the paper with your water mister as we did earlier with the flower shapes . Starting in the centre of the circle , create a cone shape using the end of the paper and start rolling the paper tightly together until you get to the opposite end of the paper spiral ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper down on your work surface and it will open up a bit ... if it is too tight you can play with it to open up a bit or if it is too big you can rewind it again to make it a little tigher . Set it aside and let it dry . <p> You will do the same technique on the three vintage text paper circles . <p> I posted a rolled paper flower tutorial using circle shapes on my blog a while ago and you can also check it out if you want . Basically , the plain circles will create rolled flowers with a straight edge ... the scallop circle will create rolled flowers with a scallop edge on a few of the outside layers of the flower . <p> Note : I drew a spiral on the circle so that you could get a better idea of what I mean when I say cut a spiral shape . If you want to use a pencil to draw your lines before you cut that is okay ... or just do as I do and cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To attach the rhinestones to the top of your favor box you will need to use two-sided tape or glue dots . As you can see in the photos above , I used a single length of two sided tape and adhered it to the middle of the rhinestone strip . Then I attached the rhinestones to the box top as shown . You can do this step before or after you have attached the flowers to the top of the box ... I decided to let the flowers dry while I was photographing this tutorial and did this step while I was waiting . <p> The last thing to do is assemble the flowers on top of the favor box top . <p> Please note that I am a mixed media artist and gel medium is my adhesive of choice . You could you could easily use white glue , mod podge or a hot glue gun on these last steps . <p> First you will want to adhere your two flower shapes together as in the top left picture . <p> Then you will add a generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle flower and place it on top of the first two flowers to form one large flower . <p> Use gel medium to attach this large flower to the box top as shown in the top right photo . <p> You will want to use the gel medium again to adhere the three vintage flowers beside the larger flower ... as you will see in the bottom left photo , I angled the flowers so that they were not all facing up . <p> The last step is to adhere the two small pieces of tulle into the arrangement . I think that the tulle is a fun , unexpected element and where you put them is n't important ... just tuck them into two spots that look a little more open and make sure that the two pieces of tulle are not side by side . I simply folded the tulle in half twice and added a bit of gel medium to the folded corner . You can use a pencil or wooden stick to position the tulle into place . <p> The leaf can be used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used paper that had a design on one side only so that you could easily write on the back . The leaf does not have to be glued to the favor top ... it will easily slip into place under the larger flower so that it can be removed . <p> As I said earlier , my next post will be about how to use the die cutter and paper punches to cut your own papers if you want to make a bunch of these yourself . There are still a few kits in the Toronto store if you want to purchase a kit ... they are $5 each . <p> Please leave me a comment with your opinion/ideas on mini workshops and demos . I 'd love to hear from you whether you were able to attend or not .

All of our Christmas merchandise is on sale so it 's a great time to pick up some last minute items and stock up for next year . <p> Our staff are looking forward to spending time with their families and friends on December 25 and 26th . We will be open on December 27th . You can see more details about our Holiday hours on our website . <p> I recently posted a few of my last minute Christmas projects on my personal blog . There is a free download and recipe for my Reindeer Treats bags here if you are looking for a quick last minute idea for holiday treat bags . Eat , drink and be Merry ! <h> Monday , 17 December 2012 <p> Snow globes seem to be a hot holiday trend this year . I have been making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holidays . It occurred to me that I could create dry snow globe using our clear tin pails and by inserting a gift card sandwiched between two gift tags , the snow globe pails becomes unique gift packaging ! ! After the <p> gift card is removed the container becomes a decoration that can be displayed every year . <p> Note : As of this morning , we still have a few of the white bottle brush trees at our Toronto store in the Creative Studio but they are almost sold out . <p> My tree was a little to big for the tin container so I took the base of the tree off and used wire cutters to remove some of the bristles on the bottom of the tree . You will also have to cut the wire stem before you put the tree base back on . I glued the tree to the base using E-6000 glue . <p> I wanted my trees to have a vintage feeling so I added sliver glitter using gel medium . We sell Wendy Addison 's German Silver Pure Glass Glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little gel medium to the tips of the trees . Work quickly once you have added the gel medium and sprinkle the glass glitter all over . <p> Tip : I put my glitter into salt shakers because it gives me better control of the glitter . I also sprinkle the glitter over a container to keep the mess to a minimum and so that I can put the excess glitter back into the salt shaker . <p> I used our #5 kraft tags and cut them to size so they fit inside the tin container . You 'll need two tags if you want to hide the gift card - one for the front and one for the back . I used stamps and distress ink ( all available in the Toronto store ) to decorate and age the tags . <p> Then I used two sided tape to attach the gift card to the back of one of the tags . More two sided tape was used at the top of one tags to join the two tags . Then a ribbon was tie to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the tags/gift card out of the container . <p> Once the gift tags is complete and the glittered tree is dry you can position them both inside of the tin container . The tree will have to be off centred to make room for the tag . Use E-6000 glue to keep the tree in place on the bottom of the container . Once the glue is dry you are ready to add the snow glitter . You only need the white snow glitter to cover the bottom of the container and part of the base of the tree . Now , place the tag/gift card back into the container behind the tree . <p> I decorated the lid of the container using kraft paper , stamps and distress ink ... similar to what I did on the tags inside the container . You could cut wrapping paper or scrapbooking paper for a different look . I embellished the handle of the pail on one side with assorted ribbons as you can see above . The washer on the twine is what you use to open the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that the washer can be used . I added a photo gift tag to my container .. you could also use one of my free gift tag downloads from this post . <p> Here 's another one of my snowglobe gift card holders ... this one has a snowflake ornament mixed in with the ribbons . I also added a vintage paper detail inside the container ... it is the definition of " snow " from an old dictionary . <p> Tip : If you are not going to be present when the gift is being opened , you may want to write on the back of the gift tag explaining that they are to open the container and take out the tag to find a surprise . <p> These are so easy to make and I guarantee whoever receives one of these will think they are very special to you . <p> If you are interested in learning more about making dry snow globes for Christmas decorating , you can visit my personal blog here for another snow globe project . <h> Sunday , 16 December 2012 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that will make make your Christmas gift wrapping look extra special this year . <p> 1 . Use Christmas ornaments to as a decorative element in your gift wrapping . This is so much easier than trying to tie big elaborate bows and after the gift has been opened the ornament can be hung on the Christmas tree . This is a great tradition to start with young children , family and friends . I especially love ornaments that you can add a picture . Visit our stores for holiday ornaments ... they wo n't last long so visit soon . <p> 2 . Spend a little extra time gift wrapping gift cards . Think outside of the box or should I say the standard envelope that comes with most gift cards . We have lots of tin containers , card holders and bags that will can be used with gift cards . Dress them up with stickers , ribbons and other decorative elements to make them extra special this holiday season . You can find my free downloads for the tin gift card holders in this post here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand to use in your gift wrapping . Twist the pipe cleaners into letters and use them as gift tags or decorative ornaments . Bend them into candy cane shapes or Dr. Seuss like swirls to use as accents . I used small left over pieces of paper straws from my paper straw wreathe project and pipe cleaners to create snowflake ornaments . We still have pipe cleaners in our stores but they wo n't last for long ! <p> 4 . If you have ever been to one of my Creative Evening workshops you know that I love using clothespins to attach decorative elements and gift tags to bags and boxes . You can paint clothespins , decorated them with glitter tape or leave them natural . I use E-6000 glue to attach small decorative elements to clothespins . We have assorted sizes of clothespins in our stores . E-6000 glue and glitter tape are available in the Creative Studio space at the Toronto store only . <p> 5 . This is my favourite gift wrapping suggestion and one that I have used for the past few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into different shapes to use as gift tags . I use one picture for each person and print copies that I can easily cut out with paper punches or scissors . We have a few paper punches at the Toronto store in the Creative Studio space - I 'm using the one that looks like a gift tag shape this year ! <h> Wednesday , 12 December 2012 <p> I presented a number of wrapping projects at the December 6th Creative Evening Workshop . Today I am going to share with you some of those gift wrapping ideas as well as the downloads that I created for the iron on transfers , stickers and gift tags that I used . <p> As you will see , there are a number of downloads ! As always , my downloads are free for you to use for your personal projects only . My art is not intended for any commercial use . <p> 2 .

We have since sold out of the letterpress tags that I used on this gift but you could easily use my round " ho ho ho " tag as an alternative . <p> Print these on blank sticker sheets and cut them out as indicated . The large rectangular shapes fit our tin gift card holders when you round the corners . The three long stickers can be used on our tin boxes as I have shown in the photo collage above or on a box or bag . <p> I also created the ho ho ho tags in black .

This one is for Halloween and includes two different elements that will make your Halloween packaging " spook " tacular . Here 's what the download looks like : <p> Download the art here . Print these in colour on white cardstock for the best results . Note : This download is just for personal use . No commerical use please . <p> First , I created this fun little square tag . As you can see , there are four of these tags on the download.Cut them out , punch a small hole with a paper punch , add some twine and you are ready to attach the tag to just about any Halloween packaging project . Here 's what I did with some of the tags : <p> ? <p> 1 . Oreo Pops . I showed you how to make these tasty treats a few months ago . For Halloween , I used orange candy melts and Halloween sprinkles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags . Black and white striped canvas ribbon was used to tie the candy bag closed at the top of the lollipop stick .

Again , some simple colour changes and these treats can easily be adapted to any holiday or party theme . Tip : To create the " eyes " on the " pumpkin " marshmallow , simply cut licorice into tiny triangles . <p> 3 . Cupcakes . Here you can see that I added the Halloween tag to one of our clear cupcake holders with a dome lid .

There are two of them on the download . Simply cut them out and fold them in half . Tip : I use a bone folder to make sure that the fold looks professional . When you are ready to add them to a bag , slip a clear flat bag inside the folded paper bag header and staple close along the bottom edges of the header . <p> Depending on what you put in the clear flat bags ... you can adjust how much of the bag is seen by folding any excess bag inside of the bag header before you staple the header in place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of clear flat bag on all of my loot bags but they vary in length to make my packaging look professional .

I just added a couple of extra steps so that you can insert or attach them to the bags . <p> You can use the tissue paper flower pom pom kits that we sell to create these and as you will see , you can add some patterned tissue paper to the kits to add a little pop ! <p> The first tissue paper pom pom that I 'm going to show you how to make has a spiky floral shape . I made this one so that it that can be tucked into a bag . <p> Start with 6 sheets of tissue paper that are 20 " by 15 " . <p> Accordion fold the tissue paper so that each fold is about 1 " wide . <p> Now fold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you have two stacks of folded tissue .

Insert the wood stick into the middle of the folded tissue paper making sure that the wood stick is far enough into the bottom of the tissue paper that you can add a twist tie to hold everything in place ( above right ) . <p> Cover up the twist tie and add a decorative element to the pom pom by wrapping a long piece of ribbon over the twist tie - finish with a knot to keep in place . <p> Now you are ready to open the tissue paper layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower tutorial that I showed you here .

I gave you the free download for the thank you tags in this post in case you missed it ! I love using the May Arts paper twine on my hang tags because they are so easy to use and are available in so many colour options . <p> If you are looking for a fun variation to my tissue paper pom poms try adding a few pieces of patterned tissue paper .

You want one side of the pom pom to be flat so open all layers of the tissue in the same direction . <p> The picture on the left ( above ) shows you what the finished polka dot pom pom will look like . You will want to hide the twist tie that was used to create your pom pom with a long piece of ribbon .

In that post I included a picture of a burlap ring bearer pillow that I created using our 9 " wide burlap ribbon and today I 'm going to show you how you can make one of these yourself . <p> Step One : Cut two squares of burlap measuring 9 " x 9 " . Centre and sandwich the quilt batting pillow form between the two pieces of burlap . <p> Step Two : Using a sewing machine , sew a square around the quilt batting pillow . Trim the burlap approximately 1 " from the stitching . Using a sewing needle and thread , sew a couple of stitches in the middle of the pillow to create a tuft and attach the twine . 
@@44713391 @4713391/ <h> Wednesday , 29 January 2014 <p> If you have been following our blog for a while , you know that I like to use our fabric bags for favor and holiday packaging . I 've been playing around with the concept of adding a little sparkle to our linen and cotton bags for Valentine 's Day and came up with a few ideas to share with you . <p> These adorable glitter hearts are a simple way to dress up fabric bags . Make the hearts as big as you want ... use one heart like I did or add a few to create a pattern. ! Just add a gift tag and you are ready to go ! If you are going to use these bags for candy or food products , I recommend using a smaller sized clear candy bag to contain the food before inserting it inside of the fabric bag of your choice . <p> I added a single band of glitter to the bottom of the linen and cotton bags pictured above . We were giving out these cute little buttons at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something like this would be cute on the bags with the glitter . You could use vintage buttons or brooches for a more vintage look ! <p> 2 . Tape off the area you want to add the glitter using painter 's tape.To create a perfect heart , I used a heart shaped paper punch and cut the heart out of a large sticker . Make sure that your tape/sticker is tight to the fabric so that the decoupage does not bleed underneath . <p> 3 . Using a paint brush , add decoupage to area that you want to add glitter . While the decoupage is still wet , sprinkle glitter to cover area completely . <p> 4 . Immediately remove the tape/sticker and allow to dry for a few hours . <p> 5 . When completely dry , add a top coat of decoupage over the glitter to stop the glitter from flaking off . <p> The great thing about this technique is that you can do it on glassware as well . I used the heart sticker that I created when making my favor bag to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only difference with using the Martha Stewart decoupage on glass is that you want add 2 or 3 coats of decoupage over the glitter so that the glassware can be dishwasher safe ( after " curing " for 28 days ) . These glass containers would be nice for flowers , candles or as a candy container for a sweet table ! <p> You can add glitter to burlap as I did with this David Tutera burlap candle holder . I added a vintage brooch to mine to dress up the candle holder . We have one brooch available on line right now and a few more vintage style brooches will be arriving in time for spring/summer weddings . I 'll keep posted when they are available ! <p> Here 's one more look at my glittered linen favor bags .

A number of people expressed an interest in them and so I have created a few free downloads to share with you on the blog today .

These tools not only make your diy packaging projects look professional they can also save you time . <p> I have talked about the sew ribbon tool and the paper punches in previous posts and I wanted to inspire you with a few more projects that I have created using these two tools . <p> Let 's start with the Sew Ribbon tool ... <p> I showed you in my last post that you can use this handy little tool to embellish stationery projects ... but did you know that you can also use this tool to add ribbon to favors ? ! <p> Our paper bags go from ordinary to extraordinary with the addition of a ribbon . I also used the paper edge paper punch on the top of the bags for a more feminine look . Ca n't you see these as a favor bag for a birthday or a wedding ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Kind Craft Show in Toronto using these paper bags to package their handmade products . They could pre-punch the bags with the sew ribbon tool and add the ribbon once the product is added to the bag . The type and colour of ribbon would match the artist 's branding . Not only is this a beautiful and inexpensive way to package product ... it is also instant gift wrapping ( talk about customer service ) ! <p> Now here are some more ways to use the paper edge punches ... <p> I have already told you that you can use paper edge punches on paper bags . I used simple kraft bags on all of my samples but they would work on so many of our paper bags . We have some new paper punches in the Creative Studio now and I ca n't wait to try this out on the notions bags ! <p> I used the paper edge punch on white card stock to decorate the two kraft boxes pictured above . <p> You may recognize the mini tissue paper flower pompom from one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box using three sheets of 7.5 " x 10 " tissue paper and using the same instructions that I gave you in this tutorial . <p> The other box with the long paper " ribbon " detail would make a great favor and place card in one . Just write the guests names on the blank space in the middle of the paper ribbon ! If you like the paper flower on this package I showed you how to make these a while ago and you can find the tutorials here and here . <p> Hello ! ! ! It 's Lorrie . We do n't have the craft punchs or sew ribbon tool on the website at this time . They are for sale in our Toronto store in the Creative Studio section .

I saw a similar idea with a square box on Pinterest a while ago and as soon as I saw the clear take out boxes I knew that I had to create my own version of this idea . <p> I stacked graham crackers , chocolate and large marshmellows in small clear take out boxes ? and used our new options labels , clean edge cards and assorted ribbons to decorate the containers . <p> I could see these favors being used at an outdoor wedding , a birthday party or beach get together at the cottage ... so it was hard for me to just create one version of this sweet treat . <p> Note : update February 2014 ... we no longer carry REX7 Options labels that these were created to print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank sticker sheets . Cut out with circle paper punch or by hand with scissors . <p> I 've also included a download for the art without the circles so you can create whatever shape of label you would like .

I tied a variety of different coloured ribbons , twine and burlap together on the wire handle along with a gift tag . <p> This last S'more favor box was designed with a totally different kind of party in mind ...

One recipe is for cookies and the other is for hot chocolate . Who does n't love cookies and hot chocolate ? ! I also created two free digital downloads for the jar labels so that you can package your gifts in a jar like mine . <p> The first recipe is for M&amp;M cookies . I layered all of the ingredients in the 4 cup jar as per the recipe directions . The label that I attached to the front of the jar with baker 's twine contains the directions for making the cookie dough and baking details . <p> I used some of our printed holiday tissue to decorate the top of the jar ... simply cut the tissue paper into circles , place over the jar top and secure with a ribbon . I used two layers of tissue paper on my jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cardstock for best results . <p> The other recipe in a jar is for <p> a peppermint hot chocolate mix . <p> I made them to fit into a small 1 pint jar but if you want to make this in a larger jar just increase the recipe to fit the jar size . <p> I created a label for the hot chocolate that could be inserted into the jar top to fit between the ring and top insert . <p> The label has directions for how to make the hot chocolate . I printed the label on kraft cardstock but you could print it on white cardstock if you want a different look for your packaging . <p> I also created the art a second way with a kraft paper look so that you could print it on white cardstock if you are unable to find kraft to print on . ( We have kraft cardstock in the Creative Studio at the Toronto store only ) <p> I tied a beautiful May Arts ribbon onto the jar lid and attached a felt acorn ornament for fun ... it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of beautiful felted holiday ornaments in our stores . <p> If you want to give your labels an antique/vintage look like mine use distress inks on the edge of the labels after you have cut them out . I used Tim Holtz vintage photo on mine and used the blending tool to give a soft aged effect . I will be demonstrating this technique at my workshop this Thursday . <p> I used ribbon scraps to create this bow ... if I was making a bunch of these for wedding or party favors I would purchase an assortment of ribbons and twines in different textures and widths . I cut wider ribbons in half to give some of the ribbons a vintage , worn look and used a large jingle bell for the centre . Gather all of your supplies and cut the ribbons to between 6 " to 7 " . <p> I tied jute around my gift box four times and tie a knot at the top . You will want to leave the ends of the jute long so that you can tie the ribbons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps in a circle like you see above . Mix up the layers so that the ribbon textures and colours are not all bunched together . <p> Next I used a clear twist tie and gathered the ribbons in the middle . Place the ribbons on top of the box and use the jute to secure the ribbons to the box . Tie the jute right over the twist tie to hide the twist tie . <p> I squished the ribbons to make them stand up a bit and cover the top of the box . It 's kind of like working hair product into your hair to give it volume ! ! You have to tease the ribbons a bit to get them to look right . Using baker 's twine or jute , attach the jingle bell to the middle of the top few layers of ribbons . You can add a gift tag to the top by simply looping a string tied to the tag around the bell .

These clear jars are great for kids because they are not glass and the kids can use them afterwards to store crayons , craft supplies or small toys . <p> Packaging instructions : <p> 1 . Gather your supplies . A large clear jar , a small solid ( or hollow ) chocolate bunny that will fit inside the jar once the lid is closed , small colourful candies ( I used M&amp;M 's in the limited edition spring colours ) , twine and assorted ribbons and if you want to use my free Easter gift tags you will need my download and either our Clean Edge 80lb card tags ( KP10 ) or cardstock paper . You will also need scissors to cut the ribbons . <p> 2 . I filled about 1/4 of the jar with the M&amp;Ms . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - so be careful . <p> 3 . Then I gently inserted the chocolate bunny into the centre of the jar and continued to place a few more M&amp;Ms in front and behind the bunny to make sure that the bunny stood straight . You do n't want to completely cover the bunny so do n't add too many more M&amp;Ms ... it 's okay to eat a few of the M&amp;Ms if they do n't all fit ( I wo n't tell the kids if you do n't ! ) <p> 4 . Close the lid on the jar and now you are ready to tie an assortment of different ribbons to the outside of the jar as a decorative element . I used a variety of different kinds of ribbon ( satin , organza and grosgrain ) in an assortment of colours ( similar colours to the candies inside ) and all of varying widths . I did not tie the ribbons in any special order ... just start tying the ribbon onto the metal hinge and continue to tie on ribbons until you have the look you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to attach it with a piece of twine as I did . I also tied some twine around the jar - just above and below the metal band ... you should be able to see it in the last two photos above . <p> I created a chevron gift tag that can be attached to these Easter gifts and they were designed to be used with our Creative Bag Wedding Clean Edge 80lb cards ( KP10 ) ... <p> We do n't sell these cards on line but they can be special ordered in all three of our stores . Our Toronto store has inventory of select shapes and colours of the Clean Edge cards in packages of two sheets . I love the Clean Edge cards and Exacto labels because they match our Options Wedding Favor Boxes so if you want to make tags or labels to match your favors these are amazing . <p> I created the download so that you have two options - 1 . print them on the " tag shaped " ( KP10 ) Clean Edge 80lb Card using the download that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain white card stock using the download showing the tag outline and cut them out by hand . <p> Here 's my tips for printing on the 80lb Clean Edge Cards . <p> 1 . I used my ink jet printer at home - my printer is made by Brother and is from their " professional series " model MFC-J6510DW . <p> Note : the matte coloured cards are laser and ink jet compatible , the metallic colours are laser compatible - so make sure that your home computer is compatible before you start printing . <p> 2 . I used the manual feed on my printer because the 80 lb Clean Edge Card was too thick for my paper tray and it got stuck the first two times I tried . I was able to print the metallic coloured cards on my ink jet printer but I know that they WILL NOT PRINT on ALL ink jet printers . <p> 3 . I test print on plain white paper anytime that I am using special papers on my home printer to make sure that the document is set properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip this step ... you 'll thank me later for this tip ! <p> 4 . When you are printing my art do not set the printer to " size to fit " ... the art is the correct size for the template and will print properly if left alone . <p> 5 . Select " best quality print " and if you have a " vivid " colour mode select it as well so that the pastel colours do n't fade . <p> 6 . You want to use my " print ready " download for the Clean Edge Cards ... this version does not show the outline of the tag shapes ... you do n't want to print the tag outline . The art is made to " bleed " off the die cut edges ... that is so that if your printer is slightly off the art will still print to the edges . You want to keep this in mind if you create your own art for these tags on line . <p> 7 . Once you have printed your tags you can pop them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags in place on the sheet ... it 's easy to keep them in a file folder on the sheets and you can store the left overs for next year . <h> Thursday , 22 March 2012 <p> Whether you are planning a wedding , shower , birthday party or another celebration - it seems like sweet tables and food bars are more than just a trend . I 've been pinning pictures of sweet table decorating ideas for a while and I 've seen so many amazing presentations that it makes my head spin . I 'd love to throw a party just so I can have an excuss to create a sweet table or food bar . <p> One of my favourite details of most sweet tables ( aside from the yummy food ) is the decorative containers that are used to contain and display the food . I 'm so excited that we have brought a number of different glass containers and vases into the stores that can be used at sweet tables and food bars . We are expecting more glass containers in the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you more about them when they arrive . <p> These glass jars with lids are my favourites right now .... and they look so sweet with the vintage labels that I created earlier this year for Valentine 's Day . There have been a few customer requests for me to create more of them so that they can be personalized for birthdays and weddings . So I decided to create a pdf of blank labels . <p> Of course , after I created the labels in black and white ... I had to create colour versions as well so that they could easily co-ordinate with some of the colours of our paper straws and bitty bags .... so there are 8 colour versions to download as well ... <p> Download the coloured vintage labels here by clicking on the colour name : <p> I have a number of projects on the go and I will be sharing more details with you soon . One of the projects has to do with a special wedding that I 'm working on and I ca n't wait to share some of the projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement about a new contest that I know will appeal to our " wedding " customers ... more about that one next week ! <h> Saturday , 17 March 2012 <p> I LOVE Pinterest ... it is not only where I keep and organize photo ideas for projects that I am working on but it is also my number one source for finding the newest trends , inspiration and ideas . You can see and follow ? my pinterest boards here . Today I thought that I 'd share with you some of my favourite pins that feature diamond wrap . <p> Diamond wrap is one of the most popular items for wedding and I think that it is because you can incorporate this beautiful roll of " bling " in so many ways to so many different elements of a wedding or special event . <p> Here 's how easy it is to adhere the diamond wrap to the vases . I used a new two sided tape that is in the Toronto store right now called " SuperTape " . The tape is heat resistant so if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have to worry about the diamond wrap falling off of the glass if it gets warm . Cut the diamond wrap with regular scissors to fit your vase . It is easy to cut , does not fray and you can make the bands as wide and long as you want . I used two pieces of tape on each piece of diamond wrap and place them close to the two longest edges as seen in the centre photo above . When I adhere the diamond wrap to the vases I start at the front of the vase with the middle of the band and work my way around to the back . <p> The diamond wrap can be the only decorative element that you add to the vases as seen in the first photo on the left . It looks simple and elegant . <p> If you want to add another pop of colour and texture you can add a ribbon accent as I did in the centre photo . I used the glitter lame ribbon with wire so that I could just knot the ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the last photo on the right , I tucked a table number sign into the ribbon . This is a great option if you are trying to keep the number of elements on the table to a minimum . <p> I will be joining the staff of Featuring ... You Spa &amp; Salon for a Bridal Spa Sampler Afternoon . We just found out that Jane Dayus-Hinch from Wedding SOS ( a very popular SLICE television show ) will be joining us as well so I 'm sure that it will be a fun and entertaining afternoon .

If you are planning on making a lot of these I would highly recommend purchasing the tools . <p> Here 's my list of tools to make and assemble your own paper flower kits : <p> 1 . Cuttlebug die cutting machine* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tattered florals " * <p> 3 . Sizzle Bigz die - Eillen Hull " leaves " <p> 4. circle paper punch - 3 " diameter <p> 5. scallop circle punch - 3.5 " diameter <p> 6. small water mister <p> 7 . Golden Gel Medium " heavy matte " - or you can use white glue or a hot glue gun <p> 8. two-sided tape <p> 9. scissors <p> We have just received some of these tools in the Toronto store this week . The Cuttlebug retails for $89.99 and the Sizzle Bigz dies are $19.99 each . They are in the Creative Studio space if you are looking for them . We did not order large quantities so if we are sold out of something that you were looking for let us know and we will special order more . <p> The other materials that you will need to create these favor boxes are : <p> 1 . small mod boxes - I used the kraft coloured boxes . There are many colours options to select from that are stocked in the stores or can be special ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new shipment of silver just arrived ! ! ) . Use whatever colour works for your wedding or event . You will need to cut the diamond wrap into 11.5 " lengths . From each 11.5 " length you will cut 6 strips ( four rows of diamonds high ) to fit the small mod box lid . <p> 3. tulle - I used white , but again there are lots of colour options ( some with glitter ! ) so select what works best for you . I cut two small 1.5 " square pieces of tulle for each favor box so you will have lots left over for other projects and decorations . <p> 4. scrapbooking papers and old books - use what works for you . Pages from old books work well for a vintage theme . When you are selecting coloured papers , I recommend buying two sided papers for the flowers . The easiest way to co-ordinate colours if you are doing more than two colours is to purchase a pad of paper because the colours will already be co-ordinated for you and eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick tutorial for how to use the cuttlebug die cutting machine with the Sizzle Bigz dies . I demonstrated how to do this at the paper flower mini workshop so this will be a reminder for some of you . You will need a large metal die and the two " B " plates that came with your Cuttlebug . <p> 1 . Cut your paper to either fit the size of the metal die ( if you want to cut all of the shapes on the die ) or to fit the size of the shape you wish to cut ( plus a little extra in case the paper moves slightly when you are cutting ) . <p> 2 . Open the Cuttlebug as shown and place the first " B " plate on one side of the machine as in the picture . I am right handed so I positioned the Cuttlebug so that the handle is on the right side . <p> 3 . Now place your die on top of the " B " plate with the black foam side facing up . Put the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . <p> 4 . Complete your " sandwich " by placing the second " B " plate on top of the paper . And now you are ready to cut . <p> 5 . Place your left hand on top of the Cuttlebug as shown and use your right hand to turn the handle and continue to turn the handle until the " sandwich " passes completely through the machine to the opposite side . <p> Depending on how thick your paper is , you can more than one piece of paper at a time . I 've used two or three pieces of regular weight scrapbooking paper when I have many pieces to cut and it saves a lot of time . <p> These steel rule dies can cut shapes from many different kinds of materials . Use them to cut cardstock , chipboard and matboard , craft metal , craft plastic , fabric , felt , flexible magnet , poly foam , shrink plastic , vellum and vinyl . I love to cut fabric shapes using my Cuttlebug and I just found out that they have dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 20 years ago when I was making baby quilts for everyone ! ! <p> The number of different dies to cut out seems to be limitless . At last weekend 's workshop , I showed another flower die ( that just arrived in the Toronto store this week ) that can be used on the Cuttlebug and you can view a quick tutorial on my personal blog to make that flower by clicking here . <p> So now you know how I created my paper flower favor and you can recreate lots of them yourself if you want to . Just remember you can easily make them your own design by using whatever colours you want . <h> Tuesday , 6 March 2012 <p> First , I just want to say thank you to everyone who came out to Creative Bag 's Toronto store on the weekend to see me . I know that many of you drove into the city from the north , east and west ! I had a wonderful time and we will be doing more of these going forward . I loved sharing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great products that we have in the store ( and some that are on their way ! ) . If you have any suggestions for future events - please leave me a comment here on the blog or send me an email here . I 'd love to hear what you have to say ! ! ! <p> We had a great turnout for the paper flower mini workshop and many of you purchased the " diy paper flower favor kit " that I created to make at home . As promised , here is a quick tutorial to remind you how to make the flowers and put together the favor box . <p> In the kit you would have received a copy of my instructions ( see above ) , a round favor box with lid , a strip of rhinestones ( diamond wrap ) , two pieces of tulle , and paper shapes - one large scallop circle , three medium circles , two flowers and one leaf . In the next post I will give you all of the information regarding the tools that I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of these favor boxes for a wedding or party . <p> You will also need : scissors , two sided tape or glue dots , glue or gel medium and a water mister . <p> The first thing that you want to do is give the two flower shapes some texture and dimension . <p> Start by using a water mister to spray one paper flower . A light mist of water is all you need ... just enough so the paper will be easy to work with . Next , scrunch the paper flower into a ball with your hand ! I know that I surprised many people when I did this at the workshop . It will look similar to the photo second from the right . Then you want to gently open the paper back up so that you can see the petals again . Play with it so that you give the flower a more dimensional look . You can see the difference between a flower that has been scrunched and one that has not in the first picture on left . Do this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now we will use the scalloped circle shape to make the next flower part . First you will need to cut the circle into a spiral shape as you see in the first two pictures on the left . Mist the paper with your water mister as we did earlier with the flower shapes . Starting in the centre of the circle , create a cone shape using the end of the paper and start rolling the paper tightly together until you get to the opposite end of the paper spiral ... see the second picture from the right . Set the paper down on your work surface and it will open up a bit ... if it is too tight you can play with it to open up a bit or if it is too big you can rewind it again to make it a little tigher . Set it aside and let it dry . <p> You will do the same technique on the three vintage text paper circles . <p> I posted a rolled paper flower tutorial using circle shapes on my blog a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . Basically , the plain circles will create rolled flowers with a straight edge ... the scallop circle will create rolled flowers with a scallop edge on a few of the outside layers of the flower . <p> Note : I drew a spiral on the circle so that you could get a better idea of what I mean when I say cut a spiral shape . If you want to use a pencil to draw your lines before you cut that is okay ... or just do as I do and cut away ! You do n't have to be perfect . <p> To attach the rhinestones to the top of your favor box you will need to use two-sided tape or glue dots . As you can see in the photos above , I used a single length of two sided tape and adhered it to the middle of the rhinestone strip . Then I attached the rhinestones to the box top as shown . You can do this step before or after you have attached the flowers to the top of the box ... I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutorial and did this step while I was waiting . <p> The last thing to do is assemble the flowers on top of the favor box top . <p> Please note that I am a mixed media artist and gel medium is my adhesive of choice . You could you could easily use white glue , mod podge or a hot glue gun on these last steps . <p> First you will want to adhere your two flower shapes together as in the top left picture . <p> Then you will add a generous amount of gel medium to the bottom of the scallop circle flower and place it on top of the first two flowers to form one large flower . <p> Use gel medium to attach this large flower to the box top as shown in the top right photo . <p> You will want to use the gel medium again to adhere the three vintage flowers beside the larger flower ... as you will see in the bottom left photo , I angled the flowers so that they were not all facing up . <p> The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the arrangement . I think that the tulle is a fun , unexpected element and where you put them is n't important ... just tuck them into two spots that look a little more open and make sure that the two pieces of tulle are not side by side . I simply folded the tulle in half twice and added a bit of gel medium to the folded corner . You can use a pencil or wooden stick to position the tulle into place . <p> The leaf can be used as a gift tag or escort card . In the kits I used paper that had a design on one side only so that you could easily write on the back . The leaf does not have to be glued to the favor top ... it will easily slip into place under the larger flower so that it can be removed . <p> As I said earlier , my next post will be about how to use the die cutter and paper punches to cut your own papers if you want to make a bunch of these yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store if you want to purchase a kit ... they are $5 each . <p> Please leave me a comment with your opinion/ideas on mini workshops and demos . I 'd love to hear from you whether you were able to attend or not . <h> Thursday , 1 March 2012 <p> If you have been to the new Creative Studio space in the Toronto store , chances are that you have already seen my " s'more " favor packaging ideas . I saw a similar idea with a square box on Pinterest a while ago and as soon as I saw the clear take out boxes I knew that I had to create my own version of this idea . <p> I stacked graham crackers , chocolate and large marshmellows in small clear take out boxes ? and used our new options labels , clean edge cards and assorted ribbons to decorate the containers . <p> I could see these favors being used at an outdoor wedding , a birthday party or beach get together at the cottage ... so it was hard for me to just create one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 2014 ... we no longer carry REX7 Options labels that these were created to print on . You can print these on our Sticker You blank sticker sheets . Cut out with circle paper punch or by hand with scissors . <p> I 've also included a download for the art without the circles so you can create whatever shape of label you would like . You can download the art here . <p> To decorate the first S'more favor I simply wrapped a red ribbon around the box , secured it in place with some two sided tape and then added my circle label to the front of the box . <p> When I was decorating this next favor I was inspired by our burlap ribbons and I thought that this favor would be perfect for an outdoor wedding or party ... ca n't you just see these at a reception in a barn ! I tied a variety of different coloured ribbons , twine and burlap together on the wire handle along with a gift tag . <p> This last S'more favor box was designed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about a summer birthday party at the cottage with the kids . I combined a custom label with some some funky scrapbooking papers here . I tied the papers to the wire handles using two pieces of ribbon . I have girls so I usually make things a little more " girly " when I am thinking about birthday parties but this could so easily be interpreted for a boy 's party if you used a different scrapbook paper and ribbon .

Today I am pulling together everything for our booth at the Total Wedding Show on January 17 to 19 , 2014 at the International Centre . <h> Tuesday , 24 December 2013 <p> After a very busy 2013 holiday season , all of the staff at Creative Bag are all looking forward to a couple of days off with families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish all of our loyal and creative customers a happy holiday . Thank you for a wonderful 2013 and we all look forward to working with you again in 2014 . <h> Thursday , 19 December 2013 <p> We carry lots of burlap products at Creative Bag all year round but this year we added a few extra holiday products that have been very popular . I thought that I 'd show you how I included some of our burlap products into my personal holiday decorating and gift wrapping projects . <p> Please note at this time of year , as holiday specific products sell out , items will be removed from our website . <p> Note : I have started to stock a number of our bakery boxes and different colours of baker 's twine in my pantry . I usually volunteer to make desserts for parties and family gatherings and these come in handy to package my baked goods . The bakery boxes are expensive and I do n't have to worry about finding dishes or plastic containers at the end of the event to take home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another fireplace mantle in my home .

These mini burlap stockings are the perfect size to hold a gift card and a sweet treat . I added one of our mini chalkboard clip tags to the stocking as a decorative element and to hold a gift tag ( not shown ) . If you add a magnet to the back of the chalkboard clip it can be used on the fridge later to display holiday cards . <p> Looking for more burlap products ?

We saw this amazing diy party kit in the Holiday issue of Food &amp; Drink that is available at LCBO stores in Ontario . I have to warn you that I have only been able to find these magazines in french lately because they tend to fly off the shelves quickly ! The diy project idea is by gift stylist extraordinaireCorinna vanGerwen . <p> Corinna shares a stylish way to get guests in the countdown mood with her little DIY kit and you can read about it on her blog . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter window boxes and white stationery boxes to create these kits .

They have a rich textured finish and look great just as they are with the simple white accent and rope handles . But if you are looking for a wine container to add a personal touch to for holiday gift giving these containers are perfect ! And I 've got a couple of diy packaging ideas for you ! <p> The red container was decorated with a small white sparkle tissue paper pom pom* that I attached to the lid using two sided tape . If you have been reading our blog for a while you may remember seeing the " Dear Santa " tag that I created as a free download last year . I punched two holes in the tag and used a white ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find my tutorial for making tissue paper pom poms here . Please note that to make this smaller pom pom I used 4 pieces of 10 " x 15 " sparkle tissue paper and opened all of the layers on the same side . <p> The black container is another one of my chalk marker experiments . And yes , as you can see , chalk markers work on these containers ! I created the vintage frame element in my chalk design by tracing around the " Dear Santa " tag . I added " cheers " inside the frame and added random snowflakes all over the rest of the container . I made the yellow paper bow using a download that I designed for Weddingbells magazine . <p> You can printable paper bow download and instructions here . The download is for two bows so I added the second bow to one of our black and white jewellery boxes . These boxes have a high gloss finish and are stunning .

( Hint hint to my family if you are reading this ! ) But did you know that you can use our cake stands as a part of your holiday packaging ! ! I guarantee when you walk in the door with this gift EVERYONE is going to be hoping they are on your holiday list this year . <p> In this holiday packaging project I combined one of our cake stands with two round boxes . I wanted to create an " elegant rustic " look so the burlap pattern on these boxes worked perfectly for me . We have an great assortment of colourful round boxes that will fit our cake stands and give you a completely different look ! You can use whatever decorative elements you want to work with your colours and theme or just use ribbon and no extra decorations for simpler version ! <p> Here 's what I did ... <p> a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top on the cake stand .

I also tied a piece of twine to the smaller box as a decorative detail . c I wanted to create a natural woodland theme to my packaging so I added a bird with a clip to the top of my " cake " . d The next layer down , I added a floral element on the left side . e The next layer down I added a small grouping of silver balls and burlap " leaves " on the right side to balance the floral element above.Here 's another look at my gift packaging .

@@44713421 @4713421/ <h> Friday , 19 June 2015 <h> pretty gift packaging for baby and free downloads <p> One of our custom services staff , Lynn , delivered a baby girl earlier this month . I designed a simple diy gift for baby Brittany using some of our gift boxes and our blank printable sticker sheets . You can recreate this gift yourself ( for personal use only ) by using my free download and the instructions below . <p> By the way , the download contains two colour versions - I 've only shown the pink version in this post . <p> I took many , many pictures of my daughters when they were little . Over the years , we have spent a lot of time looking through photo boxes to find pictures for school projects and to add into scrapbooks . As time passes , it has become difficult to remember how old the girls were in their photos . So with that in mind , I designed the first year photo stickers so Lynn could add the stickers to whatever Brittany is wearing on the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some onesies that matched the colours of the photo stickers and packaged them in a gift box that could be reused afterwards as a baby memory box . <p> Note : the printables include 12 " months " speech bubbles , a long packaging label for the photo sticker packaging and a label for the lid of the memory box that can be personalized . <p> The blank sticker sheets are easy to use on your home printer . Just remember to print " size as is " and not " size to fit " so that they print properly . I always do a test print on regular paper first to make sure that I do n't waste my sticker sheets . <p> Use scissors to cut the photo stickers as shown above . If you have a paper cutter , you may want to use it to cut the straight edge elements for the packaging labels . Use the crop marks on the art as a guide for cutting the labels . <p> The 12 " speech bubble " photo stickers are packaged in a white stationery box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the long packaging sticker is wrapped around one side of the box . Start the sticker on the clear lid and wrap it around the side and onto the back of the bottom box . You can see the label positioning in the next photo . <p> To gift wrap : Place 3 or 4 folded onesies into the kraft box and add the packaged first year photo stickers on top . Centre the memory box sticker label on the box lid . <p> Note : If you did not personalize the memory box label before printing , it can done later by hand using a fine sharpie marker . <p> The gift box takes on a new purpose afterwards as a memory box to hold baby photos and small objects . I thought that the custom sticker on top of the box was too pretty to cover with wrapping paper so I simply tied a ribbon to the box to finish .

It 's pretty , it 's artsy , and it 's one way among others , to make the most impersonal offerings - gift cards and electronics to name a couple - seem meaningful . <p> When I am wrapping a large number of gifts , I usually end up with a pile of wrapping paper scraps . Instead of send those pretty pieces of paper to the recycle bin , I use them to create these little gift tube packages . They are super easy to make , so dust off your sewing machine and get ready to WOW everyone with this unique gift packaging idea . <p> Here 's how I made them : <p> 1 . Cut wrapping paper into a 7 " x 6 " panel . On the back of the paper ( along one 6 " edge ) , place a 5 " piece of two-sided tape centred along the edge .

I 've been playing around with the concept of adding a little sparkle to our linen and cotton bags for Valentine 's Day and came up with a few ideas to share with you . <p> These adorable glitter hearts are a simple way to dress up fabric bags . Make the hearts as big as you want ... use one heart like I did or add a few to create a pattern. ! Just add a gift tag and you are ready to go ! If you are going to use these bags for candy or food products , I recommend using a smaller sized clear candy bag to contain the food before inserting it inside of the fabric bag of your choice . <p> I added a single band of glitter to the bottom of the linen and cotton bags pictured above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Total Wedding Show a few weeks ago and I thought that something like this would be cute on the bags with the glitter . You could use vintage buttons or brooches for a more vintage look ! <p> 2 . Tape off the area you want to add the glitter using painter 's tape.To create a perfect heart , I used a heart shaped paper punch and cut the heart out of a large sticker . Make sure that your tape/sticker is tight to the fabric so that the decoupage does not bleed underneath . <p> 3 . Using a paint brush , add decoupage to area that you want to add glitter . While the decoupage is still wet , sprinkle glitter to cover area completely . <p> 4 . Immediately remove the tape/sticker and allow to dry for a few hours . <p> 5 . When completely dry , add a top coat of decoupage over the glitter to stop the glitter from flaking off . <p> The great thing about this technique is that you can do it on glassware as well . I used the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the heart shape on the glass vase . The only difference with using the Martha Stewart decoupage on glass is that you want add 2 or 3 coats of decoupage over the glitter so that the glassware can be dishwasher safe ( after " curing " for 28 days ) . These glass containers would be nice for flowers , candles or as a candy container for a sweet table ! <p> You can add glitter to burlap as I did with this David Tutera burlap candle holder . I added a vintage brooch to mine to dress up the candle holder . We have one brooch available on line right now and a few more vintage style brooches will be arriving in time for spring/summer weddings . I 'll keep posted when they are available ! <p> Here 's one more look at my glittered linen favor bags .

Use them as a backdrop for sweet tables and photo booths , hang them on tables or above any area that needs to be highlighted . Use one garland or lots of garlands for added impact . <p> They are so easy to make and you do n't need to have any special tools to create them . <p> Here 's how I made mine ... <p> Gather your supplies . You will need tissue paper ( cut into 15 " x20 " sheets ) , scissors , glue ( any glue that works on paper ) , ruler and string for hanging . Clothespins are an option . <p> Fold a sheet of 15 " x20 " tissue in a half so that it is 15 " x10 " . You are going to cut fringes in the tissue a little less than 1/2 inch wide . You do n't want to cut all the way to the folded edge so I measure about 1.5 " down from the folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringes were all the same length . See my photo above . <p> Once you have cut all of the fringes , open the tissue paper up so that the uncut area is in the middle and you have fringes on either side . See photo above . If your tissue has a " front " and " back " you will want the " back " side facing up . <p> Starting at the bottom of the uncut middle section of the tissue , begin to roll the tissue paper to create your tassel . Continue to roll the centre section until you reach the top of the tissue paper . <p> Now you will twist and gently squeeze the solid section that we just rolled together . Your fringes were most likely twisted around as you were rolling in the last step - you can untangle them now so that they look like my photo above . <p> You will need to make a loop on your tassel for hanging . I like to add alittle bit of glue to hold the loop in place . Use any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist where you added the glue and hold tight for a minute while the glue dries . I like to use large clothespins to hold my loop in place while it dries so my hands are free and I can continue to work on making more tassels ! <p> Once all of your tassels have been made you can add them to a piece of twine , string or ribbon for hanging . You can make the string as long as you want . I like to place the tassels about 4 inches apart and tie each tassel in place on the string so that they do n't move around when I 'm hanging them . <p> Note : If you are using a bunch of colours , you may want to string them all in place before tying the tassels in place to make sure that you like the colour order and placement . <p> Your tassels may need to be smoothed out a bit once you have them in place .

Our 4oz quilted crystal jars with lid fit perfectly into the 4 " wide candy bags ... fill these jars with homemade sauces , jams or body scrubs for unique party favors . <p> These clear candy bags do not have to be used for just candies or food products . Here you can see that I packaged a number of craft materials in this bag . These bags and headers would be great for packaging customer orders if you have a small business doing home parties . There is space on the " thank you " side of the header to personalize the header with a handwritten note . <p> I hope that you will check out our clear candy bags the next time you are looking for interesting packaging supplies . <h> Wednesday , 6 March 2013 <p> I 've shown you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hung from the ceiling for a party or wedding here and these small tissue paper pom poms are just as easy to make . I just added a couple of extra steps so that you can insert or attach them to the bags . <p> You can use the tissue paper flower pom pom kits that we sell to create these and as you will see , you can add some patterned tissue paper to the kits to add a little pop ! <p> The first tissue paper pom pom that I 'm going to show you how to make has a spiky floral shape . I made this one so that it that can be tucked into a bag . <p> Start with 6 sheets of tissue paper that are 20 " by 15 " . <p> Accordion fold the tissue paper so that each fold is about 1 " wide . <p> Now fold the tissue in half as shown above and cut the tissue so that you have two stacks of folded tissue . We will be able to make two of these so put one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiky shape you will need to cut one end of the folded tissue paper into a point as shown ( above left ) . <p> You can see how the pointed ends will look as you fan out the tissue a little . <p> I use a wood stick or skewer to keep the tissue paper flower pom pom from falling out of the bag . Insert the wood stick into the middle of the folded tissue paper making sure that the wood stick is far enough into the bottom of the tissue paper that you can add a twist tie to hold everything in place ( above right ) . <p> Cover up the twist tie and add a decorative element to the pom pom by wrapping a long piece of ribbon over the twist tie - finish with a knot to keep in place . <p> Now you are ready to open the tissue paper layers just as we would have done with the tissue paper flower tutorial that I showed you here . Be careful as you open each layer that you do n't go too fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it it full . <p> You can insert the pom pom into a paper bag with the wood stick hidden inside and use the ribbon tied to the bag handle to keep everything in place as shown ( above right ) . <p> I used a long piece of ribbon on my pom pom so that I could tie a pretty bow on the bag handle . I gave you the free download for the thank you tags in this post in case you missed it ! I love using the May Arts paper twine on my hang tags because they are so easy to use and are available in so many colour options . <p> If you are looking for a fun variation to my tissue paper pom poms try adding a few pieces of patterned tissue paper . That 's what I did to create the tissue paper flower pom pom on the right ( above ) . I used three sheets of polka dot tissue paper and three sheets of white tissue paper - all tissue paper was 20 " x 15 " . To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here but when you open the tissue paper layers open the patterned tissue first so that it is in the centre of the flower . You want one side of the pom pom to be flat so open all layers of the tissue in the same direction . <p> The picture on the left ( above ) shows you what the finished polka dot pom pom will look like . You will want to hide the twist tie that was used to create your pom pom with a long piece of ribbon . This ribbon is more for decoration so make it long enough so that it will hang below the pom pom . I used the twist tie on the pom pom to attach the pom pom to the bag handle as you can see in the photo above ( right ) . <p> The nice thing about these tissue paper flower pom poms is that they can be reused if you store them so that they do not get crushed . <p> Do you like adding floral details to your packaging ?

@@44713453 @4713453/ <h> Tuesday , 25 September 2012 <h> diy tulle tutu tee shirt <p> I have been wanting to show you how to make one of these cute tulle tutu tee shirts for a while and thought that Halloween would be a good time to share this idea . My youngest daughter , Robyn , had one of these when she was 5 and she insisted on wearing it everyday for months ... <p> Here 's my little princess at age 5 ! Robyn is almost 13 and we still have the original tulle tutu tee shirt hanging in her bedroom . <p> What I loved about this is that the tulle tutu is sewn directly onto a plain white tank or tee shirt so it is one piece ! The tee shirt can be worn with a pair of shorts or pants depending on the weather . This is a great project for a Halloween costume for a child , teen or adult . But I can also see making these for all of the guests at a princess or dance themed birthday party . <p> Before I show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn you that this project involves sewing ! If you do n't like to sew please keep checking this blog because I will show you how to make a " no-sew tulle tutu " in the near future . <p> Note : 12 " wide tulle will also work for this project because we are folding the wider tulle . <p> 1 . Measure and cut tulle . First you will need to measure your tee shirt to find out how much tulle you will need to cut . The tulle will be sewn to the tee shirt at the waist so you need to measure the tee shirt in the waist area . If your tee shirt has a lot of stretch , try to stretch the fabric a bit when you are measuring . <p> I measured the front of my tee shirt ( 10 " ) and multiplied that number by 2 to get a total tee measurement of 20 " . You want your tulle to be very full so you need to double ( for me that was 40 " ) or triple ( again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on how full you want to go . I only doubled my tulle measurement for the sample I am showing you but I think that the next one I make will be tripled . <p> I used 18 " wider tulle and cut two pieces of tulle that measured 40 " each . <p> Note : If you are using 12 " wide tulle you will not fold the tulle . And you will need to cut 4 lengths of tulle not two . <p> If you are using the wider tulle as I am you will need to fold your tulle in half length wise to find your centre point . I found it helpful to use a quick disappearing ink fabric marker to draw a line on the fold of the tulle . Pin the two layers of tulle together . If you are using four pieces of 12 " tulle , you do not fold the tulle - but you can pin the tulle layers together at this point . <p> 2 . You will need to sew the layers of tulle together so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this with two rows of thread but I found that by using a heavier weight , brightly coloured thread on the tulle that I only needed one row of stitching . This thread will be removed at the end of the project so by using a bright colour it will be easier to see . If you use your sewing machine for this step ( which I did ) use the largest straight stitch you can . Stitch directly on top of the line ( middle point of the tulle ) that you just drew with the fabric marker . <p> Note : 12 " tulle will need to be sewn about 1/2 " from the top of the tulle to create your gathering stitches . <p> 3 . In photo three , you can see that I have gathered the tulle . To create the gathers I pulled the top thread so that the tulle would pucker . You want to do this with the thread so that the tulle is evenly gathered . Be very careful not to break the thread as you are pulling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tulle along the stitching will be the measurement of your tee shirt ( for me that was 20 " ) . Knot the brightly coloured threads at each end when you reach the required length so that the gathers will stay in place . You may need to go along the stitching to make sure that the gathers are evenly spaced . <p> 4 . Now the tulle is ready to be sewn onto the tee shirt . I found it easier to mark on the tee shirt where I was going to sew using the fabric marker . Remember the tulle is going to start at the waist area . Now line up the tulle so that the brightly coloured stitching for the gathers lines up with the line you drew on the tee shirt . You will want to start at the middle front of the tee shirt and line up the middle of the tulle . The two ends of the tulle will end up at the centre back of the tee . You will have to carefully pin the tulle to the tee remembering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once the tulle is pinned in place and you are happy with the way that the tulle is gathered it is time to do the final sewing . This time you will use a white thread so that your stitching is not seen . Stitch using a normal stretch stitch setting on your sewing machine and stitch right on top of the coloured thread . <p> 6 . Once you have finished sewing you will need to carefully remove the coloured thread with a seam ripper or pin . And now your tulle tutu tee shirt is ready to be worn ! <p> As I said at the beginning of this post ... I think that this would be sweet as part of a girl 's Halloween costume . <p> There are still about 15 seats available for the Halloween workshop that I will be hosting on Thursday October 4th , 2012 at the Toronto Creative Bag store .

@@44713458 @4713458/ <h> Thursday , 28 March 2013 <h> Tissue Paper Tassel Garland Tutorial <p> Tissue paper tassel garlands make beautiful wedding and party decorations . Use them as a backdrop for sweet tables and photo booths , hang them on tables or above any area that needs to be highlighted . Use one garland or lots of garlands for added impact . <p> They are so easy to make and you do n't need to have any special tools to create them . <p> Here 's how I made mine ... <p> Gather your supplies . You will need tissue paper ( cut into 15 " x20 " sheets ) , scissors , glue ( any glue that works on paper ) , ruler and string for hanging . Clothespins are an option . <p> Fold a sheet of 15 " x20 " tissue in a half so that it is 15 " x10 " . You are going to cut fringes in the tissue a little less than 1/2 inch wide . You do n't want to cut all the way to the folded edge so I measure about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crease so that my fringes were all the same length . See my photo above . <p> Once you have cut all of the fringes , open the tissue paper up so that the uncut area is in the middle and you have fringes on either side . See photo above . If your tissue has a " front " and " back " you will want the " back " side facing up . <p> Starting at the bottom of the uncut middle section of the tissue , begin to roll the tissue paper to create your tassel . Continue to roll the centre section until you reach the top of the tissue paper . <p> Now you will twist and gently squeeze the solid section that we just rolled together . Your fringes were most likely twisted around as you were rolling in the last step - you can untangle them now so that they look like my photo above . <p> You will need to make a loop on your tassel for hanging . I like to add alittle bit of glue to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and dries quickly ... <p> twist where you added the glue and hold tight for a minute while the glue dries . I like to use large clothespins to hold my loop in place while it dries so my hands are free and I can continue to work on making more tassels ! <p> Once all of your tassels have been made you can add them to a piece of twine , string or ribbon for hanging . You can make the string as long as you want . I like to place the tassels about 4 inches apart and tie each tassel in place on the string so that they do n't move around when I 'm hanging them . <p> Note : If you are using a bunch of colours , you may want to string them all in place before tying the tassels in place to make sure that you like the colour order and placement . <p> Your tassels may need to be smoothed out a bit once you have them in place . If you plan to make a bunch of these to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will not be crushed or ripped . <p> I will be making these tissue paper tassels with everyone at a special Creative Evening Wedding Workshop at Creative Bag in Mississauga on Thursday April 11th , 2013 . This is a special evening for brides and their guests . Everyone will make a couple of diy wedding projects and I will be showing samples of our beautiful personalized wedding products that can be ordered online here .

I 've talked to so many customers in our stores these past two weeks looking for ideas for weddings , bridal showers , anniversaries , baby showers and birthdays . <p> Let 's gather our supplies : push pop containers , spray paint ( in colour of your choice ) , confetti ( I 'll show you how to make your own in a minute ! ) , download and print the labels . I printed my labels on blank sticker sheets - you could also print on white text paper and use two-sided tape to adhere them to the push pop containers . <p> Note : You do n't have to spray paint the push pop containers - this step is optional . <p> Spray paint the stick and inside element of the push pop container to add a pop of colour but keep in mind that if you paint the push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for food . <p> It will take a number of coats paint to completely cover the plastic - take your time so that you do n't get any drips and allow the paint to dry COMPLETELY between coats . <p> Assemble the push pop container pieces and add the label as shown above .

Push the confetti down into the container so that you can easily add the lid . <p> Give the container a shake so that the confetti will expand into the open space under the lid . <p> You can buy premade confetti if you want , but it 's really easy to make your own and I 'm going to show you how I made mine . <p> When you make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit your party . White and gold confetti would be great for a wedding . Having a baby ? Use pink or blue confetti for a gender reveal party or photo shoot .

Cut the bottom edge with the fringe scissors and then cut the fringes again to create little squares . Do n't have fringe cutters ? Use regular scissors ... it just takes a little longer to cut ! <p> Our paper and mylar sizzle makes awesome confetti . And best of all - no special tools are required - just a pair of scissors . Bunch the sizzle into long strands and cut it into smaller pieces . <p> You can create confetti using small paper punches and paper scraps .

Use Christmas ornaments to as a decorative element in your gift wrapping . This is so much easier than trying to tie big elaborate bows and after the gift has been opened the ornament can be hung on the Christmas tree . This is a great tradition to start with young children , family and friends . I especially love ornaments that you can add a picture . Visit our stores for holiday ornaments ... they wo n't last long so visit soon . <p> 2 . Spend a little extra time gift wrapping gift cards . Think outside of the box or should I say the standard envelope that comes with most gift cards . We have lots of tin containers , card holders and bags that will can be used with gift cards . Dress them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them extra special this holiday season . You can find my free downloads for the tin gift card holders in this post here . <p> 3 . Keep some holiday themed pipe cleaners on hand to use in your gift wrapping . Twist the pipe cleaners into letters and use them as gift tags or decorative ornaments . Bend them into candy cane shapes or Dr. Seuss like swirls to use as accents . I used small left over pieces of paper straws from my paper straw wreathe project and pipe cleaners to create snowflake ornaments . We still have pipe cleaners in our stores but they wo n't last for long ! <p> 4 . If you have ever been to one of my Creative Evening workshops you know that I love using clothespins to attach decorative elements and gift tags to bags and boxes . You can paint clothespins , decorated them with glitter tape or leave them natural . I use E-6000 glue to attach small decorative elements to clothespins . We have assorted sizes of clothespins in our stores . E-6000 glue and glitter tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store only . <p> 5 . This is my favourite gift wrapping suggestion and one that I have used for the past few years . I use photos of my daughters and cut them into different shapes to use as gift tags . I use one picture for each person and print copies that I can easily cut out with paper punches or scissors . We have a few paper punches at the Toronto store in the Creative Studio space - I 'm using the one that looks like a gift tag shape this year !

I added some cream cheese and fresh fruit to make these as yummy to look at as they were to eat . <p> Saturday : Chicken sliders with pretzels for lunch . Got ta love mini sliders ... they are so easy to store in the freezer and when you present them in these wood serving boats they make last minute entertaining a breeze . <p> I loved how natural the serving boats look and although they are disposable , I was easily able to wipe them out and reuse them if they were originally used to contain food items like chips and candies that were not messy . <p> The wood serving boats looked fabulous with our mason jars ( available in stores only ) , daisy mason jar lids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mason jar glasses just as much as the kids . <p> Just in case you are wondering how I made the cookie cutter sandwiches ... here 's my tricks and tips ... <p> I used a star cookie cutter but you can use any shape you want .

I usually cut all of the sandwich elements ( bread , cheese , etc ) separately so I do n't waste any food . ( Who am I kidding ? The kids and I eat all of the food scraps while we are preparing these ! ! ) Assemble each sandwich as you wish using the cut out shapes . <p> One tip that I do have is that many cold meats do n't cut well unless the meat is thick ... so I will cut the cold meats in between two slices of bread as shown in photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to use the cookie cutter for every layer of your sandwich . Bacon and a little bit of lettuce would look great sticking out of a " turkey , cheese , bacon , tomato and lettuce sandwich " ... Yum ! ! <p> Another tip : If you are using spreadable foods such as peanut butter , jam , etc add them to the cookie cutter bread shapes instead of making the sandwich and trying to cut it out like I did with the cold meats . It will save you time cleaning the cookie cutters in between each cut . <p> To make the veggie garnishes on the bamboo skewers I try to arrange the veggies so that the veggies stay in place on the skewers . You can see that I " tied " a piece of carrot ( I used a veggie peeler to create the long thin pieces of carrot ) between the cucumber and grape tomato .

Inside each bag , you can add a candy , small toy or notes with activities to do that day ... like baking cookies , go to a movie , you get the idea . The bags are hung on a large wood canvas with clothespins . Sounds easy ? It is . Follow along if you want my detailed instructions .... <p> 2 . Paint the wood canvas with the chalkboard paint .

I used a red ribbon with a white stitch like detail ... you may want to select something that suits your home decor . I tied a simple knot with the ribbon to secure it to one side of the clothespin by the spring and cut the ends of the ribbon on an angle . <p> 10 .

I have been making lots of dry snow globes to decorate my home for the holidays . It occurred to me that I could create dry snow globe using our clear tin pails and by inserting a gift card sandwiched between two gift tags , the snow globe pails becomes unique gift packaging ! ! After the <p> gift card is removed the container becomes a decoration that can be displayed every year . <p> Note : As of this morning , we still have a few of the white bottle brush trees at our Toronto store in the Creative Studio but they are almost sold out . <p> My tree was a little to big for the tin container so I took the base of the tree off and used wire cutters to remove some of the bristles on the bottom of the tree . You will also have to cut the wire stem before you put the tree base back on . I glued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted my trees to have a vintage feeling so I added sliver glitter using gel medium . We sell Wendy Addison 's German Silver Pure Glass Glitter in the Toronto Store . You only have to add a little gel medium to the tips of the trees . Work quickly once you have added the gel medium and sprinkle the glass glitter all over . <p> Tip : I put my glitter into salt shakers because it gives me better control of the glitter . I also sprinkle the glitter over a container to keep the mess to a minimum and so that I can put the excess glitter back into the salt shaker . <p> I used our #5 kraft tags and cut them to size so they fit inside the tin container . You 'll need two tags if you want to hide the gift card - one for the front and one for the back . I used stamps and distress ink ( all available in the Toronto store ) to decorate and age the tags . <p> Then I used two sided tape to attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags . More two sided tape was used at the top of one tags to join the two tags . Then a ribbon was tie to the top of the tag so that it would be easy to pull the tags/gift card out of the container . <p> Once the gift tags is complete and the glittered tree is dry you can position them both inside of the tin container . The tree will have to be off centred to make room for the tag . Use E-6000 glue to keep the tree in place on the bottom of the container . Once the glue is dry you are ready to add the snow glitter . You only need the white snow glitter to cover the bottom of the container and part of the base of the tree . Now , place the tag/gift card back into the container behind the tree . <p> I decorated the lid of the container using kraft paper , stamps and distress ink ... similar to what I did on the tags inside the container . You could cut wrapping paper or scrapbooking paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pail on one side with assorted ribbons as you can see above .

I also added a vintage paper detail inside the container ... it is the definition of " snow " from an old dictionary . <p> Tip : If you are not going to be present when the gift is being opened , you may want to write on the back of the gift tag explaining that they are to open the container and take out the tag to find a surprise . <p> These are so easy to make and I guarantee whoever receives one of these will think they are very special to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making dry snow globes for Christmas decorating , you can visit my personal blog here for another snow globe project .

Use white chalk markers to write words like I did or doodle a design on your pumpkin .

I think that it would be too stressful to have to come up with 12 different ways to decorate the boxes so I decided to create three different designs ... <p> and I think that it would be easy to repeat these designs with the other boxes .

A brad ( not included in the kit ) was used to hold all of the paper petals and lace together . <p> I also used the brad to attach the flower to one of the ribbons that was wrapped around the box . <p> Gift tags were not included in the kit but it would be very easy to add small vintage looking manilla shipping tags to these favors .

@@44713480 @4713480/ <h> Friday , 12 October 2012 <h> bitty bag packaging inspiration for cookies <p> Here 's a fun way to package cookies using our bitty bags . I have given all of my examples a Halloween theme but the basic concept can easily be adapted to suit any party , shower or wedding theme . <p> I used one of the Martha Stewart All Over the Page paper punches to create a cut out on one side of the bag ! By packaging a large cookie ( or a few small cookies ) inside of a lip and tape bag and inserting it into the bitty bag the cookie will stay fresh longer . <p> Next you want to position the all over the page paper punch so that it is where you want your hole . Place the bottom half of the paper punch inside the bag so that you will cut a hole on one side of the bag ( as shown above ) . The paper punch is magnetic so it stays in place while you are punching . <p> Now you are ready to package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peel off the protective strip and fold over the opening to close . I love these bags because you can reposition the adhesive edge if you did n't get it quite right the first time . Insert this package into the bitty bag and you are ready to decorate your bitty bags . <p> To make the Halloween moon and bat : Cut a large circle from a scrap piece of orange paper . Position your circle near the top of the bitty bag and off to one side . Use your hole punch to create two holes off to one side of the orange circle as shown above - making sure that you go through both layers of the bitty bag . Now you are ready to add your ribbon ! Thread the ribbon through the two circles as shown above . <p> To make the ribbon " bat " you will need to tie a knot and cut the two ends on an angle as shown to form the bat shaped wings . <p> And we 're done ! Super easy and it would take very little time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This time I used a different all over the page punch shape . I decorated the top of the bag with a piece of my bag header art that I created for you to download here . I added a piece of black glitter tape at the bottom of the art as a decorative element and I used orange thread on my sewing machine to seal the bitty bag . <p> Here 's another picture of the bitty bag with some other Halloween projects that I have shown you already ... the blackboard painted pumpkins and witches ' feet cupcake decorations . The spooky glass was made by cutting black glitter tape into eye shapes . If you serve orange beverages in the glass they look like pumpkins ... milk will look like ghosts ! <p> I think that all of these would all look great on a Halloween themed sweet table . <p> BTW ...

@@44713482 @4713482/ <h> Thursday , 3 May 2012 <h> Lauren and Adam 's wedding project no. 1 <p> Last week I told you that I was working on some projects for Lauren and Adams wedding and I 'm excited to share with you the first project that we worked on for the reception . <p> Lauren wanted to have a sweetheart table instead of a head table and to decorate the table we decided to create a canvas banner with their initials . <p> The sweetheart table will be round and we are going to set up two more round tables on either side of the sweetheart table with similar canvas banners . One table will be for the wedding cake sweet and the other table will be for the gift card holder xoxo . <p> I 've been pinning pictures of sweetheart tables on my Pinterest boards in case you are getting married and looking for sweetheart tables inspiration as well . <p> Above are a couple of my favourite pictures of sweetheart tables that I have pinned . <p> Sweetheart tables allow you and your partner to spend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and friends . Just like a head table , you will want to add some extra special elements to your sweetheart table to make it stand out from the rest . <p> Here 's a quick tutorial for how I created the canvas banners for Lauren and Adam ... <p> 2 . I created the letters for the banner on my computer and printed them on a sheet of transfer paper on my inkjet printer . The font that I used is called Antique Shop . It is not a free font but here 's the link if you are interested . I 've shown you how to use the iron on transfers on a previous posts here or you can refer to the instruction sheet included in the iron on package . Make sure that your letters print out in REVERSE . <p> 3 . You will need to cut out each letter before you can iron the letters onto the canvas . Make sure that you leave a white space around each letter . I wanted to position the letters on the banners so that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick row of lace ribbon . To help me position the letters , I used natural light and a window to see each letter through the transfer paper . Iron each letter as per my previous post . <p> 4 . Peel the paper back off the transfer once the paper has cooled down a bit . <p> 5 . To attach the lace ribbon to the top of each banner you can either sew it on by machine , sew it on by hand , glue it on with fabric glue or use a two-sided fabric tape . I think that the two-sided fabric tape will be the best way to go if you do n't like to sew and we will have two-side fabric tape in the Toronto store in a week or two . <p> 6 . Once all of the banners have the lace ribbon attached you are ready to 7. tie the banners together with jute rope . You will want to add extra long pieces of jute rope to each end so that when it comes time to hang these up you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of Lauren and Adam 's banner for their sweetheart table . <p> In my previous post , I gave you an iron on transfer design to decorate a canvas bag . On the side of the iron on are the letters to spell LOVE . Use those letters to create this banner ... <p> I think that this would be cute for engagement or wedding photos ... you can see similar banners in use in photos I 've pinned to this Pinterest board . <p> I can see this " love " banner at a baby shower and then again at baby 's first birthday party . <p> I 'm going to show you how to make the letters on these banners pop and sparkle using glossy accents and glitter later this month ... so stay tuned for more !

@@44713487 @4713487/ <h> Saturday , 14 July 2012 <h> diy stationery inspiration using our stationery kits <p> We stock these items in the wedding section but I want to show you that the papers in these kits can be used for more than just wedding invitations . It is very easy to customize these papers using your printer , some embellishments and your imagination . <p> Here 's how I created the samples shown above using my home computer &amp; printer : <p> ADDING YOUR TEXT <p> On my computer , I prepare all of my type in a document that is sized to fit the stationery paper I will be printing on . I work in Photoshop and Illustrator but you can do this in the software of your choice . <p> Tip : To make sure that all of your type is set to fit within the blank space of the invitation , set your margins and leave 1/2 " of white space between the stationery design and your text . <p> Once I am happy with my text , I save the art and open a new 8.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art to the new document and position the art so that it will fit in the top left corner . I do that so that I can easily line up the invitation papers . <p> 2 . Then I use a light source to make sure that I am happy with the invitation set up and positioning of the text . You should be able to see through the papers and get a good idea of final placement ... see #2 above . If you do n't like what you see ... go back to the computer and modify your text . If you are good to go , add a few small pieces of masking tape ( or painter 's tape ) to the edge of the stationery to hold it in place against the bond paper for printing . <p> 3 . Manually feed the combined papers through your printer . Carefully remove the tape from the invitation so that you do not tear the paper and admire your work ! ! You can continue to print more invitations using the same bond paper . <p> Keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the font(s) will set the tone for your event . We have stationery designs that are very elaborate like the letterpress sample shown above in pink and brown but we also carry designs that are less ornate and can be customized to fit many different themes . <p> You can customize your stationery using embellishments . Our new resin flowers are perfect for wedding stationery . They are available in three different sizes and lot of colours . In the sample above I knew that I would be adding the resin to the top of the stationery so I positioned the text with that in mind . <p> Tip : I used Inkssentials Glossy Accents ( available in the Toronto store 's Creative Studio space ) to adhere the resin flowers to the paper and know that it works well . I would suggest that you test whatever glue you want to use to make sure that the resin bonds smoothly to the paper before you do too many invitations . <p> So here is the same stationery kit paper but this time I used it to create menus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just invitations ? And because this would not be sent in the mail , I used one of our large resin flowers to decorate this piece . <p> Everyone knows that the smaller cards in the stationery kit can be used as reply cards ... but that is not the only thing that they can be used for ! How about creating your own " save the dates " as I did ! ! A small resin flower was added to this sample . <p> To create table numbers , I would use either the large or the small ( as seen above ) stationery . In my sample above , I designed the art so that a small resin flower could be positioned on top ... which is a good idea if you have someone helping you to assemble a lot of these because they will know exactly where to place the embellishment . <p> The sample above was created for a birthday party . It was embellished using a resin flower and satin ribbon . I was able to add the ribbon by using a tool called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy tool in my next post . You can view a tutorial for using this tool from We R Memory Keepers here ... <p> We sell the Sew Ribbon Tool in the Creative Studio at the Toronto store . <p> Here 's one last project that I wanted to share with you . This time I created a little home decor item using the letterpress stationery . I knew that I wanted to add a resin flower to this piece , so after printing the quote , I used two sided tape to adhere the paper to the glass of a picture frame .

Basically , it is a flash mob " dinner " and everyone is dressed in white and the tables are decorated in white . <p> We have so many different whites and I decided to combine them all from pure white to antique white .
