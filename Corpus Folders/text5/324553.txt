These restrictions take effect on the calendar date October 3 , 2015 , regardless of whether an application has been received on that date . These activities include : <p> Imposing fees on a consumer before the consumer has received the Loan Estimate and <p> The consumer has indicated an intent to proceed with the transaction . <p> Providing written estimates of terms or costs specific to consumers before they receive the Loan Estimate without a written statement informing the consumer that the terms and costs may change . <p> Requiring the submission of documents verifying information related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : Can a loan originator email a Loan Estimate to a borrower ? <p> A : Yes ; as long as the borrower has given their consent and the other specific requirements under the ESIGN Act have been met . <p> Q : If you are emailing and there are two consumers , is emailing to one email considered sufficient ? <p> A : There are different rules for each document provided . They are as follows : <p> Loan Estimate : If there is more than one consumer then the Loan Estimate may be provided to any consumer who is primarily liable on the obligation . If one consumer is merely a surety or guarantor then the Loan Estimate must be given to the principal debtor . <p> Closing Disclosure : In contrast to disclosure of the Loan Estimate the Closing Disclosure must be provided to each consumer who has the right to rescind in rescindable transactions .

If a GFE was disclosed prior to October 3 , 2015 , a HUD-1 and final TIL will be required . <p> LOAN ESTIMATE ( LE ) : <p> Q:When is the Loan Estimate required to be disclosed ? <p> A : A Loan Estimate must be issued no later than three business days after receiving an application or information sufficient to complete an application . Note above the new definition of an application . <p> Q : If a loan contains mortgage insurance that is paid by the lender ( LPMI ) and will not be charged separately to the borrower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A : No , because the LPMI has already been captured in the interest rate and is not charged separately to the borrower , it is not disclosed on the Loan Estimate .

If the creditor is unknown , is the broker required to generate and disclose a unique I 'd number ? <p> A : No . A broker would not be required to generate and disclose its own unique loan I 'd on a Loan Estimate , and assuming the creditors unique I 'd is not available to the broker , the disclosure may be left blank . The loan I 'd number must be a unique identifier that should be determined by the creditor , and must remain the same throughout the loan transaction . <p> Q : Can a revised Loan Estimate be provided to the consumer once a Closing Disclosure has been delivered ? <p> A : No . The Loan Estimate must not be provided after the Closing Disclosure has been provided to the consumer . <p> Q : Section 1026.37(a) ( 12 ) indicates that the creditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditor is unknown , is the creditor required to disclose its own unique loan I 'd once there is a creditor for the loan ? <p> A : Yes . The creditor is required to include a unique loan I 'd on any subsequent disclosures it provides , such as revised Loan Estimates or the Closing Disclosure . The creditor is ultimately responsible for the disclosures and that includes providing its own unique loan I 'd . <p> Q : If a creditor charges an origination fee that is a percentage of the loan amount , but it is not a " point paid to the creditor to reduce the interest rate , " may the creditor identify it as a point in some way to preserve its tax deductibility for the consumer ? <p> A : No . Section 1026.37(f) ( 1 ) ( i ) provides that only points paid to the creditor to reduce the interest rate may be labeled as points . The Loan Estimate form is meant to provide accurate disclosures to consumers , not to document eligibility for tax benefits or other purposes . <p> Q : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A : Points paid to the creditor to reduce the interest rate must be disclosed as a separate line item on page two under Origination Charges . They must also be listed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of the loan amount . Discount points used to pay for Loan Level Pricing Adjustment assessed on the lender must be itemized separately . <p> A : The adjustable payments table ( APT ) is used only when there are adjustable payment features . If there are no such features in the legal obligation the APT table is not disclosed . Accordingly , the APT table will only be disclosed if the fixed rate loan has adjustable payment features . The adjustable interest rate ( AIR ) table is only disclosed when interest rates can change , which would be contrary to the definition of a fixed rate loan . Therefore , the AIR table should never be disclosed with a fixed rate loan . <p> Q : Is the consumer required to sign the Loan Estimate ? <p> A : No . The signature statement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature statement can be utilized as alternative documentation to prove receipt of the Loan Estimate prior to the three business day presumption . FCM will require the use of the signature statement . It is important to remember , a signature on the Loan Estimate does not constitute an intent to proceed by the borrower . <p> Q : What is listed in the " Other Considerations " section of the Loan Estimate ? <p> A : This section contains some initial required disclosures such as Right to Receive Appraisal and Servicing . This may be used in lieu of separate disclosures provided the Loan Estimate has been completed and disclosed with the model form verbiage under the rule . <p> Q : Does the creditor have to disclose an itemization of the amount financed with the Loan Estimate ? <p> A : No . A creditor would not disclose an itemization of the amount financed with the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure . The CFPB also advised that some disclosures are required to be made only on the Closing Disclosure and not the Loan Estimate . These include some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financed and the finance charge . These disclosures are required to be on the Closing Disclosure pursuant to sections 1026.38(o) ( 2 ) and ( o ) ( 3 ) , but are not required to be included on the Loan Estimate . However , note that even for the Closing Disclosure , the amount financed is not itemized . Section 1026.38(o) ( 3 ) requires that only the amount financed itself ( which is calculated in accordance with section 1026.18(b) ) be disclosed <p> Q : When the sale price of the property is not yet known , does the creditor disclose a label other than " sale price " for the sale price on the Loan Estimate ? <p> A : No . The label should state the sale price , and the label does not change when the creditor uses an estimated sales price as described in commentary section 1026.37(a) ( 7 ) -1 . For transactions without a seller , such as a refinance , because there is no sale , the estimated value of the property is disclosed in place of the sales price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbreviated as " prop . " <p> Q : If owners title insurance is not required by the creditor is it subject to the 10% cumulative tolerance ? <p> A : No . Owners title insurance not required by the creditor is not subject to the 10% cumulative tolerance . The CFPB is aware that the preamble to the final rule contains potentially conflicting language , but advises that the final rule text is what should be followed . Under 1026.19(e) ( 3 ) ( ii ) , the 10% cumulative tolerance category includes recording fees and charges paid to unaffiliated third party service providers when the consumer is permitted to shop for a settlement service provider , but chooses a provider from the creditors written list of providers . Owners title insurance is not a charge that is assigned to a particular tolerance category . Therefore , the applicable tolerance category depends on other factors , including whether the creditor requires the insurance and , if so , whether the consumer may shop for the provider of the insurance . To the extent owners title insurance is not required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the rule the insurance is not subject to any percentage tolerance limitation , even if paid to an affiliate of the creditor . <p> Q : Does a creditor have to show an appraisal fee ( or other fee ) paid to a third party on the Loan Estimate even if the creditor wants to cover 100% of the fee ? <p> A : Yes . The creditor must list all required third party services on the Loan Estimate regardless of whether the charge is paid by the borrower , seller , creditor , or any other party . <p> Q : Is the creditor required to disclose on the Loan Estimate that it will be transferring servicing even if the transfer is not immediate , but will happen at some later point in time during the life of the loan ? In the case that the servicing is being transferred to the creditors subsidiary or affiliate , is it still require ? <p> A1 : Yes . The creditor must disclose on the Loan Estimate that it will transfer servicing if the creditors intent at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point during the life of the loan . Section 1026.37(m) ( 6 ) requires disclosure of a statement of when the creditor intends to service the loan or transfer the loan to another servicer . This means that a creditor is required to disclose whether it intends to service the loan directly or transfer servicing to another servicer at any time after consummation . A creditor complies with the rule if the disclosure reflects the creditors intent at the time the Loan Estimate is issued . <p> A2 : Yes . The creditor must disclose that it will transfer servicing , even if the transfer will be to a subsidiary or affiliate , if that is the creditors intent at the time the Loan Estimate is issued . As with the previous question , Section 1026.37(m) ( 6 ) requires a creditor to disclose a statement of whether the creditor intends to service the loan directly or transfer servicing to another servicer . A creditors subsidiary or affiliate is another servicer for the purposes of this requirement if it is a person responsible for receiving scheduled periodic payments from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Q : The borrower chooses a settlement service that is not on the written list , does the tolerance apply ? <p> A : No , if the borrower chooses a settlement service provider that is not on the written list of providers , the amount paid for that service is not subject to a tolerance , so long as the service provider is not an affiliate of the creditor/mortgage broker . <p> Q : Is the borrower required to select a settlement service provider from the written list of settlement service providers ? <p> A : No . If the borrower is permitted to shop for a settlement service provider , the borrower may choose a qualified provider that is not on the provided written list . <p> Q : At what point does the written list of service providers need to be provided ? <p> A : When the borrower is permitted to shop for third-party settlement services , the written list of services providers must be provided with the Loan Estimate , on a separate sheet of paper . <p> Q : May a loan originator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originator is not endorsing the quality of a settlement service providers service ? <p> A : Yes , the loan originator may include a statement on the written list that the listing of a service provider on the written list does not constitute an endorsement of that service provider . <p> Q : The borrower chooses to use a provider identified on the written list , is the lender subject to tolerances for those services ? <p> A : Yes , the lender is subject to the tolerances for the services in which the borrower chooses to use the identified provider . <p> Q : In lieu of providing the written list of providers , may the loan originator disclose to the borrower that if they specifically wish to shop for their own provider , but have difficulty finding a provider for a service at the disclosed price that they may contact the loan originator to ask the loan originator to identify a provider ? <p> A : No . Where a loan originator permits a borrower to shop for third party settlement services , the loan originator must provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of the Loan Estimate , on a separate sheet of paper . <p> CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE : <p> Q : If a Loan Estimate has been provided and the interest rate has not been locked , can the creditor provide a revised Loan Estimate when the borrower later locks the interest rate ? <p> A : Yes , if a borrower locks the interest rate after the Loan Estimate has been issued , a revised Loan Estimate must be issued within 3 days of the interest lock reflecting the date that the interest rate lock is good through . Any interest rate-dependent charges and terms that changed must also be updated on the revised Loan Estimate . <p> Q : Would the discovery of additional documents ( such as releases ) that must be recorded causing an increase in government recording fees be considered a changed circumstance allowing the loan originator to provide a revised Loan Estimate ? <p> A : The discovery of previously undisclosed circumstances affecting settlement costs such as unreleased liens could be considered a changed circumstance . A loan originator may choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from the changed circumstance or may choose not to reissue a Loan Estimate if the increase is minimal . If the loan originator chooses to issue a revised Loan Estimate , only the increase in recording fees may change on the Loan Estimate : all other charges must remain the same . <p> Q : Once a rate is locked , how many days does the loan originator have to issue a revised Loan Estimate for the initial rate lock ? <p> A : A revised Loan Estimate must be provided within three business days of the Lock Date . <p> Q : Once a Loan Estimate is issued , what if any , circumstances under are there which the loan terms or charges can change ? <p> A : The terms or charges can change in the event that there are changed circumstances.Changed circumstances is defined as : <p> ( 1 ) Acts of God , war , disaster , or other emergency ; <p> ( 2 ) Information particular to the borrower or transaction that was relied on in providing the Loan Estimate and that changes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been provided , which information may include information about the credit quality of the borrower , the amount of the loan , the estimated value of the property , or any other information that was used in providing the <p> Loan Estimate ; <p> ( 3 ) New information particular to the borrower or transaction that was not relied on in providing the Loan Estimate ; or <p> ( 4 ) Other circumstances that are particular to the borrower or transaction , including boundary disputes , the need for flood insurance , or environmental problems . <p> None of the information collected by the loan originator prior to issuing the Loan Estimate may later become the basis for a changed circumstance upon which a loan originator may offer a revised Loan Estimate , unless the loan originator can demonstrate that there was a change in the particular information or that it was inaccurate , or that the loan originator did not rely on that particular information in issuing the Loan Estimate . In addition , the loan originator is presumed to have relied on the borrowers name , the borrowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the property , the mortgage loan amount sought , and any information contained in any credit report obtained by the loan originator before providing the Loan Estimate . The loan originator can not base a revision of the Loan Estimate on this information , unless it changed or is later found to be inaccurate . <p> Q : There is a changed circumstance on the loan , when does the loan originator issue a new Loan Estimate ? <p> A : When there is a changed circumstance and the loan originator intends to issue a revised Loan Estimate , the loan originator must do so within three business days of receiving the information sufficient to establish changed circumstances . A loan originator may only issue a revised Loan Estimate reflecting the increased charges resulting from the changed circumstance . <p> Q : What charges can change before the interest rate is locked ? <p> A : With the exception of interest rate-dependent charges and terms , the charges and terms for all settlement services on the Loan Estimate must be available for 10 business days from when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of time as the loan originator provides . The interest rate-dependent charges and terms can not change before the expiration of the period indicated by the loan originator . <p> Q : If a Loan Estimate is revised to reflect a changed circumstance , may other charges on the Loan Estimate change to reflect market fluctuations ? <p> A : No . A Loan Estimate may not be revised to reflect market fluctuations . <p> CLOSING DISCLOSURE ( CD ) : <p> Q : How is consummation defined under the Rule ? <p> A : Regulation Z defines consummation as : " the time that a consumer becomes contractually obligated on a credit transaction . See 12 CFR 1026.2(a) ( 13 ) . The Commentary to Regulation Z states further that the point at which a " contractual obligation is created " is a matter of state law . 12 CFR 1026.2(a) ( 13 ) -2 . <p> Q : What are the timing requirements associated with the Closing Disclosure ? <p> A : <p> ( i ) The Closing Disclosure must be received no later than three business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Closing Disclosure must be made available to the consumer one business day prior to consummation if requested by the consumer . <p> ( iii ) If the CD becomes inaccurate before consummation , a corrected CD must be provided at or <p> before consummation . If the APR changes by more than .125% on a regular transaction or .25% on an irregular transaction , the Loan Product Changes , or there is an addition of a prepayment penalty , a new 3 day waiting period is required . <p> Q : If there is more than one consumer involved in a transaction how is delivery of the Closing Disclosure handled ? <p> A : In rescindable transactions , the Closing Disclosure must be given separately to each consumer who has the right to rescind under TILA . In transactions that are not rescindable , the Closing Disclosure may be provided to any consumer with primary liability on the obligation . <p> Q : What is TIP ? <p> A : The TIP is the total amount of interest that the consumer will pay over the life of the loan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for " Total Interest Percentage . " <p> Q : Who will prepare the Closing Disclosure ? <p> A : Acopia will be creating the Closing Disclosure with the help of the settlement agent . Acopia will also be delivering the Closing Disclosure to the borrower(s) and verifying receipt 3 days prior to consummation . <p> Q : Who is responsible for providing the Closing Disclosure to a seller on a purchase transaction ? <p> A : The settlement agent is required to provide the seller with the Closing Disclosure reflecting the actual terms of the sellers transaction . <p> A : Yes , in some circumstances . Creditors must provide a corrected Closing Disclosure if an event in connection with the settlement occurs during the 30-calendar-day period after consummation that causes the Closing Disclosure to become inaccurate and results in a change to an amount paid by the consumer from what was previously disclosed . When a post-consummation event requires a corrected CD , the creditor must deliver or place in the mail a corrected Closing Disclosure not later than 30 calendar days after receiving information sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Creditor discovers clerical errors after consummation , are these subject to the re-disclosure obligation ? <p> A : Yes . Creditors also must provide a revised Closing Disclosure to correct non-numerical clerical errors and document refunds for tolerance violations no later than 60 calendar days after consummation . An error is clerical if it does not affect a numerical disclosure and does not affect the timing , delivery , or other requirements imposed by the Rule . <p> Q : Can loan documents be kept electronically and still meet the record retention requirements of Regulation X and Regulation Z ? <p> A : Yes , Regulations X and Z permit , but do not require electronic recordkeeping . Records can be maintained by any method that reproduces disclosures and other records accurately , including computer programs . <p> WHOLESALE : <p> Q : If a broker is issuing a Loan Estimate but does not know the creditor , may the broker put its name on the form in place of the creditors name ? <p> A : No . The comment provides that the broker must make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when the name of the creditor is not known at the time the Loan Estimate is required to be delivered or placed in the mail , the mortgage broker may leave the creditors name blank . This does not allow the mortgage broker to substitute its name for the creditors name . Section 1026.37(a) ( 3 ) requires the name and address of the creditor , and a broker would not place its name and address when the name of the creditor is unknown . Commentary section 1026.37(a) ( 3 ) -2 addresses situations where the mortgage broker is making the disclosure and the creditor has not yet been determined . <p> Q : Information constituting a changed circumstance or borrower-requested changes might become available to the broker and lender at different times . When is the time for providing a revised Loan Estimate triggered ? <p> A : If a revised Loan Estimate is to be provided , the loan originator must do so within 3 business days of receiving information sufficient to establish the changed circumstance . The 3 business days is triggered from the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker or the lender , receives the information first .
