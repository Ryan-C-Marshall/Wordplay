" <p> The operation was finally arranged to take place once she had finished her studies . <p> Afterwards she went back into industry , but soon felt the pull of a vocation in the church . <p> She said : " I did n't think they 'd even look at me .

 University of Sheffield help find new ' monster ' stars <h> Using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope astronomers were able to study the central and most dense region of this cluster in detail . Here they found nine stars with more than 100 solar masses . Credit : NASA , ESA , P Crowther ( University of Sheffield ) <h> Graham Walker , Digital Editor <h> University of Sheffield experts have helped astronomers to identify nine so-called monster stars which are over 100 times the mass of the Sun using the Hubble Space Telescope . <p> It is the largest group of massive stars identified to date and the nine stars - located 170,000 light years away - outshine the Sun by a factor of 30 million . <p> The announcement comes just a month after scientists at the University of Sheffield helped to make one of the biggest space discoveries of all time , proving Albert Einstein 's 100-year-old theory of general relativity was right . <p> They helped to find the first space distorting gravitational waves , which looks set to unlock the wonders of the universe with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link below . <p> Today 's announcement is another major discovery . The nine star cluster , named R136 , is the largest sample of what are know as very massive stars to be identified to date and has raised many new questions about the formation of such stars . <p> The international team of scientists , led by researchers from the University of Sheffield , combined images taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 with the unprecedented ultraviolet spatial resolution of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) to successfully dissect the young star cluster in the ultraviolet for the first time . <p> R136 is only a few light-years across and is located in the Tarantula Nebula within the Large Magellanic Cloud about 170,000 light-years away . The young cluster hosts many extremely massive , hot and luminous stars whose energy is mostly radiated in the ultra violet which is why the scientists probed the ultraviolet emission of the cluster . <p> As well as finding a total of nine very massive stars , over 100 times more massive than the sun , the new study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The detected stars are not only extremely massive , but also exceptionally bright and together the nine massive stars outshine the Sun by a factor of 30million . <p> Professor Paul Crowther , from the University of Sheffield 's Department of Physics and Astronomy and lead author of the study , said : " Once again , our work demonstrates that , despite being in orbit for over 25 years , there are some areas of science for which Hubble is still uniquely capable . <h> Monster star cluster R136 can be seen at the lower right of the image taken by the Hubble telescope .

At that time the extreme properties of these stars came as a surprise as they exceeded the upper-mass limit for stars that was generally accepted at the time . <p> Now , this census , published in the monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , has shown that there are five more stars with more than 100 solar masses in R136 raising many new questions about the formation of massive stars as the origin of these huge creations remains unclear . <p> Saida Caballero-Nieves , also from the University of Sheffield and co-author of the study , said : " There have been suggestions that these monsters result from the merger of less extreme stars in close binary systems . From what we know about the frequency of massive mergers , this scenario ca n't account for all the really massive stars that we see in R136 , so it would appear that such stars can originate from the star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the origin of these stars the team will continue to analyse the datasets gathered . An analysis of new optical STIS observations will also allow them to search for close binary systems in R136 , which could produce massive black hole binaries which would ultimately merge , producing gravitational waves . <p> Despite the new discovery the current record holder R136a1 does keep its place as the most massive star known in the Universe at over 250 solar masses . <p> The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA . <p> With almost 27,000 of the brightest students from over 140 countries , learning alongside over 1,200 of the best academics from across the globe , the University of Sheffield is one of the world 's leading universities . <p> A member of the UK 's prestigious Russell Group of leading research-led institutions , Sheffield offers world-class teaching and research excellence across a wide range of disciplines .

 buses sent to Doncaster on the eve of travel chaos <h> Buses in Sheffield city centre <h> George Torr <p> Double decker buses in Sheffield were sent over Doncaster on the eve of resulting travel chaos that caused misery for passengers across the city . <p> A report by Doncaster Council seen by The Star said that Sheffield were sent their newer single deckers in return due to the bus partnership ' commitments ' . <p> First bus company said that they ' recognised quickly ' this was a mistake and brought double deckers back over to Sheffield . <p> The Sheffield Bus Partnership , which includes bus operators , Sheffield Council and the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive , said they had introduced extra buses to ease demand after the initial public outcry . <p> The Star asked First South Yorkshire how many Sheffield double deckers were sent over to Doncaster and how many were later brought back but no answer was given . <p> Over 12,000 people signed a petition calling for the cuts to services across the city to be reversed , after they came in on November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cuts which axed , rescheduled , reduced or renumbered dozens of services , creating long queues at stops , full buses , confused passengers and left residents unable to get to work . <p> Greenhill mum , Joanne Lumley who set up a petition which gathered thousands of signatures said : " It 's more seats per day and they were lost when they were needed most . <p> " It is significant and it annoys me with this line about more double deckers being put on being the magical solution .

 hidden stars of Sheffield 's NHS system <p> Doctors and nurses are the faces of our NHS but behind the scenes there are many unseen scientists providing expertise in patient diagnosis , treatment and safety . <p> These are the teams responsible for tasks as diverse as carrying out tests for swallowing disorders to advising staff on the regulations surrounding X-Rays . <p> Some of the dedicated staff working at Sheffield 's hospitals are featured here to mark Healthcare Science Week and de-bunk some of the myths about their specialist work . <p> Rebecca Mather <p> Having people you love in hospital can be a challenging time for anyone , but for Rebecca Mather it was a turning point for her career . <p> Seeing how well her grandparents were treated in hospital and the impact this had on her own family led her to want to be able to help others have the same experience . <p> After studying for her A-Levels , Rebecca was successful in gaining a position as a healthcare science apprentice in gastrointestinal physiology at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals . <p> Working closely with her supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients with disorders in areas such as the small bowel . <p> The patients Rebecca sees may often feel embarrassed by symptoms these disorders can present , including flatulence , abdominal pain , wind and bloating . <p> Testing for many of these conditions is carried out by analysing methane and hydrogen levels in the breath . <p> After an initial assessment , the patient is given a drink of either glucose , lactose or fructose sugars which are found in many common foods and the breath test is then repeated . <p> Rebecca said : " While many of the patients may be quite embarrassed , I love getting the chance to talk to them and make them feel comfortable in the department . Knowing that I am involved in helping clinicians get the information they need to make a real difference to these patients ' lives is a great feeling . " <p> Rebecca now aspires to become a fully qualified clinical scientist . <p> Stella Bradey <p> Thousands of tests and investigations are carried out on patients every week in Sheffield , but most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of care . <p> One group of people who are essential in this part of the healthcare system are biomedical scientists . They are often instrumental in enabling clinicians to assess a patient 's health , make a diagnosis , decide on a treatment course and monitor progress . <p> Stella Bradey is a biomedical scientist based at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Broomhill , and throughout her career has tested tens of thousands of blood and urine samples . <p> Stella 's working day can involve processing urgent samples , setting up and maintaining analysing equipment as well as staff training and ensuring all results are accurate and precise . Throughout her career , Stella has seen technological advances drastically change the way her work is carried out . <p> Stella explained : " When I started , it would take three days to get thyroid stimulating hormone test results . Today it takes just 20 minutes , on a machine that can run 170 samples every hour . <p> " We are also seeing an increasing number of pieces of laboratory equipment on the wards , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling medical staff to get the results immediately , with tests such as blood glucose , which in turn means patients are getting the right care much faster .

A large part of Davina 's role is spent with patients , as embryologists play an important role in the patient 's journey and are in contact with them throughout treatment . <p> An average day for Davina starts off by carrying out fertilisation checks for the patients whose eggs were collected the previous day .

I have been an embryologist for 15 years and I 've never looked back . I feel privileged to play such a significant part in the very personal journey our patients take to try and achieve the family they so desperately want .

 Kes , Barry Hines , dies aged 76 <h> Barnsley author , Barry Hines , has died aged 76 , it was reported today . <h> Sarah Marshall , Multimedia Reporter <h> The Barnsley writer behind A Kestrel for a Knave , Barry Hines , has died aged 76 , it was announced today . <p> The news was announced on Twitter by the poet Ian McMillan and subsequently confirmed by a friend of the author this morning . <p> He said on Twitter : " Very sad news : the great writer Barry Hines , creator of Barnsley 's defining myth A Kestrel For A Knave , has died . Rest in peace . ' <p> Barry 's first novel , The Blinder , was written at Loughborough University and finished while he worked as a teacher . Published in 1966 , it was followed two years later by the novel which marked the arrival of a distinctive new voice and a writer who would tell the stories of those who could not speak for themselves , A Kestrel For A Knave , which is about a young working-class boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Loach turned it into the film Kes in 1969 . Barry Hines went on to write novels including The Price of Coal in 1979 and Unfinished Business in 1983 . His 1984 screenplay Threads , about the aftermath of a nuclear war , saw him nominated for a second BAFTA , following a nomination for Kes . <p> Our sister title , The Yorkshire Post , reported that Barry had been diagnosed with Alzheimers seven years ago . <p> Speaking on life with the condition , Barry said in 2009 : He loses his thread and wants to explain what that 's like . " I lose it . We 'll be talking and then suddenly it just goes . But it does n't worry me . Ten years ago I 'd have gone ' Oh I want to die , ' but I just get on with it . Most things I can do .

 Tyson after the final whistle against Peterborough <h> Paul Goodwin <p> Easter might fall earlier than normal this year but it looks set to be no less defining for Doncaster Rovers . <p> Nothing is usually won or lost at this time , but it can lay the foundations for either success or failure . <p> And for a Rovers side still in the midst of one of the club 's worst ever runs of form , Easter now serves up two monumental games against teams who find themselves in the same boat - Colchester United and Blackpool - looking to clamber to safety in League One . <p> You get the distinct feeling that Darren Ferguson 's men must now win at least one of those games - and at least avoid defeat to Blackpool - to give themselves a fighting chance in the battle to avoid the drop . <p> In boxing terms , Rovers are well and truly on the ropes after a woeful run that has seen them take just one point from the last 30 available and drop into the relegation zone for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They have been punch drunk in recent weeks , seemingly wilting under the pressure and producing particularly lame performances in their last two defeats at Scunthorpe United and Bradford City . <h> Rovers ' Andy Williams has a clear header at goal but it goes over the bar <p> So after eventually coming round , pulling themselves together and finally showing some fight and pride against Ferguson 's former employers on Saturday , to end up losing the game in the fashion they did - conceding yet again in horribly soft fashion , this time right at the death - was like kicking them while they are down . <p> Ricardo Almeida Santos 's winning goal was very harsh on a Rovers team that at least looked like it was up for the scrap . <p> A draw would have been a fair result after the visitors shaded the first half on points and Rovers controlled the majority of the second period . <p> So it was understandable , given Doncaster 's improved display , that almost their entire team should drop to its knees as one when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santos 's telling blow . That distressing image said everything about the current state of mind within the Doncaster dressing room . <p> This is a team that has now taken hit after hit after hit after hit since the turn of the year , to the tune of 13 games without a win . <p> Given the way certain individuals have quite clearly gone into their shells over the last three months , they are a squad whose collective mental strength has quite rightly been questioned over recent weeks . <p> But after taking so many punches there is now a real danger of a complete mental black-out . Perish the thought that Rovers take two more hits over Easter - because that could prove very difficult to come back from . <p> Ferguson will face a massive task on the training ground today just keeping people 's chins up after the latest setback . But his message to the players is likely to be a simple one : if you show the same sort of attitude and application as you did against Peterborough for the remaining nine games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One next season . <h> Doncaster 's players celebrate James Coppinger 's goal <p> Everything was seemingly going to plan for Rovers when they took just five minutes to break the curse of the first goal - through none other than returning skipper James Coppinger . <p> The led by example as he popped up in the right place at the right time to finish from close range after Andy Williams picked the pocket of Santos at the by-line and laid it across goal . <p> It was the first time Rovers had scored first in a game at the Keepmoat Stadium since November 24 and ended a run of nine consecutive games in which they have gone behind . <p> They arguably scored too early , but you could clearly see the positive effect it had on the players . They had a spring in their step , were working hard to close their opponents down , and might have extended their lead around the half hour mark when Coppinger and Cedric Evina fired efforts narrowly wide . <p> Rovers knew they were in a game though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to going behind . <p> Michael Bostwick , Harry Beautyman and Gabriel Zakuani all went close for the visitors before they grabbed a deserved leveller on the stroke of half time . Star man Marcus Maddison was given too much time and space to deliver a teasing ball into the corridor of uncertainty and Aaron Williams crept in at the far post to finish . <p> Rovers had much the better of the second half and saw Posh keeper Ben Alnwick make important saves from Cameron Stewart and Nathan Tyson , while Williams headed Luke McCullough 's cross just over . <p> But they failed to convert that element of control into goals and disaster struck inside stoppage time when Thorsten Stuckmann inexplicably flapped at a high Maddison cross and Santos was left with a simple tap-in after Williams ' header came back off the post . <h> Share this article 
 <p> But the frustration etched across his face as he rued yet another missed opportunity to close the gap on the play-off positions betrayed the fact that , for the umpteenth time since taking charge nine months ago , Adkins knew the visitors had been the architects of their own demise - a habit which , David Edgar later acknowledged , will condemn them to another yet another year in League One unless addressed and kicked soon . <p> " We knew coming here was going to be tough , " the centre-half conceded . " Because of that , we needed to be on our toes . Making such a poor start cost us because , performance and effort-wise , we did enough to win the match . " <p> The veracity of that statement must be open to debate after United , now 12th in the table with only nine fixtures remaining , huffed and puffed without ever really threatening to overwhelm Neil Harris ' side , save for a brief period of pressure early in the second half . <p> But the visitors did enjoy enough possession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so could be attributed to a variety of different factors , including lack of assertiveness , attention to detail and , as Adkins conceded , an inability to combat Millwall 's street-smart approach . <h> United misery at the end <p> Lee Gregory and Steve Morison , a centre-forward you suspect gorges on raw meat rather than grilled chicken or pasta before games , imposed their authority on proceedings from the first whistle . It was not until Ryan Flynn and John Brayford both saw shots blocked as the hour mark beckoned that United wrestled back control . <p> " The way we started was n't good enough , " Edgar continued . " And everything else stemmed from that . " <p> With Edgar set to miss the next two games after reporting for international duty with Canada and Alex Baptiste tweaking a hamstring soon after the re-start , the problem of how best to plug United 's porous rearguard now appears even more complex . <p> Adkins admitted he is loath to fill the void created by Baptiste 's absence - " We do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the issue then he 's probably looking at a few weeks out " - by entering the transfer market , but United 's profligacy in attack also represents cause for concern . <h> George Long saves from Steve Morison <p> Billy Sharp , their leading goalscorer , worked tirelessly as usual . Alongside him , though , Conor Sammon struggled to make his presence felt after being selected ahead of Che Adams . <p> The former Republic of Ireland international is a third-tier version of Tore Andre Flo : A talented footballing conundrum who , despite his hulking frame , does not pack a concussive punch . <p> The same can not be said , Adkins admitted , of either Gregory or Morison . <p> " Our back three struggled to deal with them , " lamented the United manager . " They were a handful and set the tone . <h> Florent Cuvelier up against Ben Thompson <p> " It was a simple ball over the top every time . That 's not being disrespectful , because it worked . Millwall were clever because , whenever we seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke them up . I 'd like to think we 'd have done the same in their position . " <p> United , though , never gave themselves the chance . The contest was barely 120 seconds old when Ben Thompson sent Morison darting clear before his centre reached Taylor who , signed on loan from Blackburn Rovers 48 earlier , duly swept home unmarked . <p> Gregory , who was released by United as a youngster before resurrecting his career at Staveley Miners Welfare and Halifax Town , forced the first of two fine saves from George Long before Morison also tested the United goalkeeper 's reactions . <p> When Sammon showed Millwall 's back four a clean pair of heels after the break , Long 's heroics appeared destined to become a pivotal moment of the match , Instead , with the resulting cross was intercepted before reaching Sharp , they were reduced to an epitaph . <p> " Conor did so well getting through , " Adkins said . " He showed great acceleration but could n't get the ball across . " <p> Sharp , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six yard box , recovered his poise to test Jordan Archer at the near post but saw a low drive parried away to safety . <p> Millwall remain fifth after stretching their unbeaten run to six outings . United , meanwhile , enter Friday 's meeting with Crewe Alexandra having won four and lost five of their last 12 . <p> " We need to get consistent results and the key to that is consistent performances , " Edgar said . " We 've got to go on a winning run and string some victories together . " <h> Tennis Tourney Director

 real symbolism of Easter eggs <h> Dr Minna <p> It 's a question that 's been uttered a lot in recent weeks , as supermarket aisles began to fill with colourful chocolate treats in every size . <h> Mary Magdalene holding an egg <p> It does seem a little odd that Easter , which sees Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , be marked with the exchange of Cadbury 's eggs . But according to Dr Minna , co-director of the Hidden Perspectives project in the Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies at the University of Sheffield , there is a good reason behind this seemingly unrelated symbolism . <p> " Chocolate eggs may seem like the indulgent embodiment of secular , post-Christian Easter in the 21st century , which has become about treats rather than traditions , " says Dr . <p> " However , the symbolism of eggs and their place in spring time celebrations has long roots , reflecting ancient beliefs , both pagan and Christian , of new life and celebration . " ? And according to Dr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to emerge - was commonly associated with the creation of the universe in ancient thought . Ancient Egyptians believed that gods came forth from eggs of creation , and in Hindu mythology , Hiranyagarbha , a ' golden womb ' or ' golden egg ' , was the source of creation . There are similar myths from Greek , Japanese , Chinese , and Oceanic cultures , as well as Nordic tales which speak of the world being created from six eggs of gold . In many ancient legends the egg , or its yolk , was associated with the sun , and the shell formed the dome of sky , earth and water . <p> " In Christian tradition , eggs have multiple meanings , " Dr adds . <h> Easter eggs <p> " They were thought to symbolise the stone on the tomb of Christ , as well as Christ bursting forth from the grave . <p> " There is also a common association between sacred femininity and eggs . According to Eastern Church traditions , Mary Magdalene brought cooked eggs to share with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behold , when she met the Risen Christ at the empty tomb , the eggs miraculously turned blood red . Hence images of Mary with an egg are common in Orthodox iconography . <p> " Eggs were also part of ritual eating and pagan celebrations at springtime , which could be another explanation as to why they are found in the Easter story . " <p> Easter eggs became chocolatey in 19th century Europe , with the first British dark chocolate eggs crafted by Cadbury in 1875 . Chocolate eggs were originally often solid chocolate , and later replaced by hollow eggs containing surprises , as representation of the new life and hope within . <h> Jesus ' tomb <p> Dr adds : " Easter eggs now come in every shape - I 've seen a few square ones - and size ! They 're a symbol of life-giving and , along with bunnies and chicks , are a great representation of springtime . " <p> The story of the Easter Bunny is thought to have become common in the 19th century , around the time that rabbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies , became a symbol of new life . In many countries , the goes that the Easter bunny lays , decorates and hides eggs as they are also a symbol of new life , though in Switzerland , Easter eggs are delivered by a cuckoo , and in parts of Germany , by a fox . <p> So the link is n't as tenuous as it may first appear . <p> Dr smiles : " If you think about it , chocolate is a treat , and an aphrodisiac , which is quite fitting for any celebration of life eternal or otherwise . " <p> And according to Dr Meredith Warren , also a member of the Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies , the confusion over Easter does n't end with chocolate eggs . <p> Dr Warren says : " Jesus 's crucifixion is probably one of the most familiar images to emerge from Christianity and Good Friday , one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar , marks this event . But what do we actually know about the way Jesus was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that all four canonical Gospels agree on - Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John - although each tells the story a little differently . <p> " The Gospel of Peter specifically describes how , after Jesus died , the nails were removed from his hands , while none of the Gospels in the New Testament mention the nails . In Christian tradition , nailing the limbs to the cross is assumed , but Romans did not always do this , instead sometimes tying them in place with rope . <p> " Curiously , this fixation on the nails persists , despite the fact that the earliest gospels make no mention of Jesus being nailed to the cross .

 bit of recognition <h> Eagles chief Mark Aston <p> There 's a fellow in our midst . He 's not a Sheffielder but he 's spent a big chunk of his life in our city and I think he deserves a bit of recognition for the work he has done . <p> I 'm talking about Mark Aston , the Sheffield Eagles head coach . He was a member of the team that won the Challenge Cup against the mighty Wigan all those years ago . This fella has had all kinds of barriers put in front of him . It 's as if someone wants him to fail . <p> He has had to endure the disastrous merger with Huddersfield , where all his better players were taken from him . The club then folded but he helped reform it in 2000 . The stadium at Don Valley was flattened , he had to take his team to play at Owlerton Stadium , he then had to move to Doncaster 's stadium . None of this was ideal , shall we say , but all the time producing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's now having to play at Bawtry Road , which is , not ideal either . <p> Then the final kick in the teeth , he had to scrap his academy and reserve team because the facilities do n't reach the rugby league requirements . <p> Now I do n't go to watch the team , although I should , because my father-in-law was a professional rugby player . Also I 'm a football fan first , but my mate follows them both home and away and he tells me that their proposed move to the new multi-purpose sports arena looks like falling through because a couple of the sponsors have pulled out because of some ' red tape ' nonsense with the council . <p> Now if anybody needs a break , it 's this guy . I 'm sure there 's someone out there who could back this gentleman like he has backed our city . <h> Farewell to writer

He was absolutely tiny when he came to us ; we have both him and his girlfriend Panda and hopefully they 'll make some more little Netherland Dwarfs together . " <p> Butters is fluffy and cuddly - and cute enough to adorn any Easter card . The next animal on our Easter walkabout is just the opposite . Imogen is n't too sure what to make of Smartie the tortoise when she first claps eyes on him and I can understand why , he looks a bit like a giant rock you 'd find in the garden - until he starts moving . Then she starts smiling . <p> And that 's exactly what surprises me most about the Butterfly House , the sheer variety of animals on show . When owner Bob Ellis bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very own Butterfly House , and that 's exactly what he did . But once the Butterfly House was built , Bob and his family - who still own the centre today - began to expand , quite organically , into other types of animal . <p> " Bob 's daughter , now in her thirties , works here and she can still remember riding her bike around these grounds when the Butterfly House was first being built and was just a concrete mound . <p> " We 're always expanding , in the last two years we 've gone from four acres to eight and we have plans for so many other things . <p> " The Tropical Butterfly House is special because it 's truly a family-run business . Bob is absolutely excellent and his enthusiasm rubs off oh his staff - everyone who works here has so much passion and loyalty , it makes this a wonderful place to spend your days .

The funds we donate are vital to helping with conservation efforts . " <p> The lemurs are cheeky and full of fun and , as they bound on to our heads and shoulders , we ca n't help but laugh . It 's wonderful to be able to see animals so up close and personal , happy and having fun in their own environments .

 Hard-working ' Sheffield United kids have earned respect of senior team mates <h> James Shield <p> Jay McEveley has revealed how old-fashioned values , including attitude and humility , have helped Sheffield United 's latest wave of academy graduates earn the respect of senior professionals at Bramall Lane . <p> Nigel Adkins named seven home-grown players in the squad which faced Crewe Alexandra three days ago with two , Ben Whiteman and Louis Reed , combining to create an 87th minute winner for Billy Sharp . <p> Adkins recently outlined plans to ensure " 50 per cent " of the options at his disposal have progressed through the club 's youth system " in the short to medium term . " <p> After observing the strides made by the likes of Whiteman , Graham Kelly and Dominic Calvert-Lewin at close quarters , McEveley has endorsed the reasoning behind Adkins ' ambitious target but told The Star it is the approach , not the ability , of United 's youngsters which has impressed most behind the scenes . <p> " You ca n't come into the first team with the wrong attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Times have changed but , still , you ca n't come in thinking you are Billy Big B******s or anything like that . But all of the young lads who have come into that dressing room now have the right attitude about them . They are confident but they work hard every single day in training and are willing to listen and learn . " <p> Although Whiteman , Kelly and David Brooks , an unused substitute against Crewe , are being granted opportunities to impress , Italy youth international Diego De Girolamo has again struggled to make an impact following another low key season . <h> Dominic Calvert-Lewin , in action against Crewe on Friday , has impressed since breaking into the Blades ' first team <p> The centre-forward used Twitter to vent his frustration at the situation last week with the post - " What more can you do " - still appearing on his timeline yesterday . <p> Although Adkins , together with his predecessors Danny Wilson and Nigel Clough , does not dispute De Girolamo 's ability , doubts have been expressed about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken a dim view of his outburst on social media and , given McEveley 's comments about the importance of attitude , senior members of the first team squad are also thought to be unimpressed . <p> Mansfield Town expressed an interest in acquiring De Girolamo 's services before the deadline for emergency loan signings but with a move to Field Mill failing to transpire and an unnamed non-league club his only other alternative , the must now rebuild bridges after agreeing a new 24 month contract during the close season . <p> McEveley , acknowledging the emergence of Whiteman and Calvert-Lewin has brought a fresh dynamic to United 's play as they attempt to secure a top fix finish , said : " That bit of youth , there 's no pressure on them . I remember coming through myself and you know that everybody wants you to do well because you 've come through the academy .

A business like Ikea needs space and free parking . A town centre site would not work . Who would want to lug a flatpack kitchen even a few hundred metres to the car ? <p> An out-of-town Ikea is better than an out of region Ikea .

 Town old-boy Jack Hunt warns of Terriers threat <h> Jack Hunt <h> Chris Holt <p> Jack Hunt says Sheffield Wednesday must be wary of the threat posed by Huddersfield Town tomorrow as the Terriers look to build on the rise in form under boss David Wagner . <p> The German had only just taken over when the sides met at Hillsborough in November , but since then , Huddersfield moved away from the relegation zone and a few more points on the board should see them safe . <p> A warning of their collective abilities came in a 4-1 hammering of rivals Leeds United before the international break and Hunt , who began his career with Town , says this trip to West Yorkshire will be no easy task . <p> " They utilise the ball very well , get a lot of passes in , but we 've got to go there and adapt to their style of play but obviously we have to play our own game and hopefully that may be enough , " said Hunt . <p> " They are coming together really well . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good eye on their results and you 'd have thought next season you 'd see even more of a push from them because the manager will have had a full pre-season to get his thoughts across . <p> " Credit to the players , they seem to have taken to it very quickly and you 've seen it on the pitch . " <p> Hunt also says there is a freshness about Wednesday going into this latest test , the last of eight ties between them and Yorkshire sides , after a relaxed international break . <p> He added : " We had two good results away at Forest and at home to Charlton but it was nice to recharge the batteries and get ready to go for the last eight games . You can enjoy the break a little bit more , if you go in with a few bad results you might think you have to work harder over the international break so for us , we got to get the feet up and recharge the batteries .

It was very frustrating but these things happen in football . I 'm sure I will get injured again . The injury could have been a lot worse . <p> It is all good now and I have had three weeks of training and feel good . It is nice to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in training and played in a couple of development games . I needed to get games under my belt . Playing in the Under-21 game against Huddersfield on Tuesday was definitely what I needed . It was nice to get a clean sheet and hopefully now I am in the frame to play if I am called upon . <p> It was good to be back on the bench against Charlton . It shows what faith the gaffer and Andy Rhodes ( goalkeeping coach ) have got in me . <p> Going on international duty <p> It is a brilliant experience . You are testing yourself against the best English players in the country at that age group . <p> The set-up is really good . The standard is really high and we all push each other . Obviously we all want to play and there is really good competition . <p> Some of those players have played at the highest level so it has showed me what I need to do and improve . <p> England 's next generation <p> We 've got some lads playing at Under-21 level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior level soon . <p> Some of the lads are joining up with the Under-21s thinking the sky 's the limit because there are boys who they know who are in the senior side . <p> You only have to look at Dele Ali to see what is possible . He is only 19 and the gaffer has shown he is prepared to give young talent a chance . If you prove yourself at club level , it just shows what can happen . <p> Everyone believes they can get into the squad . You want youth to come through and for everyone to be confident in their own ability . I think that 's what we have got with the Under-21s . <p> Winning his first Under-21 cap <p> It would be brilliant . I 've had a taste for it at Under-20 level and there 's no better feeling than playing for your country . It is just a massive privilege . I know if I keep performing at club level that the international accolades will come . <p> Saturday 's draw at Switzerland was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone is buzzing . We think we can beat anyone and that 's how you 've got to go into every game . <p> Wednesday 's busy scheduel after the international break <p> Three games in a week is tough and will take its toll on the team but we have got the squad to rotate if we need to so everyone will be fresh . Morale and fitness is good and we are going into the final stage of the season feeling strong . <p> We are confident we can finish in the top six . It is in our hands . If we keep on winning , we will stay sixth or possibly higher . We are not waiting on other teams to slip up which is a nice position to be in . <p> You would rather it be in your hands than not at this stage of the season . It is down to us . <p> But we are taking it game by game . Our focus is now on Huddersfield . If we can win that , hopefully we will increase the gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S6 <p> It is the biggest buzz that has been around the club in probably 10 to 15 years . Things have really taken off this year . <p> Having watched on as a kid , I 've seen the club go through some tough times . We have been relegated a few times , have money problems and different chairman . Milan Mandaric then came in and he sorted everything out . <p> Now the chairman Dejphon Chansiri has taken things on to another level and that 's what we needed . It just needed a little kick up the bum to help it really kick on . The club is big enough to be in the Premier League and is what it deserves for the tough times it has had . <p> Helping Wednesday get promoted <p> I think Sheffield needs a team in the Premier League . If anything , both clubs should be in the top flight . It would be great and only benefit the city . Wednesday fans want to see their team back at the top level . <p> " Many of

The decision could put more than 2,000 jobs at three South Yorkshire sites , and 15,000 nationally , at risk . <p> Rotherham MP Sarah Champion told the Times : " The UK has been refusing to put any sort of tariffs on China 's steel , but China is still putting tariffs on UK steel . <p> " The Government is not standing up for the people it is supposed to be representing . " <p> The announcement on Friday that Beijing is to impose anti-dumping duties on " under-priced " steel from the EU , Japan and South Korea further inflamed feelings and intensified the calls for the Government to act . <p> The Chinese ministry of commerce said imports of grain-oriented flat-rolled steel will be charged duties ranging from 14.5 per cent to 46.3 per cent . <p> Tata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just 16 producers worldwide to make the hi-tech steel product hit by the levy . <p> Downing Street said David Cameron had raised the problems of global over production of steel with China 's president Xi Jinping during the course of an international nuclear security summit in Washington . <p> " The Prime Minister raised concerns about the global steel industry , said we needed to work together to tackle the challenges with over-capacity and that G20 could be a good forum to address it later in the year , " a Government source said . <p> But with the Government already facing accusations that it blocked moves by the EU to raise tariffs on Chinese steel , it did not go far enough for opposition parties , with Labour calling on Business Secretary Sajid Javid to change his position . <p> In a letter to Mr Javid , shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said : " If the Government and other EU members states now accept that steel making in the Europe is in ' emergency measures ' , then it would be possible to apply ' safeguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU . " <p> She said Chinese dumping now had " the potential to destroy the UK steel industry " , adding : " Will you commit to picking up the phone to Beijing as a matter of urgency to discuss these proposals ? " <p> Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the UK steel industry was now paying the price for Chancellor George Osborne 's determination to woo Beijing at any price . <p> " This news is further pain added onto a community that has been kicked in the gut by Government inaction , " he said . <p> " The Chancellor has made a ' better relationship ' with China , a cornerstone of his economic policy . Now the consequences of that decision are being felt by steel workers . <p> " Rather than standing up for China in the EU , by blocking higher tariffs on their steel , he should be standing up to China on behalf of the UK steel industry . " <p> Mr Javid , who visited Port Talbot on Friday after breaking off a trade mission to Australia , insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose tariffs on cheap Chinese steel .@@8034953 <p> Series three of

 charge of your own lives <h> Overweight <p> As children growing up in the 1950s and early ' 60s , we were often oblivious to the struggles mum and dad had in making ends meet . Dad was a bricklayer and mum worked part-time in a cutlery factory , neither of these industries was known for paying high wages . <p> Our family lived in a two-bedroom house in Arbourthorne and although we did n't consider ourselves poor , we knew we were n't well off because most of our goods were secondhand . We may have been short of luxuries , but what we did n't lack was good homecooked food . Meat and potato pie , stews , home baked cakes and apple pies were a good part of not just our family 's diet , but also thousands of other working class families . <p> Back then obesity was n't a widespread problem and certainly not among children and yet a recent letter to The Star from a Doctor Bond makes the claim , among others , that poverty is the number one cause of obesity and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand how Doctor Bond comes to the conclusion that people who are cash poor are also time poor . <p> If you are unemployed or working part-time then you may well be cash poor , but will almost certainly have time on your hands . The doctor uses this theory to back up his claim that people do n't have time to cook food using basic ingredients , patently not true . <p> Undoubtedly , obesity is fuelled by over consumption of high-fat foods and takeaways , but the reason people eat this stuff is not because it 's cheap , it very often is n't , but because it can be extremely tasty . It is also convenient , you can have 6,000 calories delivered to your door with a phone call . <p> Doctor Bond 's idea that people on low incomes can not afford to eat nutritious food is , I think , simply wrong . In fact , I do n't believe cost even comes into the equation . If people , whatever their status , want something then they will find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk food and nor , increasingly , to being obese . If most people in your area are overweight , it becomes the norm . <p> I do n't doubt that Doctor Bond is a caring professional , but not once in his letter does he give the impression that he thinks the obese could do more to help themselves , rather that they are victims of outside agencies and vested interests . <p> It can be hard , but sometimes people have to take charge of their own lives , nobody else can do it for them . <p> Kirchhoff has rightly

 tough action on the disease of insurance fraud <h> Cash for crash case Bus pic 1 <h> John Leigh <p> Insurance fraud has become a disease that is infecting my industry and damaging our relationship with customers . It adds an estimated ? 25 - ? 40 to everyone 's policy . In 2014 , insurers uncovered 130,000 fraudulent claims worth ? 1.32 billion . Stamping out fraud is part of the public confidence agenda and should have the highest priority within the insurance profession . So the insurance industry is working hard to confront the fraudsters . <p> Crucially this means taking tough action in order to protect honest customers . This has entailed the creation of working partnerships with law enforcement , government and public sector organisations , which is having an impact . The Insurance Fraud Bureau is also working with the industry and police to detect fraudsters and bring them to justice . Insurers are fighting back by investing at least ? 200 million each year to identify fraud . <p> The most common frauds involve home insurance with 66,000 bogus or exaggerated claims detected , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This includes ' crash for cash ' scams where motor accidents are deliberately staged . What 's more , staged car accidents carry a safety risk to innocent members of the public . Sometimes , fraudsters deliberately slam their brakes on so that an innocent motorist hits them . In 2014 two men were been jailed for orchestrating a series of " crash-for-cash scams " , including one involving a two tonne bus with up to 40 passengers hitting a car in Burngreave , . The court heard how the crash , in June 2011 , was just " the most extreme example " of a series of fake collisions . Both men were jailed after attempting to net ? 500,000 from fraudulent claims . <p> Personal injury claims against employers or local authorities carry a similar risk . Some people will invent incidents or exaggerate the effects of a genuine claim in an attempt to secure payment beyond which they are entitled to . Examples range from individuals greatly embellishing an injury suffered at work , through to organised activity where people are encouraged to invent an injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheats can be severe . The simplest piece of information can be the key to uncovering a fraud . There will always be a lie in the evidence and the challenge is to find the discrepancy . It is essential to verify every piece of information provided to establish evidence , which is , in any case , good claims handling . So the message is clear . We owe it to the honest paying public to combat fraudsters and will always take the toughest possible action against those who attempt to defraud us. <p> He was one

 of invention costs Sheffield United in blood and thunder derby , says James Shield <h> Chris Holt <p> Sheffield United needed the win against Barnsley at Bramall Lane to keep alive their hopes of sneaking into the play-offs , but they had to settle for a point after a 0-0 derby draw . <p> With that surely went United 's chance of a top six spot , but the visitors are still well placed to make it . <p> The Star 's James Shield reflecting on the game said : " It was an absolutely breathless derby , good old fashioned blood and thunder . It was almost like rolling back 10 or 15 years in English football . Tackles aplenty , a lot of industry , a lot of endevour , but the one thing lacking , certainly from a Sheffield United 's perspective , was a little bit of invention in the final third .

 rues lack of quality as Sheffield United draw with Barnsley <h> Chris Holt <h> Sheffield United boss Nigel Adkins admitted his side lacked enough quality to beat Barnsley and maintain their outside chance of making it into the play-offs . <p> In a game where there were few clear cut goalscoring opportunities for either side , a draw was a fair result but it suited the visitors more , with United needing nothing less than a victory . <p> Che Adams struck the post in the first half for the Blades and there were half chances near the end , notably for substitute Conor Sammon who was denied by a superb block , but United did n't create enough as Adkins said : " It was a competitive game , an old fashioned derby . Both teams needed to win the game , that 's our fourth clean sheet in five games , however we needed to get the victory . <p> " We 've put balls into the box but maybe not with the quality we 've needed at times . We just needed that one goal but it finsihed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were capable on the counter-attack . Sharp and Adams have been on fire but today I thought their centre-halves Mawson and Roberts did very well against them and gave them problems " <p> " The lads are working extremely hard .

It was zero-zero unfortunately that 's it . " <p> Adkins all but conceded that the opportunity to sneak into the top six places after a fine run had now come to an end , adding : " It 's not mathematically impossible , stranger things have happened but we needed to win the game today .

 No time for panic as Carvalhal stays cool ahead of Cardiff City clash <h> Owls head coach Carlos Carvalhal is all smiles during the 1-1 draw with Derby County <h> Liam Hoden <p> Carlos Carvalhal insists he has no concerns about Sheffield Wednesday 's short run without a win as they head towards an expected play-off campaign . <p> Wednesday drew 1-1 at Derby County on Saturday , their fourth game without a win after being beaten at Bristol City and held by Ipswich and MK Dons . <p> Head coach Carvalhal says he has taken plenty of positives from his side 's performances and believes they are on the right track . <p> " You have seen the games so you know what I will say , " he told The Star . <p> " You have seen the game against Ipswich , you saw the game against MK Dons and you saw the game at Derby . <p> " The people saw the game on TV and I am sure everybody is saying we are in a good way , we are playing good football .

 along tram tracks <h> Cycling on tram tracks in Sheffield <p> Your article , of April 25 , highlights well the hazards of tram tracks for cycling . <p> The first-generation tram network , before disability discrimination became an issue , did n't have platforms at stops . <p> There is certainly clear reasoning behind platforms -- trams , unlike buses , are able to make use of them because they can stop alongside them with perfect accuracy . <p> Unfortunately , making life easy for tram passengers creates a serious hazard for cyclists , who have to cross the rail to pass the platform , ( which should be done at as wide an angle as possible ) . <p> Another hazard is rails crossing the carriageway at an oblique angle , for example at the south end of Shalesmoor tram stop , and on Ridgeway Road , approaching Manor Top you need to ride slowly and lift your front wheel to cross each rail . What worries me most however , is the actions of other road users . <p> Wherever there are tram tracks , all road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from side roads , vehicle occupants opening doors , and parked drivers moving off , need to pay attention to cyclists and appreciate the extreme restriction on their sideways movement . <p> The advice to cyclists should be to ride between the rails as much as possible keeping up with motor traffic is not normally a problem in the city centre . <p> You should never ride at the edge of the road , left of the tram tracks , when passing parked vehicles , side roads or large numbers of pedestrians ( some of whom might step off the pavement ) . If anything gets in your way , you are trapped . <h> JetBlue Pilot Accused 
 Fernando Forestieri when Cardiff and Sheffield Wednesday met earlier in the season <h> Liam Hoden <p> The subject of Fernando Forestieri and diving has proved to be a major talking point in recent months for Sheffield Wednesday . <p> And boss of Saturday 's visitors Cardiff City Russell Slade has chipped in with his own views on the diminutive forward . <p> Top scorer Forestieri has been booked four times this season for perceived ' simulation ' with most coming in very questionable decisions . <p> Head coach Carlos Carvalhal admitted he withdrew the 26-year-old after he was booked for a foul at Derby County last weekend due to a fear the 15-goal striker would be sent off and miss the final two games by a referee who may act on reputation .@@8553729 <h> Friend of Charleston

 powerful account of disaster goes viral <h> Andy Frith ( right ) helps an injured fan at the Hillsborough disaster <p> A powerful account of the Hillsborough disaster by a former police officer who ' broke ranks ' to help the injured has been viewed by thousands of people on the internet . <p> A Facebook post by Andy Frith , who served in South Yorkshire Police for 17 years and reached the rank of inspector , has been shared more than 27,000 times after he shared an account detailing both the lack of command by senior officers and defending the police on the ground who did their best to help . <p> Mr Frith said : " The media coverage over the past few days , comments in the House of Commons and the suspension of the South Yorkshire Chief Constable all persuade me to post my thoughts . <p> " I was a Constable , Sergeant and Inspector in South Yorkshire Police and served 17 years before leaving to run a family business . I was there on the pitch at Hillsborough when the tragedy occurred working as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground when the shout went up for assistance . <p> " I witnessed the lack of command . The almost complete radio silence from the control room at the ground and the ridiculous decision to line up our serial in front of the Notts fans to prevent a pitch invasion whilst people at the Leppings Lane end were in obvious trouble . <p> " I broke ranks at that moment with several other officers and began helping the injured from the pitch because it was obvious that senior commanders were not reacting to the situation as they should have been . <p> " There is no doubt in my mind that poor policing decisions led to the deaths that day and it comes as no surprise that those in charge tried to deflect the blame . The culture in the force at that time was demonstrated in person by the majority of the chief superintendents and senior command team . I have never come across a more arrogant , pompous and unlikeable group of individuals . They had absolute power over their divisions ( districts now ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were completely but mistakenly self assured in their ability . <p> " That it took so long to discover the depth of the cover up from the then Chief Constable Peter Wright to the chief superintendents and those under their direct command is no surprise to me as no one would have dared to speak out . " <p> Mr Frith added he objected to media headlines describing the force as ' rotten to the core ' following comments made in the House of Commons by Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham about the leadership of South Yorkshire Police . <p> He said : " The huge majority of officers on duty that day did just that their duty . They helped where they could , used initiative when the chain of command failed and should be commended for their work . <p> " The current Chief Constable David Compton has been suspended by the Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings . Yes he takes responsibility for the force but he was n't there 27 years ago . <p> " It looks as though he was suspended because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think our Dr Billings is coming up for re election and needs to be able to say to the electorate " Look how tough I am " . This has nothing to do with proportionality . <p> " And the fans yes like all football crowds some of their number were intoxicated . I know because I saw it and we were confiscating beer from vehicles all morning . A huge haul of trays of lager and beer cans which had been brought to drink before the match . This was nothing unusual . <p> " This was the culture at the time and the reason fans were penned in like sheep at all grounds . Their behaviour in the previous decade had necessitated separation because of continued violence . So to say the fans had no responsibility is also wrong . Perhaps on the day the fans did not contribute directly to the 96 deaths but as a group their general behaviour over previous years had led to the point of wire cages on terraces . <p> " Yes , let the people responsible face the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called to account but please do n't call South Yorkshire Police rotten to the core .

I just always have fond memories of holidays , I very rarely remember the rain and boredom . " <p> Pete , who is 50 , was brought up on a council estate in Batemoor . He remembers : " You kept yourself to yourself and very rarely ventured into enemy territory . <p> " There were plenty of parks around there like Lowedges Park and Graves Park so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The East Coast was our holiday hunting ground as a family , any one from the five on that coast . <p> " We did n't go up to Whitby too posh . Scarborough was as posh as it got . <p> " B&amp;Bs were aspiring to be middle class ! <p> " We used to go to a caravan in Chapel St Leonards or Ingoldmells and went to one bed and breakfast . <p> " When I was about 13 we went on our first package holiday to Ibiza . After that I do n't remember having a holiday for ages , sometimes we did n't . Not every holiday you went somewhere . <p> " It always inevitably used to be a mate from the pub 's grandma 's caravan , which was cheap ! " <p> Holidays gave kids a chance to go exploring on their own . Pete said : " I remember having a couple of quid in my back pocket and you had to figure out where you were on the beach . You had to find a landmark so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come back for two hours and then you could n't remember where the family were and you 'd get completely lost . <p> " I remember going in the arcades and playing on the machines , then drifting back for a chip butty by the beach . <p> " My dad would wander off for a couple of hours to put a bet on and have a snooze . <p> " I had three older brothers , all considerably older than me , so I was left to my own devices . I was far too young to go with them , they said , ' we do n't want any little twerp cramping our style ' ! " <p> Pete put out a call on social media for people to let him have their own holiday memories and old photographs to go into the exhibition and also held an event at the Moor Market so people who do n't have access to scanners could submit their pictures too . Just a few of them can be seen on these pages.There was also a Subbuteo tournament on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . He said : " I had 13 teams , I was fanatical . I used to have Sheffield Wednesday and they could pose as five other football clubs who had similar strips . " <p> Pete 's been hard at work for the exhibition , which will feature 30 new paintings because of the size of the Magna venue . <p> He said : " It was quite daunting , to be honest , when I first went there . All the blood drained from my face . I realised that half a dozen paintings on the wall was not going to cut the mustard . I had to pull my finger out . The show will have a theatrical feel to it with a stage setting . It 's definitely the biggest show I 've ever done and I 'm looking forward to it . <p> " It 's nice to use an old steelworks and the Big Melt area is fantastic . It 's nice to be able to have a big exhibition somewhere that is n't a stuffy art gallery . The small private ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Magna on May 28 with his band the Everly Pregnant Brothers , who are excited to be playing alongside one of their heroes , Rotherham-born singer Tony Christie . <p> Looking back on his career , Pete ca n't believe how far he has come from his days of using emulsion paint pots in his kitchen at night to paint on MDF boards . <p> He said : " It really feels like a completely different time . <p> " I 've almost forgotten all those years when I was struggling to make a living without working in a factory like my dad or brother . " <p> " I did n't have a degree and it came with a lot of struggle and toil but I 've been a professional artist for the past 10 years . <p> " I wake up and pinch myself every morning and think how lucky I am to make a living out of what I love doing .

 in Sheffield group 's Barnum show <h> James Smith in rehearsals on the tightrope for the Manor Operatic production of Barnum <h> Julia Armstrong <p> It 's a marriage made in heaven a musical about the man who created ' the greatest show on Earth ' and a theatre group who are always ambitious on stage . <p> This production by Manor Operatic was vivid and vibrant and lit up the City Hall auditorium with performers who put every ounce of effort and enthusiasm into what they did and it showed on stage . <p> The company also found a great leading man in James Smith . <p> As well as acting , singing and dancing , he juggled , performed magic tricks , did acrobatics , walked on stilts and even mastered the tightrope . <p> At one point he descended from the balcony on a wire . <p> James has an engaging and lively personality big enough to really own the part of PT Barnum , an American sideshow impresario and circus owner who loved to dream up new ideas , each bigger than the last . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite of the showman - she hates his dreams , preferring facts , and deplores her husband use of ' humbug- or hype to sell his ideas to the public , declaring " There 's One Born Every Minute " . <p> However , gradually she decides to support her man , standing by and inspiring him , and the two make a formidable team . <p> Emma Holmes ' portrayal was confident and convincing and she has a lovely singing voice , but sadly it sometimes failed to rise above the orchestra , so the delivery of some of her songs was muted . <p> Manor Operatic specialise in spectacle and they really let rip with some great ideas , including a giant elephant , and loads of colour . <p> Everyone on stage performed circus skills and the ensemble numbers like One Brick at a Time and Join the Circus were great , especially when they spilled out into the auditorium . <p> The supporting cast were very strong , including Simon Hance as a whip-cracking circus . <p> Production and direction team Richard Bradford and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to answer : how are you going to top that ? <p> We 'll find out at the City Hall in December with their next pantomime , Jack and the Beanstalk. <p> Manchester United are

He is a level-headed kid and went out there and won on points . <h> Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As for me , I had to fly to Texas last time I was a late substitute - so at least it was n't that far " said Coldwell , who 13 months ago coached Jamie McDonnell in <p> San Antonio , because long time trainer Dave Hulley failed to board the plane due to a morbid fear of flying . <p> Meanwhile , Marlow claims he was left sitting on the wall outside his house , waiting for a lift , having been told he would be picked up at a specific time . <p> " I put some good in hard graft into Jayce and feel bit sad and let down " he said . <p> " I wo n't be working with either again . I get cold when done wrong to and find it easy to remove people from my life . " <p> Dixon is due to fight his third professional bout at the Metrodome , Barnsley , on July 8 . <p> Coldwell said : " Jayce is no spring chicken ( he is aged 33 ) and perhaps might not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to learn is very unorthodox and jumps in , but he is heavy-handed and will improve with a lot of hard work .

 's conviction for control and abuse of partner ' could be first of many ' <h> STOCK : Domestic violence illustraion . <h> Alex Moore <p> The first conviction in South Yorkshire under a new law designed to tackle controlling behaviour could lead to many more , according to police . <p> Sheffield man Mohammed Anwaar was jailed for 28 months for a prolonged series of attacks and restrictive , abusive behaviour towards his former partner Gemma Doherty . <h> Mohammed Anwaar <p> Nine of the 10 counts he admitted at Sheffield Crown Court were related to specific violent incidents . But the 10th was a new charge of controlling or coercive behaviour , only brought in at the end of the year . For that alone Anwaar , from Charlotte Road , received a 12-month prison sentence in court today ( Wednesday , May 18 ) . <p> The told Miss Doherty who she could see , what she was allowed to wear and what not to eat . He forced her to use a treadmill every day , showing her pictures of other women 's bodies and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The new law , which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years , was brought in to include such behaviours , which do not amount to violence but still cause someone to fear violence will be used against them , or generate serious alarm or distress that has a substantial effect on their usual day-to-day activities . <p> Abuse can include a pattern of threats , humiliation and intimidation , or behaviour such as stopping a partner socialising , controlling their social media accounts , surveillance through apps or dictating what they wear . <p> In a victim statement read out to the court yesterday , Miss Doherty said the relationship had started out ' perfect ' but everything changed in May 2015 . <p> " I knew how quickly his mood could change over the smallest thing , " she said . <p> Miss Doherty described how she no longer had any self confidence and was worried because Anwaar had a large family and she did n't want to go out in case she saw them . <p> " He ruined my daily life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated the case , said the new law gave South Yorkshire Police new powers to prosecute people who use coercive control , giving officers another way to tackle those who commit domestic abuse . <p> " In this case , both physical and mental abuse occurred over a prolonged period , and I would like to praise the woman in coming forward and reporting the matter to us , " he said . <p> " This has enabled us to not only bring to justice for his actions , but to also provide this woman with the necessary support in order to help her move forward with her life . " <p> Superintendent Natalie Shaw , the force lead for domestic abuse , added : " This is the first successful conviction we have had under the new legislation regarding coercive control , and I am pleased that Anwaar is now behind bars for his actions . <p> " Domestic abuse is wide ranging and is n't always clear to see upon first examination . Just because physical signs of abuse might not be present , it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coercive control can be extremely damaging to a person . <p> " I 'm pleased that coercive control is now legally recognised and we can continue to work with partners to effectively tackle domestic abuse cases and provide the support needed to those involved . <p> " I would also like to praise the bravery of the woman involved in this case as well as the work of the officers , which combined has helped to bring about this successful conviction . <p> " If you 're suffering from emotional , physical or psychological abuse , I 'd encourage you to report it to someone . <p> " If you do n't feel comfortable talking to the police , there are a wide range of support agencies and charities you can speak to . <p> " Please know that help is available and you do not have to suffer . " <p> Mixed in with Anwaar 's controlling behaviour were violent attacks , the most serious of which in August last year brought a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm . After an argument over money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with slaps and kicks , choking her and causing her to fall unconscious . <p> He assaulted her on five other occasions , often in front of her young sons . The most recent attack was on March 5 this year , again after an argument , and this was when police were called . <p> The court heard Anwaar slapped Miss Doherty two or three times around the back of the head , put his hands around her throat so she fell to the floor and choked her in a headlock . He continued the assault , hitting her again and calling her a dog . <p> Nicola Quinney , prosecuting , said Anwaar had held a knife to Miss Doherty 's throat , asking her if she wanted him to kill her , and saying he was n't scared of a life sentence . <p> During the attack , Miss Doherty 's son Ethan , three , was hiding under the bed . <p> Taking into account Anwaar 's previous convictions , which included several assaults causing actual bodily harm to other men , Judge Goose sentenced Anwaar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage , and 12 months for the controlling and coercive behaviour . He also imposed a five year restraining order . <p> Following the sentencing , Nicola Lambe , of Sheffield domestic abuse charity Ashiana , said : " The new legislation has and will continue to help raise awareness around all types of domestic abuse which will help protect women who are or have experienced this type of abuse and to also understand that this is abuse and the fear that this can instil can be damaging . <p> " Now there is a new legislation , women are more likely to understand and seek the support that they need . <p> Sheffield city councillor Cate McDonald , cabinet member for health and social care , added : " Controlling or coercive behaviour can take many different forms and can involve making someone do something they do n't want to do , repeatedly causing a victim harm and limiting someone 's freedom and independence . <p> " This type of behaviour can be incredibly harmful in an abusive relationship , where one person holds more power than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all types of domestic abuse in Sheffield and we do n't want people to suffer in silence .

 sweetest of voices in Sheffield <h> Eric Bibb <p> Inevitably , some concerts stick in the memory more than others . When it comes to the Memorial Hall at the back of Sheffield City Hall , performances over the years by Eric Bibb have never failed to hit the mark . <p> Essentially , the American singer and guitarist plays acoustic blues , but in a distinctive style that encompasses folk , soul and gospel . <p> Sheffield audiences have come to realise that an evening in his company is one of warmth and inspiration , with an almost spiritual dimension .

" <p> Claire added : " More than 25 girls have been attending regularly from across Sheffield including girls from Handsworth , Hillsborough , Fir Vale , Shiregreen and Sheffield Lane Top , with more joining all the time . There are plans to use this as a way of feeding back into local groups and the wider community over time , so that the giftings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Drawing from the GB programme , the ( 11-14s ) and ( 13-18s ) ages have had a range of themed activity nights , including a bake off , human board games , a trip to Jump Inc , movie night and making and donating table crafts to the local foodbank for their Christmas meal . <p> Claire added : " It 's been going brilliantly and while we 're still learning what the girls want and getting the mix of activities right , the girls are starting to talk about it and ask what 's coming next . " <p> Group member Millie , aged 12 , said : " I really enjoy the cluster group because I meet new people who go to GB . The activities are fun and interesting and you get to learn different skills .

 of points <h> EU <p> In response to Coun Teal 's letter printed on May 24 in which she argued on behalf of the Green Party for continued EU membership , may I make a couple of points ? <p> Most of the case she makes has been comprehensively refuted by other correspondents , though her assumption that workers from other countries in services such as the NHS is a good thing invites challenge . <p> It is , of course , true that the NHS relies upon large numbers of foreign skilled people . <p> The scandal is that these are mainly ' poached ' from poorer countries where they are needed more than here . This is effectively a form of neo-colonialism . <p> Another argument deployed by Coun Teal is that the undoubted pressure on schools , housing , NHS and jobs in some areas would have been eliminated by more public spending and less austerity . <p> Well , yes , but that is not the political context in which Britain finds itself . With four more years of the Tories and Labour unlikely to win a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So the pressure are genuine and problematic so can not be ignored . <p> Finally , I worry that left progressive people such as the Greens often seem to dismiss the public 's expressed ( and therefore real ) concern about aspects of immigration , disregarding the consequence of so doing . <p> Namely , the rise of the far right as we see in Austria and France , for example . It is rather ironic that , in the UK , the FPTP electoral system , which the Greens oppose , means that the fascist and racist parties are unlikely to gain many Parliamentary seats ! <p> Overall , it seems to me that the neo-liberal political experiment that is the EU is likely to collapse in its current form : the faults are already clear . Do we really want to remain in such an organisation ? I think not . Let 's instead work towards cooperative and amicable trading and other agreements post-Brexit to allow continuation of the benefits of being a European that Coun Teal highlights , without the well publicised downsides. <h> Advertisement <h> European

Photo : Chris Etchells <p> I 've lived in Sheffield all my life . Born at Nether Edge Hospital , I lived on Duchess Road until the age of seven , then moved to Chippingham Street in Attercliffe until the age of 15 when we moved to Carrill Road , Foxhill . I married Terry in 1981 and we settled down in Hillsborough and then where we 've stayed ever since . <p> Family ? <p> I have three sisters , two grown-up children , a girl and a boy and four grandsons who are the light of our lives and certainly keep me and Terry on our toes . <p> What do you do for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Home Office , where I 've been for 14 years . It can be challenging but I 'm really lucky to work with a fantastic team of people . <p> What do you like most of all about living in Sheffield ? <p> Sheffield has so much to offer , it 's hard to pin point just one thing - so how about I tell you my top three . <p> There 's the green open spaces - it would be hard to find a city with more . A third of Sheffield is located in the Peak District National Park - no other city can claim to have a National Park within its boundary . <p> And then there 's the variety of entertainment and leisure facilities on offer to suit people of all ages and abilities , which means that whether I 'm out with friends or looking after the grandkids we 're never stuck for things to do . Above all though it 's the people . Sheffield people are the salt of the earth -- warm and friendly . We are home to over half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins and cultures , working together to make it a lively multi-cultural and multi-lingual city , all helping each other and living in harmony . <p> Do you have a favourite place or hidden gem in the city ? <p> One of my favourite places of sanctuary is the Winter Garden . I love to see the plants as they change over the seasons and the different displays which are often quite unique the 100th birthday display for Winnie Blagden ( who received thousands of cards from across the world following a public appeal ) was definitely one of my favourites . <p> What is your favourite pub or place to eat in Sheffield - and why ? <p> The Bessemer Pub is one of my favourite haunts after a council meeting ! It 's just a really friendly place where everyone feels welcome . <p> If you could improve one thing about the city , what would it be - and why ? <p> My family and I experienced the strikes of the 1980s first hand . Things have improved so much since then but the number one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secure jobs . <p> Do you have any hobbies ? What do you like to do in your spare time ? <p> I enjoy jogging , which is one of the reasons I love Sheffield 's abundance of outdoors space whatever your ability or how far you want to run you can find a route to suit . <p> I also love reading , it 's how I wind down at the end of the day , I mean where else can you travel the world , solve a murder or fall in love without leaving your front room ? <p> And yes , I am a bit of a social butterfly I enjoy nothing more than spending time with my family and friends . Really that 's what life is all about , is n't it . <h> Hull wins ? 
 Mel Hewitt : The Poldark of the 70s cooks up a treat <h> Robin Ellis , star of the 1970s series Poldark , with his cookery books <p> This time last year many of us were still dealing with withdrawal symptoms after the last episode of Poldark had aired . It was a malady even the delightful Dr Enys could n't remedy . <p> The richly deserved success of the series stirred for me cherished memories of the original version , which aired in 1975 . <p> Robin Ellis played Ross and the late and much loved Angharad Rees was the unforgettable Demelza . <p> The impact of this heady , rich and romantic brew on my 14-year-old self was immeasurable and I have never forgotten it . <p> Robin 's cameo appearance in the new series as the Rev Dr Halse was a fitting and nod to the popularity of the first . <p> So , my curiosity stirred I was keen to find out what had been happening in the last 40 years to the man whom for many of us over 50 immortalised the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I knew he had been a member of the RSC , an actor whose wide range of work from Dennis Potter 's Blue Remembered Hills to Cleese and Booth 's Fawlty Towers was part of what many see as the golden age of television . <p> Well , in 1990 Robin and his wife Meredith moved to France and have created a life there that embraces Robin 's love of cooking , friends who love to visit , and their cats . <p> Since Robin 's diagnosis of Type two diabetes in 1999 his love of writing his book The Making of Poldark was published in the 1970s and food has flourished . <p> To enjoy what you eat , whether you have diabetes or not can take you in a new positive direction . <p> His first cookery book Delicious Dishes for Diabetics was published in 2011 .

 Billy Sharp speaks of his pride after being handed Blades captaincy <h> Billy Sharp has been confirmed as Sheffield United 's new captain <p> Billy Sharp has spoken of his pride after being installed as Sheffield United 's new club captain under boss Chris Wilder . <p> The Sheffield-born striker was informed of his appointment just before fellow Blades supporter Wilder was unveiled as Nigel Adkins ' successor in the Bramall Lane hotseat . <p> Sharp was in Manchester Airport waiting to board a flight when he heard the news , which he admits left him on cloud nine : " The gaffer called me and told me he was doing a press conference , and asked if it was OK to name me as his new skipper , " Sharp told The Star . <p> " It did n't take me long to say yes ! I had no hesitation . And to be honest , I 'm delighted . And proud . As are my family , they 're all proud of me . <p> " It has n't really sunk in yet , either , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team out . And to do that at Bramall Lane will be extra special . I ca n't wait . " <p> Sharp , who turned 30 in February , scored 21 goals last season and was one of a few leading lights in a disappointing campaign , which saw United finish 11th and resulted in Adkins losing his job . <p> " I think I 'm a good age to be a skipper , if there 's even such a thing , " Sharp added . <p> " At this stage of my career , I think I could be a good skipper - obviously , the gaffer thinks that too - and I have a good relationship with the fans . <p> " It 's a cliche that we need 11 captains out there on the field , but it 's true . We need everyone to be a leader , I 'm just the one who has to lead from the front I guess . <p> " There 'll be aspects of my game that I will have to change to suit the captaincy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change too much about my role . " <p> Sharp will be joined in pre-season training by returning colleague Marc McNulty , fresh from his successful spell on loan at Portsmouth . <p> The Scot scored 12 goals for Portsmouth in their failed Play-Off campaign , and Sharp said : " I was reflecting on the season the other day . Che Adams and myself scored 30 between us , Dom Calvert-Lewin scored eight on loan at Wilder 's Northampton and Sparky scored a few too . So I 'm sure the gaffer is excited by players who are capable of scoring goals . " <h> Posted ! <h>

 The end of Eaden and Best and the beginning for Stubbs <h> Nicky Eaden 's one match as Neil Redfearn 's No 2 <h> Paul Davis <p> He was always more than welcome in the media suite at New York Stadium , but it seemed wrong to see him there . <p> Nicky Eaden , the man brought to Rotherham United to be assistant manager only to find everything changing after just three days , became a regular visitor . <p> Appointed by Neil Redfearn on Friday February 5 , Eaden stood on the touchline as No 2 for only one game , the following day , before his boss was sacked on the Monday . <p> Neil Warnock came in with his own backroom team that same week to inspire the Millers ' famous Championship survival charge and there was never really a first-team role to satisfy Eaden thereafter . <p> At home matches , he would pop into the press room at half-time and grab himself a hot drink . <p> While Warnock , Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson attended to playing matters in the dressing room as Rotherham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eaden would queue for his tea or coffee with the assembled journalists . <h> New manager Alan Stubbs <p> It was n't the club 's fault . It was n't his . Through a cruel twist of circumstance , a man with much to offer was never given the opportunity to show his true worth . <p> The 43-year-old former top-flight player with Barnsley and Wigan Athletic had been lured away from a steady job leading the under-21s at Premier League Leicester City , where he had built up a good reputation . <p> Then a horrible last-minute 2-1 defeat in the rain at bottom club Bolton Wanderers saw the end for Redfearn and the beginning of the end for his one-time Oakwell teammate who finally cut his ties with the Millers last week . <p> The 's taciturn demeanour did n't mask an engaging dry wit and he was well liked , but taking training for fringe players with little or no chance of making Warnock 's squad was n't what he 'd signed up for . <p> There was a feeling at the club that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events had conspired unfairly against him . <p> However , last Thursday saw the arrival of Warnock 's successor , Alan Stubbs , on a deal until 2019 , and a day later Eaden parted company with Rotherham by mutual consent . <p> Stubbs has his own ideas and own assistant in John Doolan . But the split had been coming before the unveiling of the former Hibernian manager . <h> Leon Best and that unforgettable day against Derby <p> Warnock , like Eaden , is also gone , but his thinking may well still be felt as Stubbs , who twice came close to promotion to the Scottish Premier League in his two years with Hibs and lifted the Scottish FA Cup only two weeks ago , embarks on his first managerial job in English football . <p> The Liverpudlian plans on speaking to Warnock and other past encumbents of the Rotherham hot-seat . <p> " It 's important that you draw in everybody 's knowledge , " he said , " If I do n't speak to previous managers about the club , what it entails and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . <p> " I need to engulf myself in what they know , and if I can add to it and make it better , then fantastic . " <p> The reaction to Stubbs ' appointment from a town still remembering Warnock 's heroics was pleasingly warm , offset by some dissenters . The acclaim for the impact he made at his first press conference was unanimous . <p> There were no frills , bluster or attempt to work the room , just conviction and common sense from a man comfortable with the responsibilty of moving the Millers up the Championship table . <p> He was a top-class centre-half in his day and reminded me of another character , well respected in these parts , who never shied away from a battle in the heart of the defence . <p> Craig Morgan . <p> Stubbs is back in Edinburgh on Monday and Tuesday , tidying up personal business and determined to say goodbye face to face with as many Hibernian staff and friends as he can . <p> He also plans to phone every Hibs player individually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain Lee Frecklington . <p> He 's that kind of man . <p> Meanwhile , 15 minutes prior to a club statement announcing Eaden 's departure had come confirmation of the first exit of the Stubbs era . <p> Striker Leon Best scored four goals in the Millers ' survival push and had been offered new terms , with his short-term contract due to expire . <p> That was before Stubbs ' appointment . The had n't accepted and is now free to find another club . The new boss 's influence will have been felt more in this farewell . <p> Best was signed by Redfearn and shone on his debut at Leeds United before going AWOL through a red card at Elland Road and a groin injury until he became a regular under Warnock . <p> He was never completely match-fit after surgery , but his physical presence and ability to hold up the ball were important to the Millers ' throughout the 11-match unbeaten run which secured their place in the second tier . <p> His high point came in the draw against high-flying Derby County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last seven minutes of New York mayhem as Rotherham stormed back from 3-0 down to earn a point . <p> A week later he scored the only goal at Ipswich Town as the Millers closed out mad March with 10 points from a possible 12 against teams in the promotion mix . <p> Warnock rated him . And , while Best , with his Premier League background , may have thought he was worth a bigger club than Rotherham , the centre-forward literally gave blood for the cause . Best 's hernia had been a bad one and , despite the operation , he would bleed after matches . <p> The verdict on four other out-of-contract men made offers before the Millers turned to Stubbs should be in soon . <p> Leaving aside Kirk Broadfoot , Richard Wood , Stephen Kelly and Matt Derbyshire , the new man has been left only 10 contracted players . But the is already planning his new signings , and the quality of his did n't go unnoticed in Scotland . <p> " I walked into Hibs with a similar situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was a long time there since a manager survived one AGM . I managed to survive two so I must have been doing something right . " <p> Already in his short time in South Yorkshire he 's spoken of liking to give young talent a chance and of trusting his own eye for a player . <p> He 's talked about good results bringing stability , about the " good nucleus " of players already at New York , about the importance of man-management , about his belief that people will enjoy working under him . <p> But he added : " The most important thing is recruitment . " <p> He went on : " I think the Scottish market is one I am aware of . But we 're going to try to utilise every market . We 'd be missing a trick if we did n't , whether it 's the loan market , free transfers , a transfer . We want to be competitive and utilise the budget in the best possible way that we can .

 of child sex abuse to South Yorkshire Police last year <h> Dan Hobson <p> Almost 900 reports of child sexual exploitation have been made to South Yorkshire Police in the last year alone , according to a new report . <p> The study by South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings states that 894 reports of child sexual exploitation were made between April 2015 and March 2016 -- an average of 75 per month . <p> The report further states that the force is currently investigating 183 child sex abuse cases . <p> Dr Billings said in the report that 50 per cent of the child sex cases recorded relate to offending occurring more than a year prior to the incident , but many are ' committed considerably earlier ' . <p> He said : " The historic nature of many of the recorded child sexual exploitation crimes makes them extremely difficult to investigate . <p> The findings come less than three months after the Drew Report concluded South Yorkshire Police had been ' seriously under-resourced ' in its early attempts to tackle CSE and its response to safeguarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rotherham . <p> The Drew Report was commissioned in the wake of the Jay Report which found that at least 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 . <p> Dr Billings said : " In the past 12 months , South Yorkshire has received considerable scrutiny in the area of child sexual exploitation and has feedback from several sources . <p> " The HMIC in their most recent inspection covering CSE noted that South Yorkshire Police had a ' very good understanding " of child sexual exploitation .

 of Government support for Sheffield trade mission to Canada <h> William Beckett of the International Trade Forum <p> The organiser of a Sheffield trade mission to Canada has hit out after the Government offered ? 200 in travel costs days before it starts . <p> William Beckett , of the International Trade Forum , said he was " incredibly frustrated and annoyed " at the offer which came too late for anyone to join the trip , starting on June 6 . <p> He is one of 12 people from seven companies set to meet bosses and government officials and attend the Global Petroleum Show in Calgary . <p> The mission , being led by Master Cutler Craig McKay , had the backing of 25 companies when it was announced last year , Mr Beckett said . <p> But this fell to just seven due to government export body UKTI ending financial support for trade missions at the end of March and a downturn in the oil and gas sector . <p> On Wednesday , UKTI reversed its decision and offered ? 200 per person towards travel costs after pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beckett , who sold his Sheffield plastics firm last year , said : " I 'm incredibly annoyed and frustrated , it 's too late for people to rearrange things and join the mission . <p> " To get people to go out there is no easy task , small companies need support . <p> " It is a ridiculous situation when the Government has a target of hitting ? 1 trillion annual exports and 100,000 new exporting companies . " <p> But Mr Beckett said there was a silver lining the row had led to the visit taking on a new importance and more high level meetings were planned , including with the Canadian government minister of trade . <p> A BIS spokesman said : " UKTI is also offering soft support .

 : Government may launch public inquiry <h> A public inquiry may be held into the infamous Battle of Orgreave <h> Ben Green , Acting Head of Digital <h> A Home Office minister has suggested the Government may launch an inquiry in to the Battle of Orgreave . <p> Mike Penning said Home Secretary Theresa May has a ' track record ' of considering similar inquiries . Calls for a public inquiry into the confrontation during the 1984 national miners ' strike have strengthened following the Hillsborough disaster inquests , which revealed two senior police officers and a solicitor were linked to both investigations . The Battle of Orgreave saw thousands of police officers and picketing miners clash at a coking plant at Orgreave . Dozens of miners were charged over the incident but their trials collapsed when police evidence was deemed unreliable . Speaking during Home Office questions in the Commons , shadow Home Office minister and Rotherham MP , Sarah Champion , said : " For the police to be effective they need to be trusted by the community they serve . Truth is built by being honest about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing and grant the request of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign and nearly 100 cross-party MPs for a full inquiry on what exactly happened on June 18 , 32 years ago in the Battle of Orgreave ? " Policing Minister Mike Penning said : " You raise a very , very important point . " The Home Secretary has a track record of looking at this sort of thing very open mindedly , in perhaps a way that no other Home Secretary has ever done and Hillsborough has proven that . " We will look at Orgreave , we 're still looking at it at the moment . " The confidence in our police can only be there if we have a transparent system when complaints take place and that 's exactly what ( the Policing and Crime Bill ) is taking through the House . " Last year police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission said the passage of time prevented a formal investigation into the police 's handling of events at Orgreave. @ @ @ @ had

 list <h> Sheffield 's Women Of Steel <p> I would just like to thank The Star for publishing my letter on the omission of many of the Women of Steel names from the roll of honour printed in The Star 's Women of Steel special edition . <p> I now understand this was due to Sheffield council 's confidentiality protocols and the oversight of a tick box on the medal application form by the event organisers in seeking permission to all recipients of the medal that would have allowed the full list of names to be published in The Star . <p> However , when I contacted Julie Dore about this omission and asked that the small cost in sending out a form to all those who received a medal , including those family members who got one on behalf of the Women of Steel no longer with us , the only answer I had back was to say it may be considered in the future as names were still being received . <p> I regard that as council speak that it will now be kicked into the long grass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that Sheffielders will help in my efforts to urge the council to seek the required permissions . <p> If you feel you would like to help those missed from the list please email Julie Dore at **27;333;TOOLONG <p> The Star editor has expressed her willingness to publish the full list ASAP and this is also noted . <p> Shadow chancellor John 
 readjustment of going back home <h> Daniel Sutherland <p> As another university term comes to a close , thousands of students have begun their annual pilgrimage home . <p> It is an occasion that many students look forward to - scattering to all corners of the country and beyond for ( in most cases ) a well-earned rest . <p> I am one of those many thousands , retreating home from my student-digs for some nicely cooked food , the company of familiar faces and a free washing service ( sorry mum ) . <p> However for the first few weeks being back home , I find there is a difficult period of readjustment . <p> After months of being in control of your own destiny , there is now suddenly a structure to adhere to and chores to be done when other people say so . <p> You are often your own best friend whilst away and though you live with others , you often do things , such as cooking and washing , by yourself . <p> This means you start to develop your own routine , away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes getting used to the accommodating , selfless nature of family life again is quite difficult and sometimes you begin to question why you have decided to come back for so long . <p> I am aware that I possibly sound like I am being ungrateful for what my parents give me , but believe me I am not . <p> I fully recognise the sacrifices they make for me and the patience they have to keep smiling when I turn up back home with all my dirty laundry - expecting it to be cleaned . <p> A lot of home life is better , I think . It is always lovely to see those you leave behind when you study away and I am yet to meet a student can cook anything as good as they get it ' back home .

 story of St Luke 's poster star <h> John Highfield <p> IF you 've been driving around Sheffield very much in the past few weeks you 'll have seen rather a lot of Wendy Cooper . <p> At 56 years old , the last thing Wendy ever expected was that she would become the star of a major poster campaign , her face smiling down from billboards across Sheffield . <p> But then the other thing she never thought would happen to her is that she would spend a decade of her life living with cancer . <p> Yet it is her positive approach to life with a terminal illness that made her the perfect star of a new publicity campaign for St Luke 's Hospice , where she is a patient . <p> Wendy 's attitude to her illness is perfectly summed up by the message on the posters : " I 'm still here . Still . Still Wendy . " <p> It 's a positive response that has helped her through the ten years since she was first diagnosed with cancer , bolstered by the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It was Christmas time and I thought I just had indigestion , " she remembers . <p> " I came into the hospital and that was when they told me I had breast cancer . Then two weeks after that I was told I had bone cancer and not long back I found out I had liver cancer . " <p> At the time of the initial diagnosis Wendy , who lives in the Intake area and was then still working as an assistant at Sheffield 's Talbot Special School , also discovered that daughter Emma was pregnant . <p> " Emma thought she had kidney problems so I took her to hospital and we found out then that she was just two weeks pregnant , " Wendy says . <p> " I was convinced that I would n't be here to see the baby being born but I was and it was one of the best moments of my life . <p> " If anything , since then , my condition has brought me even closer to Kayden , he 's grown up with it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is that level of family support that helps Wendy remains positive and if she does have inevitable moments of doubt and fear for the future , they are not the ones she chooses to share . <p> " When you hear the Big C all all you think is : ' I 'm going to die . ' My mum died of cancer and I just thought : ' I 'm going the same way , ' " she says , though it is clear that she still believes very strongly that she has plenty of life to live and that with the support of the St Luke 's team she will be able to do just that . <p> Wendy is a patient at Weston Park Cancer Hospital - one of only four dedicated cancer hospitals in the country and it was through her specialist there that she eventually received a referral to St Luke 's . <p> " St Luke 's has been a big part of my life , " Wendy admits . " My specialist at Weston Park always knows when I 'm feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll send her up to her favourite place , send her to St Luke 's . ' And it is my favourite place . " <p> Wendy is a regular at the St Luke 's Therapies and Rehabilitation Centre where she has found that the support of art therapy sessions has been invaluable . <p> And is where she has discovered a talent she never knew she had making her own unique design silk scarves , which she then sells to raise funds for St Luke 's . <p> " Over the years I 've made many of these scarves , " she says . <p> " I sell them at at schools where I used to work . <p> " It 's just to give something back . Doing this is the only way I know how , something I do n't think I want to be stopping soon -- I just love it ! " <p> Wendy knows too that she gets far more out of the hospice than the pleasure of discovering a talent for art and creativity . <p> " It means ever such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all alone , " she explains . <p> " Everybody picks you up . " <p> Like every St Luke 's patient , however , Wendy adds that she was uncertain what to expect when she first visited the hospice . <p> " I think everyone 's surprised , " she says . " They do n't know what to expect on that first visit , they 're a bit nervous . <p> " But they come in and have a cup of tea and it 's just a different way of life when they come in here . I <p> " It 's just a great place to be . <p> " It is my favourite place and it means a lot the day centre , the people . " St Luke 's helps me to remember that I 'm still me .

 ... Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visits Doncaster as part of the ' Remain ' campaign and is joined by local MPs Ed Miliband , Rosie Winterton and Caroline Flint . Picture Scott Merrylees <p> Sheffield Labour supporters are divided in their opinions over the future of party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the wake of Brexit . <p> Following last week 's referendum , where 51 per cent of voters backed Britain leaving the European Union , Mr Corbyn has been heavily criticised over his ' lacklustre ' campaigning to remain in the EU . <p> Wentworth and Dearne MP John Healey is among those who have resigned from the shadow cabinet , while fellow South Yorkshire MP Angela Smith , MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge , has gone on the record to say she does ' not believe Jeremy offers the strong leadership required at this difficult time . ' <p> The Star took to the streets of Sheffield to find out what locals think about the future of Mr Corbyn as Labour leader . <p> Although some had faith inhim , many found it difficult to see the current leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the job . <p> Jeremy Hall , aged 55 , a project manager from the city centre , said : " Labour seems to be in chaos at the moment after the Brexit poll , so I think they need to sort themselves out . " <p> Finance manager , Simon Sheldon , 44 , agreed and said : " In the current state at the moment , the Labour Party , I do n't think it 's fit for purpose . There 's a lot of revolt going off and I think they just need to step back and decide what they 're doing . " <p> Hannah Sturridge , aged 24 , expressed her dissatisfaction with the current political situation and said Brexit has affected younger people like herself regarding unemployment . <p> Other locals were more supportive of Mr Corbyn 's leadership . Sales representative Andy Gray said the Labour party 's ability to lead is about more than just Brexit . <p> The 22-year-old , from Queen Street , said : " The European issue , which we have just had , is just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just that . I think Corbyn seems reasonably popular around people my age and going forward they still might be strong . " <p> The Remain voters expressed disappointment at the overall Brexit outcome but one said Labour are more representative than the Conservative party . <p> Sarah Bridge , a 28-year-old trainee teacher from Upperthorpe , said : " I am very against the whole Brexit thing so I find it very difficult to talk about really because I would n't like anyone to take us forward with that . But if anyone was going to take us forward with Brexit , Labour are the only people who I know what they 're planning on doing . " <p> The Labour party itself is also divided on Mr Corbyn 's leadership . He has faced many high profile resignations from his shadow cabinet since the initial sacking of Yorkshire MP Hilary Benn . <p> One of the latest resignations came from Wentworth and Dearne MP John Healey , who said he personally handed his resignation letter to Mr Corbyn after meetings today . In the letter he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your failure to recognise the turmoil after the referendum vote , a likely autumn election , the responsibility to hold the Labour Party together and the very wide and ever widening concerns about your leadership require a fresh leadership election , with you stepping aside as Leader to seek a new mandate if you aspire to lead Labour into the coming General Election . " <p> He added Mr Corbyn was ' not prepared ' to ' accept social responsibility ' in the wake of the Brexit vote . <p> James Stonehouse , aged 31 , from the south east of the city , commented on the resignations and current Labour leadership . He said : " I think it remains to be seen whether or not the Labour party is right for Sheffield following Brexit . The response of the party at the moment seems to have been somewhat muted . They 're embroiled in turmoil following all these resignations . I think we need to watch this space . I 'm not personally entirely happy with the present leadership of the party . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Labour Party . Sheffield Trades Union Congress , the body which represents trade union branches in the city , has backed Mr Corbyn 's leadership and urged Sheffield Labour MPs to avoid backing a ' coup ' attempt against Corbyn , led by members of the Parliamentary Labour Party . <p> Sheffield TUC secretary , Martin Mayer said : " A divisive new leadership contest would risk bringing civil war into our Party at a time when we need to unite and fight the Tories and engage with our working class communities ravaged by austerity spending cuts on housing , welfare and jobs . <p> " Had Labour MPs respected his overwhelming democratic mandate and given Jeremy their backing from the start instead of a constant stream of bitter personal attacks and public acts of disloyalty , then Labour would be riding much higher in the polls . There is no doubt Jeremy is highly popular among Labour voters . " <p> He said Mr Corbyn fought a ' tireless and honest ' EU campaign , rejecting the view he lost the EU referendum for Remain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour Party 's rank and file membership nine months ago . Sheffield TUC said they see this as a ' clear statement that the Party wanted a major shift away from New Labour politics of ' ' and a new vision of positive investment , sustainable growth , decent jobs , trade union rights , a council house rebuilding programme and a strong welfare state . ' <p> However Penistone and Stocksbridge MP Angela Smith said : " I respect Jeremy Corbyn as a man of principle . However in the light of the new circumstances that we face as a country following the EU Referendum , I do not believe Jeremy offers the strong leadership required at this difficult time . After a lacklustre performance in the EU Referendum , I have drawn the conclusion that Jeremy is not the strong and effective leader that we need , and the country needs in the forthcoming period , characterised as it will be by political and economic instability .

They have done fantastically , and done everything asked of them . <p> " When I arrived I was told players did n't turn up to play for their country or that they pulled out at the last minute .

's flick-on after losing Kyle Walker a little too easily . <p> It was a goal that brought England back down to earth with an almighty bump and then , the unthinkable happened ; Iceland went ahead , when Sigthorsson 's shot from around 14 yards squirmed under Hart 's left hand and bobbled agonisingly over the line . <h> And for Roy Hodgson , too , who quit after the game <p> It was Hart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gareth Bale 's free-kick against Wales , and the Manchester City goalkeeper held up his hands in apology to England 's travelling support at the full-time whistle . <p> Hart had to be alert once again to deny Cardiff City 's Aron Gunnarsson on the break , and only once 18-year-old Marcus Rashford was introduced , with minutes to spare , did England show any real attacking impetus . <p> " It 's been a fantastic journey , these four years , and it 's one I 'll look back on or remember with pride , " Hodgson said . <p> " But we 've been unable to deliver .

No11 is next door to the main hostel and acts as a stepping stone for the young people moving from the hostel to their own tenancy . <p> It consists of five self contained flats for eight young people and gives them the next step towards independence with the same support they have in the hostel .

" <p> Toni is now volunteering with the National Citizen Service , helping other people develop their skills for work and life and is looking forward to getting her own place to call home soon . <p> Over the years , Roundabout has found that the most common risk to a young person becoming homeless is problems within the family , which often then leads to feeling the need to leave home .

" Managers always have players like that and I think it says a lot about the guy that I wanted to do it again . <p> " He was made available , for whatever reason , and as I 've explained before , it 's not always about paying a fee . You can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , I think this is a really smart piece of business . " <p> Wright , aged 30 , captained Oxford to promotion from League Two last term before leaving The Kassam Stadium by mutual consent .

" He wo n't want to be in the stands . " But , no matter what he 's doing , Jake will be getting lads fired up . Like Willo , Jake really wants to grab this opportunity . <p> " They are n't players who think they are at the stage of their career when they can come here for a big pay day before they get the golf clubs out .

We want proper players who can handle the expectation of being at this football club . " <p> Fleck , who joins United following a successful spell with Coventry City , certainly ticks that particular box after progressing through the ranks at Glasgow giants Rangers . <p> The midfielder was excused from duty at Bracken Moor after joining United as a free agent . But , like Wright , he is expected to feature when they face a Murcia Representative XI on Thursday evening . <p> " Blimey , it you can play for that club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win no matter what , then you can handle anything , " Wilder , reflecting on Fleck 's time at Ibrox , said . <h> Matt Done on the scoresheet <p> " Alan ( Knill ) , myself and the rest of the coaching staff are really looking forward to working with him . He 's a good kid too . He could have been down the road getting his stuff together but he wanted to be here with the lads . And that speaks volumes . " <p> " John was outstanding for Coventry and was their Player of the Year last season , " Wilder added . " They 'll be disappointed to see him leave . Our supporters know what a footballer is all about and I think the reaction of him coming in tells you that . John is aggressive , he 's combative and he likes to get on the ball . Basically , he 's a proper player . " <p> Although it must be measured against the level of opposition , United 's display at Steels was illuminating . Not least because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing stages of Nigel Adkins ' regime last term . <p> With Marc McNulty and Matt Done both scoring twice before the break , United played brutally effective football . There was an intelligence about their work . But also a simplicity too , with defenders and midfielders encouraged , Wilder later explained , to " pass forward " whenever the opportunity arose . Possession was used rather than just maintained . Che Adams was on target after the interval while Academy graduate David Brooks caught the eye . <p> Likewise O'Connell who , on this evidence , appears another astute investment . <p> " I think you 've just seen what Jack is all about , " Wilder said . " He comes for the ball , he recovers well , he organises and he 's got a sweet left foot . I 've got a lot of respect for Mark Warburton who took him down to Brentford .

Wednesday are really going places and the buzz around the club is amazing . <p> " It 's a call to action for all Wednesdayites to turn up in blue and white along with their Wednesday scarves . <p> " We 've arranged with the Kop band to start playing the ' We 're all Wednesday Are n't We ? ' song and it 's a cue for fans to wave their scarves above their heads right after kick-off . We mentioned the atmosphere at some home games was a bit below par and we launched a campaign to try to improve things . <p> " The noise at the Ipswich , Cardiff and Brighton play-off games was fantastic at the back end of last season and it 's something we want to carry on .

In the stock room , I see organised rails of carefully steamed clothes and boxes of labelled items waiting to be shipped down to the shop floor .

" <h> Long gone are the days when charity shops were just glorified jumble sales <p> Catherine Hatch <p> Catherine has run the Sheffield shop - one of six in the city - for the past 11 years . And if you have n't set foot in a charity shop in the past ten years , you do n't know what you 're missing . Gone are the little old ladies with blue rinses working their way along crowded rails , fingering faded and out-dated clothing . Gone is the smell of mothballs and the board games with a half dozen missing pieces . Instead I see a pair of students hunting for treasure in the clothing section ( is that Prada ? ! ) while a father and daughter are browsing books in the corner and a middle-aged woman is eyeing up a beautiful china set on display in a nearby glass cabinet . <p> " Our main demographic are females aged 18 to 40 , and so we 've given our shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with all the other shops on the high street .

Everything that comes to us is carefully sorted , so you 'll never find a designer dress with the same price on it as a Primark dress . We 've had Jimmy Choo shoes and Alexander McQueen suits and two of my volunteers have even been married in wedding dresses that were donated ! <p> " Last week we sold two gold chains for almost ? 800 - people are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive turnover of new stock and very little waste . Statistics have shown that items are most likely to sell in the first four days , so items only stay on the shop floor for two weeks before being culled and , either sent on to a different Oxfam shop , or to the charity 's own redistribution plant in Batley . Even items that ca n't be sold , because they 're damaged or stained , are sent to women 's group in Senegal , where they are repaired and then sold at market . <h> Linda West in Ecclesall Road Oxfam shop <p> And next week , the store will truly burst into the 21st century as its launches its online shop . <p> Catherine adds : " There are about 700 Oxfam shops in this country and around 400 of these already have online shops , including two in Sheffield that are running very successfully . 59.000 customers a week already shop with Oxfam in the UK , spending an average of ? 33 each time they visit .

Rather than just people who visit us on Ecclesall Road , we 'll be able to reach everyone , everywhere . You 'll be able to search our stock the same way you can at any other online store .

 Sheffield was named the world 's best beer city in a report earlier this year . But what secrets do its seven hills hold to justify that title ? <p> According to some of the city 's brewers , it 's a perfect mix of creativity , passion and tradition that come together to produce a bewildering array of beers to rival anywhere else across the globe . <h> Sheffield Brewery Company . <p> A report published in April as part of Sheffield 's Year of Making named the city the best for beer in the world . There were several reasons for the title , but key was the number of breweries in the city and the wider region . <p> The report identified 23 breweries within Sheffield 's borders , and a further 34 across South Yorkshire and North East Derbyshire . Importantly , many of these are new , and most are expanding . <h> Sheffield Brewery Company . <p> One , Sentinal Brewing , opened just this year , combining an in-house brewery with a bar serving food on Shoreham Street . <p> While the company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of experience . He worked for Bass Charrington and Co both in Sheffield and elsewhere for many years , before setting up a consultancy educating companies on beer storage and use . He saw the drinking scene change , from factory workers enjoying a pint of Stones or Wards to today 's more diverse demand . <p> " From a time when there were four big breweries and a lot of local passion , that was all ripped out by big companies , " said Alex . " What was left ? <p> " We have got a lot to be proud of in terms of the developed craft scene , but it will never reach the heights of what it used to be . <h> Sentinel Brewhouse . Picture : Andrew Roe <p> " But in a lot of ways , that 's a good thing because customers want things differently . " <p> Alex 's approach focuses on quality , and keeping as short a distance between production and consumption as possible . His brewing machinery is just yards from the bar . <p> " I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do a whole range that would cover most tastes . " <p> The range includes a Czech pilsner , bitters , a stout , an IPA and a number of other guest and bottled beers . <p> This reflects the picture across the city , but Alex thinks more can be done to shout about Sheffield 's offer . <p> He said : " There are opportunities for a Sheffield Independent Brewer 's Association . For a much more united body as a result of the beer report . " <p> One of the city 's more traditional firms is Sheffield Brewery Company . It was set up in 2006 by Dr Tim Stillman , formerly a biochemist at the University of Sheffield . <p> Working with Eddie Munnelly , landlord of the Gardener 's Rest pub in Neepsend Lane , he took over a Victorian factory in Kelham Island dating back to 1850 and starting making real ale . <p> As an active member of the Campaign for Real Ale , or Camra , Tim was well aware of the Sheffield beer scene . He produced a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewery Company it became the fifth microbrewery in the city , but that number soon rose . <p> " Since then it has really mushroomed into a large number , " said Tim . <h> Wards Brewery 1979 <p> " It 's a positive but there is not necessarily that big an increase in the number of free houses . So whereas you used to have your beer in a pub on rotation , now you join a queue . <p> " So it 's a bit more competitive . " <p> This is a huge benefit to the customer , who gets a bigger choice , and encourages brewers to be at their best . And although the craft beer revolution is sweeping the city and the world , Tim believes the traditional Sheffield drinker still has a soft spot for a pale , hoppy ale , such as his own Five Rivers . <p> " Our customers are not very forgiving , so we have to make sure it 's perfect all the time , " he said . <p> Sheffield Brewery Company is expanding , bringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nick who appeared on Songs of Praise on Sunday does n't shy away from non-traditional flavours . <p> But the future in a busy market could be partnerships with breweries . Tim said : " The way it 's going forward is that breweries are taking on leases of pubs . In that was they can make sure their bar is stocked with their beer . " <p> One man who sees the appetite for Sheffield beer is Sean Clarke , who runs the Beer Central shop in the Moor Market . He sells a wide range of beers produced in the city , alongside those from across the world ranging from traditional ales by Kelham Island Brewery and Bradfield Brewery , to more modern craft beers from Lost Industry and North Union . <p> " Perhaps not from a point of view of volume , but from a point of view of variety , imagination and accessibility , the beer scene in Sheffield is as good as it 's ever been , " he said . <p> Some of the more unusual flavours and colourful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheffield 's newer brewers . Hillsborough 's Lost Industry , for example , has come up with a rhubarb pie saison with an actual rhubarb pie thrown into the mix to add flavour . <p> The firm stands out thanks also to its colourful labels and thoughtful names , which link into Sheffield 's heritage . There 's Hole i n't Road , named after the famous subterranean roundabout , or Lizzie Ward , named after the elephant that inspired the Herd of Sheffield trail . <p> Sean said : " It feels small but very creative and different to just knocking out a four per cent blonde beer . " <p> Plenty of people still come into Beer Central asking for Bradfield and Kelham Island ales , and the traditional real ale scene is alive and well . <p> " But there 's another group that perhaps has more of a loyalty to beer in general , more than a geographical area , " said Sean . <p> And if Sheffield continues to produce good beer , then it will have no problem marketing itself further afield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sean . <p> HISTORY LESSON <p> Sheffield has a long history of brewing . Production grew to cope with mass demand created as the industrial revolution gathered speed , and consumption peaked towards the end of the 19th century . <p> But brewing began a slow and steady decline as consolidation took hold . Brewers began to acquire each other simply to increase their estates . <p> By the start of the First World War there were fewer than 20 breweries left in Sheffield , and that number continued to fall . <p> The industry did experience a resurgence in the 1950s , thanks in part to the Hope and Anchor brewery on Mowbray Street . The company struck a transatlantic distribution deal with Canadian entrepreneur EP Taylor , who agreed to distribute Hope and Anchor 's stout in North American while the Sheffield firm would sell Taylor 's Carling Black Label lager . <p> Taylor then bought the brewery and began expanding . He created Northern Breweries , which got bigger and bigger to become United Breweries , owning 2,800 pubs by 1961 . <p> This expansion quickly overtook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small part of Bass Charrington and Co , and famous Sheffield names such as Ward 's and Stones being bought by national companies and production being moved out of the city . <p> Stones beer itself at one point had huge popularity , and in the early 1990s was the best-selling bitter in the UK . But by 1998 the Stones brewery had closed , with Ward 's to follow a year later . <p> But the appetite for good quality beer had not disappeared in Sheffield . Dave Wickett , a lecturer , opened a pub in what was then a derelict Kelham Island known best as the city 's red light district . His plan was to focus on real ale when the majority of British drinkers were buying lager . <p> When Wickett 's pub The Fat Cat opened , there were queues down the street . <p> That was followed by Kelham Island Brewery 10 years later , inspiring a real ale revolution in Sheffield - well ahead of the national trend - and eventually leading to the flourishing brewing scene the city enjoys today . <h> Councillor Ray Nowak 
 childhood home was Oasis safehouse in case of Knebworth terrorist attack <h> Oasis in 1996 . <h> Darren Burke , Communities reporter <p> Sheffield band Drenge have claimed their childhood home was a safehouse for Britpop legends Oasis in case of a terrorist attack on the 20th anniversary of their infamous Knebworth gigs . <p> Noel and Liam Gallagher and their band played to more than 250,000 at the country estate on August 10-11 1996 - and the concerts have gone down in music folklore . <p> Now , two decades on , the Sheffield indie rockers have revealed that their then Hertfordshire home would have been used as a safehouse in the event of a terror attack on the concert . <p> Writing on Twitter exactly 20 years on , brothers Eoin and Rory Loveless of Drenge said that they lived in Hitchin and their mother worked at the outdoor venue but had that weekend off . <p> " If there had been a terrorist attack at Knebworth , Noel and Liam and the lads would 've been taken to our house , " the brothers claimed , adding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as they were " very young " . <p> The house is a 17 minute drive from Knebworth where the concert was held and which also featured the likes of the Manic Street Preachers , The Charlatans , Ocean Colour Scene , Kula Shaker , The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy . <p> Drenge grew up in Castleton , Derbyshire , where they formed the band in 2011 , before relocating to Sheffield in 2014. <p> Tottenham 's attempt

 parents fined for taking children on term-time holidays <h> School girls playing truant . Pic : PA <h> Chris Burn <p> More than 6,000 fines have been issued to parents whose children have missed school in Sheffield in the past three years . <p> And most have been handed to parents who take their children on holiday during term-time , rather than pay sky-high prices during school holidays . <p> A Freedom of Information response by Sheffield Council reveals a total of 6,512 truancy fines have been issued , but more than 1,600 were withdrawn -- meaning 4,893 people have paid fines for their children failing to go to school . <p> In the 2013-14 academic year , 1,346 fines were issued 1,199 for unauthorised holidays and 147 for non-attendance but 455 of the fines were eventually withdrawn . <p> In 2014-15 , 3,036 holiday fines and 107 attendance fines were sent out , a total of 3,143 . But 762 of these fines were later withdrawn . <p> So far this year , 1,810 families have been issued with fines notices for taking children on holiday during term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children failing to attend school regularly .

One of the main reasons fines are withdrawn is when the council decides it is not in the public interest to take a case to court . <p> Other reasons include them being incorrectly issued , sent to the wrong person or there being exceptional circumstances for a child being off that a school has not taken into account . <p> A Sheffield Council spokeswoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in education have higher attainment , and this is something we work closely with schools on in order to improve pupils ' attendance . <p> " Our big ambition is that all Sheffield children , young people and families achieve their full potential and attending school every day is an important part in this . <p> " Schools take different approaches depending on their individual circumstances and the children at their school . <p> " These decisions are n't taken lightly by schools -- but are taken in the interest of the child 's education . We work with schools to look at patterns and trends and collect the fines . <p> " This money is then re-invested in resources to support attendance . " <p> The council 's code of conduct on the issue says such fines are ' never used as a punishment ' but as a way of attempting to improve attendance . <p> " Parents and pupils are supported at school and the local authority will work to overcome barriers to regular attendance through a wide continuum of assessment and intervention strategies , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use only where parental co-operation in this process is either absent , or deemed insufficient to resolve the presenting problem . <p> " Sanctions are never used as a punishment , only as a means of enforcing attendance where there is a reasonable expectation that their use will secure an improvement .

 Will Middlesbrough winger Harry Chapman be the first of many at Bramall Lane ? <h> Harry Chapman ( right ) in action for Middlesbrough 's under-21 's <h> James Shield <p> There is a video on You Tube which shows Harry Chapman dancing past two defenders during a UEFA Youth League tie against Torino before sweeping the ball past the goalkeeper and into the back of the Italian 's net . <p> The winger , who joined Sheffield United on a season long loan from Middlesbrough yesterday , would be facing Stoke City rather than Rochdale this afternoon if he was capable of such magic every week . <p> But Chris Wilder , who is poised to hand the teenager his debut against Keith Hill 's side , is convinced the League One club have acquired a footballer of considerable talent . <p> " Harry is a highly-rated wide player with plenty of ability and I 'm sure he 's going to excite our supporters , " he said . " We 're delighted to be able to bring him here . " <p> Chapman , aged 18 , becomes Wilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago . And , with the former Northampton Town and Oxford chief outlining plans to forge closer relationships with top-flight teams , he is unlikely to be the last . Although Wilder 's plans to bolster United 's midfield options could be delayed until several unwanted or development players leave Bramall Lane , talks are known to have taken place with several other potential targets operating at PL and Championship level . A goalkeeper , if either Aaron Ramsdale or Jake Eastwood are encouraged to gain more first team experience , could also feature on United 's wanted-list . <p> " We 've got three young lads there and we 've got a huge amount of confidence in all of them , " Wilder , speaking earlier this week , said . " We 're always looking and always seeing what might need to be developed depending on the situation here . " <p> United enter the meeting with Rochdale searching for their first win of the season after being beaten by Bolton Wanderers and then Crewe Alexandra in the EFL Cup . The visitors have also used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack O'Connell , the United , enjoying two spells at Spotland earlier in his career . <p> " They pick their loans well , " Wilder acknowledged .

It 's a big game for everybody though . We want to get off to a good start in terms of league games at Bramall Lane . Even though results have gone against us , we will be positive . " <p> Chapman , an England youth international , was on the verge of joining Fleetwood Town until United hijacked the move by guaranteeing Middlesbrough he would become an important member of Wilder 's squad . But Aitor Karanka , his counterpart on Teesside , has not stipulated Chapman must start every game . Crucially for United , the youngster boasts League One experience having helped Barnsley win promotion during a similar spell in South Yorkshire last term . <p> " We ask all Blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in applause for John in the 71st minute of the match , " a spokesperson said , " In memory of his life and the contribution he made in sealing our promotion in the 1970/71 season .

 Ennis-Hill faces another Olympic fight of her life today <h> Ennis-Hill in Rio <h> Bob Westerdale , Head of Sport <h> Jessica Ennis-Hill was braced for a battle for gold as she finished the first day of the heptathlon in Rio firmly on track to retain her Olympic title . <p> She led the field by 72 points , but team-mate Katarina Johnson-Thompson 's hopes of challenging for her crown were dealt a major blow by a woeful performance in the shot put . <h> Jessica Ennis-Hill <p> She was 100 points behind her compatriot in fourth place after four events . <p> Ennis-Hill will head into the second day of competition on 4,057 points , 101 down on the same stage at London 2012 . <p> With three more events to come on Saturday - the long jump , javelin and 800 metres - the 30-year-old is well-placed to make history by becoming the first British woman to retain an Olympic title in athletics , some achievement two years after the birth of her son Reggie . <p> " It 's always nice to be leading after the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long jump and they can all run a good 800m , so it 'll be a challenging day tomorrow , " said Ennis-Hill . <p> But one of them , Canada 's world number one Brianne Theisen-Eaton , was struggling as she lay in sixth place overall , 186 points off the lead . <p> A repeat of London 2012 's ' Super Saturday ' is on the cards after Greg Rutherford held his nerve to qualify for the long jump final , but the mouth-watering prospect of a titanic tussle for gold between the two British heptathletes , which would have provided one of the highlights of the Games , looks unlikely to materialise . <p> Johnson-Thompson , the heir to her team-mate 's multi-eventing throne , is still very much in medal contention , though , trailing second-placed Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium by only 28 points . <p> " It 's not over , " she said . " I ca n't give up on my dream . " <p> She could , though , have been so much better placed but for a dreadful shot showing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.68m . The event is the Liverpool athlete 's weakest by far , but this was still a well below-par performance . <p> " With the shot I just lose my head a little bit , there 's no excuse for it , but I add that into my score now as though it 's expected , " she said . <p> She rectified the situation by clocking the fastest time in the 200m , her 23.26 seconds edging out Ennis-Hill 's , but was still left playing catch-up on her team-mate . <p> Ennis-Hill had to settle for a best throw in the shot of 13.86m and admitted she was " devastated " with the effort after throwing around 14.50m in training . <p> The day started so promisingly for the British pair - and Johnson-Thompson in particular after she produced a British record clearance - and equal world heptathlon best - of 1.98m in the high jump . <p> It was some statement of intent from an athlete who was left distraught at last year 's World Championships in Beijing when three fouls in the long jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shot woes have not done the same . <p> Her team-mate , the defending champion , also got off to a flying start , clocking in the 100m hurdles and then clearing 1.89m . <p> It was her third-fastest time since London 2012 - and her fastest in a heptathlon since then - and her best high jump since before the last Olympics . <p> Ennis-Hill declared herself " really pleased " with her hurdles and high jump . <p> Johnson-Thompson had clocked 13.48 over the hurdles , a solid enough time given the rainy conditions at the start of the morning . <p> The Britons were hit by a wall of noise on their first morning of London 2012 , a teenage Johnson-Thompson saying ' wow ' at the roar which greeted her introduction . <p> There was no chance of that at a near empty Olympic Stadium for the start of competition here , even if the British fans were the ones making the most noise . <p> There looked to be barely a couple of thousand spectators in the venue when the action got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening session it was less than a fifth full . <p> Laura Muir , fresh from breaking Kelly Holmes ' British record on her last appearance , breezed into the 1500m semi-finals , taking her heat easily to go through in third place in 4:06.53 . <p> Laura Weightman had to rely on a fastest loser spot to advance , though , while Ireland 's Ciara Mageean also progressed . <p> Matthew Hudson-Smith booked his spot in the 400m semis , but there was agony for European champion Martyn Rooney as he crashed out . <h> Share this :

" He 's not ready to be No.1 . " <p> Thomas Price added : " Let 's just hope it 's a slow start ! Not every team that does well in a season flies out of the blocks . Although I do think our priority now is an experienced ' keeper . Someone with authority . That will inspire confidence in the back four and therefore the rest of the team going forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But Blade Sam Tweed said : " I do n't think the goal was his fault - it seemed to take a bad deflection and I do n't know what he could have done differently . I do n't agree with the ironic cheers when he caught the ball just after , either . Whether you think he 's good enough or not , that 's not the thing to do . " <p> Mark added : " Very poor performance from the Blades and to be fair we got out of jail . After the goal we were on top ... why did n't we play like that all game " <p> And Jeremy Brooke said : " We had two shots on target , four corners and 46 per cent of possession . Needs work . But two games in ... gelling and entirely new squad and still carrying the likes of Brayford , who has taken the mickey for a season and three games , and indulging Long , who just is n't going to be a great keeper .

 will take a lot of belief from Derby win , says boss Paul Heckingbottom <h> Barnsley 's Conor Hourihane celebrates after his shot lead to the first goal . Picture : Jonathan Gawthorpe <p> Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom saluted a well-deserved victory for his team against Derby , one which will certainly see everyone at the club buoyed ahead of Wednesday 's next major Championship test at home against QPR . <p> The Reds were great value for their 2-0 win , their first of the eagerly-anticipated new campaign at the higher level . <p> After watching an unfortunate Scott Carson own-goal and Alfie Mawson 's towering strike see off the Rams , Heckingbottom said : " We started both halves really well and got the goals at key times . <p> " It was a well-deserved win , but more importantly all the lads will take a lot of belief and confidence from it . <p> " We want Oakwell to be a difficult place to come to , but we might play like that in some game and get beat , but either way we 'll have to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans will respond to that , the players will respond to the fans , and hopefully with the quality we 've got we can cause teams problems . <p> " When we get the organisation and the game-plan right , not only will you nullify the opposition , we 're capable of creating chances and maybe getting a goal out of nothing . " <p> Despite the humbling midweek home defeat by Northampton in the EFL Cup , Heckingbottom made just the one change to his line-up - drafting Ryan Kent back in place of George Moncur - and an all-round battling performance worked a treat as the Reds bounced back in some style from the opening-day reverse at Ipswich . <p> Mawson ignores speculation <p> Barnsley centre-back Alfie Mawson showed that any speculation about a possible future away from Oakwell was pushed to the back of his mind at the weekend . <p> Former Reds boss Lee Johnson continues to be linked with the impressive defender , with reports indicating that a ? 1m Bristol City bid has been rejected . <p> As the closing of the transfer window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye off the ball , so to speak . <p> However , that is far from the case with Mawson , as the Reds ' current boss Paul Heckingbottom revealed . <p> After watching Mawson turn in a sterling performance and score a crucial goal in the Derby victory , Heckingbottom said : " Alfie is n't let anything bother him , he 's just letting his football do the talking . <p> More than 15,000 were packed into Oakwell on Saturday , with the vast majority inside the stadium enjoying the eventual outcome . <p> Derby 's team was packed with players of Premier League experience or potential , but they were dispatched by a hungry and confident Reds team who proved that they could well be a force in the second tier this term - particularly at ' fortress Oakwell ' . <p> Many fans may have entered the stadium at the weekend fearing for their team after they had shipped four at Ipswich on the opening day and were then humbled by Northampton in midweek . However , the Reds ' quality shone through against the shell-shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during their epic charge towards promotion in the second half of last season . <p> There was great goalkeeping from Adam Davies , a resolute defensive unit which also contributed a goal via the head of the determined Mawson , and a midfield four who worked so hard . <p> Up front it might be taking a little time for Tom Bradshaw to settle into his new challenge and Sam Winnall is always going to be a big miss , but across the park the Reds team poses threats and that was totally evident against Nigel Pearson 's Rams . <p> Ratings : Adam Davies 8 - Produced breath-taking saves from Forsyth and Russell in the second half .

Photo : Jason Chadwick <p> There is more to come from Ched Evans according to Chesterfield boss Danny Wilson after he scored the Spireites ' third goal in a comfortable win over Swindon . <p> After Gary Liddle and Jay O'Shea had given Chesterfield a 2-0 half-time lead , Evans made the game safe with his second goal in as many games in the league despite a late consolation from Darnell Furlong . <p> And as he continues his return to football after a four-year absence , Wilson only expects him to get better . <p> He said : " Ched 's a very good player and he 's what we expected . I think he 'll do better as he gets match-fit as I hope the whole team will . <p> " It 's important to get your first home win under the belt and it takes a little bit of pressure off you . <p> " I thought it was a very good performance . All we could do is show our discipline in our defensive work and I think we showed that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few chances and I think that was down to our cleverness and playing with our heads rather than with brawn . " <p> Wilson added : " We could 've had more goals to show for it but I thought their goalkeeper was outstanding for them . We ca n't be too disappointed with three goals and three points , particularly in your first home game . <p> " If you sit off a team that have the quality that they have then they 'll punish you , even if they are young lads . I think you saw that late on where we looked a little bit jaded and our passing got a little bit sloppy at times . <p> " The three points are well-deserved , I do n't think anyone was complaining about that . " <p> The 3-1 result was arguably flattering to Swindon , who were grateful to keeper Lawrence for keeping the score down . <p> Chesterfield made a strong start and Evans ' header was palmed brilliantly onto the post by Vigouroux after only five minutes . <p> Swindon should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only find the grateful arms of Ryan Fulton . <p> Midway through the half , Chesterfield deservedly took the lead . made a brilliant double save from Evans ' free-kick and Sam Hird 's follow-up but there was nothing the Swindon keeper could do to stop Liddle heading into the empty net . <p> Swindon boss Luke Williams had Vigouroux to thank for keeping the score respectable but after a push on Evans in the box deep into first-half injury-time , O'Shea fired in Chesterfield 's second from the penalty spot . <p> Paul McGinn looked set for his second goal in a week but opted to pass rather than shoot when put through by Ariyibi .

 closed after police concerns to become new branch of Sheffield restaurant <h> Yankee Lounge , London Road , Sheffield . <p> A Sheffield club opened in the ' wrong location ' due to drug and gang problems on London Road is moving - being replaced with a new branch of a popular city restaurant . <p> A council licensing hearing was told that a new city centre location is being sought for the Yankee Lounge bar , with work already under way to return the building to its previous use as a restaurant . <p> But instead of returning in its previous guise as a Turkish restaurant known as Turkuaz , it will become a new branch of Viva Tequila , an Italian-Mexican restaurant that already operates in Gleadless . <p> The license for the premises was reviewed after it was turned from the Turkish restaurant into the American-style bar without the relevant authorities being consulted in May . <p> That followed trouble at a privately-booked party at the restaurant in March , in which police were called to reports of a mass brawl involving up to 100 people and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sean Gibbons , from the council 's health and safety team , said a review had been requested due to ' public safety ' concerns that the building was unsuitable as a nightclub for up to 200 people when it had previously been a restaurant limited to a maximum of 80 diners . <p> He said there were particular concerns about the stability of the floor , leading to a request for a structural engineer to assess the property . <p> A launch night for the Yankee Lounge was cancelled on May 7 on the understanding the club would only open following further agreement with the authorities , but the meeting was told two further events took place on May 29 and June 10 . <p> Michelle Hazlewood , representing owner Huseyin , said the club has been closed since June following concerns being raised by the police and council and is in now in the process of being changed back into a restaurant . <p> Cheryl Topham , from South Yorkshire Police 's licensing team , said she was ' more than happy ' with how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said that due to ongoing crime and disorder issues in the London Road area , she considered it to be the ' wrong place ' to open a nightclub . <p> Ms Hazlewood said Mr had run the Viva Tequila restaurant in Gleadless , which he has now sold to new owners , in addition to Turkuaz . <p> She said he had been attempting to deal with affairs affecting his family in Turkey relating to the Syrian crisis at the same time when problems occurred this year . <p> " His family have a farm very close to Syrian border , " she said . <p> " To say he has been slightly distracted in the past year is an understatement . <p> " One of his thought processes had been to focus on Viva Tequila and look to moving London Road to the operation of a third party . <p> " The March event was a private booking . <p> " During the course of the night a Somalian gentleman threw a glass bottle at a Jamaican gentleman and the situation escalated very quickly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 Chris Wilder delivers a few home truths ahead of Millwall clash <h> Chris Wilder says everyone at Sheffield United must stand-up and be counted . Pic David <h> James Shield <p> Fingers were pointed , home truths delivered and voices were definitely raised . <p> The inquest into Tuesday 's defeat by Southend was , as their expressions betrayed afterwards , an uncomfortable experience for Sheffield United 's players . And it confirmed that , under Chris Wilder 's management , neither they nor Bramall Lane 's coaching staff will be shielded from the toxicity which inevitably follows a horrendous result . <p> " There will be a lot of talking and working out which players will take us forward , " he said . " I ca n't hide , I wo n't hide and neither should anyone else . I stood there on the touchline , I did n't go and sit in the dug-out or say ' I do n't fancy this . I 'll just go home . ' It 's at times like this you find the true character of people . Whether they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Wilder will demand his team does exactly that when they visit Millwall this weekend . The performance against Phil Brown 's side , which saw United concede three times at home for the first time since January , was described as " ridiculous " and " unacceptable " by the 48-year-old who later accused them of " gifting " the opposition their final two goals . A habit which , even before Southend arrived in South Yorkshire , had proven costly during fixtures with Crewe Alexandra and Rochdale . <p> " Nobody is going to help me , " Wilder continued . " My family might help a bit and pick me up a little . But basically , I have to look after myself . And , do you know what ? Those players have to look after themselves as well . They have to pick themselves up and , if they do , they 'll be a part of this fantastic football club . If they do n't then , regardless of whether I 've signed them up or not , then they wo n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge earlier this summer with Leon Clarke , Jack O'Connell and loanee Harry Chapman among eight new faces to join in recent weeks . Inevitably , given the sheer scale of change taking place behind the scenes , it will be some weeks before they become a slick , effective unit . But , as Wilder warned after being accepting the job in May , United must ensure they are not playing catch-up when the League One table begins to take shape . <h> Sheffield United 's players were shellshocked after conceding three goals in 15 minutes against Southend ? 2016 Sport Image all rights reserved <p> Despite failing to win any of their three outings in the competition so far , United remain eight points behind early leaders Bolton Wanderers . <p> Although it is still far too early to draw conclusions about whether United are likely to challenge for promotion - Wilder 's previous club Northampton Town were eight points off the pace 12 months ago before going on to lift the League Two title in May - some issues which need to be urgently addressed have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have developed a suicidal streak with five of the seven goals conceded this season coming from errors of judgement . At the other end of the pitch , Leon Clarke and Billy Sharp are both fine centre-forwards but have yet to suggest they can forge a proper partnership . Marc McNulty , who embellished his reputation during a spell on loan at Portsmouth last term , deserves an opportunity after starting all of United 's last four matches on the bench . <p> " That 's two games on the bounce where we 've given the opposition a lift , " Wilder said . " I do n't see anyone giving us a lift . We have to make sure people work hard for anything they get against us . When we have given ourselves a lift , we 've not made the most of it . " <p> " It 's unacceptable in terms of people looking at me because it 's my group , " Wilder added . " And it 's unacceptable in terms of me looking at my players . Yes , you can break down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen that you 've handed the game to the opposition after 15 minutes as we did ( against Southend ) . " <h> Marc McNulty will be hoping for a chance against Millwall on Saturday ? 2016 Sport Image all rights reserved <p> Millwall will also be smarting after losing 5-1 to Peterborough two days ago . <p> " Mentality is one of the biggest things , " Wilder said .

I 'm finding out about them all the time , without a doubt . <p> " And I 'm finding out about players that I 've brought in too .

 Root is back for Yorkshire <p> The one blot on Yorkshire 's otherwise rich canvas is that they have never won honours in Twenty20 cricket but the Vikings are determined to wipe away that stain tomorrow at the NatWest Blast Finals Day at Edgbaston . <p> And they must stand every chance of doing so because England 's Famous Five - Joe Root , Jonny Bairstow , Adil Rashid , Liam Plunkett and David Willey - have all been given permission to play by their country , leaving Vikings with a selection headache in deciding who they should leave out of their final line-up . <p> Yorkshire have such strong all-round depth that Willey and Plunkett could not even make it into the Championship side for this week 's Roses clash at Old Trafford but the England Twenty20 World Cup duo of all-rounders could well be key figures in Vikings quest for glory . <p> " We 've not relied on any individuals , and everyone of the guys has chipped in , " Root said . <p> " When guys have gone away on international duty , others have stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great occasion - Finals Day is always a special day , and the lads have played extremely well to get to this stage . <p> " It 's always good to come back and play for Yorkshire , and play with lads I 've known since I was a young kid . Durham will be a tough test with a lot of matchwinners , and we 'll have to play well to beat them , but there 's no reason why we ca n't . " <p> Willey , particularly , is a vital cog in the wheel because this relatively new boy to Yorkshire cricket is an old hand when it comes to Finals Day . This will be his fourth appearance there , his previous three being with Northamptonshire Steelbacks who Vikings could meet in tomorrow 's final if they can overcome Durham Jets first . <p> Last year , in what was his last day 's cricket before joining Yorkshire , Willey helped Steelbacks beat Warwickshire in the semi-finals but Lancashire proved too strong for them in the final . <p> Willey , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a major part in getting Vikings through to Edgbaston with 269 runs and nine wickets . <p> He was in ferocious mood with the bat in the quarter-final thrashing of Glamorgan at the SSE Swalec stadium when he smashed 79 from just 38 balls with seven fours and six sixes and he also savaged Steelbacks in the North Group match at Headingley with 74 from 46 deliveries with five fours and six sixes . <p> It 's was largely through his performance with the ball - he claimed a hat-trick - that he won the player-of-the-match award when Steelbacks lifted the trophy in 2013 , so he admits that his all-round experience is valuable for Vikings . <p> " There will be an expectation on me to perform at Edgbaston , but that 's the case with any one-day game , " he said . <p> " We will also have the England players back , which will make it a massive headache for the coaches to pick 11 players .

 wait for retail revamp : Timeline of false dawns on way to New Retail Quarter <h> Sheffield . Picture : Andrew Roe <h> Chris Burn <p> For more than 20 years , the promise of a regenerated city centre in Sheffield filled with top shops , restaurants and bars has been on the horizon . <p> But after decades of false dawns and frustrations , council bosses now hope their ? 480 million Sheffield Retail Quarter plans can come to fruition and make the city centre a true competitor to Manchester and Leeds . <h> Latest images of how the proposed new retail quarter for Sheffield could look . <p> A new report is asking councillors to back their proposals so far -- while warning of the potential obstacles that lie ahead in making the dream of a more appealing city centre a reality . <p> Back in 1994 , Sheffield Council commissioned a retail study by a firm called Hillier Parker , which highlighted ' the inadequacy of Sheffield 's retail offer ' and called for ' significant new investment in a major new retail scheme ' . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a council development plan that was adopted in 1998 and made the regeneration of the city centre a key council aim . <p> In February 2000 , the Government set up an urban regeneration company known as ' Sheffield One ' to assist in the regeneration of Sheffield city centre . <h> The location of phase one of the Sheffield Retail Quarter , which will include a six-storey office block , shops and restaurants . Photo : Council <p> A city centre master-plan was published later that year by Sheffield One with its findings very familiar to the arguments still being made 16 years later for the proposed Sheffield Retail Quarter . <p> That plan concluded there was ' a lack of quality shopping , particularly of high price fashion and flagship stores ' ; that there was ' a mismatch between the accommodation available to retailers and the size and configuration of accommodation that they require ' and ' continuing development in competing centres will make them more attractive than Sheffield city centre ' . <p> The latter warning has proved particularly true as rival northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of Sheffield as attractive shopping destinations . <p> Following the IRA bombing of Manchester city centre in 1996 , its rebuilding was recognised as a national priority . An award-winning masterplan to redevelop it was completed in six years , by 2002 , with damaged listed buildings rebuilt and new pedestrian routes linking shopping areas combined with public open spaces . <h> An indicative drawing of the office planned for phase one of Sheffield Retail Quarter . <p> Leeds has also had significant investment in recent years , with the ? 350m Trinity Leeds shopping centre and the ? 60m First Direct Arena both opening in 2013 . <p> Sheffield city centre has also lost trade to Meadowhall , which is now the sixth most-successful shopping centre in the country and has recently announced its own ? 300m expansion plans . <p> With ambitions in Sheffield to match the likes of Manchester and Leeds , the council appointed Hammerson UK Properties as its development partner in 2001 -- with ? 600m plans to revamp the city centre approved in 2006 . <p> But that scheme , which eventually became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2009 -- and in July 2013 it was announced that Hammerson was withdrawing as the council 's development partner . <h> Sheffield Retail Quarter artist 's impression <p> In negotiations , the property company said it could not commit to a start date for construction of the project to create new shops between The Moor and Barker 's Pool , including a flagship new John Lewis . <p> Ironically , Hammerson is now involved with the ? 150m building of the Victoria Gate scheme in Leeds , which will be based on a major new John Lewis store due to open in October . <p> The Sevenstone scheme has been replaced with the new ? 480m vision for Sheffield Retail Quarter , with regeneration specialist Queensberry Real Estate selected as the council 's development partner earlier this year . <p> The new report going to councillors from planning officers Dinah Hope and Mike Hayden said the impact of the 2008 financial crisis has resulted in a ' much-altered economic landscape ' which is reflected in the new proposals with shopping becoming ' part of a rounded experience alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planning committee are being asked to approve outline plans submitted so far -- while recognising further changes may be needed in future . <p> The key elements of the new scheme include extending Fargate to the west to create a ' New Fargate ' linked to a new public square and anchor department store , while a ' Sheffield Way ' system of pedestrianised streets and spaces will be created to better connect existing areas of the city centre . <h> The John Lewis store in Sheffield <p> But concerns have been raised by conservation groups such as Historic England , The Victorian Society and The Twentieth Century Society about planned demolitions of existing city centre buildings to make way for the new facilities . <p> Meanwhile , talks are still ongoing with John Lewis about the planned demolition of its existing store and relocation . <p> It is hoped the completed New Retail Quarter will create around 2,500 jobs and bring an additional ? 300m a year to the city centre that people now spend elsewhere . <p> The first phase of the scheme , which is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of new offices for HSBC on the site of the Grosvenor House Hotel . <p> The report said the rate of empty shops in Sheffield city centre has fallen from a high of 10 per cent in 2012 to just 1.5 per cent currently , indicating there is strong demand from retailers but a lack of appropriate places . <p> It added 150 retail and catering businesses have been identified that do not currently have a presence in Sheffield city centre but whose needs for buildings with space of between 75,800 square metres and 105,000 square metres could be met by the new development . <p> Sheffield Council deputy leader Leigh Bramall said : " There is strong momentum behind SRQ and gaining planning endorsement will form an important part of that .

 The very curious case of John Brayford and the Blades <h> John Brayford has re-joined Burton Albion on loan until the end of the season <h> Danny Hall <p> His permanent move to Bramall Lane was greeted with terrace fanfare and social media buzz ; his departure , on loan 574 days later , was confirmed via a terse , 120-word statement on Sheffield United 's official website . <p> " He 's not any full back ... he 's John Brayford " became " The Blades have agreed a loan deal for John Brayford to join Burton Albion " and nobody can really say with any certainty what happened in between . The 28-year-old arrived with a bang and , 48 games later , left with barely a whimper . <p> So , what went wrong ? It would be easy - and tempting - to dismiss Brayford as a spent force , a busted flush who impressed so much on loan , and disappointed almost as much after signing permanently . <p> Others will point to two fairly serious injuries - a knee problem saw him miss 22 Blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nasty " calf injury curtailed his involvement last season - or wonder if Brayford is simply capable of performing under any other manager than Nigel Clough - who had him at Burton and Derby , took him to United and signed him for Burton again . <p> Whatever the reason , Brayford 's departure - albeit only on loan - has caused nowhere near the reaction it once would have , when he was at his marauding best and seemingly well on the way to becoming a Legend of the Lane . <p> The Beard , as he 's known to United supporters , was earmarked in pre-season by Chris Wilder as the best right-back in League One and was expected to flourish in the Blades boss 's positive system . But it simply never happened . There were flashes of a positive partnership with Mark Duffy on the opening day at Bolton , but Brayford seemed a shadow of his former self against both Crewe and Rochdale . <p> He was inculpable in United 's defensive capitulation against Southend but offered nothing going forward , either , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him flying down the wing and creating chances for us , " Kevin Gage , a former United full-back of some distinction , wrote in his column for The Star this week . <p> " So it was a surprise to see him as the first casualty of our start to the season . <p> " John has n't played anything like we know he can and particularly his crossing , in the past such a feature of his surges forward , has been terribly disappointing and just about sums up his lack of form . <p> " The marriage seemingly made in heaven has gone a bit sour ... and it 's has turned out to be a short-term affair . <p> " I 'm sure he and Nigel will be happy together , and a separation is in everyone 's best interests . I expect a full divorce from us in time . " <p> Wilder , citing Brayford 's departure as an opportunity to reinvest money elsewhere in his squad , was quick to place on record that the full-back did not seek a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkshire running until the summer of 2018 , that place in United folklore could still be cemented . <p> But few players go down as legends of their clubs if their level of performance enters a downward spiral , no matter how many tattoos and how fine a beard they possess . <p> A decent and unassuming bloke , Brayford is in some ways an unlikely footballer and could simply be an expensive , high-profile casualty of United 's poor start to the season . Or , looking more deeply , arrived in South Yorkshire riding the crest of a wave on the way to the FA Cup semi-finals that year and , when such momentum plateaued , perhaps struggled with the expectation of being one of the main men . <p> Either way , Brayford earned himself a hell of a lot of goodwill from Blades fans on his return . <p> " People talk about footballers signing at clubs for the money , but there is more to being a footballer than making a few extra quid , " he said at the time , after accepting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " For me , it 's about being able to look back on my career and be able to watch , read and remember all the good times .

We missed out in the T20 and in last year 's semi-finals so hopefully we can put in a good performance . <p> " There 's going to be a good crowd and hopefully we can put in a good performance for them , get a win and I 'm sure there would be loads of Yorkshire fans going down to Lord 's if we play well on Sunday . <p> " We need to be positive and back each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both competitions . <p> " We became a bit more positive and aggressive in the way that we batted and bowled .

 Chris Wilder on the touchline at Millwall <p> Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder has warned his star players that no-one 's place is safe as he looks to turn around his side 's poor start to the League One campaign . <p> Wilder faces one of his former sides , Oxford United , this afternoon with his current employers bottom of the table and without a win since he took charge in May . <p> Skipper Billy Sharp and Leon Clarke , Wilder 's preferred strikeforce , have flattered to deceive so far as a partnership and George Long could explore opportunities away from Bramall Lane after losing the No.1 spot to Simon Moore . <p> And Wilder , who allowed John Brayford to join Burton Albion on loan just over a week ago , said : " We have n't got enough shots off or worked the opposition goalkeeper hard enough , even though we 've got into some good areas . <p> " If the players on the fringes of the team are seeing that , then they should be seeing opportunities . To register just one point from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players or for the football club and it 's up to me to pick the right team . <p> " But no-one is untouchable or undroppable , especially after the start we 've had . " <p> Sharp was withdrawn after 65 minutes of United 's late defeat at Millwall last weekend , while Clarke was a doubt for the trip to The Den before declaring himself fit before kick-off . <p> Marc McNulty , who was under consideration for a start against Oxford , damaged a hamstring in training and could miss " a couple of weeks " , according to Wilder . <p> The Blades boss also remains in the hunt for a new centre-half . <p> Millwall turned down a bid for Byron Webster recently , insisting he is not for sale at any price , and a deal for former Rotherham United and current Wigan defender Craig Morgan collapsed over personal terms . <p> United are understood to have shown interest in Leeds United midfielder Luke Murphy , who is on the fringes at Elland Road . <p> Caolan Lavery , the former Sheffield Wednesday forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Ireland youth international is complicated by the need to agree a compensation package with the Owls . <p> Lavery was released by Wednesday at the end of last season but , because he 's under 24 , United 's Steel City rivals are due compensation . <p> " I 'm looking for pace at the top of the pitch , " Wilder confirmed , " and he offers that . <p> " But it 's not an easy situation . We 're comfortable with how we 're going about our business , and think we 'll get there in the end . " <h> Advertisement <p> ITV 
 Dom Howson <p> Some observers believe the Owls have been overpowered , particularly in the centre , in their recent defeats to Burton Albion and Leeds United . <p> It was also a criticism levelled at Wednesday after 's side lost to Hull City in the Play-Off final last May , with Tom Huddlestone and Mohamed Diam ? dominating that department . <p> Under Carvalhal , the Owls have earned rave reviews for their stylish passing football but his midfield quartet is on the small size . Barry Bannan , Ross Wallace and Almen Abdi are all under six foot and concerns are growing that Wednesday struggle to cope with teams who adopt a more physical approach . <p> Carvalhal told The Star : " It depends what you mean by physical . Barry Bannan is a very physical player with the way he moves and escapes the opponents . He 's clever and fast the way that he plays . It makes him a very strong guy . <p> " If you understand physical like rugby , I agree . But if you understand physical to play football I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the competition . <p> " I do n't think we have lost the games due to the physical side . When we lose , of course maybe people start talking about this and this but I never put things down to the physical situation . <p> " We have guys who are not physical in size but are strong . There is no player in the Championship who runs more than Kieran Lee . He runs 13km per game . That is physical . " <p> Despite two slip-ups , Carvalhal has vowed not to abandon his principles , citing Barcelona as an example . <p> " I 'm not a coach of rugby , " said Carvalhal . " I 'm a football coach . <p> " Barcelona win everything and they play with Xavi , Andr ? s Iniesta and Lionel Messi . Do you say ' let 's put a physical guy in and put these small , talented guys out as we need rugby players on the pitch ? ' <p> " It depends on the mentality . If you want to play direct football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an option . If you want to pay a ticket to see football , you must select the players to play football . " <p> Carvalhal is expected to freshen up his midfield at Brentford as Wednesday look to halt their poor run of form . David Jones is in contention to make his first Owls start since arriving for an undisclosed fee from Burnley . It could be Wallace who drops out to accommodate Jones . <p> Whatever team he fields at Griffin Park , Carvalhal expects a strong reaction . <p> " Brentford are a very good side ; I think they are better this season than last year , " he said .

 stuck in in training <p> Sheffield United are actively exploring two lines of enquiry in the transfer market as Chris Wilder , the League One club 's manager , presses ahead with his overhaul of Bramall Lane 's first team squad . <p> The Star understands that preliminary discussions have taken place with at least one unattached player who can eligible to join outside of the window while meetings with another could take place later this month . <p> Wilder , speaking before Sunday 's win at Gillingham , acknowledged United had missed out on " a couple of targets " before last week 's deadline but later described himself as " very content " with their business over the past three months . <p> " I had a meeting with ( chief executive ) Stephen Bettis and Carl Shieber ( United 's player contract negotiation manager ) , " he said . <p> " And , if you look at the squad now , it 's chalk and cheese .

 11-plus <h> Schoolchildren <p> The subject of grammar schools , selection at 11 and the supposed inequality this engenders seems to be back in the news . It is now almost 50 years since Sheffield Council abandoned the old 11-plus system but I remember it very clearly . <p> The grammar school I went to ( King Ted 's ) was certainly top notch . Formerly a private school ( Wesley College ) it retained many of the old traditions . The strict dress code was very hierarchical with different attire for different years . The ' masters ' wore black gowns , first years were demeaned as ' fags ' , homework was ' prep ' , caning was used quite liberally ( as I can attest ) and the fearsome ( but fair ) headmaster terrified the teachers even more than the kids . <p> The masters were nearly all graduates and quite a few were addressed as ' Doctor ' , which was quite unusual for the period . The intake seemed to be mostly ordinary working class lads with a token leavening from the professional and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be of just average intelligence , certainly no genius and definitely no swot . My dad was a salesman and my mum a shorthand typist . <p> The Victorian primary school I went to was very ordinary . So how did I end up at grammar school ? Quite easily really . <p> A lot of myths have built up around the old 11-plus and its supposed sudden-death nature , win or lose , all or nothing on a single day . It could certainly have a significant influence on the future course of your life but it most definitely was not sudden death on a single day . <p> As there were only so many grammar school places available each year some form of selection was clearly necessary . This selection process actually seemed to commence insidiously sometime around the ages of eight or nine . Exactly how remains a mystery to me , but presumably it was based on class work and teachers ' opinions . By the final two years of primary school each year was divided into ' A ' and ' B ' streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember any official declaration of these sub-divisions but it was obvious which was which . <p> We in the ' A ' stream had the same teacher for both of the final years and he really was the business . We were drilled hard with frequent informal testing , rapid-fire mental arithmetic sessions , essays and aptitude tests . Nothing was left to chance . When the day of the exam came it seemed a doddle frankly , so well prepared were we . Just about everyone in our class ' passed ' . The actual mark you achieved on the day determined whether you went to your first or second choice of school . <p> No-one I knew undertook extra tuition , cramming , homework , revision or anything of that sort . It was n't necessary . We did everything we needed to in class . <p> On second thoughts there was just one exception . The girl who sat behind me was a professor 's daughter and she received private tuition at home and was made to do lots of homework . She was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Girls ' High School . <p> And the ' B ' stream ? They suffered a succession of random teachers , very nice but mostly second rate and the classes seemed to me rather laid back . They almost all ' failed ' the 11-plus and transferred en masse up the road to the local secondary modern . Nearly all of them left school at 15 with a further education certificate for their efforts .

Coun Leigh Bramall ( deputy leader of the council ) has said that the ? 2.2 billion Streets Ahead contract permits the felling of 50 per cent of highway trees . Without compliance with current good practice , we stand to lose around 67.7 per cent of mature highway trees : 73.8 per cent of the highway tree population . <p> In February , the Information Commissioner revealed that , over three and a half years in to the city-wide highway maintenance project , neither the council or Amey have commissioned or drafted any alternative highway engineering specifications for consideration as a means to retain trees .

 end of Sheffield Eagles is very much a reality - we must fight tooth and nail to save the club <h> Eagles chief Mark Aston <h> Matt Young <p> There have been times in the past when the future of Sheffield Eagles looked bleak , but there has never been a situation as grave as the one that currently faces the club . <p> Even through the last two months the noises coming out of the club were ones of positivity , that a takeover could be completed . But chief executive John Whaling 's admission to The Star that red tape with the council looks to have scuppered a potential takeover , and director of rugby Mark Aston 's emotional review of the situation on local radio , suggest that even the most loyal and committed members of the club are now deeply concerned over the Eagles future . <p> Why are the Eagles in this mess ?

That 's where the club 's frustration has hit boiling point , with Whaling stating that the council 's delay in giving the green light for the investor 's potential land purchase has left any potential deal hanging by a thread . <p> Is this situation all down to the council ? It would be unfair to lay all of the blame at that door . But should everyone be working tooth and nail to save the club ? Absolutely .

 Sheffield . <p> Neill Schofield , chairman of the Friends of Parkwood Springs group , said the area could form a ' country park ' within a city . <p> " The landfill site is sitting in the middle of this area and at the moment it 's a real barrier to linking the northern and southern sections , " he said . <p> Mr Schofield said Viridor had created an ' expectation ' in its original plans that the public would be able to access the site as soon as it was restored . <p> " That makes me think reasonably soon afterwards , " he added . <p> As part of the restoration work , a cap will be placed over the landfill , with earth piled on top , and a network of pipes installed to remove methane gas produced as waste decomposes . The gas is turned into electricity . Viridor said the gas infrastructure would have to be removed before public access could be granted . <p> " We have been told it could be 30 years or more before access is allowed in some areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that it 's hard for the planning committee to do much .

He said Parkwood had stopped accepting landfill in 2014 , four years earlier than expected , but ground levels were still being built up . <p> " Viridor will retain responsibility for the site throughout the restoration programme which will follow the infilling phase , with initial restoration expected to take two years , " he said . <p> " It is expected that limited public access will be made available within a year of completion of the restoration works . <p> " Following this period , Viridor will maintain responsibility for the site to ensure environmental control whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas and other site infrastructure .

" <p> Although there were times when this fixture threatened to become a private duel between goalkeepers Chris Neal and Simon Moore , United dominated in terms of territory and possession . The trouble was , until Ebanks-Landell pounced with almost the final touch of the contest , they had failed to translate either into goals . <p> Matt Done and Paul Coutts both went close before Ebanks-Landell 's poor back pass presented Chris Long with an opportunity which he failed to take but David Ball did not . Billy Sharp and Jack O'Connell nearly equalised but , curiously , Fleetwood were still enjoying the more clear cut opportunities . Moore excelled himself to deny Ball a second while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleck , who had earlier blazed over the crossbar , forced Neal to make a superb block after combining with Sharp and although Done 's misplaced header appeared to have signalled the end of United 's hopes , Ebanks-Landell had other ideas after meeting substitute Chris Hussey 's cross . <p> ANOTHER TEST PASSED <p> Wilder has often cited the ability to recover from a mistake as the hallmark of a " proper " player . Moore , who coaching staff revealed before travelling to Highbury was " disappointed " by the goals he conceded at Scunthorpe last week , is clearly one . One this evidence , Ebanks-Landell is another . The centre-half has been almost faultless since arriving on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers but set in motion the chain of events which ended with Ball scoring his fifth of the season with a costly misjudgment . <p> Rather than crumble , however , Ebanks-Landell dusted himself down , won numerous headers and ultimately secured United a share of the spoils . Last season , under Wilder 's predecessor Nigel Adkins , United would probably not have clawed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squad he inherited and coaxing more out of those who remained , Wilder has equipped them with a tenacious streak . <h> Chris Neal of Fleetwood Town saves at the feet of Matt Done of Sheffield Utd during the Skybet League One match at Highbury Stadium , Fleetwood .

I think the fans can see what they 're about and what they bring to the table . You could tell by the reaction at the end , it 's something they appreciate . " <p> MORE TEMPO REQUIRED <p> Fleetwood paid United the compliment of altering their approach - Conor McLaughlin being tasked with shadowing Mark Duffy - and before the interval , carved the more clear cut opportunities . <p> It was a curious state of affairs given that Wilder 's charges applied several sustained periods of pressure .

But Fleetwood , who have never lost to United at Highbury , possess plenty of quality performers themselves and were more clinical in the final third . <p> Wilder adjusted United 's shape in the second-half to combat the threat posed by the likes of Ball and Dempsey before acknowledging the absence of Caolan Lavery and Leon Clarke through injury is taking its toll on his forward-line . <p> " We set up like the home team and they were like the away side , " Wilder said . " Matty and Billy are doing a huge amount of work and it would have been great to bring on Caolan and Leon at some stage . That would have caused them ( Fleetwood ) real problems .

The former Cardiff City goalkeeper 's agility , presence and organisational skills make the initial ? 250,000 they paid to secure his services look like a snip and have also provided the base for some improved defensive displays of late . <p> Neal , previously of Preston and Shrewsbury , is also among the division 's finest . His save to prevent Fleck firing home from close-range after Sharp 's persistence penetrated Fleetwood 's rearguard was superb . Neal had already tipped a powerful attempt from United 's captain over the crossbar. <p> The spectators tightly 
 Third Way <p> As someone born just a stone 's throw from David Blunkett 's birthplace and still living here , I do n't mourn the passing of New Labour , a concept based on Tony Blair 's version of The Third Way and a method of government supposedly built on ' inclusion ' and ' bottom-up ' politics . <p> From my experience I would say it could n't be further from the truth . <p> Unwittingly caught up in a mysterious plan to regenerate Parson Cross , by my desire to save much needed properties from demolition , I watched the prolonged process and struggled to understand not only who pulled the strings but where the plans were leading . <p> A process which surely paid only lip service to the above principles , as secret plans were gradually imposed and opposition stifled . <p> Initially , I considered I might be paranoid but only recently , I stumbled across the following in an article headed ' Flaws in the politics of Third Way ideologies ' : <p> " The ideologies of the Third Way emphasised their commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens in the political process . <p> " In practice the leaders of the Third Way , particularly Blair , have turned their parties into authoritarian instruments of personal rule , dissenting voices are marginalised or expelled . Local consituency parties have candidates imposed by central leadership ; candidates all hand-picked for their conformity with leadership views . " <p> Under New Labour there appeared an abundance of patronage and lack of respect for the less well-off and ' regeneration ' of areas described as suffering ' multiple deprivation ' soon became the by-word for places of illiteracy , criminal acts , idleness and benefit scrounging . <p> Yet the plight of targeted communities was not of their making , government policies having destroyed their very fabric . <p> New Labour 's answer was to ship in modern-day ' missionaries ' from the middle-class on whose support New Labour depended in order to retain their position of power . <p> Even artists were brought in from outside and paid public money to ' lift the area by way of art ' .

An emerging underclass dependent on charitable hand-outs and an army of well-paid middle-class workers educationally equipped to attempt to resolve all their problems . <p> This is not a coalition , it merely raises the better off while emotionally reducing further the poor . <p> Sometimes , barely a line could be drawn between New Labour and Tory policies , but to surrender to the whims of the newly established middle class , created during the Thatcher years , is to totally betray the activists who fought long and hard over decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Labour Party based on fairness for ALL . <p> David , you might see the election of Jeremy Corbyn as a disaster , but the fact that millions , not only across Britain but across the world , have followed his lead in looking towards a more fair and peaceful world can only be inspiring and offer hope for a new future for so many .@@14665765 <h> George Monbiot :

 Pros and cons of the international break - Tom Lees , Glenn Loovens and Adam Reach give their views <h> Owls skipper Glenn Loovens .... Pic Steve Ellis <h> Chris Holt <p> The arrival of an international break is something that splits opinion among players , managers and fans . <p> Some want to keep playing , others , especially those involved in the Football League where the fixture list is exhausting , are happy with the rest and recuperation . <h> Tom Lees would prefer not to have a break for internationals <p> And all that , in turn , might depend on the team 's form going into the interuption in domestic action . <p> Even players and management at the same clubs have differing views and Sheffield Wednesday are no exception on that front . <p> Tom Lees stated before the last one , following the draw at Brentford , that he wished to play on , and his opinion has n't changed since . <p> " It has come at a bad time . We just want to keep playing and try to put things right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international break <p> " We have a few weeks now so we have to work as hard as we can on the training pitch . We have to reflect on the last games and make sure we are ready to go when the league starts up again . " <p> Glenn Loovens holds a similar viewpoint , though his is swayed by the fact that the Dutchman is still trying to find peak fitness after missing pre-season due to undergoing an operation on an injured ankle . <p> The Owls skipper , though , recognises that for others , a rest could be needed . <p> " The break has come at a bad time for me because when you come back , you want to play as many games as you can , " he said . <p> " But maybe it is a good time for some of the other players who have played a lot of games to get some rest and recharge the batteries for the next one .

 opportunities to save life of baby girl <h> Sheffield Teaching Hospitals , The Jessop Wing . <h> Chris Burn <p> Doctors missed opportunities to save the life of a premature Sheffield baby following a four-hour delay in giving her mother an emergency caesarian , a coroner has ruled . <p> Two doctors on the Jessop Wing at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital misinterpreted heart rate readings from baby Marissa while she was in the womb . <p> An inquest heard the four hour and 15 minute delay in delivering Marissa meant she was born unconscious . <p> Efforts to revive her failed and the baby girl was pronounced dead at just eight hours old . <p> If the emergency caesarian had been carried out earlier , she would have been born conscious and potentially could have survived the congenital pneumonia , a post-mortem found the baby was suffering from . <p> Coroner David Urpeth said : " The evidence suggests that on two occasions the abnormal heart trace was incorrectly read as normal . <p> " There was a delay in over four hours . " <p> He said the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been born alive and may , but only may , have survived with treatment ' . <p> Mr Urpeth added : " At the very least , there were several missed opportunities to save Marissa . " <p> He told Marissa 's parents Michaela Buttery and Ricky Calvert , from Parson Cross : " One can only imagine the heartache caused by losing your child . <p> " It is hard to comprehend how difficult that must be . The evidence has suggested earlier intervention may have made a difference . " <p> He said he would have ordered a Preventing Future Deaths report had the inquest not already been told of the steps had been taken at the hospital to prevent such a tragedy occurring again . <p> Dr Marta Cohen said a post-mortem examination indicated Marissa had caught congenital pneumonia while in the womb . <p> She said in her opinion , the ' advanced ' nature of her illness meant earlier intervention would not necessarily have saved the baby 's life . <p> " It is probable nothing could have saved Marissa , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart rate traces were at the hearing to give evidence and neither were named . <p> Lead consultant Roobin Jokhi said both doctors had accepted the findings of his report that mistakes had been made . <p> The inquest was told Ms Buttery was admitted to the Jessop Wing on November 30 last year when she was 35 weeks pregnant and her waters had broken . <p> The court heart she had spoken to midwife Donna Blackwell at 5.25am on December 2 to say she was bleeding . <p> At around 6.30am , she reported the bleeding was getting worse resulting in a doctor being called . <p> Mr said a junior doctor incorrectly classified the baby 's heartbeat as normal . <p> Nurse Blackwell said she was ' reassured ' at the time by the doctor 's assessment , but ' with hindsight ' said she could have asked a more senior doctor to review the readings . <p> Ms Buttery was examined around 90 minutes later by a more senior doctor who again incorrectly classified the heartbeat as normal . <p> Marissa was eventually delivered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial assessment . <p> Mr said her baby heart rate traces on the morning of December 2 showed ' a marked change ' from the previous ones carried out on November 30 and December 1 . <p> He said within 15 minutes of the first trace that morning , a plan should have been put in place for the delivery of the baby . <p> Mr Urpeth asked whether Mr thought the outcome would have been different had that happened . <p> The consultant said if she had been delivered earlier ' she may well have been alive but it would not be possible for anyone to say ' whether she would have survived the pneumonia . <p> Mr Urpeth said : " Probably she would have been alive at that point but you ca n't say whether she would have survived .

 Boss warns of consequences <h> Chris Basham <h> James Shield <p> Chris Wilder has warned there will be consequences if Sheffield United 's players lose focus after a seven match unbeaten run . <p> United enter this weekend 's League One fixture against Port Vale eighth in the table and unbeaten in the competition since August . <p> Despite praising his squad for their efforts of late following a slow start to the new season - " We 've enjoyed an excellent month and a bit " - Wilder made no apology for demanding even more from his squad . <p> " I do n't want us to be a ' spike team ' that wins two or three and then loses two or three , " he said . <p> " Because , that way , you just end up in mid-table with sixty odd points . <p> " We do n't want to be there . That 's not something we want to be . " <p> " Listen , " Wilder added . " If you are at club like this then things are going to be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending otherwise and why would you want to ? <p> " Take it as a compliment and be pleased you are somewhere people want to achieve . <p> " We want to drive ourselves on . <p> " Take nothing for granted but try to make it one match more ( unbeaten ) , then another , then another . <p> " Okay , it might not happen . But that 's the attitude you 've got to have . " <p> Port Vale , now managed by former United midfielder Bruno Ribeiro , have also begun the present campaign in encouraging fashion after appointing the Portuguese in June . <p> Wilder , who took charge at Bramall Lane a month earlier , will be without Chris Basham for the match as he completes a suspension but Caolan Lavery could return after injury . <p> Basham , who was sent-off against Scunthorpe nearly three weeks ago , did feature in last week 's Checkatrade Trophy tie against Walsall but saw his absence from the side extended when Saturday 's league meeting with Jon Whitney 's team was postponed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him ticking over , " Wilder said . <p> " Because he was eligible for that one , it was important for him to be involved and hopefully it should help his sharpness when he 's available again .

 on hosting Great Exhibition of the North <h> Sheffield was shortlisted to host the Great Exhibition of the North <h> Claire Lewis <h> Sheffield has lost out on its bid to host the ? 5 million Great Exhibition of the North . <p> The city was one of four short-listed for the honour , narrowly missing out to the Newcastle-Gateshead bid . <p> Bradford and Blackpool were also in the running to host the two-month exhibition to celebrate the best of art , culture and design in the north . <p> The Government is contributing ? 5 million towards the exhibition itself and a further ? 15 million into a legacy fund to attract further cultural investment in the north to help boost the economy . <p> One of those behind Sheffield 's bid , Professor Vanessa Toulmin , Director of City and Cultural Engagement at The University of Sheffield , said : " Sheffield was honoured to be shortlisted and we 'd like to offer our congratulations to Newcastle-Gateshead being chosen to host the Great Exhibition of the North . <p> " The bid process has been an amazing experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do this without the tremendous support of the creative communities , industries and businesses of our great region . <p> " This exhibition is a platform for the whole of the North to celebrate and showcase the best of what we have -- whether it 's ground breaking innovations or a whole host of inspirational treasures .

 with Richard Blackledge : Sheffield 's leisure time top of agenda for council chief <h> Paul Billington Head of Leisure at Sheffield City Council in Tudor Square <h> Richard Blackledge <p> From overseeing Sheffield 's parks and sport to its arts and major events , leisure chief Paul Billington 's brief is one of the highest-profile at the city council , covering services enjoyed by thousands . <p> By law , of all the things the director of culture and environment is responsible for , the only facility his department is duty-bound to provide is allotments . <h> Paul Billington Head of Leisure at Sheffield City Council in Tudor Square <p> But after six years in which the council has had to make more than ? 350 million in savings , Mr Billington believes Sheffield 's green spaces , cultural venues and leisure facilities have been protected from too many damaging and irreversible cuts precisely because they are so well-loved . <p> " We could be seen as more vulnerable , " he says . <p> " But the upside is because what we do is so visible , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political commitment to the things we do is significant . So we 're not statutory , and we could be cut , but to be fair to the council , because lots of people value what we do , we 've tried to minimise the reductions on services . " <p> Mr Billington has been in his current role for nearly a decade , but joined the council in the mid-1980s . " A long time ago when things were very different , " he smiles . <p> Today 's cuts are ' possibly worse ' than those of 30 years ago , though , he quickly adds . <p> " Some of the easier reductions were made a long time ago and to do it again means you 're really into the harder stuff . A good example is if you think about the sports facilities that have been , in Sheffield 's case , managed by an independent charitable trust for a number of years -- as have the museums that delivered savings in the 1990s and beyond . <p> " Many councils , including some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that option . We 've done that already and we 're still having to make the same level of savings that they are . " <p> Controversial changes proposed on Mr Billington 's watch include the closure of Don Valley Stadium and the loss of Stocksbridge Leisure Centre . Even the sale of Cottage a dilapidated building on the edge of Graves Park was fiercely opposed by protesters . <p> Public opposition ' can be a headache ' , he accepts . " But really it 's a good headache , because the fact people get so animated and sometimes angry about their parks and sports facilities , ultimately it 's really positive because it shows they care . If the council was suggesting things , and nobody said anything , it 's probably because they were n't interested . And that really would be sad . " <p> Mr Billington is one of the council 's top earners , with a pay packet of ? 80,000 a year . He exudes a genuine passion and enthusiasm for local issues , and says he enjoys the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I think I 'm lucky , virtually everything I 'm involved in is important to the public and therefore important to the politicians . A lot of what the council does is invisible to people . For me the excitement comes from knowing you can actually see some difference , whether you 're walking in a park or you 're driving along Bochum Parkway and you can see a brand-new leisure centre , or just small things like improving a football pitch or new allotments in Totley . <p> " It 's exciting but it 's also a privileged position , to have that level of influence . But anything I do works through the political process . Key decisions that are made are n't necessarily mine . " <p> He 's proud of ' retaining quality spaces in the city centre ' , such as the Peace Gardens and Winter Garden , as well as ' managing to square the circle ' amid reductions to the parks budget and helping to bring in ? 35m of investment for sites such as Thorncliffe and Graves sports centres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council acts as the landlord for facilities such as Ponds Forge and the City Hall , the majority are run by Sheffield International Venues , including Sheffield Arena , which has been managed ' in house ' since March and has managed to fend off rivalry from Leeds ' city centre arena , Mr Billington contends . <p> " There was a lot of concern at the time the Leeds Arena was being planned and immediately following its opening , but I 'm pleased to say Sheffield Arena continues to perform extremely well and remains a success . " <p> Asked whether the council would consider matching Leeds ' model with a city centre arena , he offers : " I 've no reason to think it would be anywhere else . " <p> The decision to shut Don Valley Stadium has been justified in the last three years , the director maintains . <p> " Don Valley was operated at incredibly high levels of subsidy with low levels of usage . The choice was , do we close the stadium and save ? 700,000 , or close three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that we faced , Don Valley was the one that would have the least worst impact on Sheffield . " <p> Meanwhile a project run alongside the National Trust , looking at creating an endowment fund and charitable body to maintain Sheffield 's parks , has concluded , with the idea shelved . <p> " For now we will leave things as they are . The idea of creating the endowment fund of at least ? 100m is a major challenge . The new body would be a fledgling charity asked to pick up the responsibility of around 800 green sites . " <p> Later this month the first Asda Foundation Sheffield 10K will be held the successor to the Great Yorkshire Run in the city centre . Jane Tomlinson 's Run for All is now in charge of the event , adding to its stewardship of Sheffield 's half marathon , after the council parted ways with Nova International which owns the Great Run brand . <p> The council is in line for a better deal by receiving a share of income from the race . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by Nova 's decision to stage the Great Yorkshire Run in Harrogate in July , and says Sheffield can expect a ' great day ' on October 30 . <p> " We think we 've got a better route and we 're pretty confident the numbers will grow . If you think about running in Sheffield , from the Parkruns through to Race for Life for women and girls , through to the 10k to the half marathon , there are stepping stones there for people if they want to increase their distances .

 centre , winning at Doncaster last month , could score for Aidan OBrien if she 's allowed to tackle the 2m distance for the first time . Photo : Anna Gowthorpe/PA Wire <h> Richard Silverwood 's racing column <p> It scarcely seems credible that more than six months have passed since it all began . <p> Since THE LAST LION bolted up in the Betway Brocklesby . Since SECRET BRIEF ploughed his way through the Doncaster mud in the Betway Lincoln . <p> But here we are , one richly entertaining campaign later , on the brink of the Flat season 's climax , courtesy of Qipco British Champions Day at Ascot this Saturday . <p> Considering the event is still only in its infancy , the impact it has made on British racing has been little short of sensational . Four Group Ones , a Group Two and a fiercely competitive 1m handicap add up to a card oozing appeal , not to mention ? 4.26 million in prize money , and one that has already yielded a roll call of winners that would n't be out of place in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Des Aigles to Solow and <p> Lurking in some dark corner of the corridors of racing medialand are dinosaurs , their National Hunt leanings protruding like the sorest of thumbs , who continue to question the viability of the project . And they do so , unashamedly , on the basis that , because we 're in the middle of October , it might rain . But if we applied that sort of logic , we 'd have needed to move the dates of most of this year 's major Flat meetings , given how they have been blighted by downpours . <p> The fact is that , despite plenty of dig in the ground for four of the five Champions Days staged so far , the quality of the racing has not been diminished . And the spectacular nature of the event , expertly overseen by Rod Street and his devoted enthusiasts at Great British Racing , has created a feelgood finale that , much like the Cheltenham Festival in March , makes you proud racing is your chosen sport . <p> The weather forecast looks so encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is my potted race-by-race guide based on the five-day declarations . <p> 1.25 LONG DISTANCE CUP 2M <p> A race that features the last two winners of the Ascot Gold Cup , most notably ORDER OF ST GEORGE , who will be a short-priced favourite after his excellent third in the Arc over an inadequate trip . QUEST FOR MORE arrives in the form of his life , while FORGOTTEN RULES has been laid out by trainer Dermot Weld to repeat his success two years ago . But the chief threat to Aidan O'Brien 's standout could be last year 's St Leger heroine , SIMPLE VERSE , if she 's allowed to take her chance and tackle this 2m distance for the first time . <p> 2.00 SPRINT 6F <p> A potentially vintage renewal could feature a mouthwatering clash of the three sprinters to have lit up the season , MECCA 'S ANGEL , LIMATO and QUIET REFLECTION . All have been breathtaking winners of Group One contests , and yet all could well be trumped if John Gosden 's is still as smart as he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a successful comeback on this track two weeks ago . Not to be discounted are the likes of Royal Ascot winner TWILIGHT SON and THE TIN MAN , who were on the heels of the mighty Muhaarar in last year 's race , and French raider SIGNS OF BLESSING . <p> 2.35 FILLIES AND MARES 12F <p> With a battalion of fillies that includes Arc heroine FOUND , dual Classic winner MINDING and rapid improver SEVENTH HEAVEN at his disposal , Aidan O'Brien holds most of the aces here . Last year 's winner SIMPLE VERSE appears to need further now , while Arc Day victor SPEEDY BOARDING is probably best over shorter . But the wily Dermot Weld saddles a serious danger in , and neither QUEEN 'S TRUST nor ARCHITECTURE would be winning out of turn after consistent efforts at the top table all year . John Gosden 's JOURNEY has been primed to go one better than 12 months ago , while Godolphin 's ENDLESS TIME has an each/way squeak . <p> 3.10 QE II STAKES 1M <p> Trends suggest that only horses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it might be best to concentrate on yet another clash featuring Guineas winners GALILEO GOLD and , and a rival who might well be improving past them both , Richard Fahey 's RIBCHESTER , victory for whom would crown Godolphin as champion owners for the season . In the absence of injury victim THE GURKHA , who has beaten all three , Aidan O'Brien could rely on ALICE SPRINGS , but not since 1987 has the prize gone to a filly . <p> 3.45 CHAMPION STAKES 10F <p> This is a race that Aidan O'Brien has yet to crack , so it might be the one he chucks the aforementioned FOUND or MINDING at . The most likely winner , however , is ALMANZOR , French flagbearer of a prolific season for Jean-Claude Rouget and winner of the highest-quality Flat race seen anywhere in the world this term , the Irish Champion Stakes , where he beat the two Ballydoyle fillies . Last year 's winner and beaten favourite , FASCINATING ROCK and JACK HOBBS , add spice , as would O'Brien 's Derby runner-up , US ARMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are topped by David O'Meara 's consistent FIRMAMENT , while is long overdue a race of this type and Roger Varian 's progressive is considered Group class . John Gosden , who has hit the bar in two previous runnings , has booked Ryan Moore for top weight GM HOPKINS and is also responsible for one of two talented 3yos hoping to squeeze in at the foot of the weights , CASTLE HARBOUR . The other is Godolphin 's VERY TALENTED , who was third in the Cambridgeshire . <h> Beamish Museum heading

" <p> It has been a long road to transforming Park Hill into a place for Sheffield to be proud of again . <p> Park Hill was the first completed post-war slum clearance scheme of an entire community in Britain . It was built between 1957 and 1961 , with architects attempting to recreate the strong sense of community in the old Park area with neighbours rehoused alongside each other in the new development . <p> Each flat opened out on to a 10ft wide walkway providing access for milk floats and communal areas that promoted the ' streets in the sky ' concept . <p> A landmark BBC documentary filmed in 1965 captured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the new flats . <p> But the concrete block was condemned as an eyesore by the 1980s and became associated with drug problems and crime . <p> Despite this , Park Hill became a Grade II listed building in 1998 , identified by the Department of Culture , Media and Sport as a ' building of outstanding interest ' . <p> The controversial decision was criticised at the time due to the estate 's reputation and the look of the flats . <p> The Royal Town Planning Institute said listed modern buildings should not include ' failures ' such as Park Hill . <p> In 2003 , Sheffield Council and national regeneration agency English Partnerships began to put together a vision of a more positive future for Park Hill , with existing tenants asked to leave from December that year . <p> They selected Urban Splash as a development partner the follow year , with Great Places Housing Group chosen as a registered social landlord . <p> In 2006 Park Hill Junior School was closed , as the numbers of pupils was falling .

It was a great game of rugby whether you were a Sheffield or a Nuneaton fan . <p> " It was an excellent game for any neutrals ; within the first 15 minutes both teams had scored twice the game looked like it was going to be a cricket score . <p> " We played exactly how we know we could play .

 secret world of depression haunting Sheffield and South Yorkshire boxers <h> Bob Westerdale <p> In the macho world of boxing , you wo n't find many fighters willing to talk about a secret undercurrent that pervades the sport . <p> But Tyson Fury 's decision to vacate his world titles to focus on the bigger challenge of his own mental health has blown the lid of a hidden problem that is " rife " in the world of pugilism . <p> While Fury shocked the boxing world by beating Wladimir Klitschko he has never faced a more menacing opponent than depression . <p> There have been times when he has not wanted to live any more . <p> Across South Yorkshire , there are boxers who might not be experiencing the same parlous scale of depression and melancholy - but they 've had to face their own demons . <p> Some of them have been brave enough to make their problems public , in the hope of helping others . <h> David Allen , left , ignores the abuse thrown by Jason Gavern . <p> They revealed their innermost thoughts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 24 , Allen is currently taking a rest from heavyweight combat so he can recover from a bout of depression which followed his biggest ever ring contest , against the current British champion Dillian Whyte . <p> " Tyson shares some of the behavioural patterns that depression has caused in me - happy one second , down in the dumps the next " says the Conisbrough man , who has developed quite a following in the past couple of years . <h> The end of the road for Ross Burkinshaw <p> " I have struggled with depression since I was 14 but swept it under the carpet .

Up until a couple of months ago , I could n't watch a boxing match on TV without shedding a tear . <p> " I downed a bottle of wine every night as I tried to get my head around it .

 man at the game offers six talking points . Have your say on the game in the comments below , on Twitter or our dedicated Blades Facebook page . <p> Is there a better midfield three in the league than Fleck , Coutts and Duffy ? On current form , I think not . Chris Basham , previously a shoo-in , will struggle to regain his place after completing his suspension and here , Fleck showed his undoubted quality for perhaps the first time this season . <p> Coutts , who continues to go from strength to strength , excelled both offensively and defensively and Duffy , a player I really rate , capped another good display with a goal before being replaced . <p> But Basham , along with the likes of Caolan Lavery and Leon Clarke , will still have massive parts to play . As former Blades legend Kevin Gage wrote in his weekly column in this newspaper , Basham is " Mr Versatile , and a managers dream with his commitment , drive &amp; enthusiasm . We know his limitations , but usually forgive him . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card ? Competition for places is now hot , and he may miss out . However , if so , he 'll keep all others on their toes as he can ' do a job ' anywhere . " <p> Ethan Ebanks-Landell is developing a real taste for goals , with two more here to add to his late leveller at Fleetwood . After years of set-piece profligacy , it was pleasing to see both his goals come from corners and he was my man of the match - with a lot of challengers - after a superb defensive display , too . Wolves must have some serious talent if they can afford to let this lad leave on loan , and if United can secure his services permanently then it would appear , on the evidence so far , to be a superb piece of business . <p> He fancied his hat-trick , too . Hypothetically , Ebanks-Landell was asked post-match what would have happened if United got a 90th-minute penalty . ' I 'm on it , ' he replied without hesitation . No doubt skipper Billy Sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had something to say - but who could , or would , really argue with the man nicknamed ' The Tank ' ? ! <p> United 's victory was achieved by offensive class , but was built on defensive solidarity , too . Jake Wright and Jack O'Connell were excellent alongside Ebanks-Landell , and Kieron Freeman produced a stunning , late tackle to deny Vale early on . And then , on a rare occasion when United 's rearguard was breached , Simon Moore pulled off a superb block to deny Alex Jones a consolation . <p> Another mention for Gagey , too ; he 'll have been delighted to see three Blades players - Matt Done , Jack O'Connell and Paul Coutts - wearing black boots . Another excellent 19,000-plus crowd - some who will already be part of the ' I saw Paul Coutts score a goal ' club - also saw 5ft 6in Stefan Scougall score a very rare header , and some are even indulging in an even rarer wave of optimism ! @ @ Amman , Jordan 
 Olive Grove is the first great working-class football story . <p> Born at a unique moment in the history of the beautiful game , Fred Spiksley was amongst a new wave of teenagers who from 1885 onwards could aspire to be a professional footballer and dodge the inevitability of industrial labour . <p> He became the first player to score a hat-trick against Scotland and in 1896 he guided Sheffield Wednesday to FA Cup glory with four goals and 8 assists during the cup run . <p> His first goal in the final is considered by some to be the fastest ever goal in FA Cup final history . <p> At his peak he was the fastest winger in England and possessed total ball control . <p> He was a player with such ability that he was able to take his club and country to the pinnacle of football during an era where his slender frame did not suit the rough treatment that was often meted out to him . <p> With Fred Spiksley on the field no match was ever lost .

 outside a farmhouse his grandfather was renovating when he went missing on the Greek island of Kos on July 24 , 1991 . <p> His family always believed he had been abducted but in June a man came forward and told the police his friend could have accidentally crushed Ben while he was clearing a building plot . <p> The digger driver died last year . <p> Police officers from South Yorkshire spent three weeks excavating the area around the farmhouse and the site where the digger driver dumped land . <p> It us understood that a yellow toy car was found at the spot where the digger driver dumped material from the building plot he was working on . <p> Ben 's grandmother Christine told the Daily Mirror she remembered buying him two toy cars in Kos town centre . <p> The 64-year-old said : " I was shaken by it and both me and Kerry ( Ben 's mother ) cried .

 with Richard Blackledge : Life on the frontline of change in Sheffield 's health service <h> Richard Blackledge <p> The idea of getting more patients out of hospital and treating them closer to home has been an ambition for years in Sheffield . <p> But the head of the organisation responsible for guarding the city 's health money is candid in admitting : " We 've not really achieved it - and we 've still got a way to go . " <p> Maddy Ruff is the accountable officer for the NHS Sheffield Clinical Commissioning Group , and has been in the role for just over 12 months , grappling with the challenge of boosting community services closer to patients ' homes when there is little chance of an increase in funding in the near future . <p> The CCG is facing a ? 30 million shortfall this year , while Sheffield 's adult and children 's hospitals are ' increasingly coming under pressure ' , says Ms Ruff , who came to the city with more than 20 years ' NHS experience , having held a variety of board-level positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chief executive , but with a title that suggests the buck stops with her , and a pay packet to match around ? 80,000 a year plus pension and performance bonus . <p> " It 's been a really interesting year , in that I suppose what I had n't appreciated when I came to Sheffield is just how big and how complex the health system is here . " <p> She suggested the sheer size and scope of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals had to some extent impeded change . <p> " When you have a very successful hospital , in a way it 's too good , so it provides a whole range of services , whereas in other areas the district generals have struggled to recruit staff and some of the clinical specialities have n't been able to continue . <p> " Sheffield Teaching Hospitals have never really had that problem . And probably more patients go to hospital in Sheffield than maybe would do in other areas . " <p> She adds : " If everybody 's got lots of money , they can all get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you bring in financial challenge , if you 're not careful everybody retreats into their own organisations . <p> " But I think there 's a genuine willingness to look at the ' Sheffield pound ' all the resource that comes into Sheffield - and how we best spend that . <p> " We wo n't get it right first time and there will be some disagreements and challenging conversations along the way , but I think the intent is there . " <p> A combined , single budget , collecting every penny Sheffield receives for health and social care , would total around ? 1.2 billion . If the city can manage this effectively it would be a radical step , and Ms Ruff is reluctant to put a timescale on its implementation . <p> " I would n't like to nail my colours to the mast and say when it could happen , but I think we 're making all the right steps towards that happening . We 've talked about having a ' shadow period ' next year . " <p> She 's proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one element of which is an ' out of hospital ' plan centred on the idea of creating 16 neighbourhoods across Sheffield , each with a population size of between 30,000 and 50,000 . <p> " It 's not just about GP services , it 's about how we then wrap around social care and the voluntary sector so we create services that meet the needs of that neighbourhood , " says Ms Ruff . <p> " And the exciting thing for me is we 're not saying one size fits all . So in a neighbourhood in the city centre , where perhaps the majority of people do n't speak English as a first language , those services would be completely different to the range of services we might develop in Dore and Totley . " <p> Through ' social prescribing ' referring patients to charities and voluntary organisations -- patients are even being given help with needs indirectly related to health , such as filling out benefit forms . <p> More pressingly , there is the need to sign contracts with health providers for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , by December 23 . <p> " Andrew Cash at the teaching hospitals has got to balance his books , just as I 've got to balance mine , " says Ms Ruff . <p> " There are tensions , there are bound to be , because clearly , as with any contract negotiation , they wo n't want to put themselves in a position where they 're not sustainable financially . It 's a trust thing . They have to trust that services really will be delivered in the community for them to reduce their cost base say , the number of clinics they run . That saves me some money to move it into the community but then , if the same number of patients go through the hospital Andrew 's not getting paid for it . " <p> However , even if the need to make cuts disappeared , Ms Ruff believes change would still be necessary . <p> " We would need to change the kind of care we give people and how we organise it . Patients are living longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals to support them and it does not have to be a doctor . " <p> There are difficulties in recruiting family doctors the idea of traditional ' partnerships ' is off-putting for new medics and efforts are under way to increase the numbers of nurse practitioners , physiotherapists and pharmacists who can see patients for straightforward conditions . <p> There is also the hope that , with more support , the voluntary sector can step in to bridge the gap . <p> " What they manage to do on a small amount of money I think we could all learn from . <p> Often it 's on a shoestring and they do n't know where the next pay cheque is coming from , and so one of the things we are looking at is how to support the sector more . I think they could play an even bigger and better role in the way we develop the ' neighbourhoods ' . " <p> Savings have been made by buying cheaper drugs - simply purchasing a different brand of inhaler has saved ? 500,000 this year - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " People have no idea how much drugs cost , " says Ms Ruff . <p> " There are things that we have put restrictions on -- things like plastic surgery where it is not clinically necessary . Because if we did that we would n't be able to pay for all those hip operations and heart operations . " <p> But there remain ' lots of red lines ' where cuts would be unthinkable , she concluded , saying firmly : " People are entitled to a health service . " <p> A ' more integrated approach ' to urgent care <p> Sheffield 's urgent care strategy a review of out-of-hours services , A&amp;E and more is taking shape , said Maddy Ruff . <p> The city 's four out-of-hours hubs at the Northern General , Crookes , Woodhouse and Heeley paid for with ? 9.7 million from the Prime Minister 's GP Access Fund are being encouraged to work closer together , and the role of pharmacies is being strengthened . <p> Mental health patients , children and adults , are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanies police on busy nights throughout the week . <p> " Some of our services were not brilliant , " said Ms Ruff . <p> " Somebody with mental health problems should n't end up in A&amp;E or , even worse , a police cell . " <p> The status of the GP walk-in centre on Broad Lane , and the minor injuries unit at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital , has yet to be confirmed . The Hallamshire facility was once an A&amp;E , and the decision to downgrade it sparked a furore in the 1990s . <p> " What we 're going to try to look at is a more integrated , joined-up approach , rather than all these different services , " said Ms Ruff . " But we have to be conscious that Sheffield is a big city , so we have to know that we 're providing services that are accessible to everybody . <p> " If there are major changes , we will be consulting with the public . We wo n't just make a unilateral decision , we will come out with options for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that stage yet . " <p> She added : " Part of the problem is that we 've confused people . We 've got this myriad of services and they 're not really sure what does what - the one that they 've all heard about is accident and emergency and I think part of our A&amp;E strategy is to simplify things so that it 's much clearer . <p> Arlene Foster said

" <p> Spending time in the company of Myers and his good mate Si King is pure laughter-filled joy , particularly when they 're so enthused by their latest project .

 highlights of Sheffield Wednesday 1 QPR 0 <h> Owls star man Barry Bannan . Pictures : Steve Ellis <h> Dom Howson <p> It has mainly been their promotion rivals who have received the plaudits and accolades so far this season . <p> But Sheffield Wednesday have quietly gone about their business and are steadily creeping up the Championship table . <p> In truth , boss Carlos Carvalhal would probably prefer his Owls side to carry on avoiding the spotlight . It suits last year 's play-off finalists more to keep flying under the radar . <p> Let people talk and big up Newcastle United , Brighton and Hove Albion , Huddersfield Town and Norwich City 's prospects of going up . Carvalhal loves nothing more than playing the underdog card and creating a siege mentality . <p> The fact is , things are all nicely falling into place and Gary Hooper 's 40th-minute strike helped them see off a compact , stubborn Queens Park Rangers outfit and move up to fifth in the standings . <h> Cameron Dawson on his first Owls start <p> The margin of the victory could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their inability to kill off sides when on top in matches is still a puzzle which needs solving . <p> QPR gave as good as they got and Cameron Dawson , deputising in between the sticks for the injured Keiren Westwood , produced several excellent saves , including an outstanding reflex stop to deny R 's skipper Nedum Onuoha in the second half . Tom Lees also cleared the visiting dangerman Tjaronn Chery 's shot off the line in the closing stages . <p> However , it would have been a travesty had the Owls failed to pick up maximum points , having dominated the contest for long periods . <h> Gary Hooper scores <p> BARRY BANNAN RAN THE SHOW <p> As expected , Carvalhal restored Barry Bannan to his midfield and the ex-Aston Villa trainee pulled the strings . <p> Having been left out of the matchday squad against Cardiff City , Bannan had a point to prove . The 26-year-old , one of four changes , always seemed hungry to get on the ball and put Wednesday on the front foot . <p> Carvalhal swapped Bannan and Kieran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right wing into the centre as he wanted to tighten their grip on proceedings . Would the tactical change diminish Bannan 's influence ? No chance ! <h> Wednesday celebrate <p> The Scotland international 's range of passing was superb and he created a number of chances for his teammates which should have been converted . <p> This was more like the we have grown accustomed to seeing . It was undeniably his best display this term . <p> Carvalhal said Bannan was " completely tired " after the international break so decided to rest him after his disappointing performance against Huddersfield . It was just the break Bannan needed to get himself going again and another good piece of man-management by Carvalhal . <p> KEEPER PROVES HIS WORTH <p> Bannan was n't the only individual who caught the eye . Academy graduate Dawson , making his first Owls start after Westwood was ruled out with a back problem , recovered well after a shaky opening . He denied Chery twice and his save to foil Onuoha was sensational . <p> Carvalhal said : " Cammy had a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a boy who we gave confidence to . <h> Fernando Forestieri <p> " It is similar to Joe Wildsmith last season who came in and played a lot of games at a young age . <p> " I have complete trust in all of our goalkeepers and sleep very easy no matter which one of them starts . " <p> Should Westwood miss Saturday 's trip to Derby County , Dawson appears a more than adequate replacement . <p> A GREAT THREE GAMES <p> As a relieved Carvalhal pointed out post-match , the Championship is a unique division . <p> " There is not a big difference between any of the teams , " he said . You could argue with Carvalhal on that point as some of the top sides do seem a lot better than the rest , but it is an unpredictable , unforgiving league . It is a marathon competition and nobody is running away with it . <p> Consistency is the key and Wednesday picked up seven points out of a possible nine from a week which Carvalhal had described as their " hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . They ended the period on a high note by beating QPR , who were on a five-match unbeaten streak . It is promotion form and the Owls are looking in good shape . <p> In what has

 know the terms of Brexit <h> Brexit <p> Several recent Star letters have sharply criticised anyone suggesting that the British people should have a say on the terms reached for the UK leaving the EU . <p> Given the assertions made by the Leave campaign that we shall be able to trade with the EU Single Market on exactly the same terms as if we were still a full member , without obeying the rules or paying into the system including the claim ( untrue ) that we pay ? 350 million a week to the EU which will be spent on the NHS we do need to know if these turn out to be true . <p> If in fact the negotiations produce a very different scenario , it seems logical that either the electorate as a whole , or Parliament , should vote on whether the final terms for Brexit are what people voted for by 51.9% to 48.1% on June 23 . <p> It should also be noted that the legislation to hold the referendum specifically stated that it was " advisory " , so given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any settlement should be very carefully scrutinised before the final decision is made .

 Ferguson is that centre halves Andy Butler , Mathieu Baudry and Joe Wright would probably all feature on a list of his best 11 players - but operating with a back three just does not seem to be working . <p> One solution might to be reinstate the Butler and Wright partnership , and play in a defensive midfield role alongside Jordan Houghton . <p> Concentrate ! <p> At League Two level you probably have to expect that individual mistakes and lapses in concentration will happen . <p> But Ferguson has to find a way of reducing the number of basic defensive errors that are leading to goals . <p> Blackpool 's first two goals - caused by Baudry being out of position and Cedric Evina not dealing with a cross - were the result of some defending . <p> Evina , who continues to be something of a defensive liability , could well pay the price this weekend .

 Tommy Rowe becomes latest victim of injury curse <h> Tommy Rowe against Wycombe . Picture : Chris Etchells <p> Darren Ferguson is braced for more bad news on the injury front after star midfielder Tommy Rowe became the latest victim of Rovers ' injury curse . <p> Rowe took a whack on an old foot injury and was forced off at half time during Saturday 's 2-2 draw with Wycombe Wanderers . <p> The 28-year-old , who broke a bone in his foot during an injury-ravaged spell at previous club Wolves , left the Keepmoat Stadium on Saturday on crutches . <p> Rowe seems likely to face a lengthy spell out and becomes the latest in a long line of Rovers players to have been condemned to the treatment room this season . <p> " I do n't think it 's good , " said Ferguson in his post-match interview . <p> " He 's been caught really badly on an old injury where he 's got a screw in his foot - right on the same spot .

It 's damaging when two of your best players are going to be out . " <p> Meanwhile , two costly mistakes from goalkeeper Ross Etheridge , both capitalised upon by Wycombe 's Matt Bloomfield , cancelled out goals from Rowe and John Marquis . <p> " We felt this was a game that would get rid of the demons of last week and we 'd kick on again , so it 's disappointing that we have n't won the game , " said Ferguson . <p> " The game should 've been over at half time . We should 've put it to bed and it should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first half and recovered quickly from an error that put us behind . <p> " The second half just got scrappy and it was not how I wanted it .

 Sheffield Utd <p> The players may be different and the formation could change but Chris Wilder insists that when Sheffield United kick off their FA Cup campaign tomorrow afternoon , one thing will remain constant . <p> " We expect a performance , " the Blades boss said , of his side 's clash against Leyton Orient at Bramall Lane . <p> " Whatever team we put out . We appreciate we wo n't get a 20,000 crowd like we did against MK Dons , which was a fantastic effort and one we 're very grateful of , but it 's still a big game for us . <p> " There 'll be opportunities for a couple of players to come in and impress , and for the others to keep bang in form . <p> " We 've got a team which is still learning how to win , that wants to win , and that wo n't change on Sunday .

 of remembrance <p> A blind veteran from Chesterfield is set to march at the Cenotaph in London this Remembrance Sunday . <p> Brian Eldridge will join 100 others blind veterans from the charity Blind Veterans Uk in the capital for this weekend 's commemoration , which also coincides with the 100th anniversary of the end of the Battle of the Somme . <p> Brian , aged 69 , joined the army in 1966 , when he was 19 , and served in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps training dogs , and the army . He served in Germany and Hong Kong before leaving the army to work for an aerospace company , working with electronics for military aircraft . It was here that Brian first became aware of problems with his eyesight . He was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa . Brian tried to cope with his deteriorating sight but , after a serious incident in the workplace , he decided to retire and was registered blind in 2001 . <p> Brian , who became a standard bearer for the charity in 2008 , said : " When I first retired after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure what lay ahead of me . <p> " The biggest thing Blind Veterans UK has done for me is to give me back my confidence , which is very important to me . <p> " Since receiving support from the charity I 've met some wonderful like-minded friends and enjoyed some great experiences with them . I 'm extremely proud to represent Blind Veterans UK in the Remembrance march and will continue to do so for as long as I can . I will do it for everyone I 've met since becoming part of Blind Veterans UK and all the people I served with . " <h> Services <h> Trader 
 the visitors , who like Marcus Bignot 's side were unable to reach the knockout stages regardless of the result , were able to use the tie to blood some of the promising young talent within their youth ranks . <p> One of those Regan Slater , marked his first taste of senior football with a superb second-half finish after Kayden Jackson , on loan from Barnsley , had earlier edged the hosts in front . <p> An own goal from Andrew Boyce and Jack O'Connell effort extended United 's lead before substitute Leon Clarke , now recovered from the ankle complaint which has troubled him since the summer , ended Grimsby 's hopes of a comeback . <p> The absurdity of a tournament ostensibly designed to promote the development of young players is that United were required to break the rules to ensure it served that purpose at Bramall Lane . With Chris Basham and Kieron Freeman the only survivors of the starting eleven which beat MK Dons 12 days ago , Wilder 's team selection means the visitors are likely to be hit with an English Football League fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations meant the likes of Graham Kelly and David Brooks gained valuable experience while fellow teenagers Jordan Hallam , Joe Cummings and Slater also made their professional debuts . <p> If United had been able to do so without risk of censure during their meetings with Leicester City under-21 's and Walsall then perhaps the EFL 's revamp would enjoy more support . <p> Despite the subdued atmosphere - less than 600 people watched the action unfold - the Northern Group H dead-rubber was a memorable occasion for 10 of the 11 Academy graduates named in Wilder 's squad . For the other , George Long , it was an opportunity to press his claims for a more prominent role between now and the end of the season after losing his place to Simon Moore . <p> Long , who appeared destined to leave United following the 26-year-old 's arrival in August , suffered a crisis of confidence at the beginning of the campaign . But he remains an accomplished goalkeeper with a long future in the game and , despite being powerless to prevent Jackson from breaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquitted himself well to deny the Grimsby centre-forward a second soon after . <p> However , he will have been disappointed not to have dealt better with the long-range shot which led to Disley 's late strike . <p> With Wilder making no secret of the fact that Sunday 's meeting with Chesterfield , not salvaging something from what has been a thoroughly underwhelming Checkatrade Trophy adventure , the sight of Matt Done and Clarke making their returns from injury was an encouraging sign . Together with Slater 's tenacity , clinical finish and Jordan Hallam 's relentless running in attack . <p> Organisers take note . There is life - and plenty of ability - beyond Category A academies in the Championship and Premier League . <p> Town , playing their first fixture under new manager Bignot , caused United some problems before running out of ideas as the contest wore on . <p> The former Crewe , Millwall and Queens Park Rangers ' defender 's appointment , following a successful five year spell at Solihull Moors , was viewed as a surprise in some quarters . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues with Alan Buckley , Russell Slade and his predecessor Paul Hurst all impressing after making the step-up in north Lincolnshire . <p> In front of a crowd more in-keeping with a match at the Automated Technology Group Stadium than a between two professional clubs , Bignot 's reign got off the the best possible start . <p> A defensive mix-up allowed Jackson to break clear in the 14th minute and , with only Long to beat , he made no mistake from eight yards out . It was Grimsby 's first goal since James Berrett , who had earlier seen his appeal for a penalty rejected by referee Richard Clark , scored against Cambridge United three outings ago . <p> Hallam , whose performances at academy and under-23 level have earned glowing reviews in recent months , also had a strong claim for a spot-kick turned down after being upended by Zak Mills . <p> Long , recalled following a three month absence , had little more to do until the 28th minute when Jackson again darted clean through . This time , however , his shot failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself until the final moment , scrambled clear . <p> Reece Brown should have dragged United level when he inexplicably headed wide with the goal at his mercy just before the break . Hallam 's delivery from set-pieces was impressive throughout and , had the defender made a cleaner connection , Andy Warrington would not have stood a chance . <p> Instead , it was Regan who restored parity with a delightful drive past Warrington , playing only his second match since March 2013 , in the 53rd minute . Hallam was inches away from firing United ahead moments later but , after skipping past two markers , his effort flashed just wide . <p> Boyce turned Clarke 's angled effort into his own net with 14 minutes remaining . Three minutes later , O'Connell extended United 's advantage after benefiting from an excellent exchange between Hallam and Brooks . Disley reduced the deficit in the 81st minute after pouncing on a loose ball . But Clarke , with another perfectly placed shot , sealed victory for United . @ <h> Maria Fowler shows 
 Sheffield United Column : Is the Checkatrade Trophy a sign of things to come ? <p> If some folks within the game get their way then , yes , maybe . Chris Wilder 's team could well find themselves competing against Leicester City 's under-21 's and the like in the not so distant future . <h> Sheffield United began their Checkatrade Trophy campaign against a Leicester City under-21 team ? 2016 Sport Image all rights reserved <p> Although , as the sparse attendances confirm , it is not a prospect which excites Football League supporters . Or , for that matter , those who follow top-flight teams . <p> The decision to grant clubs boasting Category A academies entry into the competition has proved controversial for a host of different reasons . Not least because , despite repeated denials , it stinks of League Three mission creep . Their presence , given that achieving this status costs around ? 2m per year , also serves to underline the increasing gulf between the have 's and have not 's . <p> Assistant manager Alan Knill admitted United were " unsure " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 's Northern Group H fixture at Bramall Lane . Or , indeed , if the Italian would attend at all . What they were certain about , however , was that Wilder enjoyed no such freedom when it came to picking a side . Unless , of course , he wanted to hit his employers ' pocket . <p> " Each EFL club shall play its full available strength in and during all matches , " the competition 's rule book states . " The League will from time to time issue a policy as to what constitutes ' full available strength ' . Any club failing to meet this requirement will be required to pay a fine of up to ? 5,000 . " <h> Claudio Ranieri was not on the touchline for the game <p> Wilder 's predecessors Nigel Adkins and Nigel Clough ignored this threat and picked who they wanted in the Johnstone 's Paint Trophy , as the tournament used to be known . The latter famously named his starting eleven and substitutes 24 hours before a visit to Hartlepool a couple of years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which holds over 32,000 people is likely to have cost United money when City and then Walsall visited , wasting even more will understandably stick in their owners ' craws . <p> So what are the rules to which Leicester , Stoke City , Middlesbrough and other sides parachuted into the competition much adhere ? <p> " For the invited clubs , a registered player is one who would be registered and eligible to participate in a Premier League and/or Premier League 2 match commencing at the same time and on the same date as the match in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Premier League rules , " the EFL state . <h> Attendances for Checkatrade Trophy games have been poor . Pic Jamie <p> " Each invited club must ensure that in each match at least six of the starting eleven players named on the team sheet are players who were aged under 21 as at the 30th June in the year in which the season concerned commenced . " <p> Sounds suspiciously like a ' B ' team to me . <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to double the amount of prize money on offer during this season 's competition represents a vital source of revenue for financially troubled clubs . But I suspect it would not have been offered had the FL not agreed to the revamp . Nor , like Chinese stadium diplomacy , is it likely to be an altruistic act . Beijing has been building sports grounds across the globe for decades . Partly for humanitarian reasons but , as a World Policy Forum paper recently recognised , also to gain access to valuable mineral resources . And , it added , these projects are " catalysts for diplomatic recognition " too . Agendas , as those teams currently being acquired by Chinese owners might soon discover , can be skilfully concealed . <p> Richard Scudamore , the PL 's chief executive , has claimed this is not the case . <p> " Yes , of course we know some of our clubs would like B teams , " he told a national newspaper recently . " We look abroad and we see the benefit of B teams . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't work , and so this is it . We can console all these worried Football League clubs ' supporters . This is n't the thin end of the wedge , this is the block . It 's the beginning of the end of it . " <p> Aside from the slightly patronising tone , we all know things can change . And fast . The PL threatened to cease solidarity payments if FL clubs did not vote through the Elite Player Performance Plan ( EPPP ) in 2011 . Advocates insist EPPP brings consistency to youth coaching and development . Although , as campaign group Against League 3 rightly argue , allowing PL teams to take part in this season 's Checkatrade Trophy " drives a coach and horses through these claims . " Until several declined their invitations , only top-flight clubs with category one academies were being considered for a place . So youngsters attached to Championship sides who also enjoy this status were set to be denied the same opportunities afforded to their PL counterparts until the matter descended into chaos . <p> Quite how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's guess . <p> The assumption that PL clubs are better served to develop players is flawed . Ten members of the 23 man England squad which travelled to Euro 2016 progressed through the ranks at FL teams . Former United defender Kyle Walker , Joe Hart and John Stones included . The latter has just completed a ? 47.5m transfer from Everton to Manchester City . Clearly Pep Guardiola thinks he was denied a proper footballing education at Oakwell . <p> The JP Trophy used to be a worthwhile competition . No matter what its detractors said . It provided those working further down the pyramid with a realistic shot at a medal . Their fans the prospect of a day out at Wembley too . But , in its present format , the Checkatrade version is a lame but potentially dangerous duck . <h> Mark Allen survived

 home Rovers ' equaliser at Exeter <h> Liam Hoden <p> When it comes to taking your chance , Liam Mandeville may have just set the standard . <p> It may have taken a degree of verbal cajoling from Darren Ferguson but the young forward finally grasped his opportunity with a game-changing performance at Exeter . <p> Mandeville initially struggled to fit into Andy Williams ' boots after the striker was ruled out with a long term injury . <p> But after showing promising signs of coping with the pressure during last weekend 's FA Cup clash with Oldham Athletic , the 19-year-old put all the pieces of his undoubted quality together for the first time to carry Rovers to a remarkable turnaround . <p> After a lacklustre first half at St James ' Park , Rovers fell behind six minutes into the second period . <p> With the low afternoon sun in his eyes , Marko Marosi misjudged the flight of a long ball and rushed out of his goal before hauling down David Wheeler as he shaped to shoot . Reuben Reid stepped up and smashed home the resultant penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he celebrates giving Rovers the lead <p> Ferguson reshuffled the side , switching to a back three but Rovers still struggled for a real attacking presence . <p> That was until Mandeville 's introduction with 21 minutes to go as he injected much-needed energy into their play . <p> And within three minutes , he made a major impact , rising superbly to loop a header from James Coppinger 's fine cross over James Hamon and in off the bar . <p> The two sides went back and forth from there on , but Mandeville 's presence gave Rovers an added edge . <h> Marko Marosi can not keep out Reuben Reid 's penalty <p> Racing forward out wide , Mandeville cut back a low pass which John Marquis darted onto and powered home first time from the edge of the box to give them a 77th minute lead . <p> And after surviving a rally from Exeter , Mandeville and Marquis combined again to seal the win in the last minute . Mandeville surged forward in a direct run before squaring to the unmarked Marquis who slotted home confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that he felt Mandeville was the reason for the win and it is hard to disagree with the Rovers boss . <h> The Last Post is played ahead of the minute 's silence <p> Rovers were undoubtedly poor with the ball from the start of their clash with a side yet to win on their own turf this term . <p> Possession play was disappointing throughout . Long balls were far too often played up towards Marquis , who was effectively acting as a lone striker . It denied Rovers the opportunity to play their usual possession game and saw them unable to control the game in the middle of the park . <p> After a series of disappointing recent performances , Saturday was a worrying turn for the worse and ensured the questions Rovers need to answer only grew in number . <p> Mandeville 's intervention meant the concerns were masked as Rovers earned the win . <p> But they must take it as a missed bullet and react sufficiently before Hartlepool come to town next week . <p> Rovers ' goalkeeping department has not been the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty reliable presence between the sticks . <p> So a collective groan was almost audible around St James ' Park when he inexplicably raced out of his goal and clattered into Wheeler with a reckless challenge just inside the area . <p> He could perhaps use the setting sun as an excuse but a loss of composure is probably the greater reason . <p> The power Reid put into his penalty rendered it unstoppable , even though Marosi went the right way . <p> But he also went the right way in atoning for the calamitous conceding of the penalty with a commanding performance over the remainder of the half . <p> was strong to keep out a similarly powerful strike from Reid from close range and also palmed away a tricky bobbling effort from Ollie Watkins to keep Rovers ahead after Marquis had edged them in front . <p> He provided much need assurance in the later stages and for the coming weeks . <p> Not too long ago Rovers only seemed to be growing in confidence , reflected in controlled performances that marked them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals . <p> Over the last three or four weeks , that status has disappeared along with their ability to lock a stranglehold on games by dominating the ball . <p> Defensive instability has been well documented but there is a chicken and egg question as to how it relates to the lack of composure on the ball higher up the pitch . <p> Joe Wright , who looked solid through the first couple of months of the season , now seems shaky while Mathieu Baudry hardly looks the composed defender expected , both on and off the ball , particularly following his introduction in place of the injured Andy Butler at the break . <p> But the blame for the presence of nerves should not fall squarely on the shoulders of the defence . <p> Jordan Houghton was not his usual commanding presence in midfield , where Exeter had the edge as the Chelsea loanee and his team mates struggled to get hold of the ball . <p> The surprising lack of midfield control is quickly becoming the main issue for Rovers as it puts pressure on the defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lacking a foundation in the middle of the park tends to draw both Tommy Rowe and Coppinger deeper in search of the ball , leaving Marquis isolated . <h> Search NOLA.com <h>

" <p> Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough MP Gil Furniss responded by saying : " The number of children living in poverty in Sheffield and across the country is a national disgrace . All too often it is working parents doing the right thing that have to rely on foodbanks to get by . <p> " Whether it 's cutting benefits , closing Sure Start Centres , or the likes of Concentrix stopping single parents ' Tax Credits on no evidence , the Government are undermining families struggling to make ends meet .

 Rob Parsons <p> Sir Norman Bettison has accused his former employer South Yorkshire Police of unnecessarily prolonging an investigation into an allegation that he tried to sell stolen platinum because it was " fearful of a backlash " in the aftermath of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report . <p> Following an investigation by Derbyshire Police which ended in 2013 , the Rotherham-born former chief constable was found to have no case to answer over a claim that he was involved in the sale of platinum wire to a Sheffield firm . <p> South Yorkshire Police , which had asked the Derbyshire force to look into the claim , then decided to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service for a second opinion . The CPS announced the following year that there was " insufficient evidence to prosecute " . <p> Sir Norman , who has never previously commented publicly about the claims , has devoted two pages to describing the investigation in his new controversial book Hillsborough Untold : Aftermath of a Disaster . <p> Its publication has been criticised by families of the Hillsborough victims , particularly because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was part of a criminal conspiracy to shift blame onto Liverpool fans after the disaster . <p> He claims his former employer South Yorkshire Police was " fearful of a backlash " if it had closed down the platinum investigation after Derbyshire Police 's report , because of the political climate after the publication of the 2012 Hillsborough Independent Panel report . <p> But the former West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable has now come under fire from an MP over his description of the former South Yorkshire Police officer whose allegations prompted the investigation as " vindictive " and " dishonest " . <p> In the chapter In The Shadow of Salem , a reference to the witch trials of the 17th century , Sir Norman describes being " caught up in a witch hunt " after the publication of the 2012 report which revealed efforts by police to blame Liverpool fans for the tragedy . <p> He said that in the four years after this , " numerous allegations have been raised that I may have conspired with others to pervert the course of justice in all manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a particularly nasty historical aspersion cast about the integrity of my father . My dad , the most honest man I have known , sold a small amount of platinum swarf in 1987 , which he cleared out of my deceased grandfather 's workshop . <p> " Grandad had collected the filings in an old snuff tin and I was with my father when he sold it for about ? 100 at a reputable precious metal dealer . The precious metal dealer had a protocol with the local police to report all sales from private individuals . <p> " My father 's possession was enquired into and the inquiry was immediately closed . End of story . " <p> He claimed that a " vindictive former police officer , himself sacked for dishonesty and sent to prison " , shared the allegation with Labour MP John Mann , who appeared in the media and demanded the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) investigate . <p> The story was revealed by The Yorkshire Post in 2012 , after a retired officer said Sir Norman and another man were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of stolen platinum wire . <p> The retired officer said his former colleagues gathered evidence against both men at the time , but says no action was ever taken after it was referred up the chain in South Yorkshire Police . The force said at the time that despite extensive checks it had no record of any investigation . <p> Responding to the claims , Mr Mann said Sir Norman was mistaken about the identity of the officer whose allegations prompted the investigation . <p> He said : " His character assassination on an unnamed South Yorkshire police officer may well come back to bite Bettison . <p> " If he has knowledge of the source of the allegations then this can only have come through a criminal leak from within the police . <p> " If he has guessed wrongly at the source , which I strongly suspect , then he has launched an unwarranted and vicious attack on the wrong person and that has consequences . I will be pressing the IPCC on this matter . " <p> Describing the investigation in his book , Sir Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not see any merit in taking this further . South Yorkshire Police , on the other hand , found themselves in a tricky bind . <p> " Mr Mann 's accusations were of a historic South Yorkshire Police cover-up and so , in the current climate , they did not want to be seen to ignore the complaint , however far-fetched . Particularly as it came from an MP . <p> " South Yorkshire Police asked Derbyshire Police to investigate the matter , which they did with scrupulous attention , diverting valuable resources away from the protection of the people of Derbyshire . <p> " The investigators , over a number of months , traced and interviewed 51 witnesses . They recommended that there were no offences disclosed from their investigations . <p> " South Yorkshire Police , fearful of any backlash , still felt unable to accept that recommendation and closed down the investigation on their own authority . <p> " They sent all the papers to the CPS asking that they instead make the final decision on the matter . <p> " The head of CPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our years of working in partnership to reform the criminal justice system locally . <p> " He therefore sent the file to another CPS region for independent review . " <p> South Yorkshire Police declined to comment , while Sir Norman declined to comment on Mr Mann 's claims . <p> The Deputy President 
 Sheffield Wednesday fans should be preparing themselves to see the return of the Fernando Forestieri that wowed the Owls crowds last season . <p> The forward has yet to reach the heights of last term when he became the club 's leading goalscorer and this season has appeared to be struggling with the fall-out from that dispute at the early part of the campaign when he refused to play against Norwich City . <h> Fernando Forestieri is yet to reach the heights of last season 's form <p> However , during the international break , Carvalhal says he has seen signs of a different Forestieri , one more like the player that rocketed Wedneaday to the play-offs , with the head coach proclaiming that ' we have Fernando back again ' . <p> " Let me tell you about Fernando , " said Carvalhal ahead of Saturday 's trip to Fulham . <p> " I think we have Fernando back again , really back again . <p> " This week , two weeks , but especially this week , he has been very , very strong , very powerful , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he will express on Saturday , what he is doing these two weeks we will be with better Fernando again . <h> Fernando Forestieri 's last goal came against Huddersfield Town <p> " I am very happy about that of course , all of us because we are waiting for the best of Fernando because in reality he is back 100% to the Fernando of the big days at Sheffield Wednesday . " <p> Carvalhal admitted Forestieri is not the only one struggling to show last season 's worth , but the Portuguese is confident those under-performing will hit their best . <p> " It is not just Fernando who has n't performed 100% yet , " he said . " There are more players that we expect more from , they will do more in the future because we know that from last season . " <p> " We know that they can do better . They will show more . It is not just Fernando , to talk about him , we must talk about three or four more . <h> Owls head coach Carlos Carvalhal ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team so I am happy with them but their individual performance , they can do better and they will do better , I 'm absolutely sure . <p> " When they find the maximum we will be more strong and we need this . <p> I talk about Fernando because I felt this week that he is back again , ' I am here again with the maximum ' . <p> " I do n't want to put any pressure on any player , they are the first to want to do the best . " <p> Forestieri 's last goal for Wednesday came immediately after the last international break , when the Owls beat Huddersfield 1-0 at the John Smith 's Stadium last month . He has scored just three times this season , having scored 15 altogether last term . <h> Chancellor 's Corner 
 of community value <h> Walkley Library hub of the community <p> As one of the signatories on the application to register the Carnegie Walkley Library building as an asset of community value , I am delighted that the council has accepted the application and awarded this status . <p> I need to clarify the situation however as the recent articles in both The Star and the Sheffield Telegraph do not tell the whole story . It was not the council which took the action to register the library as implied in the articles , but as you rightly say it was local residents and users who submitted the application acting on their own initiative . <p> The council has fulfilled its obligations under the terms of the Localism Act 2011 , which requires local authorities to maintain a list of assets of community value which have been nominated by the local community and they deserve credit for that . <p> The building can still be sold but the community value status gives groups the time to develop a business plan and raise the money to bid to buy the asset if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Act 's intention is to help local communities keep much-loved sites in public use and part of local life . <h> In graveyard of

 45pc of trees ? <h> Rustlings Road <p> There may well be one or two trees on Rustlings Road that hat need removing because they are dangerous or will cost too much to repair , however , on the evidence seen in other parts of the city , the people of Sheffield have no confidence in the council 's present approach or process . <p> Elsewhere , eg Meersbrook Park Road , 45 per cent of the 45 trees on the road have been listed for removal due to " damage " . <p> If you inspect these trees , you can clearly see that in the vast majority of cases the damage is to curbstones , which is only usually minor . <p> Such an inspection seriously questions the council 's removal logic . <p> If this is also the case elsewhere ( I do n't have the other figures only those for our road ) , then 40 per cent of Sheffield trees are being removed simply for minor damage because the ca n't be bothered to save them . <p> The replacement of a mature tree with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to vandalism resulting in their demise to say nothing of air quality , damage to local houses due to less water take-up and ground heave . <p> Removal of mature trees can cause your house to be damaged , look it up ! <p> It is unimaginable that the Council 's approaches are being applied widely across the city . In particular Sheffield residents can no longer believe the Council especially following Wednesday 's actions . <p> Will this become a question for Labour 's popularity in Sheffield ? Certainly the Liberal Democrats have been making publicity over it and getting much support . <p> If the council want to continue to remove trees in Nether Edge , Meersbrook and Heeley without the support of the public , they will have to repeatedly use night- time commando actions . <p> To what cost , traffic disruption and very importantly Labour support ? <p> Please note the public will support the removal of diseased or seriously damaging trees but the council have to get the public back on side and gain our confidence before we can trust them again . <p> A Tesco store 
 Keane has n't seen the best of me , says Conor Hourihane <h> Conor Hourihane is yet to break into the ful Republic of Ireland squad <p> Barnsley captain Conor Hourihane believes Roy Keane 's perception of him is holding him back for the Republic of Ireland . <p> The 25-year-old was under the watchful eye of the Manchester United legend on two occasions as a youngster . <p> Hourihane was coming through the ranks at Sunderland whilst his fellow Irishman was first-team manager and he was brought in at Ipswich Town when Keane was at the helm there , too . <p> The central midfielder never made a big enough impression on the 45-year-old to get into the first team back then . <p> Hourihane has made two provisional international squads , but has missed out on the respective matchday squads on both occasions . <p> " He remembers me as a 16 to 19-year-old boy when I was n't ready to play football , " admitted Hourihane , who has netted three times for the Reds this season . <p> " Hecky has said this to me and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in one game over the last however many years and you ca n't perform at your peak in every single game . <p> " It 's just one of those things and I 'm sure he 'll come to one of the games where I play to my potential and play well . <p> " If you ask Hecky which two games we have n't performed well in this season he 'd probably say Reading and Brighton and they 're the two Keane and Martin O'Neill were at . From that point of view I 'm probably unlucky .

 its own authoritarian state <p> Regarding the Star Letter sent in by David Allen on Wednesday , November 23 . <p> When was peacefully standing by a tree ' illegal ' ? <p> I was woken up by the horrendous noise that morning , and in due respect Mr Allen , the ' hysteria ' surrounding the trees on Rustlings Road , was far from that ! <p> I stood and watched in disbelief and utter anger with a tear in my eye , at the environmental vandalism that this sham of a council inflicted upon those healthy , over a century old trees ! So what if they are replacing them ! With what ? Saplings ! <p> Those trees had a rich and diverse ecosystem and was a home to birds , and a feeding area for bats . <p> I do agree that the police have to do their job , and to be honest , that 's what we pay our taxes for , but the council had no regard to its residents , and hopefully the people of Sheffield will remember that day , when election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan Lodge , should resign . <p> Elected councillors are there to help , support and listen to the people they represent , not completely disregard facts , people 's opinions and carry out bully-boy tactics . <p> Cities worldwide are coming together to try and manage the threat of global warming , and what does Sheffield do ?

 endangered dogs born in Doncaster <h> Painted Dog and pups <p> A litter of rare wild hunting dogs have been born at Yorkshire Wildlife Park , giving hope that the endangered canine species might yet be saved from extinction . <p> The African Painted Dog puppies made their entrance four weeks ago but have been tucked up safely underground with their mother , Thabo . <p> Thabo followed her natural instincts to dig a woodland den so that she could hide her pups . Park staff had to wait until last weekend for some of the new-borns to emerge . <p> The births are particularly significant after a sharp decline in painted dog numbers in the wild . In the past decade , wild populations have dropped from 500,000 to 5,000 . <p> " Painted dogs are heading for extinction so these births are crucial to their future , " said YWP Animal Collection Manager Simon Marsh .

 the Central Library <h> Central Library and Graves Art Gallery . Picture : Andrew Roe <p> I ca n't believe , and nor can anyone I 've spoken to since I read the news that the council is considering selling off the Central Library to make way for a posh hotel . <p> This city has few enough historic and handsome civic buildings as it is , without this one being got rid of . The defence and retention of public spaces for use by the public was never more important than now , with predatory speculators and developers on the lookout for properties that will further enhance their bank balances but diminish the public 's right of access . <p> The fact that the building concerned is the city 's Central Library makes the proposed sale even more perverse . <p> I 've been living in Sheffield for more than 50 years and I 've made extensive use of the library 's facilities , as have countless thousands of others , whether it is for reading the papers , using the computers , investigating local history , borrowing books that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasures and discipline of reading and writing , or heading up to the top floor for the artistic exhibitions or just a cup of tea . <p> Coming as it does in the wake of the drastic cuts in library provision over recent years , it amounts to cultural vandalism and reflects badly on the council 's awareness of the importance of institutions such as libraries for popular education and a sense of our civic responsibilities and possibilities . <p> How the council can square the proposed sale with its purported belief in the value of education for all , but especially for the less well-off , is beyond me . The council should reconsider the decision and find some other way of raising what I assume is much-needed cash . <h> On nuclear weapons

 for home of Sheffield 's wartime elephant <h> Castle House , Blonk Street , Sheffield <h> Alex Moore <p> A new chapter could soon be written in the story of a building that used to house Sheffield 's famous elephant Lizzie and may have been the birthplace of mushy peas . <p> The distinctive Castle House building , in Blonk Street , is hard to miss , with its red , yellow and orange tiled frontage based on Flemish design . <h> Lizzie , Sheffield 's wartime elephant . <p> It adjoins the Royal Exchange Buildings and is a striking fixture on the banks of the River Don , on the edge of the Castlegate area which is a key point of Sheffield Council 's regeneration strategy . <p> Castle House itself has been empty for some time and in need of refurbishment . <p> But this week , Sheffield firm Coda Studios revealed its appointment as the architects for the refurbishment of the building . <p> An as-yet unnamed developer is planning a residential and commercial conversion of the Grade II listed building , and a planning application is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coda managing director David Cross said he was ' extremely excited ' to have been appointed to work on an ' iconic piece of Sheffield 's architectural heritage ' particularly given the history of the building . <p> Built at the end of the 19th century by animal breeder and vet John Henry Bryars , Castle House was originally used as the stable for the Midland Railway Company dray horses , which were stabled on four floors . <p> During the First World War the stables also became home to the famous Tommy Ward 's elephant , Lizzie . <p> Lizzie was hired from a circus for a couple of years during the war and became a familiar sight on city streets , hauling heavy loads of steel while horses were away at the front in France . <h> Castle House . <p> She was the inspiration for this year 's Herd of Sheffield campaign , in aid of The Children 's Hospital Charity . <p> In the 1920s the site was acquired by Batchelors , and became the company 's first canning factory .

" <p> Rob Darrington , of Commercial Property Partners , said Castlegate was on its way to becoming the next ' en-vogue ' area of Sheffield . <p> He added : " It 's already surrounded by residential schemes , which at the moment may seem a little periphery , but once this areas develops , will soon be engulfed into the expanding city centre . <p> " It has many buildings with unique character , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking distance of the city centre . <p> " I expect that the private sector could end up defining what becomes of the former market and Castlegate area , as they react to market forces . " <p> Mr Darrington pointed to Sheffield Hallam University 's move into Fitzalan Square as an example of how to reinvigorate the area , adding : " Bringing the student population closer creates demand for housing but also leisure and amenities . " <p> And he said there was an opportunity to better link the city centre with Victoria Quays . <p> " At the moment this is currently very detached and has to be one of the city 's most under-utilised areas . <p> " There are some fabulous , historic buildings around here , a mix of businesses , as well as the attractive waterfront .

 5 : Spireites crash out of cup <p> Ten-man Chesterfield suffered an FA Cup embarrassment at the Proact , shipping five goals to League Two opposition . <p> The second half sending off of Jon Nolan certainly did n't help the Spireites , but in truth Wycombe Wanderers were by far and away the better side even without the man advantage . Their front three caused problems all afternoon for Town with their movement and pace , while Chesterfield struggled to create much to talk about for the entirity of the 90 minutes . A cup run would have gone some way to plugging gaping holes in the Spireites finances , but perhaps just as alarming as their exit from the competition were the gaps in the stands - just over 3,000 home fans entering the ground . By full-time the home stands were largely empty , a Scott Kashket hat-trick giving 483 jubilant away supporters plenty to celebrate . The visitors gained an early opportunity when a Gary Liddle foul affording Joe Jacobson a shot at goal from a 35-yard free-kick , the full-back sending it wide of Ryan Fulton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Town defence in the opening minutes , winning a number of flick ons that Chesterfield were able to react to in and around their area . The Spireites ' first chance also came thanks to their big men , Tom Anderson nodding on a Jay O'Shea free-kick , Ian Evatt unable to trouble Jamal Blackman with his header . At the other end Akinfenwa made an animated appeal for a penalty when he flicked the ball against Anderson , and seconds later his backheel put in on goal , the offside flag going up as he drove the ball wide . Fulton kept the score at 0-0 with a wonderful save to deny Luke O'Nien , palming a curling 25-yard effort round his post . There was nothing the goalkeeper could do on 21 minutes when Kashket sent in a wicked cross from the right and Paul Hayes ' header found the net via the crossbar to give the Chairboys the lead . Three minutes later Wycombe must have felt they had one foot in the third round , Chesterfield half clearing a corner , Dominic Gape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked down for Kashket to poke under Fulton . With plan A torn to shreds inside 25 minutes , Danny Wilson went to plan B , throwing Ched Evans on in place of Reece Mitchell in an early tactical switch . There was little the Welshman could do to drag his side back into it in the remainder of the first half however , Chesterfield simply not good enough in possession to carve open their guests , both Gboly Ariyibi and Gary Liddle guilty of poor final balls when in great crossing positions . It could have been done and dusted within three minutes of the restart , some lovely one-touch football leaving the hosts chasing shadows as Matthew Bloomfield played in Hayes and he failed to find the target from the edge of the box . Jacobson was getting closer with his direct free-kicks , sending a second one off target but not by much this time . Evans got his first sight of goal on the hour mark , taking a pass from Dion Donohue , cutting onto his right foot and shooting low , Blackman more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 64 minutes when Nolan went flying into a tackle on Gape and missed the ball entirely , referee Michael Salisbury having no hesitation in brandishing his red card . And the cup nightmare was complete with 20 minutes remaining when a ball was passed right through the middle of the Town defence and Kashket scampered clear to stroke past Fulton for a 3-0 lead . The League Two men were threatening to run riot and Fulton had to be at his best twice in quick succession , first saving at the back post to deny a hat-trick following a lovely Wycombe move , and then he beat Hayes ' low drive away . But when the resulting corner came in , the goalkeeper came out to collect , dropped it and Anthony Stewart had the simplest task to half volley into an empty net .

 Chris Burn , Multimedia Reporter <h> " I do apologise to Lisa Bates and her family . But that is not my son , he is not that type of person .

Then he seemed to get better but he has always struggled with depression .

" <p> She said that as a youngster , Nathan had been a promising sprinter who ran for Hallamshire Harriers and was actually sponsored by South Yorkshire Police . <p> But when he was 15 he was knocked over by a car and broke his leg , effectively putting an end to his hopes of a professional career in the sport . <p> " He was a very talented runner , they were describing him as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a few years later Nathan had been looking after his younger sister , then aged 10 , when she got out of the house and was hit by a car . <p> While his sister survived , Valerie said Nathan had been badly affected by the incident . <p> She said she learnt during the court case that Nathan had sought medical help in 2014 after a friend had died in a car crash . <p> She said she has already advised one of Nathan 's friends to seek help after hearing he was ' struggling ' . <p> " I said ' Please go and get help ' . He knows Nathan and what happened to Nathan could happen to him .

 Is the mantra of ' Concentrating on the League ' a myth or fair comment ? <p> It is the first refrain of any football club manager or supporter when dreams of Wembley vanish and all that is left is the harsh reality of the English divisional system , when fairytale FA Cup moments give way to long Tuesday-night slogs to Bristol and Southend . <p> You know the one . If you 're a Sheffield United fan , chances are you 've heard it at least once since Sunday 's FA Cup exit at Bolton ; you might have even uttered it yourself . <h> Stefan Scougall celebrates after scoring in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley against Hull <p> ' At least we can concentrate on the league now ' . <p> It 's one of those bizarre and vague football utterances that mean nothing at all , really , as if an FA Cup run is football 's equivalent of the old con where you watch a card trick and the league schedule steals your watch . <p> But how does it bear out in reality ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we can at least examine the facts and come to some kind of conclusion . So , here is United 's cup and league record since they dropped into League One and , to give it some kind of context , I 've devised a scientific* method to establish whether good runs in the cup actually help or hinder United . <p> By way of a disclaimer , it 's hardly the most scientific method you 'll ever lay eyes upon but football is n't an exact science , either . So let 's divide United 's points tally for the season , by the combined number of rounds they lasted in both cups ( FA and League only , as we 've all had enough Johnstone 's Trophy nonsense for this year ) . <p> In theory , we 're talking the lower the number , the better the season , although one year is the exception ( and it was a pretty mad-cap year ) . <p> 2016/17 - Out in the second round of the FA Cup , dumped out at the first hurdle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full effects this season - given we 're almost halfway through it - but United are third in League One , sit two points off automatic promotion and have just seen a remarkable 15-match unbeaten league one ended . <p> 2015/16 - Look away now , United fans . A battling FA Cup third round defeat at Manchester United was a rare highlight in an otherwise-forgettable season , which saw Nigel Adkins ' side finish 11th . They went out of the League Cup in the second round , too , which seemed to neither help or hinder them . Cup Score : 13.25 <p> 2014/15 - United made the League One play offs , for the third time since dropping into this division . They eventually lost in the semi-finals , after a remarkable 7-6 aggregate defeat to Swindon , and may have run out of steam after their run to the last four of the Capital One Cup , as it was known back then . They eventually lost , again on aggregate , to Spurs after a thrilling second-leg at Bramall Lane . Cup Score : 6.45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . United started the season abysmally , winning one of their first 14 games , but lost just two of their next 14 as Nigel Clough replaced David Weir in charge and transformed United 's season . Under Weir , they were dumped out at the first-round stage of the League Cup by Burton - with current Blade Chris Hussey hitting both goals - but Clough led them to the semi-finals of the FA Cup at Wembley , where they were 45 minutes away from reaching the final , Europe and immortality . They eventually lost 5-3 but tasted defeat just three more times in their final 22 games , and finished just a place outside the play-off places . Cup Score : 8.37 <p> 2012/13 - United reached the fourth round of the FA Cup but again suffered an early exit in the League Cup , eventually finishing fifth in the league . More play-off heartbreak was to follow when they lost to Yeovil in the semi-finals . Cup Score : 15 <p> 2011/12 - The year United came closest to promotion from this league , in their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth round of the FA Cup - a fair achievement , given they entered at the first again - and the second of the League Cup , but smashed their way to 90 points - only for Ched Evans to be jailed , Wednesday to pip them to automatic promotion and the goalkeeper to miss a crucial penalty in a 8-7 shoot-out defeat in the play-off final at Wembley . Cup Score : 15 <p> So , there we have it . Our wholly unscientific method shows that getting past the third round of the FA Cup has helped United over the last five seasons - the only time they failed in a completed season , they finished 11th - but their best points tally in this league came on the back of a wholly unremarkable cup run . <p> Some fans will say , rightly , that winning is a habit , while others fear the fixture congestion that comes as a natural by-product of success . <p> So , can United put their cup exits behind them ? <p> Defeat at Bolton means United wo n't feature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s but if they do finally end their exile in League One , then their fans will surely not care a jot . <p> An investigation on

A large number will be from the Far East in general and China in particular . <p> Will most of these people return to their own countries after graduation , or stay on to work in this country and fill the available graduate vacancies ? <p> After all , if most of the companies setting up are Chinese in nature to cater predominantly for Chinese , then it stands to reason that they will seek to engage Chinese employees who speak both native and English tongues fluently and have an appropriate cultural affinity . <p> Similarly , the national telecoms network is now effectively run by a Chinese concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built utilising Chinese investment . <p> Where it will all end ? <p> When Sheffield has become just one more totally dependent China Town in a UK-based , Hong Kong-style enclave of China ? <h> Ivanka will face 
 the break and Andy Williams scored on his return to the side to take the second round tie to spot kicks . <p> Rovers had ridden their luck somewhat - as Blackpool twice had goals chalked off for offside - and were indebted to an excellent display from goalkeeper Marko Marosi . <p> But it was the Slovakian 's opposite number Dean Lyness who proved to be the hero in the shoot-out , saving penalties from Jordan Houghton and crucially Will Longbottom to earn the visitors a place in the last 16 . <p> Ferguson threw something of a curve-ball with his team selection by making no fewer than nine changes to the side that won at Stevenage on Saturday , with only Marko Marosi and Niall Mason retaining their places . <h> Blackpool 's Dean Lyness makes the save that wins the penalty shoot out <p> Blackpool had much the better of the early exchanges and Rovers had to rely on to keep them on level terms . <p> Following a corner he blocked a close range shot from Will Aimson . When the ball was crossed in again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , to keep out a downward header from the rangy Gnanduillet , who had earlier curled just wide from distance . <p> After 24 minutes the visitors took a deserved lead and , from a Rovers perspective , it was far too simple . <p> The Tangerines strung several passes together before Mark Cullen beat Evina in the air too easily to nod a long diaganol ball into the path of Gnanduillet who fired home . <p> Ferguson watched the first half from the stands but , whatever the angle , it made uncomfortable viewing as Blackpool continued to control possession and carve out openings . <p> Gnanduillet headed another decent chance over before Mark Yeates exchanged passes with Cullen and should have done better than shoot straight at Marosi , who made another good save at the feet of Bright Osayi-Samuel on the stroke of half time . <p> Barring one or two early sniffs for Williams , a low shot from and a speculative effort from Calder , Rovers fans had little to cheer during a distinctly ordinary first half performance . It had to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both well off the pace , were hauled off at the break with Mathieu Baudry and Jordan Houghton joining Joe Wright in the back three . <p> Within three minutes of the re-start Cullen did find a way past Marosi only to see his header chalked off for offside , as Pool threatened to continue where they left off . <p> But , rather out of the blue , Rovers grabbed an equaliser on 52 minutes when Mason , now playing down the right , whipped in a delightful cross for Williams to expertly head home . <p> Gnanduillet went close with a header from a corner but the equaliser changed the pattern of the game as Doncaster finally started to enjoy more possession and play with more purpose , although they remained far from their fluent best . <p> Rovers survived another scare mid-way through the half when Cullen again saw a goal ruled out for offside , this time after Marosi had saved Osayi-Samuel 's initial effort . <p> Midfielder Paul Keegan curled a free kick just wide late on and Rovers finished the game on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Middleton , , Keegan , Liam Mandeville , Calder , Mason and Baudry all held their nerve from the spot . <p> Marosi took it to sudden death with a good save from Yeates but when Longbottom 's kick was kept out by Lyness the road to Wembley ended for Rovers , with Blackpool winning 8-7 from the spot . <p> Maldon District Council 
 <h> Robert Cumber <p> JG Graves , the philanthropist who paid for Sheffield Central Library to be built , would have approved of plans to convert the building into a five-star hotel . <p> That was the bold claim made by Councillor Jack Scott , Sheffield Council 's cabinet member for community service and libraries , as he addressed a public meeting about the controversial proposals on Tuesday evening . <h> More than 9,800 people have signed Rebecca Gransbury 's petition to save Sheffield Central Library <p> " If JG Graves was here today I think he would say art should be for everyone and libraries should be for everyone , " said Coun Scott told the audience of around 200 people gathered at Sheffield Town Hall . <p> " I think he would say ' that library I built was brilliant but it 's not as good as it was and if you can do something with my legacy I would support that ' . " <p> Coun Scott , who claimed the hotel would generate around ? 1 million a year in business rates and add to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the support of JG Graves ' great-great-nephew . <p> Whatever JG Graves might think were he still around , it was clear the majority of those addressing the public meeting were less than impressed with the proposals . <p> " The library building is part of our heritage , and I would like to see it remain part of our heritage , " she said . <p> She called on the council to continue to search for the necessary funding to preserve the building as a library . <p> Should the central library move , she said she wanted a ' renewed commitment ' to funding Sheffield 's library service , which she said currently compared unfavourably to other cities like Liverpool , Leeds and Wakefield . <p> One member of the audience demanded to know why other developers had not been invited to submit proposals for the building , when he said the council would ' get three quotes for its stationery supply ' . <p> Another man claimed the cost of hosting the World Student Games in 1991 could have paid many times over for the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining open to the public Graves Art Gallery would effectively become ' publicly funded lobby art ' . <p> Not everyone was opposed , however . Speaking after the meeting , Gay Horsfield said she believed a new purpose-built library was the way forward and she believed a five-star hotel could be good for the city . <p> Sheffield Council announced last month that it was in talks with a Chinese firm over plans to turn the Grade II-listed building into a five-star hotel . <p> The Graves Gallery would be retained in the building and kept open to the public , under the proposals , with a full library service to be provided elsewhere in the city centre . <p> The council , which claims the existing library building would cost ? 30 million to renovate to modern standards , has given investment partner the Sichuan Guodong Construction Group a 12-month exclusivity period in which to investigate the hotel option . <p> Couns Scott and Mary Lea , cabinet member for cabinet member for culture , parks and leisure , who also addressed the meeting , made it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of a long ' conversation ' with Sheffielders . <p> Should the proposals go ahead , Coun Scott promised a new library would be built in the ' heart of the city ' and there would be a ' triple lock ' of planning laws in place to preserve the existing Grade II-listed library building for future generations . <p> He said he believed the city would ' rue the day ' should it spurn the opportunity to save the building and build a new library fit for the 21st century . <h> Grandparents of missing

Today , Jerome , 31 , answers questions about his life . <p> How are you ? <p> I have regained most physical functions but it has n't come easy . Hard work , determination and advice from my team at the Sheffield Head Injury Rehabilitation Centre has got me where I 'm at : I 'm now able to do more . <h> A cheeky Christmas picture of Jerome taking a nap ! <p> I have daily chronic pain in my head , from neck and spine from nerve damage , the metal plate bolted into my head and the operation . <p> The fatigue is frustrating and disabling and I have short term memory issues . I 'm not the same . <p> How do you reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things about myself , what needs change , what my problems are , what needs working on . I 've made mistakes along the way , I 'm only human , so as long as I learn from them it I can draw strength . I have had to learn the hard way . What does n't kill you can only make you stronger , they say . <p> I 've been through some very dark places that I still visit from time to time but I now know how to deal with this and get back on track and rise out of the darkness . <p> Who has been your rock ? <p> Mine and my partner 's family ; in particular my kids and partner Michelle have stuck by me through difficult times and we give each other motivation , purpose , and strength to get though a life that throws many curved balls at us . <p> If you could have done anything different in the recovery period , what would it have been ? <p> It would of been of real importance if I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately I had 11 months with quarter of my skull off my head and was n't able to access help and support from the specialist therapists due to awaiting my second head operation . <p> It was n't ideal but I 'm happy to be coming through it . I know that this will be never ending but it 's my reality . I 'm not bitter about it , I get down from time to time but I have to get on with it . <p> Did some people 's sympathy disappear over time ? <p> Many people showed genuine concern for me . A lot drifted away as they knew I survived , they must think all is well now . A few have stuck by me to help me along the way . For that I 'm truly grateful . <p> I do n't do sympathy , as I do n't want anyone to feel sorry for me . But showing a bit of empathy is all , if anything , I ask from anyone , as this would allow them to understand where I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at the time and then later on down the line forget it . <p> Because I do n't want anyone to feel uncomfortable I tend to stay indoors a lot , not only because of this but I suffer from problems related to my brain injury that make getting out a lot more challenging and tiring on me . I do n't expect , everyone has their own life and problems . <p> I have to work on the things I need to to then be able to do more in the future . I 'm happy with this fact now , but I did once find it frustrating . <p> Describe your feelings , towards ? <p> I have no feelings towards him , he was a past opponent , we had a decent fight on two occasions , the last one causing to have a bleed on the brain , but that 's all .

I feel more could be done by them , to be honest . <p> When you see boxers getting injured - how do you cope with that ? <p> When I see any fighter sustaining an injury it really hurts , knowing what I myself encountering life threatening and life changing injuries through boxing it hits closer to home . Boxing is dangerous , full stop . Things can go wrong . But in life accidents/injuries happen all the time . <p> When I look around at what 's happening in the world it frightens me . <p> Boxing steers many people away from antisocial behaviour .

 1 , Sheffield United 3 - Blades extend lead at top of League One with fifth win on bounce <h> Bury v Blades <p> Sheffield United extended their lead at the top of League One by beating Bury at Gigg Lane this afternoon . <p> United went behind , to a stunner by their former youngster Jacob Mellis , but hit back through Billy Sharp , a Kelvin Etuhu own goal and Kieron Freeman 's second goal in two games . <p> With Bolton only snatching a late point at Coventry and Scunthorpe drawing at home to Peterborough , Chris Wilder 's side are now three points clear at the top . <p> United , who confirmed before kick-off that Marc McNulty had been recalled early from his loan spell at Bradford City , named the striker on the bench at Gigg Lane . Joining him there were Paul Coutts and Mark Duffy , both rested , while Leon Clarke missed out altogether due to injury . <p> United started brightly , with Sharp shooting wide and Scougall heavily involved , but they were rocked after 12 minutes when Mellis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a superb effort from outside the box , giving Simon Moore no chance . <p> But United dragged themselves back in the game when skipper Billy Sharp levelled from close range , poking home after John Fleck 's inswinging free-kick had caused mayhem in the Bury box . <p> Lavery forced Ben Williams into a good save as United pressed for another , and Sharp saw a penalty appeal turned down when Kelvin Etuhu blocked his path in the box . <p> Scougall saw his shot well blocked after good work from Lavery , and Etuhu was booked after a late challenge on Chris Basham . Sharp then squandered a decent chance to put his side ahead after robbing Antony Kay . <p> James Vaughan smashed wide five minutes into the second half when it seemed easier to put the hosts ahead , and was later booked for lunging at Jake Wright .

Lavery was again the instigator , his stepover and cross allowing Freeman the simplest task of tapping home from yards out . <p> Vaughan hit the bar with a stinging left-footed effort after substitute Paul Coutts , who replaced Dan Lafferty , underhit a backpass but United stood firm for their fifth consecutive victory . <h> Share this article

 <h> Ben Needham <h> Claire Lewis <p> The son of a digger driver implicated in the disappearance of Sheffield toddler Ben Needham claims there is ' no evidence ' he killed the tot . <p> Detectives spent time on the Greek island of Kos last year excavating land close to where Ben went missing in July 1991 after a tip-off that digger driver Konstantinos Barkas may have accidentally killed and buried the youngster . <p> Mr Barkas was clearing land from a building plot close to a farmhouse Ben was playing outside on the day he went missing . <p> A search of the land being cleared and the spot where material was dumped by the digger driver failed to uncover any human remains , but South Yorkshire detectives told Ben 's family that they believe he was killed in an accident . <p> In a television interview aired in Greece , Mr Barkas 's son , Barkas , denied his father was involved in Ben 's disappearance . <p> " We wonder who made this story up .

In fact , visiting all 454 has become has become something of an ambition for trig pillar enthusiasts in Yorkshire - even coining the phrase ' trig bagging .

 <h> Four life-saving defibrillators placed at the heart of South Yorkshire communities <h> A defibrillator <h> Stephanie Bateman <p> Four lifesaving pieces of equipment have now been placed in the heart of the community in Yorkshire thanks to Central England Co-operative . <p> The Society has installed four defibrillators across the area as part of a scheme that will see hundreds of the lifesaving devices put in place at outlets across the Society 's trading area . <p> The devices have been installed in the following locations : <p> * Barnsley Food and Petrol Filling Station , Carlton Road <p> * Birchencliffe Food and Petrol Filling Station , Halifax Road <p> * Shepley Food Store , in Station Road <p> * Sheffield Food and Petrol Filling Station , Birley Moor Road <p> It is estimated that around 100,000 people die from Sudden Cardiac Arrest in the UK each year and , while CPR saves the lives of around nine per cent , if CPR is used alongside a defibrillator the chance of survival increases to 50 % . <p> Michelle Houghton , Store Manager at Sheffield Food Store , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral part of ensuring this lifesaving device has been installed at our store . <p> " If the defibrillator is ever needed , anyone can call 999 and the emergency operator will pass on a code that will open the locked case that the equipment is stored in . <p> " The device will then talk the person through how to use it -- it is easy to use and any member of the community would be able to do so if needed . " <p> As a community retailer , Central England Co-operative already has defibrillators sited at a number of its outlets , but announced further funding for the phased installation of hundreds of defibrillators over the next year , which will be installed by long-term partner Oak Electrical . <p> The business is working with ambulance services to identify the most suitable sites for equipment and , where possible , these will be in external locations allowing community use in an emergency at any time of day or night . <p> Martyn Cheatle , Central England Co-operative Chief Executive , said : " Sudden Cardiac Arrest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the concerns of customers , members and partners , we want to help tackle the issue by getting more life-saving equipment into communities where it can save lives . <p> " As a responsible business we place a huge focus on making a positive contribution to the communities in which we trade ; we are delighted to be able to build on our existing work with this new project which we are funding from the carrier bag levy . " <p> Every installation will include familiarisation sessions available to staff at Society outlets , nearby business , local residents and community groups . Please speak to colleagues in-store to find out more details about the events . <p> Aaron Clements , from equipment supply firm Kays Medical , said : " We are not only excited to be a part of this project alongside Central England Co-operative , but we 're also extremely proud to be a part of such a community focused roll out . <p> " It is a pleasure to enter this partnership with Central England Co-operative and continue our long relationship in which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to offer this lifesaving provision to the community across Yorkshire .

 <p> " David Price is a nice fellow but probably does n't know much about us and recited what he has heard somewhere else . He 'd probably never even heard of Atif before . <p> " And he has been KO 'd a few times himself ... even though he has his hands up . " <h> Atif Shafiq v Cesar Abdon 14/11/14 <p> Ingle pointed out Shafiq 's defeat followed an extended period out of the ring , due to injury . <p> " He 'd been out 13 months ; I probably should have slapped him in the face to make him realise he was back in the ring . You can do sparring and training but if you have been out for a while you can forget the basics . <p> " In football they say that you are at your most likely to concede when you 've just scored while in boxing the golden rule is to be completely focused and pay <p> attention in the first minute . I 'd said to him this guy is going to come out swinging bombs but Atif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basics of keeping his mind on the first few seconds of a fight . He did n't see it coming and got caught . <p> " Then he probably got up too quick , he should have taken a knee . He is young and disappointed . But as he gets older he will learn to avoid mistakes like that " said <p> Ingle . <p> <p> David Price , who is handled by Rotherham trainer/manager Dave Coldwell , is said to have put IBF champion Anthony Joshua on his back in sparring . <p> Coldwell has worked on bringing more aggression out of the 6ft 8ins heavyweight saying : " I 've always said he 's too nice , too amiable , too soft . He 's like the Big <p> Friendly Giant . I 've told him he needs to get that dog in him , get that devil in him . " 
 <p> Wednesday competed well at league leaders Brighton last week and arguably looked the side most likely to win the game mid-way through the second half before falling away following Fernando Forestieri 's missed penalty . <p> Lees believes the manner in which Wednesday pushed Chris Hughton 's side shows the gap in quality is not large . <p> But he says the Owls must begin to replicate Brighton 's ruthless streak . <p> He said : " In terms of quality and playing football , the gap is not that big . <p> " But I 've watched Brighton numerous times this season . They played Birmingham a couple of weeks ago and scored a 94th minute winner . 
 <h> Sheffield boxing : broken jaw of rival does n't faze Adam Etches <h> Bob Westerdale <p> The last time John Ryder fought a Sheffield boxer , he dished out a double fracture of the jaw . <p> The unfortunate recipient was rock-hard middleweight Jez Wilson , at York Hall , Bethnal Green , in 2014 . <p> Tomorrow in the same city , Ryder takes on Sheffield 's Adam Etches for the vacant IBF International super middleweight title . <p> Etches knows the dangers he faces - but is not fazed by them . " A broken jaw that can happen to anybody in this game " said the ' Birley Bomber . ' <p> " A boxer is sometimes just unlucky and the jaw breaks . But , yes , you have got to have power to be able to do that . <p> " His power does n't worry me , though , he will be worrying more about mine on the night . " <p> Etches will enter unfamiliar territory when he takes on Ryder - it will be the first time he has faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control where he is going and keep away from his best punching hand , on his left . The technique of moving out of a southpaw 's range has been pretty easy to master in training . " <p> The Sheffielder has admired some of Ryder 's earlier fights , but thinks he may be inconsistent at times . <p> " I have not watched loads of his fights but I have kept an eye on him , I think he is one of the most inconsistent fighters there is . <p> " Against Eamonn O'Kane nobody gave him a chance but he beat him comfortably . <p> " Against Billy Joe Saunders he was unlucky not to win after a very good performance . He was unlucky not to beat Jack Arnfield . He was expected to win that and was robbed . He was n't spectacular and did n't batter him but he beat him fairly comfortably , despite the result . <p> " But he lost to Nick Blackwell and sometimes seems to switch off . He either runs out of gas or stops trying . 
 <h> Bird lovers uncover secrets of the beak <p> Citizen scientists and bird lovers across the world have helped researchers in Sheffield to uncover new secrets about the evolution of birds ' beaks over time , in a ground-breaking new study . <p> Researchers at the University of Sheffield asked the public to help measure beak shapes from more than 2,000 bird species , which have been 3D scanned from specimens at the Natural History Museum and the Manchester Museum . <p> Using the crowdsourced data , the team were able show that the diversity of bird beaks expanded early in their evolutionary history . The most unusual beak shapes often involved periods of exceptionally fast evolutionary change . <p> However , once extremes are reached , the changes to bird beaks over time became much smaller as birds filled narrower evolutionary niches . <p> Project lead Gavin Thomas , of the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences , said : " The shape of a bird 's beak is an important indicator of the food it eats and the way it forages - its ecological niche . This project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over millions of years - with major bursts of evolution as new groups emerge , followed by more fine scale changes . " 
 <p> " The council are so responsible . I even think at times the council are more responsible than he was . They allowed it to happen . Everyone knew . Everyone in the council knew but they chose to do nothing about it , " he said . <p> A third victim described how he was told by council colleagues to keep quiet after revealing the ' terrifying ' assaults Dodds subjected him to over a period of 18 months . <p> And a fourth man said he believed there were many more victims yet to come forward saying ' we are just the tip of the iceberg ' . <p> Dodds , of Cotswold Road , was jailed for 16 years on Friday after admitting four counts of indecent assault on a man aged 16 or over and one count of indecent assault on a boy aged under 14 years . <p> Sheffield Council said following his sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court that it ' accepted responsibility ' and was ' deeply sorry ' Dodds had committed the offences while in its employment . 
 <p> Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder believes his side ' answered a lot of questions ' in their 4-0 victory over AFC Wimbledon at Bramall Lane today . <p> Wilder 's men ended a three-match winless run in some style , and they went back top of League One as Scunthorpe lost 3-1 to Southend . <p> Defeats to Walsall and Fleetwood , either side of a home draw against Gillingham , led some observers to question if United 's title push was about to falter and Wilder said : " We 're where we want to be , but there 's a lot of football to be played . 
 <h> WATCH : Sheffield United 's demolition of AFC Wimbledon <h> Caolan Lavery makes it 4-0 to Sheffield United against AFC Wimbledon <p> Call it a blip , call it a wobble , call it what you like but Sheffield United brought an end to their short winless run with a comprehensive battering of AFC Wimbledon at Bramall Lane . <p> Three games without picking up all three points had seen an , albeit tiny , cloud hover over the Lane in recent weeks but that was banished completely by an impressive showing against the Dons who had no answer to United 's blistering attack . <p> As soon as Billy Sharp opened the scoring within a couple of minutes , there was only going to be one winner and when James Hanson fired in on his debut it looked like being a case of ' how many ? ' . <p> As it was , Wimbledon tightened up a little and it took until the final 10 minutes for lead to be stretched with the impressive John Fleck and substitute Caolan Lavery adding one apiece before the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the performance .

 <h> The issue of women in science starts at home <h> Women in science <p> I would like to draw your readers ' attention to an important date : February 11 , the International Day of Women and Girls in Science . <p> That we should need such a day , even now , in 2017 , is staggering . It was introduced by the United Nations to encourage young women to enter careers in science and technological disciplines ; as the imbalance between the sexes in these fields remained stark . <p> To my mind this imbalance robs us of the full contribution that women in science can make to the world . While the past 15 years have seen increased efforts to inspire and engage women and girls in science , it 's the case that in some parts of the world , the percentage of female students achieving a degree in science-related fields continues to be much lower compared with that of male students . <p> We can no longer allow this inequality to go unchallenged . Young women and girls need to be encouraged to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be more proactive in fostering this interest . <p> Women around Britain from paleontologist Mary Anning and Britain 's first female physician and surgeon Elizabeth Garrett Anderson , to chemist Rosalind Franklin and biologist Anne McLaren have made great contributions to the body of scientific knowledge . We all have a responsibility to make sure young women and girls across Yorkshire , Britain and beyond have the opportunity to follow in their footsteps . <p> Recognising a problem is always the first step toward addressing it , and the UN resolution founding the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is an excellent development . <p> But it 's an issue that starts at home . And here 's something for us all to ponder as parents , carers , teachers and employers : what role can we play ? 
 <h> Lord Lieutenant takes a tour of Fir Vale Academy <p> Staff and students from Fir Vale Academy were delighted to receive a visit from the 's representative Lord Lieutenant Andrew Coome , who took a tour of the school on its ' Enrichment Day . ' <p> The Lord Lieutenant had shown previous interest in the challenging circumstances of the area , recently walking the streets of Page Hall and Burngreave to talk to the local community and see first-hand what problems they faced . <p> A spokesman for the school said : " The Lord Lieutenant was pleased to be touring the school on an ' Enrichment Day ' which was dedicated to learning and applying new employability skills , and he visited several ' STEM ' activities , engaging with the students and the staff . <p> " He also observed students building ' dioramas ' in English , met and encouraged the Y11 students in their revision work in the outstanding Science Department in the school , and met with a Y9 group preparing a presentation on ' Skills for Apprenticeships ' which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The Lord Lieutenant was very heartened by what he saw , commenting particularly on the calm , and inclusive nature of the school with students of dozens of nationalities working amicably together on projects .

 <h> Inside the ' disgrace ' of Yorkshire 's asylum seeker postcode lottery <p> Increasing numbers of asylum seekers are being moved to Yorkshire - and now MPs want more affluent areas to take their ' fair share ' . Chris Burn reports . <p> " I just feel so blank at the moment , I ca n't even dream of anything really . The way things are at the moment , if I could just find a nice clean place where I could sit with my children , that is my big dream . " <h> Date : 3rd February 2017 . Picture James Hardisty . An asylum seeker family living in Bradford , West Yorkshire , are complaining about the condition of their house in which they are staying , the home is owned but run by G4S . <p> Asylum seeker Layla who says the bleak conditions her family have been housed in Yorkshire are far from how she imagined life in England . Her recently-arrived family who say they have fled political persecution in Egypt told The Yorkshire Post how they had been moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had walls and an infestation of insects . They say they were told if they did n't accept it they would not get an alternative and their children would be put into care . <p> A new report says the conditions that greeted the family are far from the worst recorded by asylum seekers in Yorkshire . Among the other examples are 23 people , including 11 children and babies , packed into a filthy property without working heating in Leeds , a group living in ' the worst house in Sheffield ' and even allegations of housing staff stealing money and trying to arrange marriages in Bradford . <p> Speaking through an interpreter , mother Layla ( not her real name ) , says : " We just tried not to stay at home . It was cold outside but far better than being in the house . " <p> MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee have labelled the state of some asylum accommodation a ' disgrace ' and said it was shameful that vulnerable people had been placed in living conditions that included rat infestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in temporary accommodation in Yorkshire , local councils are now calling on other areas of the UK to take their ' fair share ' . But even in Yorkshire , there are huge variations in the numbers different town and cities are taking in . <p> Sheffield has the highest with 822 , followed by Bradford with 772 and Leeds with 647 . Rotherham , Barnsley and Kirklees all have over 400 asylum seekers each . <p> In contrast , York , Harrogate , Ryedale and Scarborough are among the places named as currently having absolutely no asylum seekers in listed as living in ' dispersal accommodation ' as they await the outcome of their applications to stay in Britain . But officials says they are often valid reasons why they are not housing such people - including the fact they have never been asked to . <p> The select committee report warns the current situation is putting huge pressure on schools and health services in deprived areas - and is calling on the Government to consider forcing councils currently refusing to take in any asylum seekers to house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK are entitled to ? 36.95 per week and housing . <p> Since 2012 , accommodation has been provided to asylum seekers via regional contracts , with G4S responsible for Yorkshire and the Humber , as well as the north-east , the Midlands and the east of England . <p> The Government said at the time it hoped the new contracts run by private providers would save ? 140m over seven years . But while it is unclear whether the hoped-for savings will actually be delivered , G4S say they expect to lose ? 47m over the course of the contract as the money they are paid for housing asylum seekers does not match the rental costs they are paying landlords . <p> When the contracts were drawn up , the Home Office estimated the system would need to accommodate a maximum of 25,000 people at any one time . But providers are actually now housing 38,000 people across the country . And while the migration crisis across Europe has resulted in substantial increases in applications since the second half of 2015 , the number of Home Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local authorities are currently willing to accept asylum accommodation and at the end of September just 121 local authorities out of a total of 453 provided it within their boundaries . <p> Dave Brown , head of Migration Yorkshire which represents ten local councils including Leeds , Sheffield and Bradford , says : " Under the current system local authorities have no control over where people are placed . <p> " We are committed as a region to take our fair share , but we currently have a higher than average number of asylum seekers , and the priority should be to rebalance this with other regions taking more . There is a momentum now to put local authorities back in control and to work together as a region for a fair and equitable system for everyone . " <p> Labour MP Yvette Cooper , the select committee 's chairwoman , says it is " completely unfair so many local authorities in more affluent areas are still doing nothing at all " . <p> But councils in Yorkshire that have no dispersal accommodation insist the situation is not their fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kim Robertshaw , housing manager at Ryedale Council , says : " In Ryedale , we have never been asked to take asylum seekers . We have never turned anything down , it is up to G4S . If they could find accommodation in Ryedale , there would be nothing to stop them . " <p> Robertshaw adds : " We are in a rural area . It is alright saying yes we can provide accommodation but people have got to be able to access services . In some of our areas , you ca n't get public transport . " <p> In evidence to the inquiry , politicians were told of a filthy six-bedroom villa in Leeds where 12 women , eight babies and three toddlers were sharing a property with " dangerously unhygienic " cookers and unreliable heating . <p> They were also informed about a disabled man living with others in a slum property in Sheffield with history of rats and disrepair , as well as an asbestos notice warning which should have prevented anyone from being housed there . The property was allegedly described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sheffield " . <p> A caseworker in Bradford highlighted an incident in which it was alleged a housing officer had proposed to a single mother of two children ' a temporary marriage in exchange for money ' . The Bradford City of Sanctuary organisation said : " The worker in question was never suspended and was only ' spoken to by senior management ' . The lesson the asylum seeker took from it was that it was better not to complain . " <p> Another woman claimed she had ? 60 stolen from her purse after a G4S worker went into her house while she was out . <p> While the problems in the system can seem insurmountable , potential hope is offered through the example of the special scheme to settle 20,000 Syrian refugees in this country . <p> The resettlement programme has seen 175 local authorities sign up to help - including 121 councils like Ryedale , Harrogate and York that do n't have dispersal accommodation . <p> Special support and extra funding is provided by the Government to help find suitable places to live , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recommended the success of this scheme should be replicated with other asylum seekers . <p> For now , though , the current system is not working for anyone - from asylum seekers , to local communities and even the companies running the contracts themselves . For those at the sharp end , it is having a draining effect . <p> One recently-arrived family in Bradford have come to the UK from Egypt to seek asylum here . They said they had fled political persecution that resulted in the father being imprisoned on a number of occasions . <p> After flying into the UK on a visa , the family , including five young children , made a claim for asylum . Mother Layla said they came to England by chance . <p> " The agency that we approached to get us out of the country said we will get you a visa to go anywhere . They managed to get one to the UK which is why we came here . " <p> After spending two months in a temporary accommodation centre in Wakefield , the family were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when they arrived they found the house was " full of rubbish and all of the walls were covered in mould " . <p> After attempting to clean it up themselves as best they could , it took several weeks of making complaints for G4S to eventually make the necessary repairs - but not before the parents and children had been repeatedly bitten by bugs . <p> Layla says she is pleased to be in a safer environment but the whole family is struggling to adapt to their new surroundings . <p> " In Egypt , we had our own apartment and a business down on the ground floor , we were ok . But we had to sacrifice all that and come here for safety . <p> " We do n't regret it , we came here for the safety of the children . " <p> Father Hasani says the family are coming to terms with their new lives in Bradford , despite their new surroundings being different to how they imagined England . <p> " The children cry a lot and say ' this ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue skies , green fields and flowers . But at least we have the house . " <p> Provider defends housing record <p> G4S have defended their record in providing housing to asylum seekers in Yorkshire in the wake of some stinging criticism . <p> John Whitwam , G4S head of immigration and borders said the report " sets out the challenge of housing double the number of asylum seekers than were forecast under this contract while three-quarters of local authorities in the regions in which we work do not allow us to place people into their areas " . <p> He said the company has not had any performance penalties since November 2013 " on the basis we rectify many tens of thousands of defects each year to meet the required standard " . The Home Office says it works closely with providers to ensure standards are met.

But her mum Gaynor Steele said the traumatic experience has left her " petrified " and afraid to leave her parents side . She now takes a panic alarm out with her when she leaves the house . <p> This was one of three reported attempted abduction incidents in Sheffield within as many days and has promoted schools and police to issue a warning to parents . <p> In a Facebook post , Gaynor said the man " pulled up at the side of her and grabbed her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " She managed to get away from him and run up to our house .

Maybe these girls should carry a rape alarm and pepper spray . All schools should give self-defence classes . " <p> Iain Wilson , headteacher at Ridgeway Primary School , said : " I was made aware , on Monday morning , of the two incidents where schoolchildren were approached by strangers in neighbouring villages , but as it is our job to help keep children safe I felt it was important for parents to be aware of what had happened . <p> " As such we sent a text message to parents informing them of the incidents and asking them to remind their children about stranger danger .

 <h> Co-operation ' essential for growth in 2017 ' according to State of Sheffield report <h> Sheffield needs to work together to grow in 2017 . <h> Alex Moore <p> Sheffield must co-operate both inwardly and with regional partners in order to grow in 2017 , according to this year 's State of Sheffield report . <p> The annual analysis of the city 's strengths and weaknesses , released today , calls on Sheffield to embrace its ' uniqueness ' in order to attract global business and boost its economy . <h> Manufacturing is a key city industry . <p> It highlights the need to tackle continuing inequality , improve education , and support both younger and older people . <p> While celebrating the success of The Outdoor City brand , the report sets a target of getting more people cycling and walking in Sheffield , and makes improving air quality a priority . <p> And it outlines a desire to get more people engaged in the city 's politics and democracy . <p> The report is drawn up by the Sheffield City Partnership Board , made up of leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith and academic sectors . <h> Lord David Blunkett . <p> Chairman Lord David Blunkett said Sheffield was the only UK city to conduct such an ' authentic and objective analysis of itself ' . <p> He added : " There is a lot to celebrate here , as well as clear areas to work on . <p> " But the great thing about this city is that it is endeavouring to avoid the danger of burying its head in the sand . <p> " Where there are issues , the Sheffield way is to tackle these head on . <h> More should be done to engage people in politics . <p> " This report will inform policy makers and agencies throughout the city , as well as helping people that live , work , study and play in Sheffield to understand their city better . <p> " The lesson both past and present is that despite the enormity of the problems we face , it is possible to make real improvement if we work together . <p> " Not just joined up thinking but practical action to achieve change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are summarised below : <h> Sheffield has 18 foodbanks . <p> Vibrant Economy <p> Sheffield 's economy is once again described as ' resilient ' , as it was in 2016 . <p> The report highlights growth in the advanced manufacturing sector , which has been a city priority for some time . <p> There is also growth in the creative and digital industries , which have ' significant potential ' to bring good jobs to the city . <p> Sheffield is starting to embrace its unique selling points , such as the ' City of Makers ' tag . And the city is exploring international links , evidenced by the council 's 60-year partnership with Sichuan Guodong Construction Group . <p> The report suggests ' uniqueness counts ' in a global economy , and Sheffield will benefit from shouting about the things that set it apart . The Outdoor City brand is an example of this . <h> The Outdoor City is a successful brand .

But the move towards devolution in South Yorkshire creates potential for ' greater engagement and involvement of residents ' in shaping the future locally . <p> City institutions must be open and eager to listen , with new generations of leaders drawn from all communities . <p> " Reinvigorating democracy and engagement is possible and this will be fundamental to achieving the vision for creating a prosperous and inclusive Sheffield of the future , " the report says . 
 <h> Lack of sex education in some schools ' a ticking health time bomb ' <h> Calls have been made to make sex and relationships education compulsory in schools <h> Sam Jackson , Multimedia Reporter <p> A lack of sex and relationships education in some secondary schools is leading to a ' ticking sexual health time bomb ' , town hall chiefs have warned . <p> The subject should be compulsory in all state secondary schools , including academies and free schools , according to the Local Government Association ( LGA ) , arguing that it is a major health protection issue . <p> Council-run secondaries have to teach sex and relationships education ( SRE ) , while academies and free schools , which are not under local authority control , do not have to follow the national curriculum and are not obliged to teach the subject . <p> Parents have the right to withdraw their children from the lessons in all state schools . <p> The LGA , which represents councils in England and Wales , said age-appropriate SRE should be an essential part of the curriculum for young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take their child out . <p> It said local authorities have responsibility for public health , budgeting around ? 600 million a year for sexual health , and without proper SRE classes , pupils are not being properly prepared for adulthood . <p> Izzi Seccombe , chairman of the LGA 's community wellbeing board said : " This is a major health protection issue . <p> " The lack of compulsory sex and relationship education in academies and free schools is storing up problems for later on in life , creating a ticking sexual health time bomb , as we are seeing in those who have recently left school . " <p> She added that there was a " shockingly high " number of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) diagnosed in teenagers and young people . <p> Official figures show there were 78,066 new STI diagnoses among 15 to 19-year-olds in England in 2015 , the LGA claimed , and 141,060 among 20 to 24-year-olds . <p> " The evidence suggests that when designed and delivered in the right way , SRE can have a really positive impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " However , we are also conscious that some parents may wish to remove their children from this , which is why we are saying there should also be provision for parents to opt their children out of lessons , if they consider this to be in the best interests of their child . " <p> A Department for Education spokesman said : " High-quality education on sex and relationships is a vital part of preparing young people for success in adult life . <p> " It is compulsory in all maintained secondary schools and , as the Education Secretary said recently , we are looking at options to ensure all children have access to high-quality teaching in these subjects . <p> " We will update the House during the passage of the Children and Social Work Bill .

 <h> More powers given back to Rotherham Council in wake of child sex abuse scandal <h> Rotherham Council . <h> Alex Moore <p> Commissioners were brought in to run the authority in the wake of the child sexual abuse scandal . <p> But powers are slowly being returned to council staff and elected members . The latest to be given back by communities secretary Sajid Javid include economic growth , town centre management and park maintenance . <p> Decision-making powers for adult social care are also set to be returned to Rotherham councillors -- but as work to modernise these services is underway , commissioners will have additional oversight with the power to veto key service decisions should they have any concerns . <p> The council got licensing powers back in December , and about a third of services were given back in February last year . <p> The latest announcement which is now subject to local views follows the submission of evidence from lead commissioner Sir Derek Myers . <p> Sir Derek said : " We have seen continued progress in more areas of the council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities and local government has agreed to further functions being returned . <p> " We will continue to work with the council on those areas not yet returned and we would expect to make further recommendations in the coming months . " <p> Council leader Chris Read added : " This is welcome news and another positive step in the right direction for the council , and for Rotherham . <p> " Today 's announcement reflects the significant improvements which we have made across the board . <p> " But in this next phase we will continue to work hard to ensure the council improves and better serves Rotherham residents . Alongside commissioners we are determined to complete this work . " <p> This proposal will now be considered by the council leadership and members . The communities secretary will then consider any representations before making a final decision on whether to return these functions to the council . <p> The Government-appointed commissioners have been given until March 2019 to improve and hand back all services . 
 <p> Speaking at the launch , Mr Anderson said : " Many people in Sheffield got blas ? about the warnings because the raids never arrived and the planes went to other parts of England . <p> " Unfortunately that all changed on the night of December 12 , 1940 . At 7pm the air raid warnings rang out , and a few minutes after that something that people had rarely heard - the sound of our own anti aircraft fire . <p> " What followed was nine solid hours of bombings over Sheffied . Wave after wave of bombs over Sheffield . <p> " I 'd no idea , until I started researching for my first book , the sheer scale of it the bombings . Hardly an area of Sheffield was n't hit - right across the city . <p> " When my book came out , I was lucky enough to interview veterans but I realised there was so little to mark the Blitz in Sheffield other than a few shrapnel marks in the City Hall .

Exhbitions like this do remind us of why we need to keep the peace . <p> " The Sheffield blitz is not well documented , you have to go looking for it , so it 's important to have people finding this out for us.

 <h> Sheffield Eagles : Aston relishing clash with unbeaten Hull KR <h> Mark Aston <h> Matt Young <p> Off the back of a heavy home defeat , most coaches would be having nightmares at the prospect of travelling to the unbeaten league leaders in the very next game . <p> But Sheffield Eagles director of rugby Mark Aston is looking at Sunday 's showdown with Hull Kingston Rovers ( 3pm ) from the other side of the spectrum . <p> After being pummelled by Batley on ' home ' soil last weekend , which now makes it back-to-back defeats for the Eagles , Aston must take his side to Craven Park knowing that relegated Rovers have taken maximum points from the opening four rounds of the Kingstone Press Championship . <p> Aston though is looking to meet the test head on , and has called on his troops to use the underdog mentality to provide what would be the shock of the season so far by giving the favourites a run for their money . <p> " I am certainly relishing this game , I think it is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star . " I 'll be pitting my wits against Tim Sheens , the ex-Australia coach , so I am looking forward to it . <p> " Hull KR were a Super League side last year , they have recruited well and they have started well . Everyone likes to be the underdogs , and everyone likes to beat what everyone expects to be the champions , and that 's what we want to do . " <p> After hitting an unexpected height by beating Toulouse in round two , Aston 's side have been brought back down to earth following two poor performances in recent weeks . <p> Their task over the next fortnight looks daunting with fellow unbeaten outfit Featherstone Rovers set to follow Sunday 's trip . <p> Aston though enjoys the underdog tag , and he also maintains a solid belief that his squad can give any side in the league a bloody nose on their day . <p> " We have got to be honest at this moment in time , where we are , no-one will give us a chance , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a dreamer and I think if you work hard then sometimes you get the bounce of the ball . We worked hard in training last week but we did n't turn that into the performance . I was honest with them over the last couple of days , we went out for a feed as a team . If we can put an honest performance in then we will come away and be reasonably happy . " 
 <h> Kevin Gage 's Blades Column : Sheffield United show no sign of slowing down as they approach promotion finish race <h> Kevin Gage Column <h> Kevin Gage <p> We 've all heard and used that quote before , and after seven months of our nine month season , we are into the last few weeks of this long , hard League One race . To use the marathon analogy again , after a very slow start and from being right at the back we quickly upped our pace , moved through the field , did the hard miles along the course and got amongst the leaders . <p> We 've been tripped up and stumbled a few times along the way , but we recovered quickly and powered on again . After Tuesday 's superb win at Oxford , we 're now firmly clear of the chasing play-off pack , and the finishing line , although not quite yet in sight , is inside the stadium up ahead and getting closer with every stride ! <p> The Blades are in the middle of a run of three away matches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this marathon course , but as it 's turned out the only thing really tricky or testing about the two games so far has been the state of the playing surfaces . After a decent draw at Rochdale we went to Oxford and actually played them off their own pitch , even though it resembled a cabbage patch in places . <p> Disregard the scoreline , and even the fact that we were one down at half-time , because it does n't tell the whole story . We totally controlled the majority of the game and I now think we really can look forward to gathering more momentum for the last remaining matches . In fact I 've believed and been saying for months that we will maintain our form and win this promotion race , so do n't rule out being clear of the pack as we start the final lap , and would n't it be nice to enter the finishing straight waving and smiling to the crowds ! <p> It 's also around this stage of a season that it becomes important not just how many games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All sides just below us still have to play each other and we can sit back on Saturday and enjoy either Fleetwood or Bolton taking points off the other . <p> What 's more , in a few weeks time Bolton and Scunthorpe will do exactly the same . For some teams in the push for a top two place , the games will also simply run out . Of course , this is assuming that Chris Wilder 's Blades wo n't completely blow up in the latter stages of this race , and far from entering the final lap full of running , actually run out of steam and be staggering and stumbling over the line ! We 've maintained such an impressive pace so far , I genuinely ca n't see that happening . Honestly , can you ? <p> It also wo n't happen because as I mentioned above , we 've done the " hard miles " already . Not only that but we 've done them against the supposedly harder teams as well . In fact of our last ten games , eight are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including all the teams in the bottom five ! The only two teams in the top half that we play are Bradford and Millwall , and although they will be a tough test , we are at home to both , and as such I fully expect us to win . <p> Sky TV have chosen to screen the Bradford game live from Bramall Lane , too . What a day that promises to be ! A local derby in front of a sell-out crowd on a Bank Holiday Monday in the third-to-last game of our season , and in our marathon promotion race we 'll be inside the stadium and on that final lap . The crowd will be on their feet roaring us on and the team will be at full speed and striding out for glory . <p> If we maintain our form and our pace , we 'll come round the final bend very soon , in the clear and ready to hit that home straight ... and we 'll ALL be smiling and waving along the way !

 <h> Police officers at the Battle of Orgreave <h> Claire Lewis <p> Once secret files have revealed that Margaret Thatcher 's government feared a ' witch hunt ' if there had been a public inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave . <p> The files , which have now been ' declassified ' and released into the National Archive , reveal that Leon Brittan , then Home Secretary , told a 1985 meeting that the ' Government should not encourage any form of enquiry into the behaviour of the police ' . <p> He believed an inquiry into picket line tactics during the 1984-85 strike would ' turn into a witch hunt ' with an ' anti-police bias ' , according to the files . <p> The documents were released after Home Secretary Amber Rudd ruled out an inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave , where thousands of miners clashed with police at a coking plant at Orgreave , on the Sheffield-Rotherham border . 
 <h> New library will be in the heart of the city <h> Central Library and Graves Art Gallery . Picture : Andrew Roe <p> I would like to respond to the concerns raised in your letters page about the future of a city centre library , and to thank the Star for their emphatic support for keeping a library in the heart of the city . As I have said before , the new library will be in the heart of the city but the precise location has not been decided . <p> Rather than destroying this precious building , we will be preserving its future . <p> The library building desperately needs ? 30 million worth of repairs , so no change is not an option . <p> An inspiring , inclusive and accessible new library would be more in tune with the needs of the city . <p> We have no desire to see the existing building removed from our streets and this will categorically not happen . The potential development would mean that the building will continue in a new life and bring about the first five-star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal was announced that people reacted strongly . I had the same reaction . However , we have worked really hard to engage with people and answer all questions . I am really pleased with how the public consultation events have gone . It is now becoming very well understood that we are looking to improve on the library service provided , safeguard the future of the Graves gallery collection and the central library building , and bring about investment in the city centre that we need . <p> It is a real shame that some have tried to use Central library for purely political point scoring , recklessly spreading fear . <p> The Green Party have disingenuously told people that the council are looking to get rid of a central library without any replacement . <p> What is particularly galling is that despite all of their talk about what they would do to keep the present library open in turn shutting out millions of pounds worth of investment when council set next year 's Budget on Friday the Greens raised no objections and made no mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they continuing to spread such untruths ? The Greens councillors and former leader Natalie Bennett have shown that not only do their sums not add up , they are all protest placard and no action . <p> I want to reassure your readers that the council are doing everything to make sure we have a library service we are all proud of in the city centre and that we safeguard our precious buildings . 
 <h> Award for mountain rescue team for saving life of man lost on South Yorkshire moor <h> Claire Lewis <p> A mountain rescue team has been honoured for saving the life of a man lost on a South Yorkshire moor . <p> Volunteers who make up the Woodhead Mountain Rescue Team , based at Holmfirth , saved a 77-year-old man who ended up lost on Langsett Moor , near Penistone , last November . <p> The team was deployed after the man dialled 999 to report himself lost in the dark . It was also snowing and the temperature was falling . <p> Superintendent Paul McCurry , who commanded the search and rescue operation , said : " Immediately , we called the Woodhead Mountain Rescue Team as we knew that without them , we 'd have immense trouble rescuing this man and ensuring his safety . <p> " Straight away , the team deployed volunteers who went in search of the man with hot drinks and a basic first aid kit . Further parties were also sent to different locations , while a party with a stretcher was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue mission the man was located , thankfully before he could come to any real harm , although his health was deteriorating rapidly and he was in a hypothermic state . <p> " Due to treacherous weather conditions , the helicopter could not land to airlift the man to hospital and so the Mountain Rescue Team carried him over one-and-a-half miles over rough and slippery terrain in the pitch-black to an awaiting 4x4 . <p> " Without the team and their efforts in this challenging rescue mission , it 's unlikely that the man would have survived the night . <p> " I 'm incredibly thankful for their continued efforts and support in call-outs and search and rescue efforts . <p> " Their help is truly invaluable to us and to the friends and family of those loved ones who go missing or get in to difficulties while out walking for example . " <p> Supt McCurry and Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Barber presented the team with a Chief Officer Commendation for their efforts . <p> Supt McCurry added : " Last year alone the team members dedicated over 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to 37 call-outs in total . <p> " Their efforts are truly amazing and have saved the lives of countless people .

 <h> Selection of controversial Sheffield bishop ' showed a lack of understanding ' <h> The Rt Rev Philip North <h> Richard Blackledge <p> The search is on for a new Bishop of Sheffield - after the cleric picked for the role turned the job down amid controversy over his opposition to women becoming priests . <p> The Rt Rev Philip North , who had been expected to be elected in April , will remain as the Bishop of Burnley , and the name of an ' alternative candidate ' will need to be put forward by Dr John Sentamu , the Archbishop of York . <p> Before declining the role , Mr North had been urged to hold face-to-face meetings with clergy and parishioners to address concerns over his stance on ordaining women as priests . <p> A group - Sheffield Action on Ministry Equality - was set up , and the Labour MP for Heeley , Louise Haigh , described the bishop designate 's views as ' troubling ' . <p> And yesterday , bishop 's clothing in Suffragette colours was placed on the Women of Steel statue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , the SAME group said the diocese was in ' a period of mourning ' . <p> " We lament the church 's lack of understanding of the depth of concern which people around the diocese have felt over this appointment . <p> " We pray for Bishop Philip that he may fully recover from an ordeal we believe he should never have had to face . <p> " This is a sad moment for the Church of England but we hope and pray that , in time , greater wisdom will emerge . " <p> It is the second post Mr North has withdrawn from . In 2012 he declined the job of Bishop of Whitby , following similar unease . <p> The 50-year-old is affiliated with a Church of England group called The Society , which does not recognise women priests . <p> In Sheffield , he would have ordained female deacons , but would not have officiated at the ordination of women as priests . <p> Instead , another bishop would have presided . <p> Dr Sentamu said Mr North was a ' gifted ' bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This is a personal decision which I understand and sadly accept . However , what has happened to Bishop Philip clearly does not reflect the settlement under which the Church of England joyfully and decisively opened up all orders of ministry to men and women . " <p> He said the church had committed itself to ' mutual flourishing ' . <p> The Rt Rev Philip North 's statement : <p> " It is with regret and sadness that I have decided that I am unable to take up the nomination as Bishop of Sheffield . <p> " The news of my nomination has elicited a strong reaction within the diocese and some areas of the wider Church . It is clear that the level of feeling is such that my arrival would be counter-productive in terms of the mission of the Church in South Yorkshire and that my leadership would not be acceptable to many . <p> " I am grateful for the love , prayers and care that have been shown me over recent weeks by numerous people , especially the Archbishop of York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diocese . In particular I would like to thank the Bishop of Doncaster and the diocesan team in Sheffield for their support . <p> " I apologise to the many for whom this decision will come as a disappointment . There is clearly much to be done on what it means to disagree well and to live with theological difference in the Church of England . The highly individualised nature of the attacks upon me have been extremely hard to bear . If , as Christians , we can not relate to each other within the bounds of love , how can we possibly presume to transform a nation in the name of Christ ? I hope though that this conversation can continue in the future without it being hung upon the shoulders of one individual . <p> " I do not doubt for one single second the Lordship of Christ or his call upon my life , but the pressures of recent weeks have left me reflecting on how He is calling me to serve him . I am grateful to the Bishop of Blackburn for allowing me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events of the past few weeks and would ask for this space to be respected . I hope that , as we continue on the Lenten journey , we will each be able to hear God 's voice speaking to us in the wilderness , drawing forth order and beauty from the messy chaos of our lives .

 <h> Sheffield United Fan 's Column : Chris and a breath of fresh air <h> Chris Basham shows he can mix it with the best of them : Jamie <h> Matthew Bell <p> Four points and six goals from two away matches is about as much as could be wished for against two capable teams . <p> If there 's anything to quibble about it 's the way United were opened up too often , especially at Rochdale , but that 's a symptom of the way Chris Wilder 's team plays . Kieron Freeman and Daniel Lafferty get forward so much that there 's always going to be plenty of space behind them . <p> The manager 's positive attitude has rubbed off on the players , who seem to have the attitude that if the other team scores two , we 'll score three . It was therefore slightly surprising at Oxford to see Chris Basham replacing Mark Duffy in midfield , but when Jake Wright was hurt Wilder saw it as an opportunity to make a positive move by bringing on Samir Carruthers and moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-half performance . <p> Bash 's recent performances both in defence and in midfield have earned him the nickname of " Franz " , so reminiscent is he of the way the great Kaiser played for Bayern Munich and West Germany in the 1970s . Bash 's sidestep and cross for Billy Sharp 's goal at Rochdale was high class stuff . In fact , Basham is much better in the air than Beckenbauer , but let 's not stretch this analogy too far ! <p> Wilder has proved he has many qualities as a manager , and two things he does stand him apart from other managers . One is that he does not do the pre- and post-match interviews when United are playing one of his former clubs . I 'm not sure if this is out of superstition or respect , but it 's an unusual method that has worked . The second is how he always gives credit to the opposition , unlike , for example , Phil Parkinson , who dreamed up a wild excuse or two to explain away his Bolton team 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rochdale and said so afterwards , heaping praise on Keith Hill 's team and the manner in which they performed . What a breath of fresh air Wilder has been .

Pic Steve Ellis <p> Carlos Carvalhal is backing his depleted Owls side to rectify their stuttering league form in the Championship club 's quest to secure a top-six finish for the second year running . <p> Wednesday have won just one of their last five matches and will drop out of the play-off positions if Fulham beat Blackburn Rovers in their game in hand tomorrow . <p> Five of the Owls ' remaining nine fixtures are at Hillsborough , starting against promotion rivals Reading this Friday night . <p> Carvalhal , who was sent to the stands in Saturday 's 2-0 defeat at Aston Villa after stepping out of his technical area for protesting Vincent Sasso 's red card , said his squad have enough knowledge of the Championship to steer them through . <p> " We are an experienced team and we know the competition , " he said . With the calendar , we have four away games and five at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams fighting for the top positions and we are one of them . We are still running in the competition to achieve a good position . <p> " We must finish the season very well and that is the most important thing .

Loovens , along with Fernando Forestieri , Tom Lees , Sam Hutchinson , Almen Abdi and Callum McManaman , will be assessed this week . <p> Given their centre-back shortage , Lees may have to be involved against Reading . <p> The 26 year-old only resumed first-team training last Friday having been missing from the side since the Owls ' 2-2 draw away to Bristol City at the end of January . <p> " We are concentrating on the next game and we are trying to recover players that missed Villa , " said Carvalhal . <p> " We will be a strong team on Friday .

 <p> I would say to Jon Ball , as I have many times , it is not about winning or losing . That applies to games of sport , and furthermore no one who voted remain will gloat if things go wrong . Why should they because they will be in the same " smelly stuff " , as you put it . <p> To Terry Palmer , why does he feel the need to bring up sexual relations between Blair and Edwina Currie , that 's totally irrelevant to the argument ? <p> To Mike Dodgson , the leaflet costing ? 8million , was not received by many in this area I can assure you , me included . <p> I did n't require any such leaflet to arrive at my decision to stay . I just researched genuine information , and still do so . Peddling negative information was almost entirely the " prerogative " of the Mail , Express and Mirror . They still do it every time there seems to be a " stutter " in the leave programme . I will agree on one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others in distress . That 's if there is any left . <p> As for wanting things back as they used to be , well yes , I would like to be 18 again , ( in my own era ) , fat chance of that either . <p> Finally the " united we stand " has gone along with the vote , another Tory plan . " Divide and Rule " and they have so far succeeded well . DS Whitehead 's letter goes some way to showing that . <p> B Heaton <p> DN5 <p> Take a breath and think <p> Open Letter to Councillor Bryan Lodge . <p> Dear Bryan , you can stop now . We know the truth . You are just a mouthpiece for council officers who leave it to you and others to peddle the propaganda that you still hope will fool the people of Sheffield into believing your policy of felling thousands of mature healthy street trees is justified . <p> Sheffield is becoming evermore aware of the nonsense as STAG membership continues to grow by the day . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidding of your officers ! <p> Tell us exactly when the tail started to wag the dog . More importantly you owe us an explanation so tell us why . <p> Are you and the rest of the ruling group in council really prepared to carry on letting these cowardly officers damage your hold on power ? <p> Are you working under the misapprehension that Sheffield will forget before May next year ? Those officers do not have to answer to the electorate but you do . <p> Before you tell me Sheffield wants what you 're doing just take a breath and think ...

I 've seen and heard it said that some fans were ' disappointed ' at our second half performance in letting Swindon back into the game , and at 2-2 it could be argued that the game should have been out of Swindon 's sight after a first half we totally dominated . <p> But when a side scores from a 30 yard shot that screams into the top corner after about 30 seconds of the second half to get a toe-hold back in the game , they are obviously going to get a boost . In fact , they also then scored from another long-range effort a few minutes later , and I suggest that lesser sides than us may have crumbled and snatched defeat from the jaws of near certain victory . But not us . Not now . Not this season . <p> We are now made of much stronger stuff than that . Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of true Sheffield steel . We regrouped , got a grip on the game , capitalised on their mistakes and came out worthy winners . Job done . <p> Please do n't get too concerned that we 've shipped seven goals in our last three games , either . Whilst it would be defensively great to get clean sheets all the time , football does n't work like that . Decent professional opposition will always create chances , cause teams problems , and yes , score goals ! Swindon 's two goals were the result of speculative long range shots that have an incredibly low percentage chance of actually going in . <p> To score from one in a game is unusual . To score from two is highly unlikely . It wo n't happen again this season ... probably not anyway ! And on the subject of shots , as long as we keep creating far more chances and shots at goal than all our opponents , we will remain exactly where we currently are ... top of the league . <p> Another thing to note with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good players we currently have in our team and squad , it therefore then follows that the chances we create through our sheer ability on the ball are usually very good chances indeed . We regularly carve teams open though our approach play in and around the penalty area , and are n't we also lucky that to top off all this good work we have our red-hot goal scorer and clinical finisher ... the man who simply ca n't stop scoring and is having a quite wonderful season . <p> Yes , of course I refer to Kieron Freeman ! What a revelation this lad has been this season . From the transfer list and a seemingly very bleak Blades future , to one of our most consistent performers and our second-top goal scorer with an amazing total of nine goals from 37 games . <p> I say amazing because let 's remember he 's primarily a defender , although in this current United side he does far more attacking than defending ! His willingness and enthusiasm to make those charges down the right side are fabulous to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up play on that side . He also has this marvellous knack of arriving unnoticed and unmarked deep into the opposition penalty area to get on the end of crosses from the left , and another even more marvellous knack of scoring from them when they do ! <p> The wing-back system seems to be very much back in fashion these days with the likes of Chelsea and Spurs employing players such as Victor Moses , Danny Rose and ex-Blade Kyle Walker as attack-minded defenders . Two , Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia , raid down the flanks for Manchester United and indeed , everywhere you look in the higher divisions you will find creative , attack minded players in full-back positions . <p> I can speak from experience as I made the switch from an attacking midfielder to a full-back some 30 years ago in my Wimbledon days ! My first instinct through my career as a full-back was always to get forward , but it obviously helps if your team is generally doing more attacking than defending ! <p> The current Blades team certainly does that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a little full-back bias and because of all his circumstances above , he 's my current choice of Player of the Year in a season where there are many very worthy candidates . <p> In fact , the last full-back winner of this award was 1995 ( do the research ! ) so another one is long overdue !

 <h> Mark Duffy is expected to be available for selection this weekend : Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> Sheffield United 's preparations for Saturday 's game against Charlton Athletic received a boost this morning when Mark Duffy and Caolan Lavery both trained with Chris Wilder 's first team squad . <p> Duffy has missed the League One leaders ' last two games after injuring a knee against Rochdale earlier this month while Lavery suffered a hamstring issue during Tuesday 's victory over Swindon Town . The former Northern Ireland international scored his fourth goal of the season at the County Ground . <h> Chris Wilder is pleased to see Duffy and Caolan Lavery return to action . Pic David <p> Speaking at the Steelphalt Academy this morning , Wilder said : " Lavs and Duff , they 're both available , they 've both trained today . Duffy took a heavy whack at Rochdale a couple of weeks ago and Caolan scored and set up a goal in the week . <p> " We 're fit and healthy and , at this stage , that 's all I can ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But going into the last nine games , we look in decent shape . " <p> Wilder , whose side are eight points clear of second-placed Fleetwood Town , also confirmed that Leon Clarke has trained without incident this week after returning from a spell at St George 's Park . The centre-forward has suffered a series of ankle issues since joining United from Bury during the close season . <p> " Leon is back in full training , " Wilder said . " Sometimes it 's good to get away , different surroundings and fresh ideas can help . He 's come back and he 's looking bright . " <h> Lavery was substituted at Swindon Town after complaining of a tight hamstring . Pic credit should read : Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> This weekend 's fixture sees United return to Bramall Lane following three games on the road . Having beaten Swindon 4-2 earlier this week , Wilder 's team has taken seven points from a possible nine after responding to a 3-3 draw with Rochdale by triumphing 3-2 at Oxford . <p> " To pick up seven points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent I think , " he said . " Now we 're delighted to be back at home . In terms of the times , how the games are set out between now and the end of the season , they seem to look okay . " <p> " It 's crackers sometimes , how you view the game , " Wilder added . " We 've watched it ( the Swindon fixture ) back , they scored a great goal after half-time and then their second , possibly we 've got a couple of things wrong in terms of timing . But it 's the high standards that we 've set ourselves . Possibly the tension you feel is n't quite what is happening out there . The right result happened on the night ; first-half in particular I thought we played some excellent stuff . "

 <h> Injury doubt : Tom Carr <h> Steve Hossack <p> Doncaster RLFC will be looking to remain on the Wembley trail longer than they did last season when they return Ladbrokes Challenge Cup action this weekend . <p> Well beaten by Hunslet Hawks at the fourth round stage twelve months ago , the Dons cross swords with University of Gloucestershire All Golds for the first time in the prestigious competition on Sunday . <p> The game has been switched from the rival League One club 's ground to the Keepmoat Stadium 's No 2 pitch for financial reasons . <p> " It would have been better had we been playing at the Keepmoat Stadium because it 's a bigger pitch and they 'll be more used to playing on a pitch inside an athletics track than we are , but I 'd still prefer to be playing in Doncaster rather than going down there , " said head coach Gary Thornton . <p> Despite having home advantage , Thornton is still expecting a tough game against an All Golds side who beat fancied Keighley Cougars in the league last weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll have to be on our game because they are a big side across the park , " he told The Star . <p> Thornton will finalise his side tonight but is not expected to make any unforced changes to the side which beat North Wales Crusaders last weekend . <p> Utility man Kieran Cross , who staked his claim for a regular starting spot when scoring two tries and helping to set two more up on Sunday , is likely to switch from scrum-half to stand-off to replace the injured Jordan Howden with Jack Miller recalled at scum-half . <p> If , as seems likely , Tom Carr is ruled out , Louis Sheriff will take over his full-back role with Sam Doherty coming in on the wing .

 <p> A dejected Carlos Carvalhal was left cursing " one of the hardest weeks " of his managerial career after Sheffield Wednesday 's 2-0 home defeat to fellow promotion rivals Reading . <p> Strikes by Yann Kermorgant and substitute Adrian Popa condemned the Owls to a second successive defeat and the injuries keep piling up for Carvalhal . <h> Carlos Carvalhal cuts a frustrated figure after his side 's defeat to Reading at Hillsborough <p> Ross Wallace played no part in the clash after suffering a knee problem in training on Thursday .

 <h> Wildlife Columnist : Ups and downs of the sparrowhawk <p> I get plenty of messages about sparrowhawks in urban and suburban gardens , with some people blown away to see such spectacular birds so close-to . Others are less happy about garden blue tits predated by hawks . <p> Well , according to recorders for the British Ornithological Society , this has been a year of mixed fortunes for sparrowhawks , with the highest recorded average counts in gardens last January , followed by the lowest-ever numbers for December . The boom and bust situation was reported by the BTO 's Garden BirdWatch survey . <h> Sparrowhawks are not always popular garden visitors <p> Sparrowhawks are most commonly observed in gardens during autumn and winter when numbers are swelled by juveniles from the breeding season just gone , and smaller birds , their typical food , flock into domestic gardens to feed . However , last year was unusual and January 2016 had the highest average counts of sparrowhawk for that time of year . Yet according to Garden BirdWatch , since the summer of 2016 numbers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only seen in 8 per cent of gardens . This was well below average and a 5 per cent reduction on December 2015 . <p> Experts think this decline was linked to wet weather in June that triggered a poor breeding season for many smaller birds , ( like blue tits and great tits ) , on which sparrowhawks depend . <p> Then , with fewer young birds available the potential food to feed their own sparrowhawk chicks , it is likely survival of the young hawks reduced . It is also possible that they were affected by the wet weather too . I suspect mild weather has encouraged small birds to stay out in the wider countryside too . <p> For many people the return of sparrowhawks since the devastating population crash of the 1950s and 1960s is most welcome . Decline to the point of near-extinction was through pesticide poisoning , and persecution . Since then , with pesticides reduced and persecution illegal , numbers have recovered . Today , they are the bird of prey most commonly seen in gardens unless you live close to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hawk looks rosy if the fall in numbers was down to short-term fluctuation in weather .

" <p> The court heard Mr Hoy stayed with Ms Wright but at some point during the night , he cleared her airways of vomit and placed her back in the recovery position . <p> But Ms Wright was unresponsive the next day . <p> " I woke up and she was n't there , she was gone , " Mr Hoy said . <p> Michelle 's father who was present in court asked Mr Hoy why an ambulance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her airways had to be cleared . <p> Mr Hoy said : " In hindsight , I should 've called one sooner but she was breathing and I did n't think it was necessary . <p> Addressing Ms Wright 's family , a teary Mr Hoy added : " I 'm so sorry . I know my words wo n't mean much but I 'd like to offer my condolences to the family . <p> " The world is a darker place , she was wonderful woman . " <p> A pathology and toxicology report said Ms Wright died of pneumonia due to ' multiple drug toxicity ' which included heroin , cocaine , benzodiazpines and pescription drugs .

 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : Do n't panic ! Owls dressing room still full of confidence for play-off place <h> Jack Hunt says there is still a lot of confidence in the Owls camp <p> Sheffield Wednesday defender Jack Hunt says there is no sense of panic in the Owls dressing room as they look to prevent a poor run of form becoming much more than that . <p> After a good run in early February , Carlos Carvalhal 's side have now won just once in their last six and only a stutter from seventh-placed play-off challengers Fulham in the past two games has prevented Wednesday from dropping out of the top six . <p> Now , with the international break giving the squad some breathing space and the opportunity to address the problems that have caused the dip in form , Hunt believes that there is no reason for fans to be worried about missing out on the play-offs . <p> And while other sides have been talked up this season , the 26 year-old insists the Owls are only worried about themselves and not what their rivals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Leeds , Reading , Huddersfield are doing well but we ca n't worry about anyone else , " he said . <p> " We have to just concern ourselves with what we can do and if we can string a few results together we are confident we can make the play offs . <p> " You do n't know what 's going to happen , as long as we take care of ourselves and ca n't have any complaints at the end of the season then I 'm sure everyone will be happy . " <p> Carvalhal 's men suffered a wobble towards the end of last season , too , but managed to do enough to book their top-six spot and eventually made it to Wembley , where they would narrowly lose out on a Premier League place to Hull in front of tens of thousands of Wednesdayites . <p> However , Hunt says he and his team mates will not be looking back to last season for experience . <p> " We know what we did last season but this season is totally different and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like his head coach and a few other players , former Huddersfield and Crystal Palace full-back Hunt says the international break has proven timely , coming as it does after Friday night 's 2-0 defeat to Reading at Hillsborough . <p> " I think it 's come at a really good time for us , " he admitted . " Whether we won or lost the game against Reading it had come at a good time . With a defeat it gives us time to go away , train hard through the week , spend time with our families , clear our heads and then come into April where the games are thick and fast . There are a lot of games and that means quickly we can turn it around . " 
 <h> Sheffield school set for ' new era ' following shock resignation of headteacher <h> Westfield School . <h> Lee Peace <h> A troubled Sheffield secondary school reeling from the shock resignation of its headteacher is set for a ' new era ' , according to the management team who have taken over . <p> Parents and pupils of Westfield School were shocked yesterday after receiving letters telling them headteacher Andy Ireland has left his post . The move was described as ' i 'll judged ' by some as he left just days before the results of an Ofsted inspection were due to be published . But interim headteacher Roisin Paul , who also heads up Silverdale School in Bents Green , called for calm among pupils , staff and parents as she set out her plans to improve the school . Ms Paul said : " We are anticipating a bright future for the school . This is only my first day in the job but we can already see many positives which we will build upon , and there are areas which we will improve . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help shape our future . " The school was judged by Ofsted to ' require improvement ' in 2014 and inspectors raised concerns over pupil attainment , quality of teaching and high truancy levels . The results of the latest inspection are expected on Friday . Ms Paul , aged 46 , of Sheffield , said : " We are in the early stages but we will look at additional training for staff to ensure our pupils get the highest standards . " Parents have also raised concerns that the school fails to communicate effectively with the community . <h> Roisin Paul . <p> One mother , whose daughter attends the school , described Mr Ireland 's decision to resign as " a little ill judged if an Ofsted report is due out soon . " <p> She added : " It is of concern and we are all wondering why he has gone . A public meeting would be a good idea . " <p> But the interim headteacher said : " We will be launching a Twitter and Facebook account which , alongside our website , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange a public meeting within the next couple of weeks . " She added : " We are only in the early stages but within the next two or three months we should have more specific plans for the future of the school . " Ms Paul added that the school is currently in consultation over converting to an academy with a view to joining the Silverdale Multi-Academy Trust and this should be completed by September 1 . " I know we are facing a period of change but I am confident that , by working in partnership with Silverdale , we will be able to build on the good work we have already achieved , and ensure that Westfield provides the best education possible for our children . " A letter to parents explained that Mr Ireland has already left his post to ' follow other career plans ' . The letter , signed by the chairman of the school 's board of governors , Claire Sellars , read : " Mr Ireland has left Westfield School to follow other career plans . He has asked me to forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . " I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Ireland on behalf of the school community and also wish him well for the future . " The letter added : " There will be some further adjustments of roles and responsibilities within the team to ensure the smooth day to day running of the school . " I know that Mrs Paul will be in touch with parents and carers once she has started , to share her vision for our school . " Given her experience in leading Silverdale as an outstanding school , I look forward to the excellent ideas and commitment she will bring . "

 <h> Kevin Gage 's Blades Column : Forget the pain of the past ... Chris Wilder 's Sheffield United are n't about to choke now <h> Kevin Gage Column <h> Kevin Gage <h> Now I know us Blades are generally a pessimistic bunch when it comes to football , and to be fair , with very good reason over the years ! <p> The list of disappointments and outright calamities we 've endured in recent times would fill a whole page ( and column ! ) and the sheer thought of the word ' play-off ' brings us out in a cold sweat . <p> A mention of words such as Wembley , Hopkins , the Millenium Stadium , cup semi-finals , Tevez , Unsworth , Ched , Simonsen etc , still sends a shiver down our spines , and do n't even get me started on the results on the last day of the season in 1994 that saw us go from being 15th and safe at 4.20pm to relegated some 20 minutes later . <p> Generally then , I think it 's fair to say that rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only half-empty , but indeed knocked over and spilt all over the new carpet ! We 're Blades , it 's what we do . <p> But now , SURELY , the pessimists , the prophets of doom , the cup half-empty brigade and indeed every single Blade out there can believe that this , finally , is the season where we can uncross our fingers , stop praying to whichever footballing God we follow and put all the years of disappointment and negativity behind us . <p> We can do so because Chris Wilder , his staff and his players have now changed the culture at Sheffield United from being perennial nearly men and plucky losers , to being proud main men and deserving winners . It 's been a quite phenomenal turn around in such a relatively short space of time and whatever the outcome is this season , it 's been an absolute privilege to witness . <p> The game last Saturday epitomised everything that has changed for the better regarding this Blades team , as we coped with an very impressive and extremely fast start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so low in this league is ridiculous with the players and the potential they clearly have . <p> But we stood our ground in that first 20 minutes , and we competed . Led by the brilliant Chris Basham and the outstanding Jack O'Connell , we won crucial tackles and won important headers . We matched their energy levels and then slowly but surely our ability came shining through and we got our equaliser , turned the game around impressively and in truth a score of 3-1 or 4-1 would n't have flattered us . <p> Some of our second-half approach play around the penalty area and out wide was equally impressive . In fact , at times it was sublime . Football is still an entertainment business and the appreciation shown by nearly 23,000 Blades as we cut Charlton to shreds on occasions was clear for all to see and hear , only matched by the standing ovation at the final whistle at yet another quality home performance ... and another win . Job done ... again . <p> So we 're ten points clear of third place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's only eight games left . Given that in his last 62 league games as a manager , Chris Wilder has only lost SIX times , does anyone out there seriously think that we 're now going to lose another six or more of our last eight games ? No , me neither . <p> It would take a sequence of losses similar to that to wreck our promotion party , and trust me , it 's simply not going to happen ! As I wrote here in the first week of January ( link please Editor ... ) the Blades ARE going up . The only question left to be answered is when . <p> Finally , before the Charlton game , I got a tweet from a Blade follower who 'd just bet ? 5 at odds of 100-1 that SUFC would NOT go up this season . Talk about hedging your bets ! ! ! In fairness , he said that should the unthinkable happen , the ? 500 would pay for his play-off tickets and also the drinks to " numb the pain " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted a fiver , but if his bet does comes in he wo n't be the only Blade drowning his sorrows with a some pain-numbing pints ! I own a bar ... you might never see or hear from me again ! UTB

Aldi , M&amp;S Food and Costa are just some of the big names on the way to the area . <p> But these changes , especially the retail park , have caused some anxiety among residents and businesses in Meadowhead and Norton . <p> Traffic on Bochum Parkway , Meadowhead roundabout and Chesterfield Road is already a concern and the retail park is only expected to make things worse . <h> Meadowhead <p> Shops on Meadowhead , especially ones which sell food , have been hit by the exodus of college students to Hillsborough on a brand new site . <p> Meadowhead School used to allow older pupils out to buy dinner but this has been stopped in recent years . The expanded sixth form has helped but footfall is down during the weekday . <p> Meadowhead Meats butchers and sandwich shop has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it started out . But seven years on , things are healthy . <p> Co-owners Jillian Wallace and husband-to-be Mark said they love ? the area as they chat ? between making ? roast pork sandwiches for hungry customers . <h> Famous portrait scluptor Sir Francis Chantrey a resident of Norton <p> " It 's the people who make it for anywhere and here is no different , " Jillian said . <p> " They 're a great bunch . We get a wide range of age groups coming in . Teenagers at sixth form coming for pork sandwiches and pensioners coming in for meat . The people who live around here are a loyal bunch and they 're ever so friendly . " <p> The conversation quickly turns to the planned retail park nearby which will include a Greggs bakery . <p> " It 's a good job they do n't do roast pork sandwiches ! " Jillian said . <p> " But we 're definitely not fans of it . The traffic is bad enough as it is on the roundabout and the dual-carriageway it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have to wait and see what the damage , if any , is . " <p> Dating back over 850 years , Norton was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 . The village used to be part of Derbyshire but joined up with the wider Sheffield area many years later . <p> Notable residents include Sir Francis Chantrey a famous portrait sculptor who was renowned as a leading arts figure in the Regency era of British history . On his death , he left ? 100,000 -- worth ? 100m today -- to charity in 1848 . He is buried in St James ' Church close to where he was born . <p> And you ca n't talk about Norton and not mention Graves Park . It was donated to the city by John George Graves in 1925 to protect the 1,000-year-old woodland from development . <p> Now , the park boasts several football pitches , tennis courts , bowling greens , a nine-hole golf course , an animal farm and land with Highland cattle . <p> Husband and wife Ian and Sue Auckland have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " The area is amazing . One thing that strikes me is the number of community groups who really want to get involved and help improve the area . Friends of Graves Park and other groups are passionate about where they live . <p> " There is so much going on , people are never short of something to do . " <p> Ian added : " I 'd echo those comments and I 'd say we have Sheffield 's best park people from all over the city and further afield come to Graves Park for a day out and to see the animals at the farm . It 's the jewel in the area 's crown . <p> " The area is proper middle Sheffield . It 's neither in the richest 10 per cent nor the most deprived 10 per cent . People are friendly , they work hard and bring their families up here . It 's a desirable area . " <p> The main talking point in the area at the moment is the planned retail park and both councillors are encouraged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal world , I 'd have liked to have seen some much-needed housing on the plot of land where the retail park will go but I know the development is welcome . <p> " I 've met the developers and they are keen to work with the communities affected by the construction through a liaison group which can only be a good thing . <p> " Two of the area 's biggest employers are the two big secondary schools in Meadowhead and , a bit further away , Newfield and the retail park will provide much-needed jobs for local people and that is never a bad thing . " <p> Mitchells Wines which has stood proudly on Meadowhead for more than 80 years is another family-run business rooted in the community . <p> Manager Wayne Griffin , 47 , said the store has a loyal customer base of people from the area . <p> He said : " Working for a family business , you feel more involved . <p> " Meadowhead has a lot of family-run businesses which ca n't be said for many areas . <p> " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run independently . " <p> Russell Jones , 37 , who also works at Mitchells Wine and lives in nearby Greenhill , added : " I 've lived nearby for a while and I 've always liked the area . <p> " I 'd say I know 60 per cent of our customers who come through the door they 're always very friendly .

" <p> Brian Castleton , aged 67 , claimed the area has got worse in terms of crime in the 60 years he has lived there . <p> He said : " Longley used to be the city 's most sought after council estate . But things have got worse in the last few years . You are always hearing about murders and what not in Sheffield - I 'm not sure what 's going on .

 <h> Search for Sheffield family of wartime sweethearts after letter discovery <h> One of the letters from Sheffield-born Sgt Alfred Wilson to his fiancee Nora Tillson . <h> Alex Moore <h> An appeal to Sheffield residents to reunite letters written by two wartime sweethearts with their descendants has been launched . <p> John Williamson , 76 , from Sidmouth , hopes to find family members of Sgt Alfred Wilson and his wife Nora , formerly Tillson . <h> One of the letters from Sheffield-born Sgt Alfred Wilson to his fiancee Nora Tillson . <p> While working for the Welfare Insurance Company in Folkstone in the 1970s , John found two letters written in April and June 1914 by Sgt Wilson to Nora , then his fiancee . <p> John 's plan was to give the letters to their author 's descendants , and this month he approached The Star to try to further the search . <p> " It has always been my desire to reunite these letters with the descendants of either Sgt Wilson or Miss Tillson , and to this extent with the help of others I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and identify with the appropriate individuals to whom I might pass these on , " he said . <p> " I have recently come into possession of information which tells me that Alfred Wilson in Sheffield in 1885 and in 1891 was listed as living at 64 Furnival Street , with his parents . He also had three brothers - Robert , Edward and Elis . " <h> John Williamson . <p> According to Sgt Wilson 's letters , he was in training at Deepcut barracks in Surrey in 1914 , and served with the Kings Royal Rifle Corps . <p> John 's research suggests he married Nora in Folkstone while on leave in February 1915 . <p> He was sent to France where he was shot , and was sent back to the UK to recover . <p> He then returned to France and was killed near Pozieres during the Somme offensive on July 23 , 1916 - just 15 months after being married . <h> One of the letters from Sheffield-born Sgt Alfred Wilson to his fiancee Nora Tillson . <p> He is commemorated along with more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missing of the Somme . <p> John believes Nora did not remarry and died in March 1973 , with no remaining family . <p> His hope to find Sgt Wilson 's descendants and pass on the ' very emotional and poignant ' letters to them . <p> " As regards the Hussars Dance , Well I have had my studying cap on about that this afternoon and much as I should like you to stay away from it , I have come to the conclusion that you had better go under the circumstances . <p> " If you do n't go , Ma must not go either , I do n't intend having you left alone in the house any more than I should at a Dance . <p> " In any case , if I know Ma right , I do n't think she would go without you .

 <h> Dan Windham <p> Hundreds of mourners have paid an emotional farewell to beloved Sheffield football coach Steve Adams during his funeral today . <p> The former Doncaster Rovers and Worksop Town footballer died on Friday , March 3 , after battling terminal cancer for five years . <p> Following his retirement from professional football , Steve became an important and much-loved member of Sheffield 's coaching community . <p> Steve became a popular figure as a football coach with the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Community Programme and through his own Tricky Wingers coaching business . <p> Tributes poured in for the father-of-one following his death , aged 57 , with family and friends eager to share their fondest memories of an " enthusiastic and selfless individual . " <p> His popularity and stature across the city 's footballing community was confirmed when hundreds of mourners packed into Grenoside Crematorium today to pay their final respects . <p> Mourners , many of whom dressed in Sheffield Wednesday kits , erupted into an emotional minute 's applause as Steve 's coffin was presented outside the crematorium . <p> Speaking before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked guests to wear what they wanted to the funeral as it would be a " celebration of my dad 's life " <p> Gracie decided to wear a t-shirt of popular American rock band The Killers that she wore at many gigs that she attended with her father . <p> The family added that , instead of bringing flowers , guests were instead asked to donate money to MacMillan Palliative Care or Derek Dooley MBE Football Academy for disability football ; both causes " very close to both his and our family 's heart " . <p> In a fitting tribute , the band 's hit song ' Human ' played as the coffin-bearers carried Steve into the crematorium before the crowd solemnly followed in for the service . <p> Many of Steve 's friends posted on Facebook to pay tribute to the beloved footballing coach . 
 <h> Sheffield United : Boss and skipper reveal off-licence secrets behind Blades ' surge to top of League One <h> Billy Sharp and Chris Wilder <p> It was a clear , sunny August day in South East London and as the smell of marijuana floated gently across the press box at The Den , Sheffield United 's season went from bad to worse in the blink of an eye . <p> Shane Ferguson 's cross . Jack O'Connell 's hand . Steve Morison 's emphatic , 89th-minute penalty ; 2-1 Millwall . United bottom of the League One table after four games ; four games , three defeats , one point . <p> Hardly the start boyhood Blade Chris Wilder would have dreamed about . <p> Tonight , just over seven months and 35 league games later , United face Millwall again at Bramall Lane and the atmosphere is somewhat sweeter these days . <p> Wilder 's Blades are on the cusp of a long-overdue promotion back to the Championship and , although Bolton are breathing down their necks in the race for the League One title , the Blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no qualms with saying where we are , " Wilder said yesterday , in his office at United 's Shirecliffe training complex . <p> " These are n't just any other games now ; we 've set it up for them to be big games . We have to go and enjoy them now . <p> " Would we have wanted to win any of our first four games ? Of course we would . A good start is always important so did we want one ? <p> " Of course . Did we deserve one ? I think so , because we played okay , apart from a horrible 25 minutes at home to Southend when they jumped all over us and won 3-0 . <p> " We played alright at Millwall back in August , until the last minute and the cross came in ... the players care , and they were down . So on the coach home , I got the driver to pull over at an off licence and bought ? 100 worth of beer . <p> " And then kept it all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and could see the lads were down . They care . We had lost in the 93rd minute but had played all right . They were down on that bus and I wanted to change the mood . " <p> United won their next game , at home to Wilder 's former club Oxford , and the rest is history . That win sparked a 15-match unbeaten run in League One and remarkably , United have lost as many games in their last 35 league games as they did in the first four . <p> " The lads were really hurting on the bus and what the gaffer did was a great bit of management , " said Billy Sharp , Wilder 's captain and United 's 26-goal top scorer . <p> " I was surprised and the lads did n't really know what to do . It could have been a test , I suppose , but I think it was a turning point for our season . <p> " I then said something to the lads on the bus that they still cane me for now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the season , but it was along the lines of : ' We need to shake our heads and get some results because if the manager is giving us drinks after a defeat and one point from four games then imagine what he could be like if we some games ? ' <p> " The manager is very fair and honest . If you do well for him , he rewards you . He is old school but he has also moved with the times as well . That is a good mix and he is great to work for . " <p> Sharp is spurred on by memories of last season 's limp end to the season , which saw United finish 11th under Nigel Adkins and receive abuse from the small sections of their support that stayed behind as their ' lap of honour ' turned into an outpouring of grief and frustration . <p> " Personally , I was embarrassed at the end of last season when we went out for a lap of honour , " said Sharp , who still bagged 21 goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our thanks to the fans but we had let the club down . This time , the gaffer has made sure we did n't make the same mistake . He has done an amazing job in a short space of time . <p> " We had been so disappointing last season . So , when you start like we did , you do think , ' Not again ' . But the manager really has done an unbelievable job , especially after how we started . We were 12 points behind Bolton after six games , or something like that . <p> " But we have come a long way since then and if we can get over the line , it will be some achievement . " <p> Wilder , still at Northampton at the time , admits events of that final day last season were relayed to him by friends and admits United was a " split club " . <p> " The players did n't want to do it but the fans did , probably for the wrong reasons , " he added . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we faced was to unite everyone again . " <p> And if it costs Wilder a few quid at the off-licence along the way , he 'll drink to that if United are celebrating promotion next month .

 <h> South Yorkshire MP welcomes sale of historic statley home <h> Wentworth Woodhouse . <h> Lee Peace <h> A South Yorkshire MP has welcomed news that the future of a huge stately home - believed to be the largest house in Britain - has been secured in a ? 7 million deal . <p> The grade I-listed Wentworth Woodhouse near Rotherham went up for sale in 2015 following the death of owner Clifford Newbold . It has now been bought by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust . <p> The ? 7 million cost has been partly funded by a ? 3.5 million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund , with the rest of the cash coming from a range of institutional and private donors . <p> Labour 's Wentworth and Dearne MP John Healey said he was " delighted " by the move and added : " I 'm delighted that the sale is agreed .

 <h> Sheffield community hits back over ' one of country 's most anti-social estates ' label <h> Lee Peace <p> Parson Cross may have been shamed as ' one of the most anti-social ' estates in the country - but residents who live there are having none of it . <p> New research revealed the area to be one of the most notorious crime hot spots across England and Wales - with 143 incidents reported in a six-month period . Anti-social behaviour , criminal damage , violent attacks and theft make up the bulk of the offences . <h> Lewis Parkin and Katie Fields . <p> Meanwhile a recent spate of arson attacks - one of which resulted in a gas explosion - has also raised questions about the safety of the estate , once regarded as one of Europe 's largest concentrations of council housing . <p> But defiant residents spoke out today in defence of their community and rubbished ' knocking stories ' about where they live . Police also put the crime statistics down to a small number of repeat offenders . <p> One resident who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and the scourge of criminals - is mum-of-five Katie Fields . <p> The 32-year-old was left devastated when burglars broke into her home and stole her son Lewis Parkin 's beloved X-Box , along with two TVs , an i-pad and a laptop . This all happened while the 13-year-old was in a coma in hospital after being knocked over by a car . <h> Parson Cross . <p> But what happened next ' restored the family 's faith in people ' as the community rallied round to raise money to buy them back all of the stolen equipment - including Lewis 's prized games console . <p> Katie said : " We always hear knocking stories about the area . There is a lot of crime , no doubt , but what happened to us just shows you the great community spirit . <p> " We were devastated by the burglary but equally could n't believe how generous people had been . It restores your faith in people . " <p> She was by Lewis 's side in Sheffield Children 's Hospital one weekend towards the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stole around ? 1500 worth of possessions . <p> The Chaucer School student suffered a fractured skull and neck , two broken legs , a shattered jaw and a brain bleed after being knocked over by a taxi in Buchanan Road . He spent eight weeks in hospital , including two in a coma . <p> Katie feared the worst and the incident brought back nightmares after Lewis ' younger brother Samuel died suddenly in her arms in 2014 , two years ago , aged seven , from complications arising from rheumatoid arthritis . <p> She said : " I rushed to the scene and saw him lying there not breathing , I was in shock . " <p> Residents quickly set up online fundraising pages and staff at the local Tesco organised charity events . Within weeks all of the stolen items were bought back . <p> Lewis said : " I love playing video games and I want to say thank you to everyone . " <p> Their heart-warming story comes as police data obtained by software company Hopewiser found Buchanan Drive in Parson Cross and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December last year - the fourth highest in England and Wales . This included 133 anti-social behaviour incidents alone , with many other thefts , assaults and sexual offences . <p> Furthermore , arsonists sparked a fire which caused a gas explosion at a home in Wordsworth Drive on Sunday evening - one of 28 arson attacks this year in the wider Parson Cross , Firth Park and Southey area . <p> While residents recognise crime levels are high , they disregarded many incidents as ' petty crime ' . <p> A man who has owned a business in Buchanan Road for 25 years but did not want to be named , added : " Nobody seems to feel scared , sadly some crime is part of life in a community . " <p> However , they did call for more to be done to give young people ' something to do ' on an evening to keep them out of trouble . <p> Mr Kirkham , a clinical support worker at Northern General Hospital , said : " There does n't seem to be many youth clubs about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should bring them back .

 <h> Shame of South Yorkshire 's 9000 animal cruelty complaints <h> Buster has been rehomed . <h> Lee Peace <p> The South Yorkshire region looms large in a league of shame of animal cruelty as investigators dealt with more than 9000 complaints of attacks on pets and wildlife in just two years . <p> The RSPCA today put out its annual figures for the number of complaints it probed in 2016 compared to the previous year , and shed a light on acts that one senior inspector described as " deliberate brutality " . <h> Buster 's skin condition . <p> South Yorkshire was ranked as the seventh highest county on a national table showing the number of investigations - with 4466 in 2015 and 4806 last year . <p> The county was also joint tenth on the table of areas which featured the highest conviction levels -- fetching 44 last year compared to 39 in 2015 . <p> Dermot Murphy , assistant director of the RSPCA Inspectorate , said : " It continues to outrage and sadden me that people can be capable of such deliberate brutality towards animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetrators of animal cruelty are put before the courts . <p> " I believe that the figures from last year show that we 're not becoming crueler , but that people are simply less willing to stand by and do nothing if they think an animal is suffering . " <h> Buster 's skin condition . <p> As part of the figures , the charity released a case study about an American bulldog called ' Buster ' who was found to be suffering from two painful conditions at a house in Barnsley in November 2015 . <p> Then just ten months old , Buster had a severe skin condition called demodectic mange , which causes inflammation to the skin , and bilateral entropion , where the eyelids turn inwards . <p> A man and woman admitted animal cruelty charges last year and were disqualified from keeping animals for five years and given a 12 month community order . Buster was rehomed . <p> RSPCA inspector Jo Taylor said : " It was heartbreaking to find Buster in this terrible condition . It was clear to anyone that Buster was suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wales , a total of 149 , 604 complaints were investigated by the RSPCA last year , compared to in 2015 - an increase of 4.61 per cent .

 <h> Ervins Mustukovs - a consistent performer all year <h> David Simms <p> What a play off series : Sheffield Steelers face their arch rivals the Nottingham Panthers in this weekend 's quarter finals . <p> So much to gain , so much to lose , that 's what makes this pairing so exciting . <p> In the two fan bases there will be nerves like never before . If you are to win the series then there is no team you would rather play and beat than Panthers ( and vica verca . ) <p> But , if you are to lose , well then there is no team on earth that you 'd want to lose to less than them -- especially with a weekend at the play off 's to look forward . <p> Everything hangs on the line . The importance is so high , maybe even more so than winning the eventual play off finals a week later . Coaches would n't take this option but if I offered fans of either side a guarantee they would make it to the finals but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both Steelers and Panthers fans would take it . <p> So what are the keys going into Saturday 's fixture in Nottingham and Sunday 's 5pm return leg at Sheffield Arena ? <h> Miika <p> The coaches . We have the two most successful coaches in Elite League history . Thompson who has made a career winning league titles and Neilson who is a specialist in this , the shorter format competition . I do n't think these two would stand along side one another at a party , I do n't see anything they share in common other than being 24 hour a day , 7 days a week hockey nerds . They both live and breathe it . They both will share the same few hours sleep this week preparing for the series . <p> Whilst I think it 's fair to say they are n't overly keen on one another I think they do share a mutual respect . They have been rivals for the past decade . They have both delivered for their clubs , won trophies consistently . Their jobs come with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who knock them have no idea what it 's like to be either of them or what their job consists of . Win or lose they both will be drained , out on their feet come Sunday evening . <p> Goaltending : Mustukovs v : On present form , Moose that leads the way . He completed the regular season with a 91.2% saves percentage , the best in the League . Moose gives you a chance to win every night , he will need to be a brick wall in Nottingham on Saturday but he has n't let us down all year . is Panthers ' main man . <p> Key players . For Steelers its easy just to say Roy and Fretter , because come the big moments that is who you normally look too , your best players . Every team will do that . Nottingham will look to Williams and Schultz in the same way . <p> Roy is a man for the big occasion , a natural goal scorer . Fretter is maybe the most skilled genius in the league . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson . The , Nelson and Dowd line have been incredible for weeks . The bigger the occasion the taller Nelson gets . That trio will be a lot more than just a supporting cast this weekend . <p> Toughness . Big hits , energy , competitiveness will as always be part of a play off series . How many fights do you see in the play offs ? Probably zero is the answer . <p> In Zack Fitzgerald and Brian McGratton you have two experienced , professional enforcers . They will be both ready but I think in more of a policeman role than and brawling role this weekend . If needs must though you know they wo n't think twice . Neither will the likes of Desbiens or Brown . <p> Both teams are equipped for however these two games pan out . <p> It 's another reason we are all intrigued . <p> Do n't write off the Panthers , they have their rocks as well . There rocks need to deliver as they have underachieved . <p> Their coach has called them out , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hurt you within a blink of an eye . David Clarke always performs against the Steelers , keeping him off the scoresheet will be pivotal . <p> Can the Panthers beat us without David Clarke scoring this weekend ? <p> In saying all of that , if one chance falls to one player this weekend let it fall to the King . He will be hoping the puck comes to him in that big moment , he will want it , go searching and hunting for it . Why ? Because he knows that 's his job , to deliver on the big stage . 
 <h> What about the plague of Fargate ? <h> Sleeping rough , sent in by Jayne Grayson <p> When I go shopping I do not want to see people sitting in sleeping bags on the streets , it shows that our society is borderline redundant and on the verge of utterly failing , it shows that we have a lack of morality and have failed to prioritise . <p> I want the British homeless given shelter and I want the foreign-born ones deporting . <p> Most of the Eastern European ones are a sham and are of no worth to Britain , it is time for them to go . <p> Once that is done I would like all the religious stands removing from the city centre . <p> I do not want to know anything more about Jesus and I do not want to know anything more about Muhammad . <p> One supposedly died for my sins 2,000 years before I was born and the other one calls me a non-believer . <p> Both are from a far-distant land born thousands of years after my European forefathers had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as a functional modern human . <p> In fact the only thing both have in common is the proliferation of war , pain , intolerance and hatred . <p> So please let me shop in peace . <p> Oh , and stop cutting the trees down , they are the only things left on some estates that display anything beautiful , not that you would recognise aesthetics , just trust me on that one . 
 <h> Rotherham United : Summer of suffering as Vaulks gears up for new role <h> Will Vaulks <p> Rotherham United plan to put Will Vaulks through a pre-season of pain to convert the midfield man to a new position . <p> The 23-year-old has spent much of this Championship season as a central midfielder , but has impressed at right-back in the Millers ' last three matches . <p> Caretaker manager Paul Warne , who could be confirmed as permanent boss next week , has told his Rotherham future lies as a full-back or wing-back and to prepare to suffer as the Millers improve his conditioning . <p> " I like him , " Warne said . " He is one bossy man and he is a winner . <p> " I have said to him in the summer that we will recreate his fitness so he is a wing-back because he will make more money as a wing- back than as a midfielder . He laughed but I was n't joking . <p> " I would be looking at him as a right-back because it suits his play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play anywhere . " <p> The bottom-placed Millers , who return to action after the international break at home to Fulham on Saturday , are 24 points adrift of safety with eight games left and will be relegated shortly . <p> Warne believes Vaulks ' experience in the second tier will stand him in good stead in League One next year . <p> " I do like him as a right-back , " the interim boss said . " He 's not playing against idiots here . The winger in League One might not be as good as the winger for , say , Wolves . <p> " I think he has handles himself really well . He has a good understanding of the game and he has good positional sense . He has done well . " <p> Regular right-back Darnell could be back in contention for the Cottagers clash after hamstring trouble , but Vaulks is likely to get the nod against the play-off-chasing visitors . 
 <h> Kieron Freeman <p> Kevin Gage is far too modest to accept the notion that he was a trendsetter for a generation of full-backs who followed in his footsteps at Sheffield United . <p> But Gage , who played more than 150 times for United and has since become a fan of the club , is uniquely placed to observe the change in culture that has transformed one of football 's least desirable positions into a key part of the modern game . <p> His case in point is Kieron Freeman , the current Blades right-back who 's fought his way in from the cold at Bramall Lane and scored 10 goals , helping to underpin his side 's title push . <p> " Kieron has been the oustanding player this season , for me , " Gage said . <p> " You have to look at how he started the season and the difference to then and now . I spoke to Chris ( manager Wilder ) at the start of the season and I 'm not giving away any confidences here , but he was n't sure about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but he was on the transfer list and then got his chance when John Brayford went out on loan . And my , how he 's taken that chance . <p> " He was here a few years before and no-one seemed really sure if he was a better right-back or a winger , but now he does both in one and the system United play suits him perfectly . His attacking play is brilliant - he gets on the end of so much and finishes well - but his defending has been superb , too , and he 's made some fantastic tackles . <p> " He brings a dynamism to the team and he 's been the standout player for me . The adulation and respect he 's earned , from where he came from at the start of the season , has been well deserved . " <p> Gage , a paid-up member of the defender 's union , made good cases too for 26-goal skipper Billy Sharp and the midfield duo of Paul Coutts and John Fleck , while Mark Duffy , Chris Basham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blades Player of the Year award in a potentially title-winning season . <p> Gage himself won the Player-of-the-Year gong at Bramall Lane in 1995 after scoring five times from right-back , and still keeps a keen eye on his adopted Blades as a matchday host and a columnist for this newspaper . <h> Kevin Gage <p> Born in Chiswick , West London , he began life as a footballer in the No 10 role - the Duffy of his era - before Wimbledon 's direct style rendered midfield largely redundant , and Dave Bassett converted him to right-back . <p> " My instinct was always to get forward at every opportunity , because that 's what I enjoyed doing , " he remembers . <p> " I used to drive Bassett mad with it . At United , I replaced a lad called Gary Peters who was an out-and-out defender , and never crossed the halfway line . But the game 's changed that much that you ca n't get away with being just a defender at right-back anymore . <p> " Maybe 15 or 20 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-back who won a few tackles and headers , because he 'd have had to deal with an opposition winger . How many teams play with wingers anymore ? <p> " So the system at United is great for Kieron , because it gives him absolute licence to bomb forward . I used to love doing that , but would I say I was ahead of my time ? I do n't think so ! I have England Youth caps at home from my days as an attacking midfielder , so it used to come naturally to me . " <p> Despite their paths rarely crossing during their brief time together as players in South Yorkshire , Wilder was keen to canvass Gage 's opinion shortly after taking charge at Bramall Lane - along with another legend of the Lane . <p> " I think it was a day or so after Chris got the job , and I got a call from Andy Pack , the former media guy at United , " Gage remembers . <p> " He said Chris wanted to chat to me and Keith Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd missed while being away . He 'd spoken to Harry Bassett too and wanted my opinion as a relative ' outsider ' , not on the coaching staff or anything like that . <p> " Keith sees a lot of home and away games and is n't ever short of an opinion , but I was coming in fresh , so to speak , and I was honoured . Funnily enough , one of the first things he said was that he was going to play 4-4-2 and circumstances dictated that he changed that , but I hope they carry on playing 3-5-2 in the Championship , if and when they get there . <p> " Everyone seems so comfortable with the system that I ca n't see Chris changing it , either . I think they might have to do a bit more defending next year because they wo n't run away with the league , and Freeman and Daniel Lafferty might not be able to get forward quite as much as they have this year . <p> " But the three centre-halves set-up works perfectly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . Maybe we 'll have to look at the three in midfield and rein them in a little , and the centre-halves might have to rein themselves in a little bit too , but it 's an exciting time to be a Blade . " 
 <h> " The kitchen is the heart of any home " <h> Sheffield Kitchen Outlet <p> Stuart and Daniel Hattersley know that the kitchen is the heart of any home . <p> As the owners of Sheffield Kitchen Outlet - which supplies around 200 kitchens a month in the region - they 've seen firsthand how the role of the kitchen has changed and adapted in recent years . <p> " People do n't just have a little corner kitchen with a few beech units in it anymore , they expect something a bit more special , " says managing director Stuart , who - along with his brother - launched the Sheffield business 12 years ago . <p> " We 're now putting kitchens in regular homes that , a few years ago , we would have been putting in million pound homes . The kitchen is the entertainment heart of a home , it 's the place everybody congregates to talk , to socialise and we 're really seeing that people want to play to that . <p> " People do n't go out to drink in pubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home , so people want islands , breakfast bars , built-in living spaces - every kitchen we create is unique , designed just for that person , or that family . " <p> Sheffield Kitchen Outlet is a manufacturer of quality fitted kitchen furniture , selling to both trade and retail customers . As well as its head office and distribution centre , the company has three showrooms across the city , featuring everything a customer could want to create a custom fitted kitchen , from the very traditional to the incredibly modern , and everything in between . Everything is custom made to order and hand-built in Sheffield . <p> " We have 55 full-time employees , and 25 sub-contractors - all local - who can handle every aspect of your kitchen ; from worktops , furniture , lighting , taps and units , to designers and structural engineers , " said Stuart . <p> " People come to us with a vision of what they want . We go out and visit them at their home , look at the space , get a design brief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a lot of people now , this is n't a small job , there are walls being knocked down and extensions being built - whatever it takes to create this space that they 're picturing . <p> " We can have a kitchen turned around in as little as two weeks now , but it totally depends on what you 're looking for . In a lot of cases , it 's the building work and that process that takes time . Plus if people are wanting lots of little bespoke touches , that can take time too . But it 's worth the way to get exactly what you want . <p> " We do get some customers who have very specific ideas and want to push the boat out , and out job is to make the vision in their head a reality . " <p> And the brothers , along with mum Wendy , who is the company 's finance director , have a strong vision of their own for the future of Sheffield Kitchen Outlet . <p> " Business is booming , " confirmed Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has completely changed and we 've been so busy . Our number of employees has trebled in that time . The next step for us is focusing on growing the business even more , and we 're already planning a move to Leeds next , with another branch .

" <p> Heeley City Farm chief executive John Le Corney , said : " Andrew Lawton did work for us for a number of years and did work with young people . <p> " I was employed then along with a number of experienced youth workers and none of us had any concerns about him .

The band 's music is woven into their lives , with its inevitable highs , lows and tragedies . <p> The Take That trio also joined some members of the cast for a press conference about the show . Asked how close the story was to that of Take That , Mark said : " We met those kids when they were 16 outside our houses and heard them screaming . We 've seen them grow up . <p> " That 's the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have given us . We say we 're just a vehicle for them to get together and hang out ! " <p> Gary Barlow said : " I loved it today . Already we 're so involved with this music . I was very proud to sit in the audience and watch our music being performed . <p> " One of the things we loved when the story came about is that it pays the ultimate respect to our audience , those who came , loved , supported it and made it part of their lives . " <p> Howard added : " I think that 's one of the things that brings out the emotion in us . <p> " The situation of this young group of girls growing old and meeting 25 years later is a guide to those songs we chose . We 've got lot of swapping about to do still . " <p> He 's admitted that watching the show has been very emotional for him and the rest of the band . <p> They said they discussed the idea of doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Circus . <p> It 's coming about now , just as new album Wonderland is launched and they are preparing for a mainly sell-out tour of Britain and Ireland , arriving at Sheffield Arena on May 29 and 30 . <p> Rachel Lumberg plays the part of adult Rachel , one of the five friends . She is well known to Sheffield audiences after appearing in the musical My Family at the Crucible Studio and the Lyceum , and in The Full Monty . <p> She paid tribute to the members of Five to Five .

They are focused , in the moment and learn very quickly . <p> " Coming into a show is a very different experience for them . " <p> The band have been hard at work learning all the songs and taking part in rehearsals . <p> Gary Barlow praised the band and thought they could not have hoped for a better outcome from the TV show . Mark Owen jokingly warned them : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is directed behind former EastEnder Jack Ryder , who is also at the helm of the current tour of The Full Monty , about to start a two-week run at Sheffield Lyceum . <p> He said : " This production and cast are a joy .

" <p> Incredibly , Jack is also working on The Band writer Tim Firth and Gary Barlow 's new Calendar Girls musical , The Girls . He said : " It 's fun . I 'm learning to multi-task , which is a very good skill for me to have ! " <p> The Band is at the Lyceum on October 4 to 14 . Tickets go on general sale tomorrow , Monday April 4 , at noon . 
 <h> the roundabout of death <h> Cars parked on Blast Lane in Sheffield where the City Council proposes to start charging motorists to park <p> I came to Sheffield for the first time at the start of the year to start a new job in the technology sector . I picked up your newspaper and the headline prompted me to write in with some initial impressions . <p> I 'm very happy to see a thriving local paper highlighting Sheffield issues . <p> There 's a friendly welcome , interesting heritage , and a terrific energy and buzz created by the universities with so many young people starting out in life . <p> Overall , there 's a good feeling that makes the city a very pleasant place to be . <p> It 's big enough to have plenty to do , yet small enough to walk most places . <p> My one negative would be that city planners seem to have been tardy in introducing the environmental improvements that competing cities have forged ahead with . <p> I 've had to run across roads as motorists accelerate towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traffic feels too fast for a heavily populated area . <p> It seems strange to build a university on the roundabout of death , or force visitors to the city to cross a busy dual carriageway before they can walk from the railway station to the city centre . <p> To respond to the question posed by your headline : yellow lines please . <p> But not just yellow lines . Give us 20mph limits across the city . <p> the roundabout of death for 100m in all directions . <p> Introduce filtering to stop through-traffic using side streets and more pedestrianised areas . <p> Convert city centre car parks into useful buildings . Make Sheffield a pleasant city to live in as well as to drive through . 
 <h> Chris Wilder manager of Sheffield Utd . Pic David <p> Manager Chris Wilder wants his side to embrace the pressure of fighting for the League One title and has told them : " Play with a smile on your faces . " <p> United could be promoted tomorrow evening when they face Coventry at Bramall Lane - if they beat Mark Robins ' Checkatrade Trophy winners , and third-placed Fleetwood Town lose to one of Wilder 's former clubs , Oxford . <p> Either way , United hold a healthy 13-point lead over Fleetwood with six games of the League One season remaining , and only a disastrous run of results will prevent them from playing Championship football next season . <p> And Wilder , the boyhood Blades fan , said : " There 'll be a few tight games between now and the end of season , for a few clubs . But from our point of view , we 're enjoying the ride . <p> " I want the players to play with a smile on their face and a spring in their step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I look at our performance for 65 or 70 minutes against Millwall last week , and the players are really enjoying what 's happening here . <p> " Long may that continue . " <p> United prevailed 2-1 in the reverse fixture against Coventry back in December , when Billy Sharp added an 87th-minute winner in a game disrupted by home fan protests against their owners , Sisu.

I am also a member of the group , the Friends of Chapeltown Park , a member of The Thorncliffe Conservation Group and a member of the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust . <p> I am in total favour of this proposed service station , and along with many local residents think it will be beneficial to our area , as I have often stated before . <p> The writer says that <p> The Star should be impartial , ( in my view and many other peoples it is ) and the writer is really angry with them , publishing an eight-page pull-out on the plans submitted by the MSA Extra group . <p> Did n't the writer notice the two pages published in the Star on March 1 , giving the views of the groups campaigning against the proposed service station , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust , along with the other groups , have published lots of articles in their effort to get the proposed service station cancelled , as is their right . <p> The writer says that MSA Extra is not interested in the few part-time jobs it will create , only in making money , well surprise , surprise that 's what businesses endeavour to do , make money . <p> But the full impact of their investment and their proposals for the area , ( please read it all ) , is fantastic and will be massively beneficial to the area . <p> I do hope it receives the planning approval required .

 <h> Leader of Sheffield school in special measures aims for ' outstanding ' rating in turnaround <h> Pupils at Westfield School <h> Claire Lewis <h> A school placed in ' special measures ' has ' the recipe to be amazing ' , its new leader claimed today . <p> Ofsted today placed Westfield School in special measures , just over two weeks since head teacher Andy Ireland quit . <h> Pupils at Westfield School <p> Inspectors judged the overall effectiveness of the school as ' inadequate ' , with the leadership team found to have ' failed to improve the school sufficiently since the last inspection ' . <p> They concluded that the school is ' failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education ' . <p> But today , the new leader brought in to oversee the running of the school described it as being on the ' cusp of greatness ' and urged parents to have ' faith ' in it . <p> Interim head Roisin Paul , who also runs Silverdale School in Bents Green , which is in the top 20 state schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for places for their children , said progress has been made at Westfield over recent years , just not at the speed Ofsted wanted . <h> Pupils at Westfield School <p> She said extra revision lessons , including sessions over Easter , have been offered to students due to take their GCSEs next month and she hopes they will sit their exams ' well prepared , calm and confident ' . <p> Student monitoring at the school this year suggests that GCSE results this summer should be an improvement on last year 's . <p> Westfield School is in consultation over plans to become an academy as part of the Silverdale Multi-Academy Trust , which Mrs Paul said would bring advantages , with schools able to share expertise and drive up standards . <p> " The Trust involves a number of schools joining together and taking the best of these , growing that and sharing it across the organisation , " said Ms Paul . <p> " There is brilliance in every single school , and I genuinely believe that , even in what is deemed to be the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . " <p> Mrs Paul said it was the ' speed of change ' at Westfield School which concerned Ofsted inspectors , but she is confident of ' giving the school the push it deserves ' . <p> " It is so close , it just needs that push and drive , " she said . <p> " I think we can at least get a ' good ' in the next inspection but our aim is to push for outstanding and I do n't think we should stop at anything less . It has the recipe to be an amazing school . " <p> The interim head said she has been impressed with the school 's students , describing them as ' lovely , polite , courteous , friendly and curious ' and ' who want to do well for themselves ' . <p> She urged parents to ' hold firm ' and give the school chance to improve . <p> " Westfield School is about to enter into a really exciting time of development . It would be a knee-jerk reaction to take their children out now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take confidence in the reputation of Silverdale . Greatness is going to happen , " she added . <p> She said she would like more Westfield School students to enter into post 16 education . 
 <h> Doncaster Rovers : Injury update ahead of Mansfield Town clash <h> James Coppinger is unlikely to play in Rovers clash with Mansfield Town on Saturday <h> Liam Hoden <p> Veteran Doncaster Rovers midfielder James Coppinger is a major doubt for Saturday 's clash with Mansfield Town . <p> Coppinger missed last weekend 's 5-1 mauling of Grimsby Town with an ankle issue and boss Darren Ferguson is not confident he will be available this weekend , when Rovers can seal a return to League One . <p> Conor Grant is also facing a race to be fit after missing the Grimsby trip himself with a groin issue . 
 <h> The Ship At Bawtry , Gainsborough Road . <p> Split for dining and drinking , it is not for those seeking private conversation . We chatted to assistant manager Sue Cubbin as we perused the extensive blackboard menus . <p> My vegetarian friends were delighted to find a selection of five mains . But were then disappointed when the broccoli bake was off the menu . No matter , they chose a curry and Thai-style linguine , and I opted for Steak Diane . <p> To begin , we went for a ' tapas-style ' selection of three starters . Sadly the Brie offering was off the menu ( no Brie ) so the vegetarians were left with mushrooms in a creamy garlic sauce with bread , and wedges with dips , alongside my tempura prawns . <p> The mushrooms were savoured , smothered in a flavourful sauce , while a light crisp batter did justice to the prawns . The wedges looked overcooked but were , in fact , a pleasing blend of crispy and fluffy , with tasty dips . <p> It speaks for the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there is no skimping on portions . Friend Cate relished her aromatic linguine that was packed with flavour and vegetables . The curry was not quite hot and spicy enough for Ian but was still enjoyed , with rice and naan . <p> My steak Diane was deliciously tender . Its sauce was rich and tangy with the best mushy peas I 've had . Lovers of rustic fat chips would love Ship chips .... chunky , firm and golden brown . <p> A chocolatey but slightly dry fudge cake with ice cream for sweet , and we were stuffed ! At ? 55 for three including wine , beer and coffees this was great value for money . <p> Every table was taken that evening . Diners departed with happy faces , cheerful goodbyes and promises to be back soon . So this pub is definitely doing something right . 
 <h> Teaching profession under a lot of stress <h> Education <p> Re your article in The Star on Thursday , March 20 , entitled " MP supports action against teachers ' high workload " . Why , might I ask , was this particularly singled out to be only happening in Barnsley ? <p> I have both a daughter , ( an assistant head teacher ) , and a daughter-in-law , ( deputy head teacher ) , at primary schools in Rotherham . Their workload is exhausting . Not only are they full-time class teachers but their paperwork out of school hours is phenomenal . Neither of them arrives home from work until around 6pm each evening and are in school from 8am . <p> My daughter has two small children , aged five and seven , and is a very admirable mother . I simply wonder where she gains the stamina to do her job . She arrives home from school , feeds , baths and listens to them read before putting them to bed . When they are in bed out comes her laptop and she works on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed between 11.30pm and midnight . <p> My daughter-in-law , who is child-free , walks in from school around 5.30pm , has a cup of tea and opens up her laptop to continue her school work of planning and sending emails to her colleagues , etc. and does this until she retires to bed . She works non-stop through the weekend until it 's time for school on Monday . <p> They have very little life other than an annual holiday during the six-week summer holidays , more often than not only taking a week . They work all through the six- week holidays apart from that , in and out of school , cleaning classrooms and them for the new term . <p> They are both excellent teachers , know , help and encourage their pupils without any shadow of a doubt , both having been in the job well over 10 years . Their salaries are what I would call average compared with other public servant employees . <p> The whole teaching profession is under enormous stress , particularly with the cutbacks since the last budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts and no more than an average salary ? <p> Teachers need encouragement or salary increases to keep them in the job . They also need some respect from the Government . It 's not just Barnsley that needs a workload charter but the country as a whole . <p> If not , society must be prepared for teachers leaving the profession as a whole . <p> May I suggest that all our MPs and the teaching unions up and down the country take the Government to task and support their members , otherwise our children will not receive the education they deserve .

 <h> Sheffield heroin addicts jailed for burgling home of OAP while he was in the bathroom <h> Andrew Cross and Rebecca Kerrigan burgled the Crookes home of 87-year-old Harry Bennett while he was in the bathroom <h> Sarah Marshall <h> Two Sheffield heroin addicts , who burgled the home of an 87-year-old man while he was in the bathroom - even stopping so low as to steal his hearing aids , have been jailed . <p> During a sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court this morning , the court how on October 22 last year , 35-year-old Andrew Cross raided the home that Harry Bennett has lived in for 54 years . <p> As Harry went to use the bathroom at around 11am that morning Cross , along with Rebecca Kerrigan , aged 28 , broke into his house in Crookes . <p> Prosecuting , Zainab Alam , told the court : " When he came out of the bathroom he realised he had been burgled . <p> " He went into the bedroom and saw one of his wallets was on the floor . He went downstairs and realised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the items of Harry 's stolen by the pair was a television , bank cards , a driving license , two watches and his two hearing aids - which he had taken out shortly before the burglary took place . <p> The court heard how Cross and Kerrigan 's suspicious behaviour attracted the attention of people passing-by , who called the police in time for officers to be able to begin following the pair shortly after they attempted to flee the scene . <p> This led to a small pursuit , and to Cross , of Addy Close , Walkley eventually abandoning his vehicle , with a number of Harry 's possessions including the television and one of the watches still inside . <p> The money and hearing aids were not recovered . <p> In a victim impact statement , heartbroken Harry said : " I have lived in this house for 54 years and I am staggered that someone would come into my house and steal my belongings . <p> " I 'm particularly upset about a Sekonda watch that I was given by my friend Jane . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change the way I live my life , I will have to be more security conscious . " <p> In January this year , Recorder Fiona Davies sentenced Kerrigan to two years , four months and 26 days for her part in the the burglary as well as eight additional counts of theft . <p> During Kerrigan 's sentencing the court was told how she also suffered from an addiction to heroin . <p> The court heard how on January 15 this year Cross also raided another property in Crookes , along with Kirk Brunie , 35 , of HMP Moorlands . <p> Cross and Brunie entered the property shortly after one of the occupants went to bed at around 10pm through the back door , which had been left open for another occupant who was due to return later that evening . <p> The pair stole a number of items from the house including credit cards , which CCTV showed they then used to buy cigarettes at a nearby petrol station at 11.30pm - less than two hours after the property owner had gone to bed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty to one count of burglary and one count of handling stolen goods in relation to his involvement in the two burglaries , while Brunie , who is currently serving a 30-month prison sentence for his involvement in another burglary , admitted to one count of handling stolen goods . <p> Cross was also found not guilty of another count of burglary during today 's sentencing . <p> In mitigation , the court was told that Cross had become involved with people who took drugs , and had subsequently become addicted to heroin as a consequence of his association with them . <p> His Honour Robert Moore sentenced Cross to 40 months in prison , and added an additional six months to Brunie 's sentence . 
 <h> Thousands of Tesco jobs at risk <h> Jobs are at risk at Tesco <h> Claire Lewis <p> Thousands of Tesco jobs are at risk after the supermarket giant announced plans to cut back on night shifts and trading hours at its UK stores . <p> The supermarket said the move was part of ' further improvements ' to customer service . <p> Around 3,000 staff will be affected by the changes , which will see restocking shifts at 69 of its stores change from overnight to daytime hours , and trading hours at eight of its 24-hour stores cut back to 6am to midnight . <p> It will also merge different services desks , ' so that customers can get everything they need in one place ' . <p> A consultation will be launched over the coming weeks , and the supermarket expects the majority of staff will stay on with Tesco in some capacity . <p> The changes are expected to be introduced this summer . <p> Tesco 's UK chief executive Matt Davies said : " We 're committed to improving the way we serve our customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of UK stores with our colleagues . <p> " These changes will help us run these stores more simply and deliver the best possible service for customers . <p> " We appreciate these changes will impact the roles of some of our colleagues and we will work with them to ensure they are fully supported throughout this period . " <p> The Worksop store is one of eight 24-hour stores that will see opening times reduced . <p> It follows similar moves made last year , when Tesco reduced trading hours at 76 stores across the country , saying that reduced hours would help free up staff to restock shelves overnight . <p> Tesco is currently aiming to slash costs by ? 1.5 billion over the next three years to help boost margins and return the group to bottom-line profit growth . 
 <h> Sheffield United : Has the race to be crowned player of the year swung in John Fleck 's favour ? <h> Chris Wilder is a big fan of John Fleck : Robin <p> Goals will probably swing the voting in Billy Sharp 's favour but John Fleck is building a compelling case to be named Sheffield United 's player of the year . <p> The former Scotland under-21 international , whose strike against Coventry City in midweek helped edge Chris Wilder 's side to within touching distance of the Championship , has already been included on the EFL 's divisional shortlist following a series of scintillating displays for the League One leaders this term . <p> Nevertheless , despite commanding the respect of his peers , Fleck has been told his game still boasts a glaring imperfection which must be addressed before he becomes the complete midfielder . <p> " We ask the lads to get forward and , for me , Flecky and ( Paul Coutts ) should score more , " Wilder , the United manager , said . " They do a great job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , when they do get into the right positions , they should take more chances because they are so strong technically . " <p> Wilder 's decision to highlight the most obvious weakness in Fleck 's armoury should not be interpreted as a criticism . Rather , he is merely trying to ensure the 25-year-old fulfils his potential . Indeed , Wilder 's admiration for Fleck 's talents was underlined on Tuesday when , after watching United move 13 points clear of third place with only five matches remaining , he broke one of his golden rules : Never praise individual players . Sharp , who together with Scunthorpe 's Josh Morris completes the EFL 's three man shortlist , is one of the few squad members to also receive this honour . <p> " He 's been voted as one of the EFL top three players , " Wilder continued . " Every team that you come up against , they will always talk about John . Other players will always talk about John and , in that dressing room , his own team mates think a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice lad but sometimes , in training , we are having to reign him in because he is absolutely full tilt everytime he steps into the building , " Wilder added . " Be it at Shirecliffe , Bramall Lane or an away ground . " <p> Fleck , Sharp and Coutts are all expected to feature at Northampton Town tomorrow where United know a win will guarantee promotion , regardless of Fleetwood 's result against Oldham . <p> " It 's in our own hands and we could n't ask for anything more , " Wilder said . " The attitude of the players throughout has been superb . They 've just looked to keep driving it on and driving it on . For us , as coaching staff , to see how they are going about things in training gives us so much belief . " <p> Meanwhile , United have confirmed over 3,000 tickets have been sold for the live beamback of their game at Sixfields . Tickets for the event , which takes place at Bramall Lane , are priced ? 10 adults and ? 5 concessions and available via the box office . 
 <h> Sheffield wins share of ? 24 million for new heating system <h> Sheffield <h> Claire Lewis <p> Sheffield is one of nine councils to win a share of ? 24 million for heat network schemes that act as ' central heating for cities ' , the Government has announced . <p> The money is the first round of funding from a ? 320 million pot to support district heating schemes which can provide cleaner and cheaper heat and hot water to homes and businesses . <p> In Sheffield the cash woll be used to generate heat from waste to be pumped into homes and businesses across the city . <p> District heat networks are seen as a way of decarbonising UK heating system by removing the need for homes and commercial buildings to have their own boilers by linking them to one single heat source . <p> The heat can come from combined heat and power plants , which capture and use the heat generated from burning fuel to produce electricity , as well as biomass boilers , incinerating rubbish or using geothermal energy from deep underground . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network to provide hot water and heating . <p> Heat networks have the potential to reduce heating costs in some cases by more than 30 per cent , the Department for Business , Energy and Industrial Strategy said . <p> Climate change and industry minister Nick Hurd said : " This Government is committed to ensuring a clean , secure and affordable energy supply for communities and businesses across the country . <p> " Energy innovations like heat networks can cut costs for households and reduce carbon emissions , as almost half of the energy we use goes towards heating our homes and buildings . <p> " The ? 24 million in Government funding awarded to these projects will help deliver low carbon energy at competitive prices for local consumers .

" I was gutted at the way he pointedly ignored every word I said as though I were invisible . <p> On several occasions at Barker 's Pool I have had incidents which have left me quite scared by the treatment received from taxi drivers of hackney cabs . <p> Development officer for Disability Sheffield , Kathryn Littlewood , knows exactly what it is like for disabled people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be if you enjoy swimming as there are no less than around 14 swimming pools in the city we are very lucky to have these . <h> Sheffield Voices piece in Sheffield Telegraph Grace <p> Places like Graves Leisure Centre with its newly built swimming pool and also its fitness facilitates showcase just exactly what outstanding physical accessibility looks like . <p> I know that most gyms are accessible , but access to swimming pools tends to be a bit hit-and-miss with only a few having hoists . <p> Also , with some leisure facilities there is only access to certain parts of the building and these are usually the parts that are not wheelchair-accessible and they tend to be the best parts like the sauna and the steam room . <p> Being disabled and having a mental health problem means that exercise is a vital part of staying fit and well but sadly , even with the physical accessibility of quite a few of the gyms , the actual times that they open can be a real barrier to a lot of people . <p> Peer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . <p> She said that one of the main ways in which autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , or ADHD , affects her was with developmental and sensory issues . <p> She added , I found that on growing up , getting older , I did not identify with the usual interests and feelings of most teenagers and adults that I came in contact with and I was devastated when the activities I loved were no longer accessible to me , such as bouncy castles and going to adventure play areas , <p> However , I feel that I am very fortunate in many ways , as I have an insight into my autism . <p> I feel that a lot of the reason that my communication , insight and emotional well-being has improved over the years is because I managed to access the play that I needed . <p> That has included at Concord Sports Centre and play has included imagination , role-playing and secret agent games , which she can now use in real-life situations .

 <h> Analysis : Job done - and this could just be the start of the Doncaster Rovers revival <h> Rovers players celebrate securing promotion <h> Paul Goodwin <p> That was the story on Saturday as Doncaster Rovers dealt with another plucky , but somewhat limited , side in Mansfield Town to seal their instant return to League One and spark scenes of wild celebration at the Keepmoat Stadium . <h> Darren Ferguson and John Marquis <p> And that has been the story of a memorable season really . Oh how that opening day defeat at Accrington Stanley now feels like an eternity ago . <p> For Darren Ferguson has since moulded a team and squad that has grown in confidence , stature and unity as the campaign has wore on - and in all likelihood will now end in winning the League Two crown . <p> But while their achievement this term should not be downplayed - and you only have to look at the problems Portsmouth have had getting out of this league to put Rovers ' promotion into some sort of context - the really exciting thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start . <p> The majority of this Rovers squad have this season played at a level at least one below par . <h> Mansfield keeper Jake Kean ca n't keep out Tommy Rowe 's header <p> In some cases , like Tommy Rowe , you could argue two . <p> But united by the club 's ambition to really kick on , and also driven on by the unrelenting Ferguson , they are a group who firmly believe they have what it takes to challenge for promotion again next season in the next league up . <p> And who would bet against it ? <p> Ferguson has form for back-to-back promotions . <h> Tommy Rowe <p> A strong spine , and a good mix of youth and experience , means the Scot can concentrate on adding quality rather than quantity over the summer . <p> So with momentum now very much on their side , which is a far cry from when Ferguson first arrived at the club 18 months ago , this could just be the beginning of the Rovers revival . <p> THAT WINNING HABIT <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rovers were far from at their best against the hard-working Stags . <p> They had the better of the first half opportunities as John Marquis and Andy Williams both wasted good headed chances and Rowe spurned a clear opening after being picked out by the excellent Luke McCullough . <p> Mansfield were well organised and made life difficult , but they sat deeper as the game wore on and seemed content with a point . <p> The introduction of James Coppinger and Alfie May swung the pendulum in the hosts ' favour , though , and it was from Coppinger 's left wing corner which Rowe rose superbly at the near post to guide a header into the far corner . <p> Rovers had been far from fluent - and had to survive a late Stags onslaught - but yet again they had found a way of winning . Yet again their extra quality told in the end . <p> THE KEY FACTORS <p> Promotion has been a proper team effort . Everyone has played their part , on the pitch and off it . <p> The seeds were sown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated promotion on the Keepmoat pitch while Rovers reflected on a sorry campaign . Ferguson 's message in the dressing room that day was clear - ' make sure we 're the ones celebrating this time next year ' . <p> From that point the club has been proactive and professional in achieving its very clear objective . <p> Transfer business was done nice and early for a change . And the recruitment was excellent . <p> Loan signings no longer arrived to simply prop up the squad but offered genuine quality . <p> And there was no resting on laurels in January either when Ian Lawlor , Conor Grant and Alfie May arrived as reinforcements . <p> The manager 's unrelenting desire for high standards has been key . He 's got the big decisions right . <p> And his players have done him proud . They 've shown character , quality and togetherness in abundance . 
 <h> They 're up ! An ecstatic end to six years of pain for sensational Sheffield United - Northampton Town 1 Blades 2 <h> Leon Clarke and Kieron Freeman celebrate with a United fans after the striker 's equalising goal <p> Billy Sharp was ecstatic , Kieron Freeman danced around like a maniac and Chris Wilder , whose leadership has proven so inspiring this season , looked thoroughly exhausted by the sheer emotion of it all . <p> After 239 games , nearly 300 weeks and six years of pain , frustration and hurt , Sheffield United are back in the Championship . Following , midfielder Paul Coutts acknowledged , yet another performance laced with the fighting spirit and finesse which has made them such a force to be reckoned with in League One . <h> Leon Clarke of Sheffield Utd celebrates his goal <p> " The biggest thing about this team is exactly that , it 's a team , " he said , after United established an unassailable lead over third-placed Fleetwood . " We dig in for each other , we fight and we help each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the whole group , including all the members of staff . " <p> Nine points clear at the top of the table and 16 ahead of Uwe Rosler 's side with only four fixtures left , United have achieved promotion in style and with matches to spare . But as Coutts admitted , nothing comes easy in a division they have spent far too long trying to escape . Northampton Town , who lifted the League Two title under Wilder 's stewardship last term , threatened to deny them the victory which would have guaranteed a top two finish when Marc Richards scored on the stroke of half-time . Rather than crumble , however , that set-back provoked the type of cold-hearted response which epitomises the visitors ' outlook and , when John Fleck scored after Leon Clarke 's equaliser , contrasted starkly with the chaotic scenes inside Sixfields stadium . <p> " It 's unbelievable , " Coutts , who started his professional career with Peterborough , continued . " It 's the second time I 've had a promotion and the last one was my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really take that one in but that 's certainly not going to happen with this one . No way whatsoever . I 'll be soaking it all up . " <h> Sheffield United 's Chris Basham celebrates promotion with supporters after the final whistle <p> " It was pretty special at the end , I was other in the corner with Sharpy ( Billy Sharp ) and you could see there was going to be a stampede . <p> We 'll enjoy the moment but then it 's back to work because we 've still got a title to try and win . " <p> a winning machine <p> Winning is something United have made a habit of this season ; losing only three times since the end of August . It is a remarkable record of success which illustrates both the ruthlessness of their play and , following Wilder 's appointment 11 months ago , unwavering commitment to attacking football . " Chalk and cheese , " Coutts admitted , to the squad he inherited after being appointed in May . <h> Chris Wilder manager of Sheffield Utd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sixfields . Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> " From where we were as a group when he came in to today is unbelievable . All credit to him , he 's done a great job . <p> " Last season was quite low , personally , in my career . Being involved in a group , at this size of club , that struggled just did n't sit right . It did n't sit right with anyone really . <p> " I would have been bitterly disappointed if that had been my last season here . So to get a chance from the gaffer to put that right means everything . <p> " It 's taken longer than I 'd hoped or anyone else would have hoped for that matter . But this is what it 's all about . It 's what we play for and hopefully we 've got this club back to somewhere near where it belongs . " <p> Captained and managed by supporters and co-owned by another lifelong fan , little wonder Wilder insists United are " a truly special club . " Although emotion has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tears as , held aloft following the final whistle , he furiously beat the armband on his left bicep - there is more to their achievements than simply pride and passion . Fleck , on target for the second time in as many outings , has been magnificent and , like Coutts , is among a clutch of squad members capable of performing a level above . Nor is Wilder , or his assistant Alan Knill for that matter , afraid of taking big decisions ; something they demonstrated here by naming Sharp , James Hanson and Mark Duffy on the bench . <p> " He 's just got us together and working hard , " Coutts , asked about the ' Wilder Effect ' , said . " It 's hard to explain . It 's just clicked . It 's not come easy because we 've worked so hard from day one . But he 's drilled that into us and the togetherness has come . To think where this club was last season , it 's been an unbelievable 12 months and all credit to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding club with demanding fans , " Coutts added . " We get an unbelievable following at home and away . They demand a lot and he demands a lot too . He did it at this club ( Northampton ) last season as well so there 's obviously more to it than just being a fan . But , without a shadow of a doubt , I do think that 's helped him galvanise the whole place . Everybody , on the pitch and off it as well , is pulling in the same direction and on the same page . " <p> it 's all about the group <p> Wilder has made no secret of the fact that squads , not individuals , are the key to success . So it was fitting that Clarke , whose campaign was nearly hijacked by injury , scored one of the goals which helped them across the line . Wilder 's faith in the centre-forward has been questioned at times this term . But the finish , which left the excellent Adam Smith grasping at thin air , oozed composure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome of this game an irrelevance , Coutts said : " No we did n't know the other scores . It was about us , we were n't really worried about what was going on elsewhere . We just had to get our heads down and do the job .

 <p> Jonjo Shelvey bagged a late consolation for second-placed Newcastle United but the Owls deservedly held on to clinch back-to-back Championship wins . <p> Wallace said : " It was a big win , but it was more the performance . I thought we were outstanding . I thought the strikers , Fletcher and Hoops and Jordan when he came on were great and Hoops looked more like himself . <p> " All around , it was a good performance . We defended well and defensively , we have been outstanding since I have been here . " <p> Wide man Wallace , who whipped in the free-kick for Lees ' opener , declared it their " best " performance of the season . <h> GOAL .... A leap into the play offs for the Owls and scorer Steven Fletcher ..... Pic Steve Ellis <p> " It was the best we have played and it has come at a really good time , " he said . " That will give us something to build . If we put performances like that , the rest will just take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and we are starting to find a bit of form . But we knew that we have players coming back . Hooper is such a big player for us and was outstanding and he makes other people play better around him as well . " <p> With five matches left , the Owls remain two points clear of Fulham , who they welcome to Hillsborough on the final day . <p> Wallace stressed : " We are not thinking about play-offs yet . There 's still loads of points to play for . 
 <h> Glenn Loovens <p> Captain Glenn Loovens is adamant Sheffield Wednesday can handle the pressure of the Championship promotion run-in . <p> The Owls boosted their prospects of finishing in the play-off positions for the second year running by defeating second-placed Newcastle United last weekend . <h> Carlos Carvalhal <p> Carlos Carvalhal 's men head into their last five matches lying in sixth position , boasting a two-point advantage over nearest rivals Fulham . <p> Wednesday fell at the final hurdle last season but Loovens believes the painful loss at Wembley has made the team stronger . <p> The centre-back said : " We have a very experienced team . We have been through this before and I am sure we can cope better with it . <p> " It is always better to be in the play-off places but we can not look too far ahead . We take it game by game and do not lose focus by looking too far ahead . " <p> Loovens , withdrawn at half-time against Newcastle due to a long-standing abductor injury , added : " We put pressure on ourselves because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a rough spell , the challenge is simply to do better . <p> " This is pressure we put on ourselves by doing so well . " <p> The Dutchman has praised the job Carvalhal , pictured inset , has done in turning the Owls into serious promotion candidates . <p> He said : " We have faith in him and he has faith in us . Carlos always says he has faith in every single player in the squad ; they are all his choice of player and he goes through a brick wall for us and we do the same for him . So it is vital that we stay together , not only as a group of players , but as management as well . And at the end of the day , we have to do it together . " <p> Speaking after their impressive 2-1 win against Newcastle , head coach Carvalhal revealed Loovens played through the pain barrier in the opening 45 minutes . <p> " Glenn felt an old pain in his abductor , " he said . " He felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic professional and captain and played the first half . <p> " He could n't do more so we put Vincent Sasso on . Sasso trained very well and we had a lot of confidence him . " <p> Carvalhal hopes Loovens will shake off the problem in time for Friday 's clash with Cardiff City . 
 <h> Snooker : Barry Hearn tells Ronnie O'Sullivan to grow up ahead of World Championships at Crucible <h> Ronnie OSullivan , right , has been told to grow up by World Snooker chief Barry Hearn <p> Barry Hearn , the chairman of World Snooker , has risked igniting a row with arguably the sport 's biggest name on the eve of the World Championship by telling Ronnie O'Sullivan : It 's time to grow up . <p> O'Sullivan , the five-time Crucible champion , has staged a two-month protest against what he perceives as harsh treatment by the game 's governing body . <p> The 41-year-old was disciplined after he criticised referee Terry Camilleri at the Masters in January , and then swore at a cameraman . <p> Since , O'Sullivan has responded to most questions from the media with one-word answers , replied in a monotone , robotic voice to others and , at the Welsh Open last month , even started singing Oasis 's Wonderwall in response to questions from the BBC . <p> And , speaking ahead of the sport 's biggest event - which kicks off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be having a word . Ronnie 's monosyllabic remarks are not a breach of the rules but certainly they are a breach of the spirit of how those rules are interpreted . <p> " And I would hope that common sense comes back , because what started off as being quite amusing has now become in my view embarrassing for everyone , including Ronnie . <p> " I 'm a fan of the relationship between the players and the press . It 's time for Ronnie to grow up a little bit now . " <p> O'Sullivan , who set the record for the sport 's fastest 147 at the Crucible in 1997 when he cleared the table in five minutes and 20 seconds , won his fifth world crown in 2013 and has since finished runner-up to Mark Selby in 2014 . <p> He went out in the second round last year , but remains one of the game 's biggest names all around the world . <p> Meanwhile , Jimmy White is hoping snooker chiefs hand him a career lifeline with a tour wild card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour at the end of the season after falling in the first round of World Championship qualifying . <p> He lost 10-7 to Jack Lisowski on Friday , and faces a wait to learn whether he could have a helping hand back onto the circuit . <p> Two-year cards were offered to Steve Davis , Stephen Hendry and James Wattana in 2014 , and supporters of White will be hoping the same applies to the six-time World Championship runner-up . 
 <h> Interview with Richard Blackledge : Looking to the future of Sheffield 's shopping institution <h> John Lewis Sheffield 's head of branch , Tom Holmes , for a Star Interview spread . <h> Richard Blackledge <p> " I love the fact that people still call it Cole Brothers , " says Tom Holmes , surrounded by customers sitting down for elevenses in the caf ? at Sheffield 's John Lewis store . <p> " Why should people stop calling it that ? My parents used to bring me here as a child on a Saturday morning to have my shoes fitted . The shop is an institution in Sheffield . " <h> John Lewis Sheffield 's head of branch , Tom Holmes , for a Star Interview spread . <p> And Tom should know . Brought up in Richmond and a former pupil at City School , he joined John Lewis as an 18-year-old following A-levels at Sheffield College , and rose through the ranks to become head of branch in his home city . <p> In charge of almost 430 John Lewis ' partners ' -- staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is owned by its workers -- Tom is well aware of the Sheffield department store 's heritage as Cole Brothers , a name that dates back to 1847 and was retired in favour of a rebrand 15 years ago . <p> He has taken on his role at a time of great change . Yards away from the Barker 's Pool store , the old Grosvenor House Hotel has been pulled down and work is beginning on the first phase of the city 's ? 480 million new retail quarter posing the vexed question of where John Lewis sits within the development , and whether it will move into a modern replacement for its Barker 's Pool premises , built in the early 1960s . <p> Tom is also answerable to John Lewis ' new managing director Paula Nickolds , who started in January and has warned of potential job cuts amid the need to cut costs . Profits across the group , with its famous ' never knowingly undersold ' price promise , fell 31 per cent to ? 32 million in the first half of this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing preference for online shopping . <h> John Lewis Sheffield 's head of branch , Tom Holmes , for a Star Interview spread . <p> However , he is a firm believer in the need to retain physical stores on the high street , and thinks that browsing products on the internet will never wholly supplant the experience of a shopping trip . <p> " The online business has grown phenomenally , but at John Lewis we believe in both , " says Tom brightly . <p> " You still want to walk around a shop , you want to be able to fulfil your purchase in a store to see , touch , feel -- but you might complete your purchase online . <p> " Who knows what 's going to happen in retail in five or 10 years ? " <h> John Lewis Sheffield 's head of branch , Tom Holmes , for a Star Interview spread . <p> Tom , aged 35 , started at John Lewis under an A-level training programme " I guess today we 'd call it an apprentice scheme " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the Sheffield branch . He stayed for 10 years , enrolled on a leadership scheme , and went to Nottingham to become an operations manager . <p> A spell at the then-brand-new store at Liverpool One followed , before Tom ' headed into the world of head office ' in London for two years . <p> " I was responsible for driving sales from shops as low south as Nottingham , all the way up to Aberdeen . <p> " I never went to university that was n't really what happened when I was of that age group , and from my background . I 've always been more entrepreneurial go into work , learn , on the job . " <h> John Lewis Sheffield 's head of branch , Tom Holmes , for a Star Interview spread . <p> Tom succeeded James Prince , who left to open the new Leeds branch last year , as boss in Sheffield last August . <p> " Sheffield gives me this incredible work-life balance it 's a brilliant place to bring up your family , " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is married to Sarah , 38 , a teaching assistant at the Rowan School in Dore . Together they have two children -- son Charlie , four , and daughter Evie , seven . <p> " I 'm five minutes away from the Peak District , and 15 minutes away from a city centre that for me is the most buoyant I 've ever seen it . " <p> Like his predecessor , Tom is a board member of the Business Improvement District , an initiative funded by companies to boost the city centre . <p> Talks are ongoing between John Lewis , the council and its development partner Queensberry about a potential new store in Sheffield , but Tom firmly denies that the retailer has held up the city centre 's redevelopment . <p> " That 's not the case . John Lewis , like all other retailers , will be keen to see what has been produced by Queensberry . We 've always said we will be actively working with Sheffield City Council and Queensberry to bring this to life . <p> " The developer needs to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like . The decisions about the retail quarter sit with Queensberry and the council of course , John Lewis is a stakeholder in that . And there are active conversations between all parties , which is a positive sign . At least we are making some progress . <p> " But the people of Sheffield want to see a change in the space . " <p> He adds : " It would be wonderful to be running a business unit of a new retail quarter . But actually , it would make no difference , because I 'm doing it and believing in it today . This shop 's here . What 's really important for me is that people continue to come into the city centre . " <p> But , addressing the prospect of a new store , Tom admits : " It would be pretty cool , would n't it . A new generation store for the people who already shop with us , opening up to new people as well . " <p> Encouragingly , it is understood that custom has not drained away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagant , architect-designed building featuring a beauty spa , coffee department , a specific Yorkshire focus to the stock and other novelties . <p> " I see John Lewis as a brand it does n't matter where people shop . But people like Sheffield . There 's an affinity with the shop , we 're really proud of it . Leeds is 30 miles up . " <p> Tom appears relaxed about Meadowhall , despite worries elsewhere over the impact of its proposed ? 300 million extension , saying the mall ' creates jobs and a lot of economic activity ' . <p> " It 's just part of our landscape now , and that 's fine . It 's a different retail offer , out of town . " <p> And he says the improvements on The Moor ' should be applauded ' . <p> " I get excited about thinking what the future of Sheffield should look like . What it needs is more people to see that , and believe in it . It 's too costly to make the wrong decisions . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop floor in Barker 's Pool " You ca n't do this job from an office " where 14 years is the average length of service for employees , who enjoy generous pensions and an annual bonus . <p> " I 've got partners that have worked here for almost 50 years . I know pretty much every one by name . I always remember someone saying to me ' Bargains start at Cole Brothers ' , and I used to think ' That 's the first place to go , because I know they 'll look after me and I know I 'll get value for money ' . That 's always stuck with me . " <p> ' Why we need the top brands ' <p> Tom Holmes says Sheffield city centre is ' on the move ' and the development of the Cavendish Building the initial stage of the new retail quarter is ' game-changing ' . <p> " City centres are not just about retail any more . You need to have a much more holistic approach . <p> " To thrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have developed their centres . This is the advantage of coming to it later than others . " <p> He thinks the ' gold route ' for pedestrians , which starts at the railway station , goes up Howard Street and continues onwards , is ' very impressive ' . <p> " I say to people ' Look at the potential of this city ' . I walk visitors up through the station , Sheffield Hallam University , the Winter Garden , the Peace Gardens , do a right turn and show them the Crucible , and I say to them : ' Our next step is retail . ' <p> " We 've got John Lewis here , we 've got a healthy high street , but when you compare that against other high streets , and brands that are in other cities at the moment , they 're not here , and we want those brands here in Sheffield .

 <h> Chesterfield v Middlesborough 1997 FA cup semi final . <h> Graham Smyth <p> Sean Dyche might not get misty eyed when he talks about his playing days but the gruff Premier League boss does admit to a soft spot for Chesterfield FC . <p> Burnley 's manager is very much about the here and now and prefers to learn and move on than ' overthink ' and dwell on the past . <p> He did , however , indulge in a little Chesterfield nostalgia the last time he got a chance . <p> And his fondness for the Spireites stems from them making him a man . <p> " I 'm not too emotional about my ex clubs because I worked hard at all of them and then moved forward , " said the 45-year-old . <p> " But I must say , Chesterfield is slightly different because I went there as a boy and I left as a man . <p> " Literally in years and also in football experience . " <p> It 's 20 years since Dyche captained Town to an FA Cup semi-final , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue famously drew 3-3 with Premier League Middlesbrough . <p> That remarkable achievement is just part of his story however . <p> " I met my now-wife and we lived in Chesterfield for a couple of years , " he said . <p> " I had a real tough time with injuries but people had always stood by me . <p> " Although I do n't overthink my past there is a connection there because it meant so much . <p> " I was really pleased , I 've now got children and when we played them in pre-season last year I actually stayed up and took my kids , we stayed in a hotel and drove round to our old house , gave them a little look around the town . <p> " Even though they 're looking around quite bemused , it was like going down memory lane for me . <p> " Lots of fond memories of my time on off the pitch , still a bit of a soft spot . " <p> Dyche was part of a tight-knit Spireites outfit and despite leaving the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he worked for and those he captained . <p> " I had a real connection with the management team , " he said . <p> " I 'm still connected to them this day , myself and John Duncan , Kev Randall still does some scouting for me now . <p> " Dave Rushbury was such a character as a physio , Jamie Hewitt , Lee Rogers , Tony Lormer , I could name them all . <p> " Tommy Curtis I saw just the other week , Darren Carr is still a friend of mine , Nicky Law is now one of our scouts at Burnley , still good connections from a fantastic time . " <p> It was n't all plain sailing for Dyche and his gaffer , after a rocky start . <p> But the relationship that blossomed continues to bear fruit for the man who led Burnley to a Championship title last season . <p> " Funnily enough my first season under John we did n't really get on , we did n't see eye to eye on what he wanted from me , his and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Not in an undermining way , we just did n't see eye to eye . <p> " I remember getting injured and he really stood by me and helped me out with a contract situation because Norton Lea was n't always the easiest person to deal with let 's say . <p> " I remember thinking he 's done right by me . I started that pre-season , got fit and played well and things started to turn for myself , the team and my connect to John and Kev . <p> " Now John is someone I still bounce ideas off , I 've learned a heck of a lot from the pair of them . <p> " I did n't know it so much at the time but as my career has gone on I 've learned some real strong lessons from the two of them and helped form some of the opinions I 've got about the game today .

 <h> Professor 's tour of ' forgotten ' library <h> Tall Unlikely Tales at Sheffield Central Library <p> Tall tales , ridiculous revelations and amazing anecdotes are all on the menu of a new ' alternative ' city tour . <p> Tall Unlikely Tales will take visitors behind the scenes of Sheffield Central Library later this month , delving into darkened corners and sneaking into forgotten library stacks . <p> The tour , which will be led by ' Professor Horace Cope ' on April 27 , forms part of the Sheffield Library Multi-Story Festival , which will see a whole host of events taking place throughout April to celebrate the vibrancy and diversity of Sheffield 's public libraries . <p> A spokesman for Sheffield Libraries said : " Join us for a journey into the deepest and darkest depths and recesses of the library and see parts of the building usually unseen by the public . <p> " The tour involves climbing many steps , passes through confined spaces and areas of low light level , for which we will provide torches , so will be unsuitable for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to wear sturdy footwear . " <p> Paul Casson-Yardley , artistic director of Sheffield 's Cry Havoc ! Theatre Company , who will play the part of Professor Horace Cope , said : " Sheffield Central Library is such a beautiful art deco building that I 've known all my life and I feel honoured to be leading this tour . In its time , it 's been a music hall and a hospital , so we 're planning to include a smattering of history , a soupcon of suspense and a large dollop of hogwash in the event . We are delighted to have a chance to celebrate and enjoy this fantastic building , and we hope that our guests will enjoy exploring spaces that are not usually accessible to the public , deep down in the depths of the library stack !

 <h> Kevin Gage 's Blades Column : All hail Chris Wilder and his team of Sheffield United ' bottlers ' after promotion to the Championship <h> Kevin Gage Column <p> There 's not a cloud in the sky and the even the birds seem to be chirping a bit louder than usual , with the one sporting a red-breast singing the loudest ! After a monumental day , Blades all over the world have gone to bed last night with happy smiling faces , and although a few heads might be a bit sore this morning , we would n't have it any other way ! <h> United 's promotion celebrations <p> We did it ! We finally did it . But most of all , he did it . Chris Wilder did it . He did what others over the past decade or so have so miserably failed to do ... he bottled it . And his team did too . And its bloody wonderful ! And before you think I 've gone stark raving bonkers , let me explain ... <p> Sheffield United . The serial ' bottlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the big occasions ? The club that leads its supporters up the garden path that always ends in a dead-end and disappointment ? No more . Those days are over . And they were over on that day back in May last year when the club appointed Chris Wilder . <p> Sheffield United needed a Chris Wilder . It needed ' one of our own ' . It needed a manager to lift this club up from the League One mid-table mediocrity it had sunk to , and with his managerial track record and his red and white roots , Chris was the perfect choice . He instinctively knew what Sheffield United was all about , and he 'd actually known all his adult life . <p> He knew that the fans needed to be given their belief back , and he needed to tap into the huge groundswell of support , love and passion out there for this special club . He knew that if he could somehow ' bottle ' these feelings , and then give the players just a taste of what might be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a recipe for success . <h> Chris Basham leads promotion celebrations <p> And WOW , how he did it ! He somehow bottled it . The emotions of 25,000+ home fans , and tens , maybe hundreds of thousands of other Blades over all parts of the globe were brought together and were all fully behind him and his team , on and off the pitch , driving them forward and upward . We finally had a manager we could relate to , that talked our language and we believed in , and most importantly , the players totally believed in him too . <p> We found out to our cost last season that talk is cheap , and Chris proved that the phrase " actions speak louder than words " is so very true . Running half the length of the pitch at Fleetwood to join fans celebrating our last minute equaliser ? Thumping the badge on his chest after victories ? Diving onto the grass to celebrate goals with players ? Instinctive , heart-felt emotion and elation from a real leader which by his very nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a winning formula and a recipe for success . If he could , literally , ' bottle it ' , he 'd be a multi-millionaire ! <p> Raw emotion and passion is of course all well and good , but successful teams need much more than just that . They need talent . They need ability . They need technique , skill , athleticism and many other physical attributes . It 's a balancing act and a mix that needs constantly monitoring and adjusting . In our squad of players from last season we already had some players with all the above requirements , even though they maybe did n't realise just how good they could become . <p> Our new management team also had the experience and the expertise to know where to find the new players we needed . They knew who to get , and why they were needed . We recruited the right players at the right time , and we also dispensed with some players who were n't required and maybe did n't quite fit into the new mix . Three young squad players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst the club sometimes is accused of ' cashing in ' on our young talent , in this case , in this season , it was money well made . <p> So the squad was formed , the standards were set , the belief was instilled , and the confidence restored . The result of all this groundwork was that the talent duly flourished , and the cream rose to the top ... and we 've stayed there for the past three months . <p> All in all , it 's been an absolutely resounding triumph of a season , and it has n't even ended yet ! Four games still to go , a potential 100 points to get and a League champions title to claim . It 'll be difficult to top Saturday 's events , but this season could actually get even better . Even if it does n't , who cares ?

 <h> David Wildgoose , whose uncle Derek Naylor died after being exposed to asbestos at work <h> Robert Cumber <p> The family of a Sheffield labourer who died after being exposed to asbestos have been awarded compensation . <p> Derek Naylor died aged 77 of mesothelioma , an incurable cancer often caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres . <p> He worked as a general labourer on building sites in Sheffield during the 1960s , often alongside joiners sawing asbestos boards and listeners mixing powdered coatings containing the deadly substance . <p> He would then sweep up the debris , generating clouds of toxic dust which he breathed in . <p> He was only diagnosed with mesothelioma after his death in 2012 , having suffered from increasing breathing difficulties and chest pains in his later years . <p> His family were initially told by lawyers they had no grounds for a claim . <p> But John Das , a specially accredited asbestos solicitor from Dedicated Accident Solicitors ( DAS ) , agreed to take on their case , securing what the firm described as a ' substantial ' amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " We felt like we got what the family deserved , after all we 've been through . <p> " The compensation that we received helped the family greatly .

" <p> Asbestos is the largest killer of workmen in the UK , according to DAS , causing twice as many deaths each year as road accidents . <p> The use of asbestos is now banned in this country , but the symptoms of mesothelioma and other diseases caused by the toxin often take years to show , and it continues to claim lives . <p> Mr Das said he was keen to raise awareness among other families after helping Derek 's relatives . <p> " The family initially faced an uphill struggle , because they were turned away by a firm of national solicitors , " he said . <p> " However , they tell me that the compensation they have received , since we took over the case , has enabled them to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were awarded compensation after making a claim against Derek 's former employers JW Sivil and P Hassall ( now MCA Yorkshire ) . <p> DAS said the case was settled in 2015 by P Hassall 's employment liability insurers Zurich and it was not known whether the insurer had then pursued Sivils for a contribution .

Comfortable on the ball and gets forward a lot . He 's a great outlet for Fulham . <p> Midfielders <p> Matt Ritchie . He 's had a great season for Newcastle , scoring and creating goals . A player . Also got great banter . Told me to take off my classic Adidas Copa boots up at St James ' Park earlier in the season . <p> Dale Stephens . I played with him at Charlton and he is a brilliant talent . This lad has everything . He can pass , score and tackle . He 's very athletic and can get around the pitch with ease .

 <h> ' Serious concerns ' raised about performance of South Yorkshire Police <h> South Yorkshire Police headquarters <h> Claire Lewis <h> Serious concerns have been raised about the performance of South Yorkshire Police following a series of inspections . <p> The force has been judged as requiring improvement in its effectiveness , efficiency and legitimacy in fighting crime and keeping people safe . <p> In an annual report , published by Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Constabulary , Inspector Michael Cunningham said he has ' serious concerns about the overall performance ' of the force based on inspections last year . <p> He raised concerns about the force 's approach to ' preventing crime and tackling anti-social behaviour ' and said changes to its neighbourhood policing model last year had ' weakened its ability to tackle the threats facing the people of South Yorkshire effectively ' , pointing out that staff were regularly taken away from preventative neighbourhood work to cover more reactive duties . <p> Mr Cunningham said he is pleased with progress made by the force in how it keeps vulnerable people safe , but said further improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at identifying signs of vulnerability and consistent in how it handles calls reporting incidents involving domestic abuse . But labelled the quality of risk assessments made at the scene of domestic abuse incidents as ' poor ' , which he said affected decisions about safeguarding victims and referring them to other services . <p> He said he was pleased with South Yorkshire Police 's approach to tackling serious and organised crime , pointing out that the force has good processes for gathering intelligence and mapping organised crime groups , and that it prioritises and tackles organised crime effectively . <p> But the inspector said the force has ' a very limited understanding ' of the current and likely future demands for its services and urged it to work more closely with other services . <p> He said : " The force 's current operating model was built on this limited understanding of the demands for its services , and that this has contributed to the inconsistent service the force is providing to the people of South Yorkshire . <p> " The force has taken some steps to understand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working practices , but it needs to extend this work to its other practices . <p> " I am also concerned that the force does not have a comprehensive workforce plan , and that its understanding of its workforce 's capability and capacity is poor . This compromises the force 's understanding of the costs of providing its services and its ability to match resources to demand . <p> " In view of the findings in this assessment , I have been in regular contact with the new chief constable who understands the challenges facing the force . I do not underestimate how much improvement is needed for the force , led by its new chief officer team , to provide a consistently good service to the people of South Yorkshire . " 
 <h> Video : Sheffield boxing MBE legends re-united after quarter of a century <h> Bob Westerdale <p> An awkward 24-year silence between Sheffield boxing 's two MBE recipients has ended . <p> Former boxer turned trainer Glyn Rhodes made an emotional return to meet Brendan Ingle at the veteran 's famous gym . <p> The two had been virtually estranged for almost a quarter of a century since Rhodes retired from the ring in 1993 , setting up his own gym five miles away in Hillsborough . They 'd never spoken during that time . <p> But the pair put any rivalries aside to have a good natter about " the good old days . " <p> The re-union , organised by mutual friend and Ingle trainer Amer Khan , was an emotional experience for many who witnessed it , including world champion Kell Brook . <p> Rhodes explained that from 1976 : " I spent almost every day there . I had 65 fights 30 amateur fights , so I spent a big part of my life from 16 years old there . <h> Glyn Rhodes back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kind of go your own way . I started my gym ( Sheffield Boxing Centre ) in 1994 , and I 'd never been back since . <p> " A lot of the things I do now are what Brendan taught me . He was a big figure in my life . <p> " Although you are in the same game , the same circles , you never actually sit down and chat to each other . Which is really sad . <p> " It seemed only right , somewhere down the line that I should go back to my roots . A lot of water has gone under the bridge for both of us . Everything I have done since I was 16 to today is boxing . So I owe Brendan a lot for that . " <h> Glyn Rhodes and Brendan Ingle <p> Rhodes said entering the doors at St Thomas ' gym was " strange , a bit surreal . " It sent a shiver down my spine , to think I came though those doors all those years ago ... and it is 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional and how quick time has gone . Everybody made me welcome . " <p> Rhodes said he was moved that Ingle 's son Dom halted training to acclaim Sheffield boxing 's two MBE recipients . 
 <p> Ding , in his 11th appearance at the Crucible , will face either Liang Wenbo or Stuart Carrington with the pair locked at 6-6 in a marathon first round arm wrestle . <p> Qualifier Carrington had struck three centuries in a row to lead 4-2 but Liang fought back to lead 6-5 in a see-saw match . <p> Elsewhere , four-time Crucible champion John Higgins beat Martin Gould 10-6 in the morning session to book a last 16 match against Northern Ireland 's Mark Allen . The Scot held a commanding 7-2 lead overnight and though he lost the first two frames , he wrapped up victory with the help of an emphatic 127 break in frame 14 . <p> " To win 10-6 against Martin is brilliant , " Higgins said . " I am very happy to get through .

 <h> Rare opportunity to cruise up the 23 locks of the Giant 's Staircase on the Chesterfield Canal <h> . <h> Stephanie Bateman <p> At the end of the month , there is a rare opportunity to cruise up or down the 23 locks of the Giant 's Staircase on the Chesterfield Canal between Shireoaks and Kiveton Park . <p> These are the and Thorpe flights . They include some of the oldest staircase locks ever built . In one section there are 20 locks in one mile between Stone Lock and Thorpe Top Treble Locks . It is believed that this is the most in a mile anywhere in the country . <p> Pearson 's Canal Guide describes them thus : " Taken as a whole , the flights at and Thorpe rival anything the inland waterway network has to offer .

Afterwards passengers will need to make their own way back to their transport , either by walking ( 3 ? miles ) or using the train ( 4 minutes ) . Both Kiveton Park and Shireoaks stations are a one minute walk from the canal . <p> Hot and cold beverages will be available for purchase on the boat and passengers are advised to bring a packed lunch . The boat will have short stop at on both journeys . 
 <h> Doncaster inmate who scalded prisoner with kettle of boiling water is given more time behind bars <h> HMP Moorland <h> Sarah Marshall <h> A dangerous inmate at a Doncaster prison who threw a full kettle of boiling water over a fellow prisoner has been given more time behind bars . <p> On August 5 last year , CCTV captured HMP Moorland inmate Nathan Proctor going into the corridor and leaning over the first floor balcony near to his cell to see who was standing below , Sheffield Crown Court was told . <p> Moments later the 25-year-old is seen returning to his cell , and coming out with a full kettle of boiling water that he then threw over the balcony and onto fellow inmate , John Banks . <p> Prosecuting , David Wain , told the court : " He suffered burns to 15 per cent of his body .

This is going to affect me for the rest of my life . " <p> Defending , Andrew Davies , said : " This defendant is somebody who has a partner . She has told him she is pregnant , and he is looking to the future . <p> " In short , he has something to live for . This is a serious matter which is bound to come with a custodial sentence , but I ask your honour not to impose a sentence that will crush him .

" <p> Judge Watson told Proctor he must serve at least two thirds of his sentence before he can apply to be released , at which point ' it will be a matter for the parole board ' . 
 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : Judge the Owls at end of the season , insists Tom Lees <h> Tom Lees <p> Tom Lees insists the Owls have improved greatly under boss Carlos Carvalhal , but is acutely aware the team will be judged on how they fare in the final three matches of the regular Championship season . <p> Wednesday , last season 's play-off finalists , are well-placed to seal a top-six finish for the second year running . <p> Carvalhal 's men currently sit in fifth position , two points clear of seventh-placed Leeds United , and are full of confidence following four successive victories . 
 <h> Alan Biggs : You can add Leon Clarke to the list of Wilder 's wonders <h> Leon Clarke scores the second against Port Vale . Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> Want to know about man-management ? Well , take someone who has remarkably played for no fewer than 17 clubs , some of them twice and including loans , during a nomadic career . <p> A possible clue there to the scale of the managerial undertaking . <p> He 's a summer signing , a striker , one of the biggest names recruited . A proven goal scorer but carrying some baggage around . Literally . <p> After 19 appearances , without a convincing run in the side , he 's got just three goals . There 've been rumours , rightly or wrongly , that he and the club 's star striker , also the captain , either ca n't play together or do n't get on . <p> Then he 's sidelined by injury and his boss brings in a similar type of striker during the January window , albeit one who 's had a long and loyal career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some observers , including this one , start to wonder if it is already the end of the road for Leon Clarke at Sheffield United . <p> But Chris Wilder emphatically says not , insisting 32-year-old Clarke -- who numbers Sheffield Wednesday among his many former clubs -- WILL have a part to play . <p> And so he does ! <p> Five goals in four games in the rampage to promotion and the League One Championship . <p> Whatever the future holds , that is damn good management . <p> You can certainly now add the Clarke rehabilitation to the revivalist success of Kieron Freeman and Paul Coutts as examples of Wilder 's expert handling of individuals , underpinning the collective magnificence of the League One champions . <p> I 've no doubt that , even after the goal frenzy of this season , the strike department , along with others , will be itemised for a little strengthening this summer in the normal course of a club rising in status . <p> But one thing you 'd never do under this management is write off ANY of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in the case of Clarke , he 's scored goals freely at Championship level in the past -- for Wolves and Wednesday . <p> His 126 career goals , at a ratio approaching one in three , will always make him attractive to clubs , particularly those in the lower divisions . But a far bigger challenge may now await -- and the same applies to the many other heroes of a simply brilliant Bramall Lane campaign . <p> That 's because Wilder will know the spirit of the group has to be protected above all . Not weakened by supposed strengthening if new players are the wrong sort . What United have now is bigger than any individual . Present - or future . 
 <h> Warning over potentially lethal mix of heroin and powerful painkiller <h> A police warning has been issued following a number of drug-related deaths <h> Claire Lewis <p> A police warning has been issued about a potentially lethal mix of heroin and a powerful painkiller following a number of deaths across the region . <p> Four deaths in South Yorkshire , two in West Yorkshire and other fatalities in Humberside and Cleveland over recent days have led to police chiefs issuing a new warning to heroin users today . <p> They suspect that the deaths could be linked to heroin use and have revealed that tests on a number of batches of drugs recovered in the region have found that some have been mixed with a substance called Fentanyl - a painkiller said to be 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine . <p> Street names for the drug include Apache , China Girl and China White . <p> West Yorkshire Police said tests and enquiries are still being carried out into all the deaths and that it is ' too early to say ' whether mixing the drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallen , who leads the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Drugs Threat Reduction Group , said : " It 's not possible for the police to state that the presence of this drug has caused the increase in drug related deaths . <p> " We are however urging those people who regularly use Class A drugs and particularly those who purchase their drugs via street suppliers to be extremely cautious in relation to what they are taking . <p> " All police forces in conjunction with our colleagues from the National Crime Agency are working with partners from public health organisations to offer help and support to those vulnerable to serious harm from drug use . <p> " It is illegal to possess or supply a Class A drug .

 <h> Chris Wilder sprays champagne over his players after their title win is confirmed : Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> Chris Wilder , as Sheffield United 's unassailable lead at the top of the League One table proves , has barely put a foot wrong since being appointed 11 months ago . <p> From bold team selections and tactical shifts to persevering with Leon Clarke when many were calling for him to be cast adrift , the 49-year-old has got pretty much every call spot on . <p> Until , he admits , declaring his team is determined to finish the season not only as champions but also having accumulated 100 points . <p> " That was probably a mistake , " the United manager acknowledged earlier this week . " Because , if we do n't , then it should n't take the gloss off what these boys have done . With hindsight , I probably should n't have mentioned anything about it . You something get carried away in the moment though .

It was a theme he returned to during his pre-match media briefing yesterday . <h> Chris Wilder could include Harry Chapman in his team at MK Dons . Pic Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> " Every game we are involved in is a big game for us and our supporters . We 'll have seven thousand there and I , personally speaking , would have loved it to have been more . It 's important we carry on in the manner we have all season .

Neilson , who took charge soon after United 's match with Dons in October , has lost only twice at Stadium mk , where United will enjoy a 7,000 strong following , this year . <p> " You 'll have to wait and see , " Wilder said . " There 's a lot of players who are pushing for places . We 've got two games to go and we want to finish off on a high . <p> " Whatever team I pick , I fully expect them to give 100 per cent as they have all season . I 've got a group of players to pick from and they 'll all be desperate to play . The players who have been involved for the majority of the season will want to play in the two showpiece games . The ones who have n't played as much but who have travelled about all season will want to play too . "

 <h> Historic discovery of Sheffield anti-slavery campaigner 's grave <h> A volunteer uncovers Mary Anne Rawson 's grave . <h> Alex Moore <h> What seemed like a long shot became reality for heritage campaigners this week as they uncovered the long-lost grave of one of Sheffield 's most significant historical figures . <p> Mary Anne Rawson was a key figure in the fight to abolish slavery in the UK in the 19th century . <h> The gravestone of Mary Anne 's family . <p> The Sheffield-born activist is buried in the former Zion Chapel graveyard in Attercliffe . But the land has been forgotten over the years , becoming overgrown and litter-strewn . <p> The United Reformed Church is now seeking to sell the plot . But Penny Rea , of the Friends of Wincobank Hill group , believes its links to Sheffield 's role in abolishing slavery means it should be preserved . <p> The tangle of weeds had become so impenetrable the likelihood of finding Mary Anne 's grave seemed slim . <p> But that all changed when a group of volunteers armed with garden tools and determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siblings . <p> The question now is how it can be maintained and promoted to make more people aware of one of Sheffield 's most important daughters . <p> Below , volunteer Penny Rea gives her first hand account of the discovery . <p> " I am recovering from the shock and exhilaration of actually finding Mary Anne 's grave amidst what can only be described as a jungle . <p> " The place was really overgrown -- like something out of Sleeping Beauty . <p> " Ken Riley , of Rileys Machine Tools , who owns the adjacent land where the chapel stood , had kindly cleared a pathway for us to get close to the graves . Looking for a needle in a haystack did n't come near as a description for such a seemingly impossible task . <p> " So it really was quite extraordinary when one of our expedition party , Dave Roberts found Mary Anne 's grave under our feet when we were standing at the edge wondering about a more prominent and fancy grave . <p> " Dave realised he was standing on solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name Read . <p> " I was so amazed . A steel fence has been erected across the top section resulting in part of the memorial stone being in a passageway , but nevertheless it was possible to scrape off the soil and vegetation to expose two enormous stone slabs neatly and plainly inscribed with the names and dates of eight members of the Read family . <p> " Curiously , the last of the Read children to be born , baby Julia , aged 11 months , was the first to be buried in 1819 and the firstborn , Mary Anne , outlived them all and died aged 85 in 1887 . <p> " Ken Riley told me that there used to be an arched roof over this grave with a little chapel-like building at the back . <p> " This was demolished about twenty years ago when the fence was put in place to protect the rest of the graves and reduce dumping on the land . If any of your readers recall this building and could draw a diagram or sketch from memory , or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wonderful . <p> " Mr Riley really is a lovely man who has tried to look after the grave yard . He had erected a special gate and laid a path down the side of the land to allow access but people stopped visiting and it became overgrown . <p> " It seems that there are about 30 more graves which seem to be intact and in very good condition , perhaps because they have been protected from the elements by the overgrown foliage . <p> " They look very beautiful in that peaceful place . <p> " I am planning to go back with helpers to clear and record the names on the other stones and we could send you those names in case any readers are related . <p> " In the meantime I am planning to meet with the Synod Trust who have put the land up for sale to see what can be done to preserve this wonderful space .

 <h> Lee Peace <h> Hundreds of cyclists got on their bikes and rode out in the spring sunshine today . <p> Families and individuals young and old cheerfully rang their bells as they rode out in convoy from Devonshire Green for a short circuit around Sheffield city centre this morning . <h> Dexter Johnstone . <p> But behind the carefree feel of the event there was a serious message . <p> Around 400 riders gathered as part of a campaign to lobby council chiefs to improve the city 's cycle network with many raising concerns that a lot of roads are downright dangerous . <p> The day of action comes just months after statistics revealed a total of 825 cycle collisions were reported to South Yorkshire Police between 2010 and 2015 - with the most dangerous roads highlighted as Ecclesall Road , Abbeydale Road , Glossop Road , Penistone Road and London Road . <p> Beauchief resident and keen cyclist John Gilbert said : " There are too many pot holes in the roads . It means you have to swerve to avoid them , which puts you in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Abbeydale Road in particularly bad for this . <h> John Gilbert . <p> " I know they are resurfacing the roads now but they should have done it years ago . The cycle paths are also disjointed . They take you so far and then come to an end . " <p> Dexter Johnstone , secretary of event organisers Cycle Sheffield , called on the council to consider introducing a new cycle network in and out of the city centre . <p> The 35-year-old Walkley resident added : " We need to make it as easy as possible and as safe as possible for cyclists and an improved cycle path network would do that . <p> " We also think the council should look at reducing the speed limit on some roads so they are not used as rat-runs by vehicles speeding up and down to make it safer for all road users . <p> " With the Peak District next door , Sheffield should be great for cycling but at the moment it is too congested . " <p> The event was organised by Cycle Sheffield under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wider Space for Cycling national campaign , coordinated by Cycling UK , which is lobbying for councils to take action on three key issues : - *Plan a full network of cycle-friendly routes *Invest a minimum of five to 10 per cent of the local transport budget in cycling *Build the network using the most up-to-date high quality design standards . <p> Cycle Sheffield is specifically calling for Sheffield Council to make cycling part of the transport infrastructure . <p> Ian Carey , chair of Cycle Sheffield , said : " For years the council have said good things about developing a cycle network , but have done very little to make it happen . Well designed cycling infrastructure , similar to what is now being developed in London , is proving to be a boost to the economy . " People cycling to work are more healthy , get there quickly and are more productive . Sheffield needs to take cycling seriously . " <p> Councillor Mazher Iqbal , cabinet member for infrastructure and transport at Sheffield Council , said : " More than ten per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated for cycling schemes . " We are delivering cycle safety schemes around tram tracks and also secured ? 2.5m of funding from the City Region 's Sustainable Transport Exemplar Programme . This will be used to provide more dedicated cycle routes across the city and we recently completed a shared-use route at Penistone Road which enables cycling off-road or on quiet roads between Kelham Island and Oughtibridge . " We continue to promote cycling to schools and are soon to start projects at two schools looking at the best infrastructure and safety works , which can then be used as a blue print for others . This , as well as the continued roll-out of 20mph zones , will improve the cycling environment in Sheffield . " 
 <h> How Sheffield is using power of football to help refugees feel at home <h> Robert Cumber <p> Football fans in Sheffield have been helping refugees feel at home by introducing them to the joys and occasional despair of life on the stands . <p> A small group of new arrivals to the city have been enjoying the Blades ' success this season , with long-term supporters helping them settle in . <p> They travelled to watch the MK Dons game this weekend so they could continue to enjoy the promotion party . <p> More Sheffield United supporters are now wanted by Football Unites Racism Divides ( FURD ) , the Sharrow-based charity which runs the project , to accompany refugees to games and introduce them to local football culture . <p> The trip to Milton Keynes was part of Amnesty International 's Football Welcomes scheme , which seeks to embrace the power of sport to help newcomers fleeing human rights abuses and civil war adjust to their new surroundings . <p> Events are being held across the country this weekend to celebrate the contribution refugees have made to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark the 80th anniversary of the arrival of child refugees from the Spanish Civil War , who would become some of the first refugees to play professional football on these shores . <p> Youngsters evacuated to the UK after the infamous bombing of Guernica on April 26 , 1937 would go on to play for teams from Coventry City to Wolverhampton Wanderers . <p> Sheffield was one of the cities where young refugees were taken in and which their descendants continue to call home . <p> FURD , which receives funding from the Premier League Fans Fund , says while rival fans may occasionally clash over football it also has the ability to cross divides and bring people together . <p> Dr Chris Stone , the charity 's lead researcher , said : " Football is played and consumed in similar ways throughout the world .

We are alive and kicking and part of Sheffield 's entertainment mix and will continue to be so . <p> " We have had criticism that the Arena is missing out on some tours - across the past 26-years it has never been the case that every touring show has come to Sheffield Arena . That 's no different now . The market place is very competitive . But we have a great line up to come in 2017 . " <p> Arena General Manager Rob O'Shea added : " We are proud to be recognised as a top 200 venue in the world and the 13th busiest arena in the world for the first quarter of 2017 . <h> Take That also to perform at Sheffield Arena in 2017 . <p> " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's figures we are in an even stronger position as Sheffield is one of only three other UK arena 's that have a resident ice hockey team , with the Sheffield Steelers watched by over 50,000 fans in the first three months of the year . <p> " All of which highlights that Sheffield Arena is a successful market for world class entertainment . " Steve Brailey MBE , chief executive of SIV , said : " The Arena is a Sheffield success story . Every year since opening their doors in 1991 , the venue has returned a significant profit , bringing hundreds of millions of pounds to the city economy over the last 26 years . <p> " Given the venue 's current standing amongst the world 's arenas , it will continue to be a profitable jewel in the city 's entertainment crown . 2016/17 was another bumper year of shows and the 2017/18 line-up is already looking like producing one of the most profitable in the venue 's history .

 <h> Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis , the 1985 finalists <p> Heroes have come and gone , dreams realised and shattered almost in equal measure . <p> But still , in the Crucible Theatre 's 40th year of holding the World Snooker Championship , no match defines the iconic venue quite like the 1985 final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis . <p> Plucky underdog toppling robot-like favourite , respected but largely unloved , would be a fitting plot for any drama at this arena . <p> But this was real life and as the epic lurched one way then the other before going to the last ball of the last frame , a nation was transfixed . As 950 people watched ' live ' in the arena , a further 18.5 million breathed every moment from their living rooms on TV . <p> Little wonder , then , that the final features prominently in the excellent documentary The Crucible : 40 Golden Snooker Years , fronted by Davis and shown by the BBC tomorrow . <p> The absorbing account explores how the sport 's biggest event came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year , and why legends like Alex Higgins , Davis and Taylor , Stephen Hendry , Jimmy White and Ronnie O'Sullivan have all , in one way or another , captured the nation 's hearts . <p> " We were involved in something iconic , that a third of the population watched on TV , " Davis remembers . <p> " Lots of them had to get up for work in the morning but could n't turn their TV off . We had no idea what was happening outside . " <p> Fans of the game , and plenty of others besides , had been gripped by a final in which Davis , the defending champion and winner of three of the previous four Crucible titles , stormed into an eight-frame lead . Taylor levelled at 11 , 15 and 17 frames apiece , before taking on and missing three brave chances to pinch the final frame on the black ball . <p> Fortunately for him , so did Davis as the 68-minute final frame ticked on . Balls flew safe , Davis produced one of the best safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , Taylor finally sunk it and was champion of the world . <p> Taylor said : " Nobody dreamed it would go down to the black , so none of us knew how to handle the pressure . <p> " The pressure was unreal . I remember leaving the black , sitting down , pushing my old , upside-down glasses way up my face and thinking : ' There 's no way Steve will miss this ' . <p> " But who knew , the ginger magician and the bloke with the funny upside down glasses . We were involved in the best final of the lot . " <p> Not many will argue , but it is hardly a field of one , either . Stephen Hendry beat perennial bridesmaid Jimmy White in the 1994 final with a broken arm , 150/1 outsider Joe Johnson -- pink shoes and all -- shocked the world eight years earlier and Higgins calling out for his baby daughter , after winning the 1982 title is one of the enduring , and endearing , images of the Hurricane 's tumultuous career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the documentary , insisting that her late father made snooker what it is today . <p> And six-time world champion Davis does n't disagree . <p> " What is it about this place ?

 <h> Kevin Gage 's Blades Column : The story of Sheffield United 's remarkable season would be too far-fetched for a Hollywood blockbuster <h> Gagey Column <h> Kevin Gage <h> If George Lucas , Steven Spielberg &amp; J.K. Rowling had got together back in August and decided to create an out-of-this-world , box-office blockbuster , magical fantasy fairy story of a film about the Blades fortunes for the coming season , I do n't actually think the script of this season would have made it beyond a first draft . <p> It would have been filed in the drawer reserved for ' Too improbable , too far-fetched &amp; too unbelievable ' . To be fair , given our previous history of starring in our very own X-rated horror stories over the past few decades , us Blades were right to be cautious in the extreme about the new season . Unlike some , we did n't even have a dream , because for Blades fans they often turn into nightmares . <p> Therefore to be sat miles clear at the top of the division , crowned as champions , breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 points for a season mark is more than any Blades could ever have possibly dreamed about . We are still all in a bit of a red and white happy haze , as if being followed around by those celebratory flares , which does make a pleasant change from the storm clouds and thunder that usually hover over our heads ! <p> On Saturday at the MK Hilton Hotel that masquerades as a football stadium every other week , the season that could n't really get any better , got even better . The Blades put on a show of such stunning power , creative invention , and sheer quality it had to be seen to be believed . We swarmed all over the opposition and in truth they never really stood a chance . It was also a performance of strength in depth as some who do n't usually feature on a match day made their presence felt and fitted in just perfectly . <p> It was a sight to behold and a display that will live long in the memory , and with more like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So that 's the fans acknowledged ... now we 'll discuss the team ! <p> We won 3-0 . Of course we did . We 're Chris Wilder 's new Blades and we 're league champions . Winning is what we do . It 's what his teams usually do . Our class and quality told in the end as we clinically dispatched a passionless MK side on their soulless hotel back garden . In truth the victory was a sideshow to the party proceedings , but it was a fitting way to end our away day travels , and to pay tribute to the amazing levels of support that have driven the team on this season . It truly does make a difference , believe me . <p> This season has been nothing short of incredible . As I stated above at the start of this article , you could n't have scripted it much better . We even gave the others a few games head start just to make it a bit more unreal ! No-one connected with the club in any way shape of form genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more in desperate hope than sound judgement , and well done if you 've made a few quid on us at the bookies ! We 've been favourites most years , so you 've hopefully recouped some losses ! <p> So after 45 games , we 're nearly at the end of this remarkable season and much as we hate this division , it 's a season we do n't really want to finish ! But all good things must come to an end , and it 's probably just as well as this extended promotion party is taking its toll on a few ! On Sunday , as we lift the trophy high into the Bramall Lane air , it will finally end and we 'll reach the final page of the story of this 2016-17 season , and WHAT a story it 's been . <p> One day someone may even write a book about it , but personally I 'm looking forward to the film version . Chris Wilder as a Sheffield superhero with Alan Knill as the BFG assistant ? .... Get Spielberg back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit ! UTB

 <h> Sheffield United Fan 's Column : How opinions changed over the course of the season at Bramall Lane <h> Blades boss Chris Wilder has performed wonders at Bramall Lane <h> Matthew Bell <p> Now we 're at the end of what has statistically been the best season in Sheffield United 's recent history , it 's revealing to look back at some comments on Youtube after their woeful start to the season . <p> n Dallas Robinson - First game of a 46 game season , give the new players a couple of games , we will be dangerous and we will go up THIS season . <p> After the home League Cup defeat to Crewe : <p> n - New season but same old Blades . <p> n 04 - Same old same old . <p> After the home draw with Rochdale : <p> n Steve 1889 - It will be long ball football with no plan B. <p> n - Usual rubbish from United . Scraping a draw at home to Rochdale is just not good enough . <p> n Plays - Wilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan , you have to give Wilder a chance . He 's tactically good but bases much of his success off organisation and man management , which do n't come overnight . <p> n 1889 - These players are better than what we had last season but they need to gel together . CW speaks truth unlike the other managers in the past , so have faith in him . <p> After the 3-0 home defeat to Southend United : <p> n Sam Whittaker - The sad thing is that the club are only headed in one direction at the moment and it is n't upwards . <p> After the defeat at Millwall : <p> n Julian Herbert - Changes have to be made ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> n David Rawiri - Takes time . <p> n Julian Herbert - Sack Wilder , we 've given him time ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> But just to show what I know , here 's what I wrote in this column a couple of days after the first day defeat at Bolton Wanderers : United were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see anything that indicated that either side will be in the top two at the end . 
 <p> In their final match on their travels in their 2016/17 Championship campaign , relegated Rotherham finally earned a second point on the road , to go with the one they managed at Ipswich Town more than six months ago . <p> Smallwood buried his ninth-minute chance from 20 yards . <p> As a clinical finisher of difficult opportunities , the 26-year-old has always made a very accomplished defensive midfielder . <p> At Deepdale , however , he did well to control a clearance and even better to send a half-volley hit with his ' wrong ' left foot flashing past Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell . <p> The last time he was on the Rotherham scoresheet was that memorable spring day when he thumped home a shot from outside the penalty area in front of 3,000 travelling supporters during a 4-0 triumph at MK Dons . <p> The Millers have n't won away since . <h> Paul Warne <p> Preston would claw their way back into the game , yet stopping a run of 14 successive away defeats represented a good afternoon 's work for Warne 's men . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lows for the division 's bottom club . It did at least mean they ended their season of travel sickness on a positive note . <p> THE GAME <p> " I am pretty proud of what the lads have put in . I think there are green shoots for next season , " manager Warne said . " One to 11 , we were great , and I honestly believe we were more than deserving of a point . " <h> Jonson Clarke-Harris <p> Smallwood led the charge and Rotherham , organised and spirited , should have been further ahead before Stevie May - once a target for the Millers under former boss Steve Evans and starting his first match in 18 months after injury - curled in a superb 42nd-minute 20-yard equaliser . <p> Tom Adeyemi bent a shot inches wide just five minutes after the opening goal and , four minutes later , Richard Wood found himself with only the keeper to beat but could n't generate enough power on his header . <p> The worst miss came in time added on at the end of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's headed knock-back , from Lee Frecklington 's lovely chipped cross . <p> Adeyemi 's low effort across goal 25 seconds into a second half of few chances brought a good save from Maxwell . Millers keeper Richard O'Donnell matched that by tipping away danger man Aiden McGeady 's 58th-minute intended cross . <p> Rotherham winger Jon Taylor saw plenty of the ball and troubled Preston with his pace and directness but all too often promising positions were lost by a poor final ball . <p> All running , no cunning . <p> That was about it until the dying minutes when Semi Ajayi athletically diverted North End substitute Simon Makienok 's goalbound header away from the net and another header looped on to the bar . <p> It was Warne 's first ever away point as a boss , caretaker or full-time . <p> " Is it ? " he said , taken aback when he was informed . " Wow ... bl**dy hell . Well , I 'm not proud of that part . " <p> THE STATS <p> Roll on 2017/18 , when Rotherham should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what this term brought . <p> Twenty-one league defeats in a single season is the most in the club 's history , exceeding the mark of 18 set three times before the Second World War . <p> It 's only the second time they have failed to win an away fixture in an entire season , matching the nadir of 1932/33 . <p> Two points is their lowest ever away tally , one less than the three of 1933/34 . <p> Their number of defeats on the road equals the Football League record of 21 set by Leyton Orient in 1994/95 . <p> Sixty-four is the highest number of away goals they have shipped since the 73 of 1929/30 . <p> <p> The big man , Jonson Clarke-Harris , splits opinion among Rotherham fans like no other . No-one questions the striker 's physical attributes , but some wonder whether he will ever consistently make the most of them . <p> Given his first start since cruciate surgery last summer and looking to earn a new contract , he delivered . <p> He had the beating of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed well , made a couple of powerful runs and did well to last until the 72nd minute . <p> There is still some timber to be shed , but this was a display far , far better than anything he produced in the second half of last season when he was a frustrated bit-part player in Neil Warnock 's survival push . <p> He was gone by the time the game had its final twist . <p> In stoppage time , Adeyemi , a player Warne would love to hang on to next season , burst towards the goal where Millers followers were gathered , leaving Preston players trailing in his wake . <p> Was this was the moment for the prolific loan midfield man , with seven goals in his previous 21 appearances , to earn Rotherham their first triumph on their travels ? <p> " I was thinking there might have been a pitch invasion and it would be like Escape to Victory where they pass the players through the fans to the back , " Warne said . <p> " I was also thinking : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him are absolutely zero . ' He could have had a hat-trick . " <p> Shot blocked . <p> Pity , on this day of the unexpected , it did n't fall to Smallwood , one Millers goal in 30. 
 <h> Sheffield FC sad over loss of manager to Handsworth Parramore <h> James Colliver <h> Steven Jones <p> Sheffield FC chairman Richard Tims has admitted manager James Colliver 's decision to step down came as a shock . <p> Colliver ended his 14-month association with the club following their final game of the season . <p> He is to take charge at Handsworth Parramore , who play their football one division below . <p> Tims admitted the departure was unexpected following a " reasonable " season , which saw the team finish 15th . <p> " He was offered another job and took it , " said Tims . " It was quite a surprise to us really but money talks . It 's football unfortunately . " <p> However , the chairman believes Sheffield FC 's special status as the world 's oldest football club makes them an attractive proposition for prospective managers . <h> Sheffield FC 's Richard Tims . Picture : Andrew Roe <p> " We 'll have no shortage of candidates " he said . Nor is there any shortage of ambition for the season ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not , automatic promotion , " said Tims . We 've had a lot of success with our ladies side and we would like the men 's side to emulate that . Hopefully we can get the right manager to deliver our long-term project . " <p> Also central to the club 's long-term strategy is finding a new premises in Sheffield to call home , having been at Dronfield since 2001 . <p> But despite talking to a number of international parties , Tims admits progress has been slow . <p> He said : " It 's all about cash . You ca n't do anything without cash . " <p> However , Tims remains optimistic the club can " build a place where football fans can visit and pay homage to where the game kicked off . And that has to be in Sheffield , " 
 <p> The raid follows a similar operation in Beighton on Friday afternoon as officers discovered quantities of cannabis . <p> PC Hill who is the officer in charge of the investigation said " This is an excellent outcome as a result of a warrant executed in response to concerns about drug dealing from an address . Let this be a warning to anyone involved in the supply of drugs that it may be your address we visit next . <p> " Instead of being able to enjoy the Bank Holiday weekend and the good weather , the occupants of the address had the surprise of officers forcing their way into the address . This was especially surprising for one of the occupants who was smoking cannabis on our arrival . <p> " As a result of this warrant , a 23 -year-old male has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs , and another male from the address was issued with a cannabis warning . <p> " Officers encourage anyone with information about drug supply in their local area to contact us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling 0800 555 111 .

 <h> Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder <p> When the final whistle blew and the curtain came down on what has been a truly memorable season , Chris Wilder paused for a moment before glancing towards the sky . <p> Family had been thanked . Close friends and confidants likewise . <p> But , after Sheffield United had officially been crowned League One champions , Wilder remembered the man responsible for setting in motion the chain of events which yesterday culminated in the greatest achievement of his managerial career . <p> " I love seeing the old boys here , " Wilder said . " And another one that wo n't go amiss for me is Hodgy ( Alan Hodgkinson ) . He played an important part for me . " <p> Wilder worked closely with Hodgkinson at Oxford ; the club where he first rose to prominence following a successful but gruelling spell in charge of Halifax Town . The former England goalkeeper , who made nearly 700 appearances for United between 1954 and 1971 , used his influence to get Wilder an interview when Darren Patterson was sacked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his coaching staff when the Conference play-off title was won . <p> " Jim Smith was part of the interview process at Oxford and he knew Hodgy , " Wilder continued . " I had a connection with Oxford playing Halifax and he was part of that opportunity for me to go there . He worked with me for four or five years . <p> " I got a lovely card from Brenda , his wife , and unfortunately he passed away a couple of years ago . But hopefully , he 'll have a great sense of pride because he 's an iconic figure here . Invariably , on long away trips , the talk would get around to Sheffield United and the great players he worked with here . " <p> Wilder , a lifelong United supporter , cut an emotional figure when his squad were presented with their winners medals following yesterday 's game against Chesterfield . But , as he begins planning for a Championship future , the 49-year-old also took time to thank other figures from the past . <p> " So whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Len Badger ) or Ted ( Hemsley ) , " he said , " Whether it 's Brads ( Carl Bradshaw ) , Gagey ( Kevin Gage ) , Chris Morgan , Brian Deane and Keith ( Edwards ) , it 's important people recognise lads who are part of our history . This is a special football club and it 's about the people , including the fans . " 
 <h> Sheffield researchers have carried out a study into mental health <h> Claire Lewis <p> Sheffield researchers have found that over half of NHS patients experience a relapse after being discharged from mental health care within a year of treatment . <p> The study revealed 53 per cent of NHS patients had a clinically significant deterioration of depression and anxiety symptoms within a year after completing brief psychological treatments . <p> A total of 439 patients , who were considered to have recovered from their symptoms , took part in the study . <p> Over half of these were found to have suffered a relapse event , with up to 79 per cent of events occurring within the first six months after treatment . <p> The study was conducted by a team of NHS clinicians and scientists from the Universities of Sheffield , York , Huddersfield and Trier . <p> Dr Jaime Delgadillo , from the University of Sheffield , said : " These findings underline the importance of monitoring patients ' wellbeing for at least six months after treatment and offering adequate support to ensure they stay well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but often neglected aspect of psychological care in the NHS . <p> " Incomplete or insufficient treatment also costs the NHS , as patients who relapse often need further care or support .

 <h> Sheffield United lifted the League One championship trophy on Sunday <p> Lafferty , previously of Celtic and Burnley , said : " Listen , a club this size should be successful , especially with the fans we 've got here . The backing the club has is outstanding . It should be up there contending for honours all the time . " <p> United sealed their return to the Championship following a six year absence last month before a run of seven straight wins saw them finish the campaign on 100 points ; 14 clear of their nearest rivals . <p> Lafferty , who scored the decisive goal against Gary Caldwell 's side , moved to South Yorkshire in August and said : " This club probably should have gone up much sooner . But , for whatever reason , it 's been six seasons . <h> Sheffield United will be playing Championship football next season <p> " Every year , we 'll have been one of the favourites . But , until now , we 've not got over the line . <p> " Like the manager says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we 're just going to really enjoy it when we kick our boots off . We can put our feet up and enjoy it and , to be fair , I think it 's important we do that .

It 's about the group as a whole on and off the pitch . Because we could n't have done this without each other . "

 <h> The relative of a man jailed over the Rotherham grooming scandal has pleaded with a judge to spare him a prison sentence for dangerous driving , after he claimed the backlash to his conviction had caused him emotional trauma . <h> Sarah Marshall <p> The relative of a man jailed over the Rotherham grooming scandal has pleaded with a judge to spare him a prison sentence for dangerous driving , after he claimed the backlash to his conviction had caused him emotional trauma . <p> During a sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court today Shiraz Ali , of Clough Road , Masborough fell to be sentenced for a string of motoring offences , including dangerous driving ; relating to a police chase that saw him drive along busy pavements and mount roundabouts . <p> Defending , Michael Collins , told the court that since Ali 's 54-year-old father Ali , also of Clough Lane , Masborough , had been jailed for rape in March last year as part of his involvement in a Rotherham child sex gang , that it had fallen to him to act as the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this had placed a large amount of pressure on Ali , 23 , who wept throughout this morning 's hearing which he attended via video link from HMP Doncaster . <p> Ali 's 19-year-old brother Kaleem Ali , of Clough Road , Masborough , was also found guilty of intimidating a witness in the trial involving their father last year ; and Mr Collins said this had caused Ali 's family to be targeted by members of the public since their relatives ' criminality had been written about in the press . <p> He said this had caused him , and his family , stress and emotional difficulties . <p> Prior to the offence taking place on April 8 this year , Mr Collins told the court that Ali had been to visit his father in prison who was continuing to protest his innocence and this had been on his mind when police asked him to pull over . <p> Prosecuting , David Wain , told the court how officers on duty just outside Masborough at around 4.50pm asked the defendant to pull over due to the excessive speed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle he had taken without his wife 's permission . <p> This led to officers pursuing Ali , who during the chase reached speeds of up to 60mph in a 30mph zone , mounted and went the wrong way around a roundabout and driving onto a busy pavement where pedestrians had to run out of the way to avoid being hit . <p> Mr Wain told the court that Ali only stopped when he collided with an unoccupied vehicle , at which point he reversed into it and drove into the adjacent lane . <p> A police car then blocked Ali in , at which point he attempted to ' ram ' it in a bid to escape once more , but this was unsuccessful . <p> Ali was then charged with aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving , driving whilst disqualified and use of a motor vehicle without third party insurance , which he admitted to at an earlier hearing . <p> In mitigation , Mr Collins also asked Recorder David Dixon to consider Ali 's poor mental health , for which he told the court Ali had attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced Ali to 14 months in prison , and disqualified him from driving for three years . <p> He said : " Your driving here was as bad as the courts see . <p> " You drove around the roundabout the wrong way .

 <h> Battle of Orgreave <p> The Labour party may be calling for an inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave now but they did n't when they were in power . They had 13 years of government , well after the Miners ' Strike in 1984 . <p> Policing has changed a lot in 30 years but many memories in South Yorkshire are still bitter and a proper inquiry is needed to address this . <p> The Hillsborough inquiry showed that there was misconduct right through the establishment at the time but the outcome at least brought some answers to people whose lives had been blighted . <p> As a supporter of the Green Party , I can say Labour is not alone . The Greens ' Natalie Bennett challenged Home Secretary Amber Rudd 's refusal to hold an inquiry last year . And in the council , the Green councillors , together with Labour and LibDems supported a motion to call for an inquiry . <p> If Labour did n't act to uncover police corruption from the past , how would they tackle it in the future ? <p> Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar <p> You will need to look at your own 1995 Star calendar ... at the upper right of the tram waiting area are two figures .

I have in the past , wrote letters praising things , but obviously they have n't been noted . <p> I once made a point that Jayne Grayson should have her own column , but perhaps you 're right EB Warris , Justyn and myself would probably make a fantastic double act , criticising , and stating the obvious , writing about utter drivel , and completely slating the government and other political parties . <p> Oh hang on ... that 's already being done by the ' nightly ' letter writers on the ' Letters Page ' , like yourself ! <p> Twisted Nerve <p> by email <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke , as another would be politician bites the dust after being accused of anti-Semitism . <p> Ex-Lib Dems MP , David Ward , is sacked as an election candidate by Tim Farron .

A bit like an old soldier accusing " the Jews " of atrocities against the British by killing them in Palestine in the 1940s post war area , which was also true . <p> When will someone stand up and tell us " free speech " and the truth is NOT allowed when it involves " the Jews " .

The Tories are deliberately preventing an enquiry because they are hiding a lot of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , including the Met , to battle with striking miners who were staging a peaceful protest against pit closures . The minority of troublemakers were non-miners . Police officers goaded striking pit workers by flashing ? 20 notes before using excessive force . <p> An enquiry into the Battle of Orgreave will reveal the truth of what happened on June 18 , 1984 . It will also mean the Hillsborough disaster inquiry will be complete and could even uncover the corruption in the Metropolitan Police Force over the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 . <p> GPS <p> Sheffield <p> Dronfield , Derbyshire <p> On a recent sojourn to the Derbyshire town of Dronfield I was pleasantly surprised at the facilities they have such as the Civic centre , the splendid council offices , and even a lending library , but one can not think why the people of Dronfield opted to stay in Derbyshire when they had the chance to be a South Yorkshire town . <p> I feel they would have bettered their standard of living , although the natives seem happy with their lot . 
 <h> Video : Sheffield Steelers ' combination can be scourge of Elite League again next season <h> Colton Fretter - and his admirers <h> Bob Westerdale <p> Colton Fretter 's resilience after a potentially career ending season - and his uncanny understanding with linemate Mathieu Roy - has led to a fresh contract with Sheffield Steelers . <p> After winning two league titles and last year 's Play Off trophy , the 35-year-old Canadian has signed up for a fourth season at the Elite League club . <p> Fretter played only 19 League games in the 2015-16 campaign because of a double hernia . <p> The club stood by him and he responded in 2016-17 with 26 goals in 48 league games and a Play off final goal against Cardiff Devils . <p> The burly winger commented : " After the season ended I thought about what direction I was going to go . It did n't take me long to decide I wanted to keep on playing and keep on playing here at Sheffield <p> " I 've been treated so very well here by ownership , management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel a part of what we have built and continue to build .

I see a hunger throughout the club and especially inside the dressing room . <p> " We are not long into the summer but I 'm looking forward to walking back into the room and being part of that great group once again . <p> " We set the bar for many years and now Cardiff have taken that mantle . Its up to us to go get it back " <p> Being part of that ' great group ' is significant ... coach Paul Thompson wanted to re-sign the best players and core from last year . <p> The coach is an admirer of Fretter 's relationship with Roy and the fact he scores goals from range . <p> Thompson said " Colton is a very good player and person . He buys into how we do things here and has become one of our leaders . <p> " He is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The modern game means teams keep things tight , he is a player who can unpick a lock and finish . <p> " His record here with the Steelers speaks for itself .

 <h> Race on to save piece of Sheffield 's sporting heritage <h> The Plough in Sandygate <h> Robert Cumber <p> The race is on to preserve a piece of Sheffield 's sporting heritage which has gone up for sale . <p> The Plough pub in Sandygate sits opposite the world 's oldest football ground and one of its most historic cricket pitches , and it is reputedly where the rules of football as we know them were drawn up . <h> Peter Duff outside The Plough <p> The freehold is being sold by Enterprise Inns , after plans to convert the watering hole into a convenience store were rejected earlier this year , and the building is advertised with a starting price of ? 550,000 . <p> The pub is listed by Sheffield Council as an asset of community value ( ACV ) , meaning community groups have six months in which to put together a bid before it can be sold . <p> The Save the Plough Campaign Group is working hard to prepare an offer and plans to invite members of the public to buy shares , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Peter Duff , the group 's chairman , said the goal was to make ? 300,000 from shares , which would be topped up with grants , so it can reopen as a community pub . <p> But time is running out , with the deadline due to fall at the end of August . <p> " We 're confident we will be able to put together a bid but not over-confident as you 're looking at a lot of money that needs to be raised , " said Mr Duff . <p> The group is seeking grants from a range of sources , having already secured a small funding pot through the Community Pub Business Support Programme to develop its business model . <p> It is also working with its neighbour Hallam Sports Club , with whose history the pub is intertwined , to promote their sporting heritage and attract more visitors and investment . <p> As a community pub , The Plough would not just serve food and drinks , but would offer a range of other services which could include a repair clinic for household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those without an office . <p> Richard Storer , secretary of Hallam Sports Club , said : " We would be very sad if The Plough disappeared or became some anonymous conglomerate of a multinational firm , as just another convenience store or something like that . <p> " We would like it to continue as a pub because it 's part of our history and it 's part of the city 's proud sporting heritage . " <p> The sales brochure for The Plough advises potential buyers that it is ' well suited to continued use for a quality food and drink offer ' but says it may be suitable for ' alternative use ' . <p> It states that the property is not listed , does not lie within a conservation area and is allocated for residential use in the council 's development plans . <p> A spokesperson from Enterprise Inns said : " As part of our on-going business , we do from time to time identify a pub that may no longer have a long-term future in our estate . <p> " After careful consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plough Inn , Sheffield and the pub is currently being marketed .

 <h> VIDEO : Hundreds of bikers pay respect on last ride of Sheffield man Sam <h> Alex Moore <h> Sam Pickering had only been a member of the Crazy Crew motorcycle group for a couple of years , but he made a huge impression . <p> That much was made clear by the number of bikers - many who knew him , even more who did n't - that accompanied him on his last ride this morning . <p> Sam was just 20 when he died in a road accident in Oughtibridge on April 16 . He was on his way to a charity motorcycle show . <p> Hundreds of bikers gathered at Fox Valley in Stocksbridge on this morning before accompanying the funeral cortege to Grenoside Crematorium . <p> Traffic was at a standstill for close to 20 minutes as superbikes , Harleys and classic trikes joined together in a familial show of respect . <p> The noise of the bikers revving their engines was impressive to witness , and many Fox Valley visitors stopped in the middle of their Saturday morning shop to take photos and film the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral parade of Sam Pickering <p> Andy Nolan , of the Crazy Crew group that counts Sam and his parents as members , was one of many to join the ride . <p> He said : " Sam was full of energy and full of life . He was always smiling . <p> " He was a genuine bright light gone too soon . " <p> The group holds regular rallies and meets to socialise often . Sam had only been part of the group for a short time , but had quickly become a popular figure . <h> Sam Pickering <p> " We could n't do anything else to pay our respects , " said Andy . <p> " We are like a family outside a family . Everyone looks after and cares for everyone else . <p> " The biker community is a family in itself . It would be unthinkable not to be here .

 <h> Beware of Lib Dems bearing gifts <h> Voting <p> Of course it 's correct to say that , in a democratic society , we should be able to change our voting preferences whenever we wish , although , significantly , it took decades to reach Brexit . <p> What I find interesting is a previous writer 's reference to ' a crop of 18-year-old voters . ' <p> A crop also refers to the yield from a predetermined planting and feeding programme . <p> In this age of ' thought seeding ' by the political elite , it seems to be a very appropriate description . <p> I hope that this younger ' crop ' will be able to compete when it comes to houses and jobs . I know of many young people , with good qualifications , who , at present , can not . <p> No one should underestimate the intelligence of the younger generation , nor should their votes be taken for granted . <p> Polls are notoriously unreliable and I believe that the free-thinking individuals in the ' crop ' will come to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world they see around them and not on the opportunist rhetoric of any political party . <p> They may not remember the days before agency employment , zero-hours contracts , food banks and the reliance , of many , on charity . <p> They may also , be unaware that while these things were becoming the norm , Nick Clegg , the previous Lib Dem leader , was making vast amounts of money from his 10-year role in the EU , but they will certainly remember the ' student fee ' promises made by him and his party in a previous election campaign . <p> They will also be well aware of how membership of the EU has caused major social and economic difficulties to countries like Greece and just maybe , this time , they will beware of Lib Dems bearing gifts . 
 <h> Aerial picture of the blaze . <h> Lee Peace <p> Dramatic aerial footage has emerged of a huge blaze ripping through a recycling centre in South Yorkshire today . <p> South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue tweeted the footage - believed to have been captured by a drone camera - which shows flames raging from the Universal Recycling base at Wharf Road in Kilnhurst , Rotherham . <p> More than 30 firefighters have been in attendance since about 10am this morning and it is believed that up to 500 tonnes of plastic are ablaze . <p> Residents living nearby have been urged to ensure their windows and doors are kept shut . <p> Wharf Road is closed with no access to vehicles and there is very limited access available on to Springfield Road , Beighton Road , and Waterway Lane . <p> Nearby Community Centre is providing space for people to go who ca n't get access to their homes on blocked off streets . <h> Smoke plumes from the blaze . <p> Emergency services are this evening urging residents who live in areas which are cordoned off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a precautionary measure . <p> Chief Inspector Iain Chorlton , of South Yorkshire Police , said : " We would strongly advise residents to make contact with family and friends and seek alternative accommodation if possible due to the smoke that is still being omitted from the recycling centre . Residents who are already in their property are strongly advised to keep their windows and doors closed . <p> " For anyone who needs assistance with alternative accommodation please call Rotherham Council on 07748 143170 .

 <h> Eagles chief Mark Aston . Picture Chris Lawton <p> Sheffield Eagles are getting closer to becoming the finished article , according to their coach Mark Aston , but there is still work to do after their latest success . <p> The Eagles produced a dominant display to pass 50 points for the first time this season , after they crushed Bradford Bulls 52-16 at Belle Vue , to make it five wins from their last seven Kingstone Press Championship games . <p> In arguably their most convincing performance of the season , Eagles bounced back from the previous weekend 's disappointing defeat to Featherstone , with director of rugby Aston stating they are setting new standards in their recent high-quality displays . <p> " I was disappointed with our performance against Featherstone , but I think it showed then just how far we have come in such a short space of time , " he told The Star . <p> " The fact that we are competing with teams at the top , and picking up results against good sides , shows progress but there are still plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a good sign , <p> " We are pushing on now in the second part of the season , that is important . There is no better way than beating a Bradford side who gave us a lesson on enthusiasm in the reverse fixture . We were smarting from that . <p> " We have come a long way . The group has really grown and they have really impressed me . We are getting more confident , we have that togetherness that I have spoken about a lot recently - that was evident for all to see again . " <p> Eagles looked set for a possible shut-out but did show a glimmer of some old frailties when the visitors bagged three quick tries near the close . Aston still wants to see improvement , but was delighted with a dominant display from almost start to finish : " The standards are certainly important to us , " he added . <p> " We are looking for performances , we want to be playing well week in , week out and again we have shown we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are capable of defending at times , we are still letting a few sloppy tries in , we just need to put the finishing touches to our play . We need to be competitive for every single minute , of every single set , of every single play , but we are getting there and I 'm very pleased with them . " 
 <h> David Jones <p> Jones , one of 10 changes made by head coach Carlos Carvalhal in Sunday 's home defeat to Fulham , said : " I think ideally you would like some form going into the play-offs but we have seen over the years it does n't really matter . <p> " Everybody has the same chance of going up and Huddersfield have known for a few weeks they were going to be in the play-offs so have been preparing for them . <p> " Huddersfield are a very good team and have done fantastic this season . They obviously have got good team spirit and will be tough opponents . " <p> Huddersfield will be without first-choice goalkeeper Danny Ward this weekend . The Liverpool loanee will serve a one-match suspension following his red card against Cardiff City . Joel Coleman is poised to deputise in between the sticks .

 <h> The tiny nappies have been donated to Sheffield Jessop Wing Hospital . <h> Darren Burke , Digital Reporter <p> Babycare firm Pampers has launched the world 's smallest nappy for premature babies - and donated 2,500 of them to a Sheffield hospital . <p> The tiny nappies are designed to fit premature babies weighing less than 1.8lb - less than a loaf of bread - and are the smallest available in the UK . <p> The Pampers Preemie Protection Size P3 are designed specifically to meet the needs of the tiniest little fighters and the firm has handed over dozens of boxes to Sheffield 's Jessop Wing Hospital . <p> The nappy is three sizes smaller than a regular newborn nappy and is suitable for babies weighing less than 800g . <p> Approximately 1 in 11 babies - 60,000 - are born prematurely in the UK each year and due to advances in medical science , survival rates are increasing . <p> Neo-natal nurse and developmental specialist Cherry Bond said : " Premature babies have very unique requirements , which need to be valued and considered in every element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Sheffield 's Jessop Wing Hospital . <p> " The nappies that are currently available do not fit the smallest babies properly so are often cut and folded to size , which can cause discomfort and impede optimal development " . <p> Pampers has partnered with Bliss , the UK 's leading charity for babies born premature or sick , to get the nappies to the babies that need them , initially partnering with Sheffield Jessop Wing Hospital and a limited number of other hospitals across the country , before rolling out nationwide to all UK hospitals from this summer . <p> The brand is also asking all parents to get involved by sharing photos of their little ones with a raised fist on social media with the hashtag #powerofbabies , to celebrate the amazing fighting spirit that premature babies show every day . Pampers will be donating ? 1 to Bliss for every one of those pictures shared . <p> Caroline Lee-Davey , CEO of Bliss said , " We were thrilled to hear about the new range of Pampers nappies for premature babies , which will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that care for them . <p> " Caring for such a small and fragile baby can be daunting , but Bliss knows that getting families more actively involved in caring for their premature baby aids development , creates valuable bonding time and helps babies get better faster . The nappy change is one way parents can take a lead and nappies that are fit for purpose will make this so much easier . " <p> " The happy and healthy development of every baby , including the tiniest little fighters , is our priority , that is why when nurses asked us to design a nappy for the most vulnerable babies , we rose to the challenge " said Ian Morley , Commercial Director at P&amp;G . <p> " It took us three years and over 10,000 hours of research to develop the new P3 nappy , which is designed to provide comfort and protection for the smallest babies . As a parent of two preemies myself , I am extremely proud that we have created a nappy which meets the very unique needs of premature babies and those that care for them " .

 <h> Trip of a lifetime for Rotherham 's children in care <h> Stephanie Bateman <p> A group of children in care from Rotherham have thanked everyone who helped them raise enough funds to get to their dream destination . <p> The teenagers - who are all members of Rotherham Council 's Looked After Children 's Council - spent the last nine months tirelessly fund raising so they could all go on an educational visit to Poland , and they finally reached their destination over Easter when they jetted into Krakow . <p> They visited a number of historic locations including the harrowing Auschwitz concentration camp to learn about the World War II Holocaust , hate crimes and the importance of love , peace and community cohesion . <p> This followed a bid by one of the 14-strong group to visit his dead father 's birth place in order to find out more about his family 's history . <p> Three years ago 16-year-old Simon hit rock bottom after his Polish father died . <p> Devastated , the youngster - who is currently in supported lodgings after being in foster care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's homeland with the aim of understanding his heritage . <p> He said : " This has been such a trip , I ca n't thank everyone enough who helped us get here .

 <h> Headteachers speak of academisation benefits after final three secondary schools under council control apply to become academies <h> James Pape , principal at Oasis Academy Don Valley <h> Sam Jackson , Multimedia Reporter <p> Headteachers and trust bosses have spoken of the huge benefits that becoming academies has brought to Sheffield schoolchildren . <p> They believe the schools forming the latest multi-academy trust -- King Edward VII School , High Storrs and Stocksbridge High -- will experience many positives including being able to share expertise and resources , develop teaching and teachers ' skills and make financial savings . <h> Andrew Truby , who is a National Leader of Education and executive headteacher at St Wilfrids Primary School , in Millhouses , and St Thomas of Canterbury , in Meadowhead <p> Academies are independent , state-funded schools , which receive their funding directly from central government rather than through the council . <p> Their daily running is down to the headteacher or principal , but they are overseen by an academy trust or multi-academy trust . The trusts and chains provide advice , support , expertise and a strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more freedom than other schools under control of the local authority , such as changing the length of the school day and term times . <p> Libby Nicholas , chief executive of Astrea Academy Trust , which has 16 schools in South Yorkshire and will be sponsor the new in Burngreave , said : " The main benefit of becoming an academy and joining an academy trust is that the school can draw on a much wider and deeper pool of expertise : educationally of course , but also in all the other operations of a school -- development of staff , finance , IT , buildings management and so on . <h> Victoria Simcock , headteacher at Parkwood E-ACT Academy <p> " There are also huge savings to be made -- if you are buying on behalf of 16 schools compared to one , you obviously have some serious purchasing power from everything from energy bills to glue sticks . <p> " Having a shared set of values and overarching ambition across a number of schools in a local area -- in our case a commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful . It can be a real game-changer when it comes to raising aspirations right across a community and helping young people truly discover their talents . " <p> James Pape , principal of Oasis Academy Don Valley , likened being in an academy trust to a family . <p> He said : " For me being part of the Oasis multi-academy trust is similar to being part of a family , it is about how we can support one another , helping each other to provide the best possible teaching , learning and opportunities for our children . <h> Libby Nicholas , chief executive of Astrea Academy Trust , <p> " As principals we regularly meet to discuss what is happening at our academies and how we might work together . <p> " Our teachers train together and share best practice -- if one has developed an exceptional scheme of work that their pupils have really engaged with , then our pupils in our neighbouring schools can benefit from that too . <p> " Ultimately it is about working together for our pupils , their families and our local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E-ACT Academy , in Shirecliffe , said her school has transformed its fortunes since joined a trust . <p> It had been in ' challenging circumstances ' but for the last three years has been in the 20 per cent of schools nationally in terms of students ' progress . <p> " Historically , E-ACT sponsored academies that were in challenging circumstances , and being part of E-ACT has helped staff and leaders in Parkwood improve learning , outcomes and provision for both the students and the wider Parkwood community , " she said . <p> " Working with the trust , Parkwood has been recognised as a good school , for the last three years has been in the top 20 per cent of school nationally in terms of progress and has this year received the best school in Sheffield award . <p> " E-ACT also helped the school gain the fantastic , multi-million pound learning resource we call home . <p> " Being part of an academy and a multi-academy trust broadens opportunity for all stakeholders , staff have wider continuing professional development opportunities and a robust network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regional team of system leaders and from head office . <p> " Students benefit from the experience and good practice which is disseminated across the academies , and as the chain grows this in turn will increase the ability of leaders and teachers to further improve provision . As an academy we also work closely with local providers , other schools , other MATS and the local education authority and this is actively encouraged by the trust . <p> " Becoming an academy has given the school more choice , greater freedom and more support in terms of educational , legal , financial and HR matters . " <p> Andrew Truby , who is a National Leader of Education and executive headteacher at St Wilfrid 's Primary School , in Millhouses , and St Thomas of Canterbury , in Meadowhead , has also seen his schools go from strength to strength . <p> He said : " Since converting to academy status , our schools have gone from strength to strength , being judged as outstanding , establishing a nursery and being designated as a national teaching school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region . <p> " In 2012 when we converted , it was possible to be a single academy however this is no longer sustainable . Successful schools are now part of multi-academy trusts , where economies of scale and increased leadership capacity can be achieved . We work with a large number of schools and it is very important to be outward looking and to learn from high performing academy chains . " <p> Mr Truby felt school leaders should consider carefully the capacity , ethos and ambition of a multi-academy trust before joining . <p> " Schools who form MATs and just continue to do what they are doing with no shared approach or centralisation will not feel the benefits of being part of a MAT and will most likely fail as a result , " he said . <p> " This is a real opportunity for school leaders to take control of the educational landscape , build capacity and improve teaching and learning so that all children can go to a great school . <p> " We need to be making sensible decisions about workload without compromising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward looking and worried about autonomy and now it is time to take a shared responsibility for all of the children in all of our schools .

 <h> Sheffield United : Chris Wilder reveals his toughest test of the season <p> Chris Wilder has admitted that telling the likes of Stefan Scougall and Matt Done they are surplus to requirements was among the toughest moments of his managerial career . <p> Less than a week after officially being crowned League One champions , Sheffield United confirmed the duo were among five players whose services were no longer required at Bramall Lane . <h> Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder <p> Wilder , who began the process of strengthening his squad by signing Ched Evans on Monday , insisted the announcement underlined the bravery of the club 's coaching staff but admitted this summer 's cull felt very different to some of those he has performed in the past . <p> " If you speak to ( Alan Knill ) , Lee Butler , Wayne Jacobs or Mickey Lewis , people I work or have worked closely with , I 've sometimes quite liked that part , " he said . " Seriously , these last two years have been an exception because the players I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion in as many seasons after leading United to the title , having steered Northampton Town out of League Two before returning to South Yorkshire 12 months ago . <p> The 49-year-old , a former United player , appeared destined to award Scougall a new contract earlier this term but the arrival of Jay O'Shea on loan from Chesterfield prompted a change of heart . Marc McNulty is also set to become a free agent next month while Done has been placed on the transfer list alongside James Wilson and Chris Hussey . <h> Matt Done has been made available for transfer : Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> " The game is ruthless , " Wilder said . " People would be ruthless with me . You like to think it 's fair but the game moves on . We 'll always be brave enough to take the big decisions though . "

I had a chat with Rhys and Andy and some of the senior players on Tuesday night and we decided to go with it . <p> " I know it 's a big jump from amateur to League One and it 's a bit of a gamble on my part , but we 'll see how it pans out . <p> " Hopefully I can help bring a bit of extra motivation and intensity that we 've lacked at times . <p> " I do n't think that we 've reacted very well in games where we 've gone behind .

 <h> Fernando Forestieri <p> David Wagner is acutely aware his Huddersfield Town side must nullify Owls top-scorer Fernando Forestieri if they are to emerge victorious in their Championship play-off semi-final showdown . <p> The Terriers defence will be looking to keep Forestieri and company quiet when they take on Wednesday at the John Smith 's Stadium tomorrow , kick-off 12pm . <h> Fernando Forestieri <p> Forestieri 's record against Huddersfield is impressive . He has notched five goals in eight appearances versus the West Yorkshire outfit since moving to England in 2012 . <p> With Gary Hooper unlikely to be involved in the first leg due to a hamstring injury , twelve-goal is in contention to start in the first leg of the tie against his favourite opponents . <p> Terriers boss Wagner said : " Forestieri is a great player , a great offensive player . <p> " He has n't been involved as often in the last six or seven games for Sheffield Wednesday . Only this shows the quality they have in the offence and the money they invested . He will probably be involved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from scoring and performing . " <p> While Wagner is a big fan of Forestieri 's qualities , the German insists Wednesday have a " lot of top quality players " . <p> " The good thing is there are no surprises ; we are totally aware about the individual quality and the team quality , " said Wagner . " Plus , the offence and defensive qualities that Sheffield Wednesday have . We have to cause them problems , I am sure they have thoughts about us , too . "

 <h> READER 'S VERDICT : Sheffield one of worst cities to raise a family ? Nonsense <h> Meadowhall . <h> Lee Peace <h> Sheffield may have been named as one of the worst places in Britain to bring up a family - but proud Steel City residents are having none of it . <p> The city was ranked 30th out of 35 UK cities to bring up a child because of a range of factors including crime rates , poor schools , number of parks , house prices and average income . <h> Sheffield city centre . <p> Compiled by MoneySuperMarket.com , the UK Family Living Index was topped by Newcastle as the best place while London was bottom of the table thanks to its extremely high house prices , huge competition for school places and high rate of burglaries . Nearby Leeds ranked two places behind Sheffield in 32nd . <p> But proud residents across Sheffield have hit out at the survey and more than 500 people posted their reaction on Facebook . The majority described the city as a great place to live and highlighted the high number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District and friendly people as the main selling points . <p> Lindsey Durow said : " I lived near Derby and Nottingham and moved to Sheffield . I 've never been happier . There are loads of cheap or free activities for kids , lots of places to visit but most of all ( the people are ) so friendly .

 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : A performance to be proud of on a night of bitter disappointment <p> As we stood in the toilets relieving initial thoughts on play-off disappointment for Sheffield Wednesday as much as anything else , we were interrupted by former England manager Steve McClaren . <p> " They lost it in the first leg , " he interjected before quickly exiting the men 's room at the back of the grandstand . <p> The question for McClaren and everyone else is , did they ? <p> Was Wednesday 's reserved and contained approach to the first leg of their semi-final clash with Huddersfield Town an ultimately damaging blow of reaching Wembley for the second successive year ? <p> The inquest into why Wednesday this season failed to go one better than last year will begin soon enough . What could have been done differently over the last nine months will be a question debated over well into the summer . <p> It 'll be a discussion which will probably start in the cold light of day on Thursday . The morning after the night before . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shootout defeat continues to fester and makes hiding away in sleep on Wednesday night difficult . <p> So , in the here and now , thoughts turn to whether Sheffield Wednesday could have done more in their play-off semi-final . <p> Regardless of whether you agree with McClaren over the merits of how Carlos Carvalhal instructed his side to go about their business in the first leg , Wednesday at least ensured they would be starting the second level-pegging with Huddersfield . <p> It left both them and their opponents in a cup final situation . A one shot deal . Winner takes all . <p> And in their approach to that , they can not be faulted . It was a performance to be proud of and one worthy of the backing it received . <p> After a long and tough campaign , they gave everything they had left in their attempt to beat Huddersfield . <p> Fernando Forestieri was the embodiment of that . <p> This is a player who we were told weeks ago would not be 100 per cent fit again this season . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a virtual passenger in the game . <p> But you would not have known it on Tuesday night . Forestieri ran from the first minute until the last . In the 120th minute he sprinted half the length of the pitch in his desire to make something happen for Wednesday . <p> His name will be in the headlines because he missed the decisive penalty . The talisman that failed to carry them through . <p> But before his penalty was saved by Danny Ward , Forestieri had given his all in a team effort packed with desire and determination . <p> Likewise , Kieran Lee showed no signs of the injury worries that blighted the second half of his season . And Sam Hutchinson the same . <p> They gave their all and so did their team mates . Wednesday continued to restrict Huddersfield as they had done in the first leg but offered so much more going the other way . <p> There was a level of composure on the ball that was severely lacking on Sunday . Some of the passing moves were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched on and , in a neck-and-neck race of a game , they were showing why they are one of the Championship 's top tips . <p> The match played out on a knife-edge . The two teams could hardly have been better matched . Both had periods of dominance but the balance was never far from tipping . <p> With nothing between them , it was almost right for it to be decided with the lottery of a penalty shootout . <p> But such a scenario only makes defeat more agonising and the pain even more raw . <p> Now , Wednesday find themselves in the same position Brighton were last year - the side everyone said was the strongest in the play-offs yet was dumped out at the semi-final stage . <p> There was no wallowing in pity for Brighton . They shook themselves down and reset for another go , learning from their previous experience to make themselves into a much stronger side . <p> Wednesday now must do the same . Harness the pain and come out stronger for it . <p> But , like questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tomorrow . 
 <h> South Yorkshire drug dealer concealed hundreds of pounds of crack cocaine in a Kinder Egg <h> A South Yorkshire drug dealer , who hid dozens of wraps of crack cocaine in a Kinder Egg , has been put behind bars . <h> Sarah Marshall <p> A South Yorkshire drug dealer , who hid dozens of wraps of crack cocaine in a Kinder Egg , has been put behind bars . <p> During a sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday morning , the court was told how the attention of officers on duty at around 8.10pm on September 23 , 2016 was drawn to a vehicle travelling along Drummond Street , Rotherham . <p> Officers in a marked car began pursuing the vehicle that was carrying defendant , Ryan Colclough , in the back seat . <p> Prosecuting , Stephanie Hollis , told the court that officers felt that the car ' was trying to lose ' them due to the twists and turns it was taking along the journey through Rotherham town centre . <p> As a result , the police officers in the vehicle turned their sirens on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , which had noticeable drug paraphernalia scattered around the back seat , pulled over as requested and Colclough , of Burns Road , Rotherham was arrested and searched . <p> Hidden inside the 20-year-old 's shorts was a ' Kinder Egg , ' which contained around 46 wraps of crack cocaine . <p> Ms Hollis said : " The wraps weighed a total of 2.28 grams .

 <h> Sheffield Council was ' complicit ' in Roger Dodds ' abuse <h> Alex Moore <h> Sheffield Council was ' complicit ' in allowing sex attacker Roger Dodds to groom teenagers and young men , according to a damning report into his abuse . <p> Dodds , who was jailed in February after admitting a series of sex attacks on five people dating back to the 1980s , created an environment ' within which he could exploit his position of authority to pursue his sexual satisfaction ' . <h> The former Sheffield Council education department offices in Leopold Street . <p> His actions caused ' enormous distress ' to his victims according to the findings of Operation Klosters , a review council commissioned after police began investigating Dodds in 2008 - and released to The Star today . <p> Dodds was a sex tourist , ' well known ' for his use of sexual language at the education department building in Leopold Street , and was part of a club that shared hardcore pornography on the internal mail system . <p> The review found the authority was ' complicit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability or consequence ' . <p> " This , in my view , clearly constitutes a failure of duty of care to both staff and young people , " wrote the report 's author Brian Lawson . <h> Dodds was sentenced to 16 years in prison in February . <p> ' Difficult reading ' <p> It was in the basement toilets of Sheffield Council 's education department that Roger Dodds abused teenagers and young men in the 1980s and 1990s . <p> His victims raised concerns but Dodds was first moved to another job and then granted early retirement . <p> Today The Star can reveal for the first time the findings into a review of Dodds actions called Operation Klosters , which began in 2008 in response to a police investigation . <p> The but independent review found the council was ' complicit ' in Dodds ' abuse , failing to challenge him or hold him accountable . <p> Author Brian Lawson said Dodds was able to exploit his position , first in the education department and later giving grants to college students , to ' pursue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsupervised access to schools ' . <p> Dodds was part of a pornography club , using the basement of the Leopold Street office and sharing material on the council 's internal mail system . <p> He was ' careful and thoughtful ' about his choice of victim to minmise the risk of being found out , and boasted about his sexual exploits during his ' extensive ' travlling abroad . <p> And his behaviour was tolerated while concerns were not addressed . <p> In his report , Mr Lawson said : " The actions of Roger Dodds have caused enormous distress to his victims and the city council has been complicit in allowing Roger Dodds to operate apparently without sufficient challenge , accountability or consequence . <p> " This , in my view , clearlly constitutes a failure of duty of care to both staff and young people . " <p> The council has said it would never defend Dodds ' actions . Director of children and families Carly Speechley said the Klosters report made for ' difficult reading ' . <p> " This is because the author , commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncover the reality of the circumstances at the time , " she added . <p> Changes made to prevent Dodds abuse <p> In the eight years since the publication of the Klosters report , Sheffield Council says it has done all it can to prevent a repeat of the Roger Dodds case . <p> The report found changes had already been made , from policies to deal with sexual behaviour to a move to open-plan offices and a new whistleblowing scheme . <p> Seven clear recommendations were also made , all of which have been implemented ' fully ' . <p> Director of children and families Carly Speechley said : " Of particular concern is the possibility identified in the report that Roger Dodds was part of a pornography club which distributed materials through the internal mail . <p> " This possibility is likely to have been identified as part of interviews with employees at that time . <p> " Despite extensive searches , we have not found any evidence to corroborate or contradict this possibility . What we can say for sure is that a number of the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by council employees on council premises would now be impossible . <p> " If this did happen , then it was appalling and abhorrent . But both the Klosters report , and the recent criminal and civil cases which have looked a wider range of available evidence , have been very clear that the likelihood is that in his abuse , Dodds acted alone . <p> " Despite the possible existence of a pornography club , there is no evidence that this means there were other abusers . <p> " To the very best of our knowledge , and taking into account all of the evidence , Roger Dodds acted alone . " <p> ' Serious ' concerns over lack of records <p> One of the difficulties in finding out exactly what Sheffield Council had done when allegations of Roger Dodds ' abuse came to light in the early 1980s was the almost total lack of records . <p> Operation Klosters found few documents relating to Dodds ' employment history . This was apparently due either to a flood in the Leopold Street office where records were kept , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate Dodds time at the council , said in his report that the lack of information - particularly from 1981 to 1983 - meants it was hard to know whether there were more victims from that period . <p> Mr Lawson wrote : " The fact that the ( police ) investigation and this review have had to rely almost entirely on witness statements given the absence of almost any documentation pertaining to Roger Dodds or any formal record of his employment is a matter of serious concern . <p> " None of the investigators involved feel reassured or confident that documentation has just been ' lost in the flood ' . <p> The council said best practice at the time was to destroy most records after six months - but that a loss on this scale was ' clearly unacceptable ' . Following the report an ' extensive ' search was conducted and some historic documents were found , which were shared ' in full ' . 
 <p> But Wednesday let slip their advantage . The hosts fell into the trap of trying to defend their lead too early and the Terriers punished them . <p> Fletcher , a good focal point in the attack , was inexplicably substituted just after the hour mark . He was a handful in the air and gave Huddersfield 's defence plenty to think about . It was a baffling decision to take him off . <p> Wednesday have an array of attacking talent , but Carlos Carvalhal 's men badly missed Gary Hooper in the final third . The striker was bang in form before he picked up his latest hamstring injury . His ability to link the midfield and attack was integral to the Owls ' strong end to the regular season . Hooper would have added an extra dimension . <p> It also did n't help Wednesday that Ross Wallace was forced off early on in midweek . The wide man 's experience , direct style of play and quality from dead ball situations would have been handy in such a do-or-die clash . <p> Carvalhal said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a club and continue the progress we have made over the last two years . Even though we are disappointed , we must be proud . Sheffield Wednesday are now a team that fights for promotion . " <p> Now the Owls have to pick themselves up and go again . Wednesday 's squad does not need major surgery . They finished fourth in the table , seven points better off than the 2015/16 campaign , for a reason . <p> Their recruitment drive has to be better .

 <h> Gavin Baldwin : Doncaster Rovers hoping to do majority of transfer business before start of pre-season <h> Gavin Baldwin <p> Chief executive Gavin Baldwin says Doncaster Rovers are aiming to get the majority of their transfer business done by the end of next month . <p> Rovers know only too well the benefits of swift and decisive action in the transfer window after their pro-active work last summer laid the foundations for the club 's promotion success . <p> And Baldwin , speaking to our sister paper The Yorkshire Post , has said there is a determination to be equally efficient as Rovers prepare for a return to League One . <p> Baldwin said : " The lads come back for pre-season on June 26 and we would hope to have the squad together by then . <p> " If not , we would want just a couple of additions after that . But we are working at having all the players in by the 26th . It might not happen , but we will have the majority in by then . <p> " We learned about how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replicate it again . <p> " Getting promoted early was really fortunate . It means that we sat down weeks ago and spoke about what the squad needs to look like next year . " <p> Boss Darren Ferguson will be backed by a " generous " budget , according to Baldwin . <p> And he says the Scot will be targeting not just players who can help the club push on in League One but also make the potential step up to the Championship . <p> Baldwin said : " Darren has identified five or six positions we 'd like to fill to bring some added depth and that is exactly what we are doing . <p> " We are already having some really good conversations with players and their clubs . <p> " We have clearly identified targets who we are talking to now and making progress with . <p> " The vision of the club still ( ultimately ) remains to be a successful Championship club . The funds that the owners have made available for next year is again generous . <p> " The emphasis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team for every game . If we do that , we have a good chance of success . " <p> He added : " Our recruitment will be specific to doing very well in League One next year , but should we be fortunate enough to get to the Championship , we would want those players to be with us there as well . We are looking at a mix of loans and contracted players and extending contracts . <p> " Within the squad , there are players with different lengths of contract and we have to find players that we would want to retain if we should be fortunate enough to make the Championship . " <p> Ferguson said last week he was close to landing a left back and a Premier League striker on loan . 
 <h> REVIEW : A night of bravado and showmanship as WWE Live returns to Sheffield Arena <h> WWE Live wrestling superstars coming to UK Arenas in May . <p> The crowd bellows and a sea of foam fingers begin to wag as the compere starts the first fight of the night - there 's nothing quite like a WWE crowd ! <p> It 's been over 20 years since I sat and watched the likes of Hulk Hogan and Macho Man Randy Savage squaring off , and - a generation on ( literally - Ric Flair 's daughter is here fighting ! ) not much has changed . WWE is still a great night of entertainment ; dripping with showmanship , bravado and plenty of choreographed pain . Once the night got going , it was one fight after another - one-to-one fights , followed by six-man tag teams , and a title match between Canadians Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens that featured a sidekick to the face that looked pretty real . And while a third of the audience were kids , the rest was simply a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all are welcome - waving their homemade placards high .

It 's so reassuring to know that we have people to call on for advice , support and for making crazy ideas reality . " <p> They added : " We offer one of a kind off the peg designs and also bespoke design and re-trimming services . <p> " Each of us has our own individual style and we can provide skills and expertise that are no longer found on the modern high-street . <p> " We firmly believe there is a hat for everyone . It 's all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> " We regularly have clients at the shop who say ' hats do n't suit me ' and we 've always found something that is right for them . <p> " Even if we do n't have the exact match for a client 's outfit immediately available in store , our ability to make designs to order means that the client always has broad options to choose from - be it a change in the colour of a design , mix and matching decoration features , even down to finding a more appropriate colour elastic to match their hair . " <p> This year , the trio are excited to be part of Style Sheffield week , which has been co-ordinated by Sheffield BID . <p> They will host a launch party on Thursday , June 1 and also open late until 6.30pm on Thursday , June 8 as part of Alive After Five .

 <h> Doncaster council plans to take control of major schemes in town centre <h> David Kessen <p> Doncaster Council hopes to put a number of high- profile development projects on fast forward to help transform the centre of the town . <p> It is pulling out of a deal with developer Muse to try to proceed with major schemes itself , potentially including a cinema in the town centre , and the transformation of the former Doncaster Girls ' High School . <p> The borough 's cabinet has given the green light to plans for the authority to take back control of projects which had been covered previously by a deal with Muse , which previously led to the development of the Civic Building , Cast theatre and Sir Nigel Gresley Square . <p> It wants to start projects Muse has not felt able to move forward , because of the economic climate . <p> The authority recently announced plans to develop land at Doncaster Lakeside called the Herten Triangle , after the scheme had stalled , by moving the scheme forward itself . It is now looking at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with Muse . <p> Mayor Ros Jones said : " The development agreement with Muse was signed in 2009 and it has delivered some good outcomes for Doncaster , making an important contribution to regeneration of the town centre . The Waterdale area particularly has seen some excellent new developments including our fantastic theatre Cast , a new civic square , civic offices , redevelopment of the multi-storey car park and new housing at The Gables . Unfortunately the agreement also coincided with the economic downturn , and not all of the outcomes anticipated in the original agreement were delivered . This includes a number of sites that the council still wishes to see developed , such as at the civic quarter and the old girls ' school site . <p> " By mutually agreeing to vary the development agreement now , it gives the council the opportunity to explore alternative ways of bringing forward these sites , to help drive forward our plans for the town centre and the economy of our borough .

 <h> Bob Westerdale <p> The well-schooled Brook against the speed and technique of the new KO kid on the block . Here , we ask Sheffield experts for their prediction and what the event means to the sport and the city . <p> Atif Shafiq ( Ingle gym mate ) : This is a huge event for Sheffield and I am super excited to be a part of it . I 've been training with Kell for 10 years now and this is the best shape I 've ever seen him in , physically and mentally . Getting back down to welterweight will give him a mental edge , he has left no stone unturned . <p> The 27,000 fans will be a huge advantage as Kell will be feeding off the energy from each and every single person , he will raise his game to a new level . <p> Waleed Din : It 's brilliant for the city . I 've even had people asking me for places to stay as the hotels are all sold out ! With a couple weeks to go at a check weigh-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight right . Kell 's massive and can dig so I 'm siding with him on this one . The fans are an advantage , when it gets tough in there and I 'm sure it will . It does give you that extra boost ! <p> Pickering : On a world scale the biggest from Sheffield ever . It 's a great fight and broadcast live on Showtime America . Eddie Hearn keeps delivering massive events which credits our sport . Kell 's had to work hard going up to middleweight and then dropping back down to welter . Nearly 30,000 people yelling for Kell will be an advantage although he maybe nervous before the event , when the first bell goes he will feel the energy . <p> Sam : Boxing started in England and we should host these types of big fights . Kell will be good at the weight . He 's done it too many times before . The question is has Kell got Spence at the wrong time or has Spence got Kell at the right time ? And will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mental performance ? The number of fans wo n't make any difference . When you 're in the zone you 're in the zone . <p> The undercard should have been better though- more home fighters from Sheffield on it , in 50/50 fights . Shame it has n't been done . <p> Lee Noble : I 'm going late Kell stoppage or clear points win ; he 's done it once against Shawn Porter and it will happen again . I can see Errol folding when the ' chocolate brownie ' lands . <p> Dennis Hobson : This is a great event for Sheffield . Any boxing at a football stadium is a big deal . Kell is a very strong welterweight . He should be at his peak and have more experience . The hype is that it is too soon for Spence . The effect on the crowd depends on the individual . It energises you or saps you with the pressure . Being at home is a big advantage . Clinton Woods was unbeatable at home , but never performed away <p> Amer Khan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is excited about this one too . Kell is boxing for pride on a dream show in his home town , and Spence needs to win to further his career . Kell 's got a very strong , robust body that can take the hammering of training and making weight . <p> This has always been what makes Kell a cut above the rest . Spence is a strong southpaw but he stands in front of you . Kell 's right hand is the perfect answer to Spence 's style . <p> Chris Dutton : Kell will win but he 'll have a fight on his hands . If you look at the opponents they have had , Kell has fought the better boxers . Kell is not going to let this guy take his belt . <h> Kell Brook in training <p> Andy Marlow : It 's been too long since the Bramall Lane ground was used as a boxing venue . This contest is very intriguing ... a good match up . Brook 's experience will show through from the early rounds but I ca n't see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality boxer but I can see a late stoppage for Brook . <p> With the Klitschko-Joshua contest being so well matched the fight fans are hungry for more real quality match-ups and this could be one of them . <p> Ryan Hardy : This is massive for both Sheffield and British boxing , albeit the choice of stadia a questionable one : We 're all Wednesday , are n't we ? ! People complain about PPV but the numbers speak for themselves . <p> If Kell has made weight in the correct manner and over a sensible timescale we 'll see the best of Kell , who delivers a performance that shows his elite level skill and maturity , bringing a late stoppage after a one-sided affair . <p> Spence is very good , but his greatest tests have come in the form of an aging Bundu and pumped up light welter in Algieri . This is Kell 's chance to show the US he is the best welterweight on the planet , and propel himself into a unification with Keith Thurman , or a duel with the aptly-named Amir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from GGG , Spence is the hardest opponent Kell has faced . Spence was an amazing amateur and backed it up in the pro game . <p> This is the biggest fight Sheffield has seen since the days of Naseem Hamed . Kell as clearly shown that weight is no problem . <p> He 's a down to earth Steel City kid and he will want to do Sheffield proud . <p> : This great for Sheffield and world boxing . Boxing needs these big fights , real fights . The best should fight the best . Kell has never failed making welterweight before . So that will not be the issue . For both fighters it 's a matter of who deals and soaks up the crowd support better . Both will get a great support . <p> Liam Cameron : This is a big event for Sheffield at our best football ground and with our best champion . Brook will be confident in making weight he has a nutritionist and they know what they on about he also has a great team . I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlight will be on our city and that can only be a good thing especially after the buzz from Joshua-Klitschko . I see Kell edging out Spence in a close points decision . I rate Spence highly ; he will go on to reach the pinnacle of the sport but I think Brook will fight him at just the right time . Spence is still a bit green and Brook 's championship experience and sharpness will see him defend his title successfully . I do n't think the weight will be an issue seeing how good a shape he is in and he will be punching hard back down at welterweight . <p> Kell 's boxed at the top before having to go over to America to win his title and facing Golovkin in a huge event . Pressure will not be a problem - he 'll want to put on a performance to remember for his home fans . <p> Jon Buster Keeton : I 'm no football fan but Bramall Lane is a great choice of venue . Kell is up for this , big time . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching his every move , no stone will be left unturned . Kell thrives on danger and pressure . He wins late stoppage or points . Come on Babi ! <p> Wayne Reed : It 's massive for the city , an outdoor event like this : let 's hope it does n't rain ! If Kell 's cut the weight right it will be a very good contest but it 's a massive step up in class for Spence .

 <h> Manchester Terror Attack : Boyfriend of hero Sheffield woman who died in blast says she was ' happiest she has ever been ' <h> Kelly Brewster . <h> Lee Peace <h> The boyfriend of a Sheffield woman killed in the Manchester terror attack has told how she was ' the happiest she has ever been ' before her death and the couple were looking forward to a long life together . <p> Kelly Brewster , who was hailed a hero for shielding her young niece from the deadly Manchester Arena blast , has been named by friends as the fifth victim of the terror attack . <p> She had attended the Ariana Grande concert with her sister , Claire and her niece , Hollie Booth , when the terrorist struck . <p> The civil servant , who once worked at Irwin Mitchell solicitors in Sheffield , had reportedly put a deposit down on a house in Sheffield with boyfriend Ian Winslow the day before the attack on Monday night . <p> Ian , aged 36 , posted on Facebook : " Not sure how this works but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unidentified hospital patients . She has sadly passed away in the terror attack yesterday . <p> " Kelly really was the happiest she has ever been and we had so many things planned together . My daughter Phoebe will be absolutely devastated like we all are . Love you loads . " <p> Loved ones later took to social media to confirm their worst fears that Kelly was one of the 22 victims killed in the suicide blast , which also left dozens injured . <p> Posting on Facebook earlier on Monday , Tracy Booth said her granddaughter , Hollie , had broken both of her legs and Hollie 's mum , Claire , had broken her jaw . <p> Commenting on the post , Paul Dryhurst said : " I understand she Kelly was behind Hollie and shielded her with her body .

 <h> The least of their worries <h> Peregrines <p> In reply to JD Arnold 's letter about our birds of prey , I have to believe that he/she is not a countryside dweller . <p> I live in Grenoside and have both Greno Woods and Wharncliffe Crags on my doorstep and I take great advantage of them both . I am a 73-year-old schoolboy who loves to be in the woods , but even though this time of the year is an exciting time with birds all busy feeding their chicks , it is also a very cruel time with songbirds of all kinds under threat from every direction . <p> May I suggest that the various birds of prey in our woods are perhaps the least of the worries that small birds have and that they face far worse dangers from the likes of jays , crows , magpies and woodpeckers , but most of all grey squirrels . <p> If you add all these assassins together , they do far more harm to our songbirds than the beautiful birds of prey . <p> David A Green <p> Grenoside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty shoot-out defeat by Huddersfield , the Wednesday manager was quoted as saying that one of his players said he did not feel confident to take the kick and the worst thing he could have done was to force him to take one . <p> The player in question is a striker whose job should be to score goals . <p> Yet when his goalscoring skills are needed by his team he bottles out -- leaving his team mates to perform in his place . <p> If the striker feels unable to take a penalty kick , does he have the same reluctance to score goals during the match ? <p> Any professional player on Championship wages should be prepared to give their all for the team and not leave it to their colleagues with lesser scoring skills when it comes to a penalty shoot-out . <p> Before the fans of the Sheffield football fraternity come baying for my blood , I do not support Wednesday or United and my comments apply to any professional football player in a similar situation . <p> Cyril Olsen <p> Busk Meadow , Sheffield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma <p> I feel as if I am in a bit of a dilemma .

Green Party or Mr Nuttall ? <p> I certainly wo n't want to waste my vote . <p> Len <p> Shiregreen Owl <p> Nice and friendly <p> Re the letter of May 15 from Jayne Grayson about the One Show with the Prime Minister and her husband . <p> I thought it was very nice and friendly . <p> They were n't invited to talk about politics , just about themselves as a couple . <p> They 've had their bad times and good ones , and like a lot of us take it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to change places . <p> Mrs Frost <p> S5 <p> Student games <p> On May 10 , Councillor Peter Price says that he is proud of our city , and comments on the funding of the World Student Games . <p> He referred to a payment made in 1992 for the games and said that it left no debt . <p> I understand that the games were well organised but did not make as much money as hoped . <p> Presumably this is why the payment Coun Price refers to was made from reserves , rather than from income generated by the games themselves . <p> He goes on to say that the funding agreement for the games has been refinanced over the years to fund council services , which means that the debt from the games has been rolled over rather than got rid of . <p> Any way you look at this , if it were not for the cost of the games out of the city 's reserves the refinance borrowing would not have been needed to pay for council services . <p> I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be proud of , but from his own words , the debt from the World Student Games may have been moved about but it is very much here today . <p> If someone does develop such a spray , could they give me a few shares in their company for thinking of it ? <p> JD Arnold <p> S7 <p> Fund the data collection <p> Your excellent article on air pollution was based almost entirely on data collected by volunteers for the East End Quality of Life Initiative . <p> The processing of the tubes which sample the pollution used to be paid for by the council but that funding has now been withdrawn . <p> In future it seems likely that the only data we will have will come from a system used mainly by developers . <p> If John Mothersole and the council are genuine about their concerns for our health , will they demonstrate it by saying now that they will fund the data collection in the future ? <p> Pete Stow <p> Hastings Road , Sheffield , S7 <p> On the sporting map <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporting map . <p> At least Jordan Rhodes could drive home as he had no penalty points on his driving licence . <p> D Allen <p> S2 <p> Blades will get promoted <p> In answer to that Owls fan 's question , we have the money and fan base and Chris Wilder is a fantastic manager . <p> We hammered our way back into the championship with 100 points , 92 goals , which is more than you lot did when you were in League One . <p> We might consolidate our position and finish in the top 10 in the Championship , but Wilder will learn from that and the season after that we will end up in the top two , pushing for automatic promotion back to the Premier League .

" <p> And ahead of tonight 's meeting , Branford says team spirit is the best he 's known in his career . <p> " This is without doubt one of the best teams I 've ever been a part of , " he said . <p> " There 's an amazing team atmosphere , there 's a positive vibe around and that makes you want to go out there even more and battle even harder for each other because you do n't want to let everyone else down . <p> " We want to keep our home record unbeaten but we 'll have some tougher tests than we 've had so far -- and Glasgow will probably be one of them . <p> " We just need to keep doing what we 're doing though but right now I believe that if we can stay away from those injuries , then we 've got a great chance of going all the way this year .

 <h> Arthur is face of baking campaign <h> Bake It Better Day <p> A Sheffield boy , who had pioneering surgery while in the womb , is fronting a new campaign for Sheffield Children 's Hospital . <p> Seven-year-old Arthur Fountain is the face of The Children 's Hospital Charity 's Bake It Better Day , and is calling on families , colleagues , groups and individuals to get baking and raise some serious dough on June 29 , for the hospital where he still receives regular treatment . <p> Each year , 204,817 from Sheffield - and another 260,000 children from all over the world - visit the hospital for specialist treatment . Primary pupil , Arthur , is one of those children , after needing surgery on his windpipe to enable him to breathe . <p> His mum Michelle said : " When I had my 20 week scan they noticed a growth on his neck . We knew when he was born he was going to need this surgery because the tumour was crushing his windpipe . He would n't have been able to breathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur while just his head and shoulders had been delivered by ceasarean section . The tracheostomy means he is able to breathe , but he needs round-the-clock care to ensure it does n't become blocked or stop working . He has since had six operations on his windpipe at Sheffield Children 's Hospital , where doctors hope he will one day be able to breathe without the device . <p> On June 29 , The Children 's Hospital Charity wants people across the region to join them for a day of baking in aid of Sheffield Children 's Hospital , to help fund life-changing treatments .

 <h> Sir Cliff Richard . <h> Lee Peace <p> Lawyers representing Sir Cliff Richard and the BBC are due back at the High Court three weeks after telling a judge of plans to call a truce in a legal battle . <p> The singer has sued over reports naming him as a suspected sex offender . <p> Lawyers say in late 2013 a man made an allegation to the Metropolitan Police , saying he had been sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff during a concert at Sheffield United 's Bramall Lane football stadium when a child in 1985 . <p> Metropolitan Police officers passed the allegation to South Yorkshire Police in July 2014 . Sir Cliff denied the allegation " as soon as it was brought to his attention " and in June 2016 prosecutors announced that he would face no charges . <p> The singer , who has not appeared at any preliminary hearings , has taken legal action against the BBC and South Yorkshire Police over coverage of a raid at his apartment in Sunningdale , Berkshire , in August 2014 . <p> He says his right to respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " damages . <p> Mr Justice Mann is listed to oversee the latest in a series of preliminary hearings at the High Court in London today . <p> Lawyers representing all sides had told Mr Justice Mann on May 5 that a one-month ceasefire had been agreed so negotiations could take place . <p> Sir Cliff 's lawyers say he suffered " profound and long-lasting " harm and should get compensation . <p> South Yorkshire Police have apologised " wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused " by the force 's " initial handling of the media interest " in its investigation into the singer . <p> BBC editors have said they will " defend ourselves vigorously .

 <h> Kell Brook : the southpaw slayer of Sheffield <h> Ready to roar - Kell Brook <h> Bob Westerdale <p> An Ingle gym ' spy , ' who has studied every detail of American challenger Errol Spence Jr , believes he is an ideal opponent for Kell Brook on the huge Bramall Lane stage tonight . <p> Nadeem Siddique , who has been by Brook 's side almost every waking minute of the last nine weeks , believes Spence 's left-handed orientation will be an advantage to the orthodox Sheffielder . " Kell is the southpaw slayer " said Siddique , who at 39 makes a surprise appearance on the undercard of the IBF contest . <p> " He genuinely loves southpaws . In fact , he prefers them . Why ? It 's the Ingle gym ! We are used to switch hitting - something we deal with on a day-to-day basis . " <p> Siddique is sceptical that Spence has the pedigree to beat the world champion in his own backyard , despite his camp 's confidence . " No disrespect to the Americans but they were saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been told for six or seven years he 's the next best thing . <p> " He 's been patted on the back and is starting to believe the hype . He has never done a 12 rounder , never boxed in an event of such magnitude , never been in with someone like Kell , so the pressure is all on him . <p> " Is he too green ? Having talent is one thing but when Kell comes out in front of 26,000 people , and he 's in the corner and that song comes on ... he is going to question himself . <h> City centre weigh-in . By Lawrence Lustig <p> " I 've studied him inside out . He does most of his work with the left hand , likes to set himself ... very good at coming forward , but on the back foot he 's not as good . He has gone into the ring , every opponent prior to Kell , knowing he is going to win . This time it 's a different ball game . When he gets clipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he is made of . <p> Brook 's ring-walk will include the Blades ' ' Greasy Chip Butty ' tune as well as his normal ' All of the Lights ' accompaniment . <p> " Kell is going to blow him away . Just like I told you he was going to beat Shawn Porter and nobody would believe me . I think it is going to be a spectacular fight . Having been around him for the past nine weeks , it 's the best he 's been . <p> " Everything has been spot on , he is in a good frame of mind , he is excited , he is looking forward to it . " 
 <h> Sheffield Eagles : Super League full back flies in ahead of Summer Bash <h> New Eagles signing Jack Owens <h> Matt Young <p> Sheffield Eagles have added St Helens full-back Jack Owens to their ranks , as they head to Blackpool tomorrow aiming to break their Summer Bash duck . <p> The Eagles face Swinton looking for their first victory since the Bash was introduced after two previous defeats to London . <p> Owens joins the club on a loan deal until the end of the season , and is in line for a debut after the Eagles made room for fresh faces following the departures of Eze Harper and Dane Chisholm . <p> Director of rugby Mark Aston is hoping for third time lucky for Sunday 's 12.35pm televised kick-off , stating that Owens could feature after the Eagles completed his registration in time for Sunday ' showdown . <p> " I 'm delighted we have been able to secure the services of Jack until the end of the season , " said Aston . <p> " There is no doubt that Jack can play , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him shows that . <p> " He has a good knowledge of game , his work rate and work off the ball is great and he 'll be a valuable addition at a key part of the season for us . <p> " We have built a good relationship with St. Helens and hope we can continue to build this in the future . " <p> Aston 's side endured a disastrous Summer Bash experience last season when they arrived late after being caught in traffic , before being soundly beaten <p> Aston is determined to enjoy the Blackpool experience this time around but warned his side are in for a fight against a Swinton outfit , who 've recorded notable victories over Huddersfield in the cup , and Toulouse in the league this season . <p> " We have been disappointed over the past couple of years , " Aston added . <p> " We have taken a couple of beatings and we had a horrendous journey last year , stuck on the bus for six hours . We 're playing against a good team in Swinton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand of football , so we need to be good . <p> " It is a difficult one because we kick off at 12.35pm . We have to set off then at 8am which is very early for us . If there 's traffic , and that has undone us previously , then we 're stuck . We just have to get on with it , and hopefully there 'll be no issues . " <p> Duane ( groin ) is again doubtful , whilst Garry Lo and Menzie Yere ( both knee ) are expected to be fit .

 <h> MADE IN SHEFFIELD : Forging steel industry of the future <h> Independent Forging and Alloys Managing Director Andy McGuiness . <p> Down a side road past Sheffield 's Owlerton dog track is a site where forging has taken place since 1587 . <p> Those early metal workers chose the confluence of the rivers Don and Loxley as the best place to establish their trade . <h> Hot bar in the press at Independent Forging and Alloys . <p> What would the forge have looked like , in the late 16th century , almost 40 years before the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire came into being ? Probably a tilt forge , with a water wheel powering hammers . <p> But the principle of heating metal to soften it up , and applying pressure to change its shape and properties , is unchanged today . And remarkably , the site still has the same use . <p> Independent Forging and Alloys on Livesey Street proudly continues a centuries-old tradition - but the machinery , the technology and the end products have changed . <p> " Aerospace , " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Made in Sheffield . <p> Today , IFA parts can be found in the engines and aircraft of 21st century planes , including the Boeing Dreamliner , as well as oil rigs and satellites . <p> He also believes Boeing 's arrival in Sheffield -- with its first factory in Europe -- will be a huge boost . <p> " I think it 's exciting . Boeing is the biggest thing to happen to the aerospace sector locally and will establish this region as a centre . And it will bring work for the supply chain . " <p> At the heart of IFA 's operation is a forge fitted with 20 gas furnaces , each about the size of a garage . Huge buggies that look like something out of Mad Max lift out bars of hot metal and place them in a 1,500 tonne press . <h> A manipulator vehicle places a hot bar in the press at Independent Forgings and Alloys <p> They are ' cogged ' -- squashed and rotated -- in an operation involving a small team of men who communicate with hand signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear white overalls . But it has a practical purpose , to reflect the intense heat . <p> Elsewhere on the site , ingots , part-forged ' billets ' and finished products are kept in a stockyard , some still radiating heat . And in another building , the saw shop , machines slice off rough forged ends where impurities are concentrated . <p> IFA is also proud of its test house , opened a year ago following a ? 500,000 investment . Today it employs five and is advertising three jobs . Independent from the main company , it certifies products to show strict standards are being met . <p> Andy McGuinness adds : " It 's a complex business affected by global uncertainties such as the exchange rate , oil price and the cost of raw materials . That can make life difficult , especially if a customer cancels an order . There 's also the complexity of the shapes and the metals . But there 's a vast amount of knowledge on this site <h> bar at Independent Forging and Alloys . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are experiencing growth not seen since before the crash of 2008 and it 's forecast to continue for the next five years . <p> " I 'm proud of our heritage -- I can see it continuing into the next century . " <p> IFA employs 135 including three apprentices , turnover is between ? 18m and ? 20m . <p> Export is 20 per cent of business -- it won a Queen 's Award in 2008 -- and 30 per cent of its supply chain is in South Yorkshire . <p> IFA is a proud member of the Made in Sheffield club -- not least because it helps with recruiting . <p> Chairman Martin Burnham said : " In the early days of Independent Forgings and Alloys we were very keen to make much of our links to the heritage of Sheffield , we were one of the first supporters of Made In Sheffield . I feel it is key to building partnerships with the local supply chain . When we started the business in 2001 I was keen to use the Sheffield name and even our website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot metal bar from the furnace at Independent Forging and Alloys . <p> " I believe that people still know and respect the Sheffield name , especially for metals and we have promoted the Made In Sheffield brand with success at our international exhibitions . <p> " I feel that the brand also has value when it comes to recruitment and training . People in the local area are justifiably proud of their city .

Ray is backing Labour once more after voting to leave the European Union . <p> " I 've never been one for the Conservatives , " he said . <p> " I voted to leave and we are out now , so I will go back to Labour . " <h> Attercliffe <p> Ray has problems close to home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going right for people in the local area , " he said . <p> " I 'm retired with illnesses . I 'm on the verge of losing my independence and I worked until I was in my early 50s . " <p> Ray said he was n't that keen on Jeremy Corbyn but he was the ' best of a bad bunch ' . <h> Jessica Connolly . <p> He said Corbyn was ' for the people ' , but added : " I 've just turned 60 and I ca n't see a bright future . <p> " It 's going to be tough to get rid of Theresa May but it just needs people like me to muck in.

 <h> Feature : New development at St Luke 's Hospice will make it ' one of the best health care centres in the world ' <h> St Luke 's chief executive Peter Hartland in front of Clifford House <h> George Torr <p> An exciting new facility coming to a Sheffield hospice could make it ' the best health care centre in the world ' according to bosses . <p> St Luke 's Hospice in Whirlow are putting together the final touches to their new facility in Clifford House , which aims to help patients in early diagnosis . The picturesque Victorian structure , acquired in 2016 , will house up to 30 users for relaxation , activities and support just yards from it 's base on Little Common Lane . <h> Clifford House <p> Chief executive Peter Hartland spoke exclusively to The Star about the plans . <p> He said : " What we want to do is translate the outstanding work we do in St Luke 's and bring that to Clifford House and making the hospice as a whole one of the best health care centre 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene is 2008 . Terminally i 'll patients are queuing up to go to the toilet and have to book time slots for a bath . <p> Walls are in need of a lick of paint and the facilities look tired . <p> It 's safe to say St Luke 's was not in a good way . Bleak finances and crumbling facilities dampened what amazing work staff did in tough circumstances . <p> Fast forward nine years and you could hardly believe the stories of its difficult past . <p> The in-patient wing rebuilt to a modern standard has brought a calm atmosphere with non of the clinical edge . Throw in an ' Outstanding ' rating from Government inspectorate the Care <p> Quality Commission , things are looking up . <p> And now after getting back on a firm footing , the hospice is set to turn another corner with the acquisition of Clifford House - located from a short walk through a newly constructed path . <p> Speaking to The Star in his office , top boss Peter Hartland explains what Clifford House aims to offer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from diagnosis and confirmation they 've got a terminal condition right through to the point where we start to see them now ? The answer is , it 's very patchy . If you 're a cancer patient , you will get support from other parts of the system around the city . <p> " If you 're unfortunate enough to have a condition that does n't have a big centre in Sheffield , you 'll probably get very little support and you and your family may be left at home contemplating this thing that 's been dropped on you without the support . <p> " Clifford House has been acquired to enable us to help people earlier in their terminal illness an by offering them a range of activities either one-to-one or group activities around relaxation , practical advice and fun because we feel if we can help people in the early phases of their illness , when they get to the difficult stage , they 'll be better prepared for it , able to cope better with it and if we get this right , we may defer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise . " <p> He added : " We want to make a similar impact at Clifford House so when people have got real problems come and visit us , they feel welcomed and want to return . <p> " We aim for this to become part and parcel of helping them cope with what is probably the worst news that any family can get . " <p> The Victorian Mansion - located 30 seconds away on foot - back onto to the current site on Little Common Lane . <p> A bit of and a new path has opened up the structure which looks more like it should be hosting posh garden parties and weddings than treating people with a terminal illness . <p> But it 's in this idyllic environment that staff at St Luke 's believe they can expand the fantastic work they already do . <p> The story behind the acquisition is an unusual one . Clifford House , formerly owned by Gripple boss Hugh Facey , was keen to sell the building to St Luke 's and constructed an impressive state-of-the-art home on grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by Charles Clifford . Many Sheffielder will know him for the dental hospital but he was once the chairman of the Morning Telegraph and Star . <p> St Luke 's staff have made alterations and currently are polishing off the final touches for it 's operational start on September 12 . <p> " Clifford House in maybe 10 years and the work that goes on there will be the main face of St Luke 's , " said Mr Hartland . <p> " For people who are sadly diagnosed with terminal illness , they 'll know if they approach Clifford House they are going to get care , support and advice which will get them through such a difficult time in their lives and make the most of the weeks , months or years they still have to live . " <p> St Luke 's are also offering space to other Sheffield charities with the ' same ethos ' as them along with hiring out space for conferences and meetings to raise extra cash for services . <p> The exciting new chapter is a complete contrast to what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing its doors . <p> He added : " Eight years ago , if you look at the front pages of The Star , this place could well have shut because our funding was so desperate . <p> " We had to lose staff and completely overhaul the structure , lose volunteers , change services and so on . <p> " It was incredibly tough . You feel responsible for what is a Sheffield institution which in what it does , is endlessly worthy . <p> " I remember a time when patients had to queue up for the toilet in the corridor , you had mold in the bathrooms and ceilings falling down you had all sorts of stuff going on and it 's a complete contrast . <p> " Staff still carried out the amazing and incredibly humbling work they did in more challenging environment . <p> This is as difficult a job as many out there and when staff who work here literally work in life and death . <p> " It 's a job in the sense it pays the bills but you feel you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need us . <p> It 's not like serving up a meal in a restaurant , we have one chance to get this right . <p> " We want to maintain St Luke 's for the next generations and make it the best it can be and I 'd like to thank all the amazing staff and the brilliant fundraisers and supporters .

 <h> Alex Moore <p> In the first of our General Election candidate profiles , we ask those running to be the Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough MP why they should get your vote . <p> Each candidate standing in the constituency this year was asked to send up to 200 words on their policies and why people should choose them when they go to the polls on June 8 . <p> Candidates are listed in alphabetical order . <p> Tomorrow : Sheffield Central . <p> Simon Clement Jones , Liberal Democrat <p> When I first left college I worked in the steel industry , starting out on the shop floor . I eventually left the steel industry to start my own company but I know how difficult it can be . <p> The Liberal Democrats will create a new ' start-up allowance ' to help budding entrepreneurs , who would receive ? 2600 over the first six months ( ? 100 a week ) of setting up their new business to help with living costs in the testing early stages . <p> This will help get small businesses off the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create more jobs for Sheffield . <p> I have previously served on Sheffield City Council for 11 years , and was finance cabinet member whilst the Liberal Democrats ran the council where I ensured that Sheffield money by freezing council tax . <p> The Liberal Democrats would save you money again and ease the Brexit squeeze by remaining in the single market . <p> The Government 's own estimates project a ? 60bn hole in the public finances as a result of leaving the lucrative single market , whilst the weak pound and rising costs are beginning to hit real people in the pocket . <p> Mike Driver , Workers Revolutionary Party <p> South Yorkshire was at the centre of the miners strike . The Government still hold onto the files for Orgreave when police were unleashed on the miners in 1985 . <p> Miners were picketing the coke depot . It was a massive confrontation . The state was against the miners . They did not want a general strike and the Trades Union Congress did deals . <p> That 's why they cover it up . The crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing can resolve it but revolution . <p> We 're standing for a workers state and socialism . We are standing 100 years since the Russian Revolution which was a huge step forward for the world working class . <p> We have to do it here -- zero hours contracts , cuts for the disabled , it 's a crisis . <p> Labour has betrayed the working class because it wo n't get socialism . We are standing to build our party -- only a revolution can take us forward . <p> Gill Furniss , Labour <p> I was proud to have been elected as the MP for Brightside and Hillsborough last year to represent the area I was born and raised in . <p> Since being elected , I have helped with more than 3,000 local issues and held regular surgeries to listen to residents . During this time , I have witnessed the horrendous impacts that Tory cuts to our public services are having on our communities -- from the NHS crisis to cuts in local school funding . <p> After seven years of failed Tory austerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our society , their latest announcement of a ' dementia tax ' has caused deep anxiety and concern for vulnerable pensioners . It does n't have to be like this . <p> Labour will invest in young people and their futures , in the NHS and social care and has pledged to maintain the triple lock on pensions , the winter fuel allowance , and free bus passes for the over 60s to ensure dignity in retirement <p> Thursday June 8 is your opportunity to re-elect me as your MP , but also our opportunity to reject the cruel and divisive Tory agenda and instead elect a Labour Government for the many , not just the privileged few . <p> Christine Gilligan Kubo , Green <p> I have lived in Hillsborough for 24 years . I lecture in responsible and ethical business practice at Sheffield Business School and I strongly believe in an economy that works for everyone while protecting our natural <p> environment for future generations . <p> If elected I will campaign against insecure zero hours contracts , low wages and high rents and make sure our wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the funding they require to provide the services we need . <p> I support democracy and will speak out to ensure that we all get a say on the final Brexit deal . We want a deal that works for all of us and does n't remove or weaken vitally important environmental and social protections . <p> I would also support young people with free university tuition fees . <p> As a non-executive director of Sheffield Renewables I also support the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the face of climate change . I believe this would provide an opportunity in Brightside to use the engineering and manufacturing skills to create new green jobs . <p> The Green Party puts people and planet first . <p> Shane Harper , UK Independence Party <p> Originally from Rotherham , I moved to Sheffield around 15 years ago . A regular local election candidate , this will be my first Parliamentary campaign and I am honoured to have the opportunity to represent the people of my home constituency in Parliament . <p> This will be a baptism of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so I can help undo the 40-plus years of destruction the European Disunion has done to our United Kingdom . <p> Parts of my constituency have parallels with areas of Rotherham that I grew up in and I will be working hard to address the causes of the long standing and escalating social problems these areas have and find solutions to turn these areas around . <p> Brexit will take time to accomplish . <p> It is up to us in Ukip to ensure those tasked with it , complete it . <p> Michael Naughton , Conservative <p> I was born and raised in Sheffield . I grew up in a mining village , went to a local comprehensive school and graduated from Sheffield University . Sheffield is my home , and I care about our city and our people . <p> As a youth group leader , volunteer , and fundraiser , I have worked to make things better on a local level . I seek now to be a strong local voice to stand up for our city at a key moment in our country 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Theresa May wins this election , we will leave the EU and regain control of our borders and our country in March 2019 . <p> The best way to help her get the greatest possible deal for Britain is to give her the strongest possible mandate going into the negotiation process . A clear result in her favour will demonstrate to Brussels that Brexit will be crisp , clean - and successful . <p> We now need strong and capable leadership . Theresa May will deliver that . A coalition of chaos will not . I am standing to support Mrs May to get the best deal for Brightside and Hillsborough , for Sheffield , and for Britain . <p> Muzafar Rahman , Social Democratic Party <p> or ' Maz ' as he is known to his friends has been active in the local political scene and community for a number of years . <p> Born and raised in Sheffield , he knows first hand the issues of the people of the steel city . A local businessman , who has developed niche healthcare products he believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs . <p> He campaigned for Brexit in the EU referendum on the basis of democracy and equality . He has campaigned for a number of years for equality and clean air in the city , which in issue close to his heart . <p> " From a young age I have always been at the forefront of pushing for greater community cohesion , achieving the best I can and instilling my family with the same thought process , " he said . <p> " Radical elements in our communities need to addressed . I will stand up against extremism , I 'm a man of Sheffield and can see the division in the communities . I will work to stop this and I 'm not afraid to say how it is . <p> " The current crop of politician in Sheffield are scared to say how it is. " 
 <p> Sheffield United face competition from fellow promoted clubs Bolton and Millwall for the signature of Southend 's star man Ryan Leonard . <p> As The Star revealed last week , United had an initial bid for Southend 's player of the year rejected and an improved offer was also turned down , with Shrimpers chairman Ron Martin and manager Phil Brown determined to hold on to the 25-year-old midfielder . <p> Southend have extended Leonard 's contract by a further year , and Brown has warned he will not be sold on the cheap as his side look to build on last season 's seventh-placed finish . <p> " Things are bubbling along where Lenny is concerned but we 've put a not for sale sign on his head at the moment and will do all we can to keep him , " Brown said . <p> " The chairman has met with Lenny for talks but we 've had two more clubs come in for him from the Championship . <p> " There 's a lot of interest but we 've knocked back all the bids so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has warned that he wo n't hesitate to move on if a fee for Leonard , pictured above , ca n't be agreed . <p> " We 've done it the right way - we 've gone through the front door , I spoke to Phil and put a bid in , he 's recognised that and we 'll see where it goes , " Wilder said . <p> " If we come to a number we agree on and that we think is value , then we 'll get something done . <p> " But if it goes above that , then we 'll move on . " <p> Wilder , who has already signed Ched Evans , Nathan Thomas and Enda Stevens since promotion to the Championship was confirmed , is also interested in bringing Celtic winger Gary Mackay-Steven to Bramall Lane on loan . <p> The Scot was a largely peripheral figure as Celtic sealed the treble last season , and sources in Scotland suggest that United and Blackburn Rovers have made contact with the 26-year-old 's representatives . <p> United , then managed by Nigel Clough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Dundee United . 
 <h> Carlos Carvalhal celebrates his side securing a play-off place at Ipswich <p> Carlos Carvalhal is gearing up for another assault on promotion to the Premier League and says there was no doubt that he would n't be staying on at Sheffield Wednesday . <p> It was announced last week that the Portuguese had agreed a new contract - the length of which undisclosed - and now Carvalhal will set about his third attempt at ending Wednesday 's exile from the top flight . <h> Carlos Carvalhal <p> Preliminary talks have taken place between Carvalhal and Owls chairman Dejphon Chansiri with regards to their recruitment for next season , with a central defender and a wide midfielder featuring prominently on their list of targets . <p> And despite rumours of a return to his native country and newspaper reports in Portugal apparently offering credence to those whispers , Carvalhal is delighted to remain in Sheffield . <p> " I 'm happy here , " said Carvalhal . <p> " Even in Portugal , there were a lot of rumours that I had a chance to go to Porto . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They are a big club in Europe who play a lot in the Champions League . A lot of clubs talked about me in the press . <p> " I never had any doubt that I would stay here . I like to be here and to work with my players . I have a good feeling with them .

 <h> General Election 2017 : Sheffield Central candidate profiles <h> General Election 2017 : candidates for Sheffield Central <h> Alex Moore <p> In the second of our General Election candidate profiles , we ask those running to be the Sheffield Central MP why they should get your vote . <p> Each candidate standing in the constituency this year was asked to send up to 200 words on their policies and why people should choose them when they go to the polls on June 8 . <p> Candidates are listed in alphabetical particular order . <p> Tomorrow : Sheffield Hallam . <p> Natalie Bennett , Green <p> It 's time for change in politics . The Green Party offers solutions for the people of Sheffield that will help build a caring , confident city . <p> In Sheffield Central you have a straight choice between Labour and Green . There 's no chance of the Tories or Lib Dems winning . <p> The Green Party will always resist privatisation of our NHS . We will support good local schools that are not just exam factories but prepare pupils for life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one fragile planet is n't a choice , but a necessity . <p> I will be a bold , confident voice speaking for Sheffield . For all workers to be paid a decent wage in a job that they can build their life on . For the small independent businesses that are the foundation of a strong , secure , local economy . For the renewable energy projects that offer huge opportunities for traditional and new manufacturers . <p> Greens want our young people to have the same choices and freedoms their parents had . Freedom of movement in the EU . Freedom from the crushing weight of student debt . The freedom that comes from a decently paid , secure job that you can build a life on . <p> Paul Blomfield , Labour <p> I stood for election in 2010 , after living and working in Sheffield for most of my life , to make politics work for local people . <p> As an MP , my annual ' Big Conversation ' and other activities have involved thousands of people in deciding what I do at Westminster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping secure tougher rules to limit spiralling debt , and won improved benefits for the terminally i 'll . <p> It 's why I forced ministers to think again about moving Business Department jobs from Sheffield to London . <p> But Sheffield needs more secure and well paid jobs . That 's why Labour will invest in the northern economy , increase the minimum wage and end exploitative zero hours contracts . And we will seek a strong future partnership with the EU to protect our interests . <p> There are other important issues too . The crisis in the NHS and public services is not inevitable . It is the result of choices made by the Tories . Labour would reverse the tax breaks for the wealthy and big companies , while supporting small businesses , to raise the money needed to repair the NHS , fund our schools , and restore policing levels to keep people safe . <p> A better Britain is possible . <p> Jack Carrington , Yorkshire Party <p> I have lived in Sheffield Central for six years , working jobs in everything from night-shift parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my current role as finance director for Make Votes Matter . <p> Briefly studied economics and maths at Sheffield University , before moving on to accountancy , and volunteering in the community ( Citizens Advice at Spital Hill , some projects around Park Centre , and others ) . <p> Though I believe in many things ( such as fair and equal votes , ensuring a global Britain emerges from a successful Brexit , opposing excessive criminalisation , and widening economic opportunity ) , real substantial devolution is both the core of what I am standing for at this election , and how the message of voting for The Yorkshire Party will be interpreted by parties &amp; decision makers after the election . <p> Taking decisions closer to the people they affect means more targeted , more efficient , and more accountable policy-making - and as dry as that can sound , it 's what will bring jobs and growth to Yorkshire and the regions left behind by Westminster . <p> Sheffield is my home , I want to see it able to prosper , and I am standing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that happen . <p> Dr Dominic Cook , UK Independence Party <p> I am married with two girls ; the youngest of whom will be joining her sister at infant school this year . I work for one of the UK 's largest water companies and care passionately about the world we live in . I love Sheffield , our vibrant multi-cultural city , nestled in amazing countryside . <p> I care about Britain and its standing in the world . Our laws and judicial system set the gold standard which many other countries follow . Yet our courts are often overruled by those in Brussels . <p> We have been a great trading nation and can be again if Europe did n't control who we trade with . <p> Britain is great ; that 's why everyone wants to come and live here . However immigration is too high and we are full up . This is why the NHS is on its knees , schools are grossly underfunded and there is a dire housing crisis . Yet being part of the EU means that we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are leaving the EU ' I hear you say . But are we leaving completely , a clean break ? This is exactly why UKIP is still here , it 's not ' job done ' we need to hold the government to account . <p> Shaffaq Mohammed , Liberal Democrat <p> Sheffield is an international city . I was born in Kashmir , Pakistan and moved to the UK aged four with my father who came to Sheffield to work in the steel mills . <p> My experience of representing this great city on the council and attending Sheffield University with students all over the world has shown me the value of internationalism and openness , which are under threat from this Conservative Brexit Government . <p> These ideals over openness and tolerance are shared by the majority of Sheffield Central constituents , who voted around 70 per cent to remain in the European Union last June . The Labour incumbent Paul Blomfield campaigned for remain but has abandoned his principles and voted against the best interests of the people he represents . <p> Sheffield Central constituency deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a strong opposition to Theresa May 's hard Brexit Conservative Government . <p> Robert Moran , Pirate Party UK <p> As a Sheffield resident for the past four years I have first hand experience of the issues that the city faces . Sheffield as a city and the north as a whole is too often overlooked by those in Westminster . If elected , I would give those in Sheffield Central back their voice and help the city to realise its potential . <p> If elected , I would vote : <p> - For a ' soft ' Brexit which includes continued freedom of movement , goods and services . <p> - To increase NHS funding and to prevent its privatisation . <p> - To nationalise the railways . <p> - To abolish tuition fees . <p> - To scrap Trident . <p> - To fight climate change by reducing the UK 's reliance on fossil fuels . <p> On a local level , Sheffield has seen a lot of regeneration in recent years . Unfortunately , there are still many areas of the city which have not seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment in deprived parts of the city so that everyone can benefit . <p> Sheffield also has a lack of appropriate jobs . I would push for more employers to relocate to Sheffield , and encourage the creation of new businesses which will employ those with degree level qualifications . <p> Steph Roe , Conservative <p> I am no career politician . I have experience of the real world working as a criminal lawyer representing people from all sorts of backgrounds accused of all types of crimes . I also run my own business and believes in opportunity and the success that comes from working hard . <p> Sheffield is a great city but there is so much that can be done to improve the city . Labour think they have Sheffield Central in the bag . But I think they are complacent , especially as so many people know Corbyn would be a terrible Prime Minister . Brexit is the key issue this time and the feedback I get from voters is that Theresa May is the only one they trust . <p> Here are my three pledges : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the country so we can stand together in supporting Theresa May to get the best possible deal for the UK in the EU negotiations . <p> 2 - I would use my experience as a criminal lawyer to focus on making the streets safer in Sheffield . <p> 3 - The Northern Powerhouse plan is helping to boost investment in Sheffield , but I want to attract even more jobs and investment to our city . <p> Joe , Social Deomcratic Party <p> Joe graduated from university with an honours degree in business management . Soon after he went on to join a FTSE 100 financial services firm . <p> Currently he is in a management position within Sheffield 's thriving metal industry . <p> Primarily educated in Sheffield , he returned to his hometown after brief periods of study in Spain , Scotland and America . <p> He has a large family in and around the Sheffield area which is the driving force behind his passion to support people and businesses in the Sheffield Central constituency . <p> " Sheffield Central is a youthful , vibrant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the other party candidates being airdropped in I thought ' will any of these people really understand the people ? How can anyone really " get " the issues and needs and opportunities here ? ' . <p> " Although I 'm only 24 years of age , I 've been around a lot and can see the issues and have got the energy to do something about it . <p> " Education and integration are key issues . I 'm a big believer in direct democracy and we can get real democracy when we leave the EU which is controlled by unelected autocrats. " 
 <h> Feature : ' St Luke 's is amazing ' - Sheffield woman tells of hospice 's ' brilliant ' care of husband in his final days <h> Bob and Anne <h> George Torr <p> A woman whose husband died in St Luke 's Hospice has praised hard-working staff from top to bottom and said : " The place is amazing , the staff are incredible . " <p> The Star , who went behind the scenes to meet the incredible staff who care for people in their final stages of life , met Anne Payne , 73 , who shared her sorrow of losing husband Bob of more than 44 years . <h> Anne spoke to The Star about the care Bob received in St Luke 's <p> A former sheep farmer from Stocksbridge , Bob was ' full of life ' and loved spending time with his grandchildren . <p> But Anne 's world was turned upside down when Bob was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013 . She said his illness ' rapidly deteriorated ' after some initial success with treatment . <p> Bob aged 72 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise the people who work there and the hospice enough . <p> " The staff were absolutely incredible . One of the most overwhelming impressions was everybody at St Luke 's not just the medical and nursing team but the whole staff . <h> Anne 's husband Bob spent five-and-a-half weeks at St Luke 's <p> " Right from the cleaners to the catering staff and receptionists , they were able to respond on a human level and more importantly able to see beyond the broken body and to respond to the real person that was still there . " <p> The pair met on a ' boring committee ' in Birmingham in the 1970s and shared many happy years together and also worked in social services fostering children along with the work on the farm . <p> " Bob was a very much a family man and he always supported his children and loved spending time with his grandchildren nattering on about sheep to them or making cupcakes and pancakes with them . <p> " He had a very dry , but wicked sense of humour at times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in something he had to get involved . " <p> When Bob was really i 'll , Anne recalled a time when staff wheeled him out in his bed onto the balcony so he could see the trees and the blue sky . <p> " I ca n't tell you how much Bob appreciated that , " she said . " The staff knew he was an outdoors person with this sheep farming and it was something small but it meant a lot . " <p> And Bob 's passion was noticed by staff . When Anne spotted a dog walking through the hospice corridors , a nurse said she could bring the farmyard to St Luke 's . <p> " The hospice helped me enormously . Even the small things made a big difference -- they not only cared for Bob in the most brilliant way they looked after me and they even said we could bring one of the sheep from the farm for Bob . <p> " I thought they were joking but it just showed how they would accommodate you . <p> " We ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd won at shows .

 <h> Police protect two Sheffield teenagers at risk of forced marriage <h> Suzanne Bluck <h> Claire Lewis <p> Court orders have been granted to protect two teenage girls deemed at risk of forced marriage . <p> The Forced Marriage Protection Orders for two girls , aged 15 and 17 , were issued in Sheffield after South Yorkshire Police presented evidence suggesting the teens were at risk of being forced to marry against their will . <p> Under the orders it is illegal for the girls to be forced to marry or to be taken out of the UK for their weddings . <p> Last month South Yorkshire Police secured similar protection orders for two Sheffield girls deemed at risk of female genital mutilation . <p> Detective Sergeant Suzanne Bluck said : " I am extremely pleased we have been granted the right to enforce the orders and protect both of the girls from forced marriages , which are against the law and can occur when either or both individuals concerned do n't give their full consent . <p> " This action shows our commitment to protect , work with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes as victims subject to forced marriages may have been promised from birth by families or agreed to the partnership at a young age without realising what it entails . This can then leave girls and women in situations where they are forced to marry men , who are often relatives , and become a victim of repeated rape , by their new husbands . <p> " I hope this court result sends out a strong message to firstly potential or current victims of forced marriage that we are able to assist and support you , but also to those who still subject their sons and daughters to this , that we will take positive action to prevent this from happening . <p> " Our main priority is to protect all members of our communities , raise awareness and encourage anyone who may be , or has been a victim , to report it to the police . " <p> Sheffield Council figures show that 18 children have been ' safeguarded ' over the last three years and helped to avoid marriages it is believed they would have been forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be devastating , and can include them being removed from their school , from their families and community , and sometimes taken out of the country . <p> " To help keep children safe , social workers work closely with schools and the police to share intelligence . A child protection officer with specialist knowledge in this area advises on cases and the best way to help children in each individual situation . <p> " Our work also involves raising awareness of the practice of forced marriage , and this is covered in the safeguarding training we offer to schools . All school staff are expected to attend safeguarding training every three years to make sure they stay updated on the best ways to keep vulnerable children safe . <p> " I 'd urge anyone concerned about this issue to contact us , and this can be done in confidence .

 <h> Ex-cop from South Yorkshire dedicates book award to victims of Manchester attack <h> Richard Venables <h> Robert Cumber <h> A former police officer from South Yorkshire who assisted at some of the world 's worst disasters has dedicated a book award to victims of the Manchester attack and their families . <p> Richard Venables was at the forefront of efforts to recover and identify bodies at tragedies from the 7/7 bombings to the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 . <p> His account of those harrowing experiences , entitled A Life in Death , was named non-fiction book of the year at the People 's Book Prize - a competition voted for by readers . <p> The retired South Yorkshire Police detective inspector received the honour in the week the Manchester bombing left 22 people dead and many more injured . <p> Mr Venables dedicated the prize to all those who had lost loved ones in the atrocity and at other disasters . <p> " This book is in recognition of the work that dedicated teams carry out when mass fatalities occur and I am so thrilled to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost loved ones in such tragic circumstances , " said the 59-year-old grandfather , who lives near Rawmarsh in Rotherham . <p> " My thoughts also go out to those who have lost loved ones and those who have been injured in light of the recent events in Manchester . <p> " Thank you to everyone that voted and supported me . It 's hugely appreciated . " <p> Mr Venables was working as a young police officer on the day of the Hillsborough disaster , and he says he was spurred by the events that day to dedicate his career to helping families caught up in tragedies . <p> He joined the fraud squad at South Yorkshire Police in 1993 and was given responsibility for disaster management . He left the force in 2002 to train senior managers involved in identifying victims of tragedies . <p> His work earned him the Queen 's Police Medal for distinguished police service in 2006. 
 <h> Lawyer to be the new head of Team Verrico charity <h> Paul Verrico <h> Stephanie Bateman <p> On June 5 Nick Cranfield will become the chair of Team Verrico , replacing Paul Verrico . <p> Paul , the founder of Team Verrico , will continue to be closely involved with the charity and remain a trustee . <h> Nick Cranfield <p> Nick is a lawyer and has recently returned from three years in Shanghai where he worked as Corporate Counsel Asia for Johnson Matthey .

Over the last year , Team Verrico has awarded grants to researchers at Addenbrookes Hospital , University of Sheffield and University of Brighton to help with their work on developing and improving treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nick he reflected : " I 'm honoured to be taking on the role of Team Verrico chair from Paul . He has put so much energy and passion into creating and establishing Team Verrico . The Trustees and Volunteers of the charity , none of whom receive any compensation , have been universally inspired by his example . <p> " Through our network of amazing volunteers and fundraisers Team Verrico has been able to give hope to many people facing extremely dark times . This has been done by proving practical help and support to those fighting cancer and their families . <p> " I am committed to ensuring that Team Verrico continues to do this . We will reach out to people facing immense difficulties and find a way to help . " <p> Meanwhile , Paul gave his thoughts on handing over the chair 's responsibilities : " Having cancer is a long , hard and mostly joyless journey which can endure past a bereavement . A dark tunnel of grief , guilt , anger , denial , fear , isolation and anxiety all colliding together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely proud of the progress made by a small group of friends to help others face this wicked foe . Since the charity 's inception , it has grown to a formidable entity which helps many people nationwide . <p> " It is , of course , nearly four years since Anna died . I 've thoroughly enjoyed being chair of Team Verrico and watching this little idea flourish ; now my young family needs to get out of the cancer tunnel ; it is the right time for me to step back and focus on moving forward in my own life with the children and spend my energy working towards a happy future . I shall remain a trustee and redefine my role , honouring Anna 's tenacity , courage and spirit without being defined by our tragedy . <p> " Nick Cranfield has been my friend for a decade ; we worked together at the law firm Eversheds Sutherland for several years . Since September 2013 , even when out of the country in the Far East , Nick would send me photos of him running the half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his solidarity to the cause .

I have a long record of campaigning with my Lib Dem colleagues on the things that matter , like school places and the protection of our natural environment against overdevelopment and fracking . <p> Before retirement I worked in the NHS for 28 years . Our health care system was once the envy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under serious pressure . <p> That 's why the Lib Dems are campaigning for the NHS to be properly funded by raising income tax one penny in the pound . Only the Liberal Democrats are being open with the public on this issue . <p> We would also lift the Tory 's one per cent cap on public sector pay rises , giving our nurses , teachers and police the pay boost they deserve . <p> Jeremy Corbyn 's Labour party are weak and divided . If you want a strong opposition to the Conservative Government who will fight for our NHS , our schools , decent homes and for an open , tolerant and united Britain , this is your chance . <p> John Booker , UK Independence Party <p> In May 2014 I was elected Sheffield 's first UKIP councillor . As a life long resident of Sheffield , I have worked tirelessly to help local people . Now I want to take the fight to Westminster . <p> You have been ignored for too long with the Tories and Labour coming and going without anything changing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a regional constituency organiser whose job would be to : <p> 1 - Bring more funding into the area . <p> 2 - Help the development of community groups . <p> 3 - Promote social well-being . <p> 4 - Citizens Advice assistance . <p> 5 - Computer ( IT ) training groups . <p> 6 - Sport and youth club development . <p> On a national level , I would : <p> 1 - Fight for the Brexit you voted for which includes full control of our borders and our laws , removing all control of the European Commission and the Court of Justice . <p> 2 - Introduce a fair and controlled immigration system . <p> 3 - Protect our free NHS and use the money from the bloated Foreign Aid Budget to help with improvements . <p> 4 - Support our service men and women . <p> 5 - Fight for a modern and fair democracy including proportional representation . <p> History tells us the Tories do not support northern industries , northern mining or northern workers . <p> Angela Smith , Labour <p> Voters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and we are as proud of our area as we are of our country . <p> It is that belief in South Yorkshire and in Britain that underpins the work I have done as one of the area 's MPs . I believe our values and our democracy makes us strong and that voters expect their elected representatives to defend Britain and what it stands for . <p> I will always do that . <p> I am an independent-minded person who lives locally and who knows that it 's important to fight for the communities she represents . That means fighting for adequate funding for our police , our NHS and our schools . <p> It also means working hard for new jobs in South Yorkshire . I have always done that and would continue to make it a top priority if re-elected . <p> Our area means a great deal to me and I hope local people will vote to give me another opportunity to represent Penistone and Stocksbridge in Parliament . <p> Nicola Wilson , Conservative <p> Nicola and her husband run their own business in Sheffield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she believed we need more people involved who have real life experience especially in business . <p> Having started her career on the factory floor for a Marks and Spencer supplier in Rotherham she has worked for various M&amp;S suppliers across Yorkshire for over 15 years prior to setting up a family business . <p> Nicola 's primary focus for Stocksbridge and Penistone is for the funding and performance of schools in the constituency . Due to previously poor Ofsted reports in many schools she will challenge and address what can be done to improve them and enhance the children 's education experience . <p> She will fight for a fairer deal for Stocksbridge and Penistone in all national funding formulae . <p> Nicola will work with the local police authorities to ensure that we are properly protected from recent increased incidents of theft and attempted burglaries in the area . <p> Nicola continues to work with local businesses to ensure they are given increased opportunities , such as the introduction of free wifi in Penistone Market Barn allowing traders to accept card payments . 
 <h> Treeton Club are Sheffield snooker league 's champion of champions <h> Treeton Club , John Smith 's Star Cup winners <p> Treeton Club are the Sheffield and District Assocoation Snooker League 's champion of champions . <p> The whole thing started last September with seven divisions of hopefuls aiming to win their divisions and then play off against the other divisional champions . <h> Wath Corner Pockett , winners of Sheffield Snooker Teams KO <p> The final finished well after midnight at Shiregreen WMC with the C Division champs Treeton beating Cueball Four ( A Division ) 3-2 to receive the John Smith 's Star Cup , the league 's original and oldest cup . <p> The final had started well with Rob Skidmore taking the first frame for Cueball in what was a close frame until the colours when a well laid snooker by Rob put him in charge of the board to take the frame . struck back with Terry Lilley knocking in the final black to level up . Andy Garner replied in kind for Cueball potting the final three balls to put them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Andy Price levelling things up once more . So it was all to play for on the last frame . The first effort ended with the reds tied up around the black which was over the pocket . A re-rack was agreed , possibly a first for a Star Cup final . Eventually Kevin Kell took the frame to put Treeton in front for the first time in the match , but at the only time that matters . <p> Shaun Wilkes took the first frame for the Corner men with some fine play . The next proved to be the frame of the night , probably of finals week . Having extended his 12 start to 20 Corner 's Jason Fox knocked in a 58 to lead by 78 and it looked frame over . However , Steeler 's Jason Evens had other ideas and immediately replied with a 48 , only breaking down attempting the last red down the cushion from distance . There was still enough on for the Steeler 's Jason to win though and he eventually took the last red with green then yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him to pot the green proved his undoing as although Corner 's Jason did not pot it , it finished over the pocket with the white behind pink for a snooker . The Steeler 's player failed to escape the snooker and with green over the pocket Jason Fox cleared up for 2-0 . But what a frame . <p> What proved to be the final frame was of a more tactical nature and went to the final pink before Corner 's Luke Whitfield took it to give Corner Pocket the frame and the trophy .

The seven innocent people that were killed and the nearly 50 that have been injured , their families and friends .

As the rest of us naturally panic and run away , you thrust yourself into the chaos to keep us all safe . <p> " Thank you . The security forces have foiled many such plots and we must do everything we can to support our country , our police and our security forces to prevent such attacks in the future . <p> " As we all know , this is the holy month of Ramadan ; it is a blessed time of spiritual reflection for Muslims -- a fact obviously lost on the monsters that caused this mayhem .

They prey because they are animals . <p> " It should n't even have to be said , but this is not Islam . Their warped view of the world does n't belong here in our country . Frankly , it does n't belong anywhere in the world . It should die with them . <p> " Yes , we will cry again . Yes , we will mourn again . And yes , we will hurt again . But every time this happens our resolve only grows stronger - to rid our country , and the world , of this scourge . We will unite again , stand proud again and continue to live happily and freely again . That is what they would hate the most and that is what we will do . "

 <h> REVIEW : New takeaway brings a taste of Nigeria and Mexico to Sheffield <h> 's Cookhouse in Abbeydale Road , Sheffield <h> Robert Cumber <p> There are few food fusions yet to be tested , but I have to admit was a new one on me . <p> That 's the combination on offer at the latest takeaway restaurant to spring up on Abbeydale Road , 's Cookhouse . <p> Strictly speaking , it 's not fusion . The menu is split into Nigerian and Mexican sections , with the former populated by pepper soups , plantain and rice dishes , and the latter by burritos , enchiladas and tacos . <p> The bright green decor is presumably a nod to the nations ' flags and football strips , but other than that - and perhaps their reputation for spicy dishes - there appears to be little to connect these two countries . <p> Our taste buds were too timid to tackle the transatlantic trek , so we stuck with the Nigerian side . <p> The Nigerian style chicken wings had a nice tang and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? 4.95 . <p> The red pepper and tomato sauce with the Jollof rice was deliciously moreish , and the fish on the side was well-seasoned but far too dry for my liking . <p> Being a big fan of goat , it was the asun grill which most excited me - grilled goat sauteed in onion and chilli - which we ordered with a side of yam . <p> The meat was delicious but again a little tough , and the portion could have been more generous . But it was the yam which was the biggest big let-down , being limp and lacking in flavour . <p> Overall , the flavours were generously spot-on and while the cooking of the meat and fish that night left something to be desired , I 'd happily give it another go . <p> Cost for two people with mains and shared starter ( delivery free ) : ? 19.40 
 <h> Presence of armed police <h> Armed police <p> I do agree with Jayne Grayson , the presence of armed police and the military on the streets , in shopping malls and even on the beach at Scarborough , makes most people , I suspect , feel very uneasy . <p> It would be a sad day for us all if it became the norm . To me I think that would send out the message that we are not defeating terrorism but only containing it . <p> We do n't see " beat coppers " any more which is a loss I think to public confidence . They were great gatherers of information of what was happening on their beat , and information is the bread and butter for our security people . <p> Anthony Fields <p> Barnsley Road , S5 <p> We 've been too tolerant <p> We 've all been too tolerant of Muslim extremism in Britain , especially when such extremists are so intolerant of our Judeo-Christian religious tradition , moral values and way of life . But the biggest culprits of all are Labour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly admitted Labour 's disastrous policy of uncontrolled immigration , which allowed in huge numbers of fanatical Muslims , was " really adopted as a way of importing more Labour voters " , and published electoral research does indeed show most Muslims vote Labour . <p> So no matter what they pretend , Labour wo n't ever curb Muslim immigration or clamp down hard on Muslim extremism as that is n't in their own long-term interests . <p> On the contrary , Labour would for obvious reasons be best served by the admission of MORE Muslims -- hence their preference for freedom of movement and open borders , and their recently-leaked plan to let into Britain thousands of " unskilled labourers " -- perfect cover for importing even more Muslim fundamentalists from rural areas of Pakistan , Bangladesh etc . <p> Steven R Harvey <p> by email <p> Cowardly attacks <p> Each time something horrible happens as in London on Saturday night we hear straight away of raids on suspects being carried out ?

Bella Newell and Luke Damon cast their votes with candidates Jake and Tristan Condie <h> Robert Cumber <p> Labour could be celebrating a landslide victory come Friday morning , according to a new poll . <p> But the latest results should be taken with more than a pinch of salt , as they represent the opinions of under-11s in Sheffield . <p> A mock general election at Carfield Primary School in Meersbrook today ended in a thumping victory for Labour , who took 270 of the 439 votes cast . The Green Party pushed the Conservatives into third place , with the Liberal Democrats left trailing in fourth . <p> Youngsters at the school chose candidates and campaign managers to represent each of the four parties , and they picked four top policies from the relevant manifestos which they felt would appeal to young voters in the constituency . <p> Headteacher Lorna Culloden said every child was given a vote on Wednesday morning in an effort to teach children about democracy and get them to engage with politics from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appreciate the freedom that they have in this country and the power that they have too and that must not be under estimated , " she added . 
 <h> Speedway : Josh plans to continue rich vein of form for Sheffield Tigers <h> Sheffield Tiger Josh Grajczonek . Picture : Marie Caley <h> Nigel Pearson <p> Josh Grajczonek wo n't delay over tweaks to his set-up as he bids to maintain his unstoppable form around Owlerton . <p> Last week 's 14-point haul in the 53-37 Knockout Cup beating of Edinburgh left the Aussie with 17 wins from 23 competitive rides since signing for Sheffield . <p> A heat 13 battle that night saw compatriot Sam Masters end Grajczonek 's 12-race streak of remaining unbeaten by an opponent at home and the Tigers number one is taking nothing for granted ahead of tonight 's visit of Newcastle ( 7.30 ) . <p> " Speedway is a funny old game , " said Grajczonek . " This week I could score badly so you have to be on the ball . Sheffield changes quickly , it was catching me out at the start of the year so now I 'm trying to stay on top of it . <p> " I have a big break between my second and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and it makes a big difference to how your bikes work . <p> " It 's all about concentration and making changes at the right times . <p> " At the start of the year I struggled a bit , I would n't make changes when I needed to , I 'd do it a race too late and would kick myself for playing catch up . <p> " It is good to have ( team boss ) Simon Stead there because he knows the track more than anyone . <p> " Nine times out of 10 , the bike feels right but you always want to go faster . <p> " We have been concentrating on watching what the track is doing and it has worked well over the past three meetings . " <p> , who also weighed in with 12 to help Tigers secure a point at Newcastle on Sunday , will be out to continue his fine form in the return . <p> Poole Pirates rookie James Shanes takes the place of the suspended Jack Parkinson-Blackburn for Sheffield .

 <h> Sheffield United : David Brooks prepares for the biggest moment of his international career so far <h> David Brooks has performed well for England . Pic Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> Twelve months ago , only his family , friends and Sheffield United 's coaching staff could provide a detailed lowdown on David Brooks . <p> But , as he prepares to represent England in this afternoon 's Toulon Tournament final , the teenager is now one of the most talked-about young talents at Bramall Lane . <h> David Brooks featured for Sheffield United last season . Pic Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> Brooks has made rapid progress since graduating from United 's youth system , making four senior appearances during a season which ended with Chris Wilder 's side being crowned League One champions . <p> Described as " the star of the show " on his debut for the Young Lions , Academy manager Travis Binnion believes the 19-year-old 's displays in France are the result of his " superb attitude " and work ethic . <p> " David can get goals and he can play that last pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have . He always tries to be positive in everything he does out there on the football pitch and is constantly looking to get involved . " <p> " On top of that , " Binnion continued , " He 's shown a superb attitude by continually chipping away at his weaknesses and also working on his strengths . Brooksy just wants to keep on getting better . You can see how training with the first team here , and playing for them too , has really brought him on . " <p> Brooks started Thursday 's 3-0 victory over Scotland , which set-up today 's meeting with Ivory Coast in Aubagne , before being substituted just past the hour . With Neil Dewsnip 's side leading 3-0 at the time , that suggests the United midfielder is likely to be handed a prominent role against Les Elephants . <p> " There are lots of people who deserve credit for bringing Brooksy on , " said . " To be fair to the lad , though , I think it 's time he took some himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's academy , is expected to feature when England face Venezuela in tomorrow 's under-20 World Cup final . <p> Speaking ahead of the contest , which takes place in Seoul , the centre-forward said : " We 've seen that Venezuela are a good team , " he revealed . <h> Harry Chapman spent much of last season on loan at Sheffield United : Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> " They 've been on the other side of the draw and are going along quite nicely . <p> " It will definitely be a tough game but if we can bring our best performance to the party , we will be just fine . " <p> Former United loanee Harry Chapman has also made the trip to South Korea and Calvert-Lewin , now of Everton , added : " " It 's what we 've come here to do , get to the World Cup final and hopefully we can go on to win it now , but I 'm just buzzing at the moment . We 've worked all year for this moment , it 's where we want to be . " 
 <h> Paul Goodwin <p> Two of Doncaster Rovers ' most senior players are coy when it comes to expectations for the new season . <p> Boss Darren Ferguson , who won back-to-back promotions with Peterborough United early in his managerial career , is almost certain to play down expectations of repeating that feat with Rovers - at least when speaking in public . <p> Rovers ' hierarchy has set out a five-year plan to be back in the Championship by 2022 . <p> Ferguson and his squad were motivated last term by a very clear objective to make up for last year 's surprise relegation and bounce back to the third tier at the first attempt . <p> And the feeling within the camp is that , following the completion of this summer 's transfer business , there will be enough quality at the club to potentially mount a challenge for successive promotions . <p> However , Tommy Rowe and Andy Butler are not giving too much away when it comes to specific goals and targets for the new League One season . <p> " I think it 's early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on analysing the end of the season , " midfielder Rowe told The Star . <p> " I think the media know what the gaffer is like , he 's got high expectations and as players we expect that as well . <p> " Come the start of the season we expect the best . <p> " There 's that goal of going again and the Championship is not far away so who knows ? " <p> Club captain Butler said : " Team-wise it 's about taking on that challenge . Nothing has been set in stone about what we want to do . <p> " Obviously as a group we 'd like to keep going . <p> " It has been done before but we 'll go about it our way and see where it takes us.

 <h> Sheffield United : New boy George Baldock hails pulling power of Chris Wilder after Blades move <p> New boy George Baldock says manager Chris Wilder 's passion and pedigree will help attract more players to Sheffield United this summer . <p> Baldock yesterday became Wilder 's fourth signing of the summer after joining from MK Dons for an undisclosed fee , signing a three-year deal . <p> The 24-year-old joins Ched Evans , Nathan Thomas and Enda Stevens in the arrivals lounge at Bramall Lane , with the likes of Ricky Holmes and Ryan Leonard heavily linked with United . <p> And Baldock admitted : " Sheffield United did n't need selling to me . I met up with the manager and the talk was all about football ; then my eyes lit up when I walked out , saw the stadium and imagined playing there for United . <p> " It 's different class and I ca n't wait to get going now . " <p> Baldock first encountered his new boss when he was on loan at Oxford , and Wilder was at Northampton Town . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , so I know him well and how he likes to set his sides up . It was similar at Sheffield United last season ; they were very hard to beat , very organised but also very exciting going forward . <p> " The manager is very passionate about United , it 's his club and that definitely rubs off on the players . But his record speaks for itself , too , and that 's another massive pull for players , like it was for me . <p> " There 's not only a belief in the club and the squad , but in the manager too . And that 's huge . " <p> Baldock , who has made almost 200 career appearances , played in both MK games against United last season as Wilder 's men won the League One title with a club-record 100 points . <p> " George is another to fit the bill of the squad we are looking to build here at Bramall Lane , " Wilder said . <p> " He is a great age and has great experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the pitch . <p> " We 've tracked him for a while , monitored his progress , and we 're looking forward to working with him when we return to pre-season training later this month . " <p> Baldock came through the ranks at MK Dons and later enjoyed loan spells at Tamworth FC and Oxford . <p> " I 'm absolutely delighted to have signed and committed my future to this impressive club , " he added .

 <h> Walkley all set for return of festival <p> Art , local history and activities with a sense of community are on the agenda as the Walkley Festival returns for its 16th year . <p> The two-week event opens on Saturday with a big festival launch at venues along South Road , from the library to the community centre on Fir Street between 11am and 4pm . <p> There will be stalls on the medical centre car park , as well as craft sessions and other children 's pastimes , both indoor and on Walkley Green . <p> Organisers the Walkley Forum are putting a particular emphasis on assembling a programme with a wide appeal for people of all ages . <p> Artists are opening their studios for visitors to look around , and there will be an art show at St Mary 's Church Hall from June 24 , under the banner ' Drawing Walkley Together ' . <p> The Walkley Feral Writers group is inviting people to join them to discover their inner poet or novelist , while the Beeches farm shop is running an exhibition in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Walkley Community Centre will be the venue for many of the attractions , with taster sessions in hula-hooping , clog dancing and long sword dancing all happening there . <p> Walks around the local cemetery , highlighting points of historical interest , are happening on July 2 , and festivalgoers can learn about beekeeping as well as visiting fairs at the Buddhist Centre and Spiritualist Church . <p> An open day with the alpacas of Holly Hagg allotments is likely to prove popular , too . <p> Meanwhile The Big Draw on July 1 forms part of the wider Ruskin in Sheffield festivities , encompassing a full day of free creative endeavours . <p> Artists will demonstrate their skills at at 11 locations between Howard Road and the Rivelin Valley , at various times between 10am and 6pm . <p> Activities include terracotta clay sculpture at the community centre , comic book drawing at Walkley Carnegie Library , and a ' drawing walk ' along the Rivelin Valley . 
 <h> Spiteful revenge of young and Remainers <h> Voting <p> For the past 12 months since the Referendum people like myself , a UKIP supporter who voted to Leave the EU , have been told we did n't have the intelligence to know what we voted for , were branded as selfish for ' ruining the future of the younger generation ' , and have also been accused of being bigots and racists . <p> It would appear the young people and spiteful Remainers have taken their revenge by plunging the country into turmoil . <p> After last week 's General Election we now find that we have a hung parliament after misguided voters lent their support to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party which has n't benefited anybody . <p> This selfish action has achieved nothing except to leave both Labour and the Conservatives without an overall majority at a critical time when Brexit negotiations are about to start . <p> Politics is indeed a dirty business , as at the start of her premiership Theresa May was bursting with statesman-like authority and confidence but , less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from beneath her feet . <p> In Sheffield , as expected , voters kept our city a Labour stronghold in spite of the fact that the council has no regard whatsoever for the views of its citizens . Sadly the constituency of Hallam , which was the last area in South Yorkshire , fell to Labour . <p> It would appear from the election results that large numbers of the gullible younger generation ( mainly students ) voted for Jeremy Corbyn believing him to be the answer to our country 's problems , apparently finding this man 's appalling record acceptable and falling for the bait of attractive manifesto promises that in all likelihood he would never be able to deliver . <p> One wonders what kind of people can vote for a politician who has shared platforms with terrorist organisations and called them ' friends ' , failed to condemn the IRA bombings , and voted against laws to counteract terrorism at least 17 times throughout his career . <p> I have to agree that the Conservatives held a lack-lustre campaign and , due to some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs May alienated many voters and shot herself in the foot by taking a gamble which unfortunately backfired in trying to secure a larger majority . <p> However , we must now hope that , with or without Mrs May as leader , the Conservatives ( for whom I voted for the first time in my life ) can pull things together and lead us successfully out of the European Union over the coming two years . 
 <h> Buy British : English football experience to remain at core of Sheffield Wednesday transfer policy <h> Newcastle United 's Scottish international Grant Hanley ( right ) is a known target for Sheffield Wednesday <p> Sheffield Wednesday will continue their policy of buying players who know what it takes to compete in English football as they get ready to bolster their squad for another promotion tilt . <p> Since his arrival and after a few disappointments in the foreign market , Carlos Carvalhal has been keen to ensure that those who come to Hillsborough have experience in dealing with the unique challenges that come from battling in the Championship . <p> While some clubs in the division have been scouring the globe looking for talent to bring to the EFL , the Portuguese head coach will not move away from the belief that British players , or at least those who have spent a lengthy period on these shores , are best equipped to get Wednesday back into the top flight . <p> So far the Owls have shown an interest in signing Newcastle United 's Grant Hanley and Middlebrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been in England since 2009 . <p> There have also been reports a ? 3million offer for Cardiff City skipper Sean Morrison was rejected . <p> While this does not mean that Wednesday 's scouts are only watching developments in the UK , the core targets will remain British . <p> " I believe ( transfer targets ) will be players who know what needs to be done in this league and know it inside out , " said Carvalhal 's assistant coach Lee Bullen . <p> " I think we will have identified traits in players that might enhance the squad and if we can find these in England with Championship experience then even better . " 
 <h> PCSO Josh Rowley . <h> Lee Peace <h> It is a long held complaint from members of the public that you do n't see as many bobbies on the beat these days as you used to . <p> But now South Yorkshire 's top cops have listened to these concerns and are in the process of modernising the force to put more emphasis on neighbourhood policing . This should mean residents see more of a police presence in their communities - as more officers will be tasked with getting out and about . But what is it like to be an officer on the beat in the modern day ? Reporter Lee Peace hit the streets of Sheffield with a police community support officer to find out . <h> Litter and drug paraphernalia strewn at a car park in the Wicker . <p> PCSO Josh Rowley is midway through answering some of my questions at Snig Hill Police Station when the interview has to be cut short . <p> Details of a breaking incident have come in over the police radio strapped to his shoulder . <p> Reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drinking on the roof . <p> We scramble into a police car and head straight to the scene in Kelham Island . <h> A man on the roof of the property in Kelham Island . <p> A member of the public tells us that a group of people have been occupying the building - believed to be a former community centre - for nearly two weeks . <p> Over the next 20 minutes or so PCSO Rowley shouts back and forth to two men drinking from cans of beer sat on top of the roof . <p> The men refuse to come down or even let the officer into the property . They are issued with safety advice before we have to move onto the next job . <p> PCSO Rowley said : " That was a difficult one . They were n't going to co-operate so you have to think is it worth bringing in a few officers , and then the situation could turn out even worse . <h> Counter-terror police carryout a raid in Kelham Island . <p> " Every person is different and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better to handle things calmly and diffuse it . " <p> He says the ability to adapt is key to the job . And these skills served him well when he saved the life of a man who was threatening to jump from the bridge over Park Square roundabout on Christmas Eve last year . <p> His quick-thinking earned him the South Yorkshire Police PCSO of the Year Award in February . <p> He said : " You start every shift with a plan of action , but then if you get a call like that everything changes , and you have to adapt . " <h> Glass in Kelham Island - evidence that a car window has been smashed . <p> PCSO Rowley is part of the Sheffield Central Local Policing Team which is made up of about a dozen PCSOs , a team of police constables and two sergeants . <p> The team covers a broad area taking in the city centre and other districts such as Upperthorpe , Netherthorpe , Kelham Island and the Wicker . <p> PCSO Rowley 's main patrol area is Kelham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car parks on the Wicker which have become a magnet for people taking drugs . There are cardboard boxes , drug paraphernalia and litter strewn around part of one of them . <p> " This is obviously used by a lot by the public so it is important that we tackle it . For something like this we would increase patrols and speak to the car park owners to offer crime prevention advice . " <p> He explains that patrols were also recently stepped up in Fitzalan Square in the city centre following reports of anti-social behaviour . Three men , aged 50 , 33 and 16 were later arrested on suspicion of drug possession with intent to supply and have been bailed . <p> Officers also make regular patrols to speak to homeless people in the city centre , which involves giving them advice about charities which can offer help . <p> He said : " You get to know people . But again you have to be careful how you deal with people . <p> " If you are too friendly then they may see you as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing an issue . <p> " It 's all about being able to communicate with people in the right way . " <p> He explained that he and his team of PCSOs are often called in to help officers dealing with major incidents . <p> This included assisting after counter-terror police swooped to arrest a man at a flat in Kelham Island two weeks ago . <p> He said : " This was obviously a big operation and there was a lot concern so we went out to knock on doors and provide reassurance . <p> " In the wake of the terror attacks we were also out on patrol more in the city centre to be a visible presence . " <p> While responding to incidents is simply seen as part of the unpredictable daily routine of being a police officer , things are changing within the South Yorkshire force . <p> SYP has around 2400 uniformed officers , 1500 of which are dedicated to responding to emergencies . <p> Assistant Chief Constable David Hartley recently said there was an ' imbalance ' between response officers and neighbourhood officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure the force has more of a focus on neighbourhood ' beat bobby ' policing rather than response units . <p> The idea is to work harder on crime prevention and ' nip problems in the bud ' before they escalate . <p> PCSO Rowley showed me an example of this . <p> He said : " We have had a lot of reports of car crime in Kelham Island with people smashing windows and grabbing items on display . <p> " So we are looking at putting about 30 signs up warning motorists not leave things visible in their vehicles . <p> " There are a lot of people who visit the area or park here for one day who may not be aware of the crime trends . But if they see the signs then they will know . " <p> As we walk around the area we come across two cars with smashed glass on the floor - evidence that the previous vehicles parked there had been broken into . <p> Ben McGarry , chairman of the Kelham Island Community Alliance , has been working with police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said : " There are so many new residential building and other developments springing up in Kelham Island that we need to make people aware of any issues that arise . " <p> PCSO Rowley added : " There are some developments which are not even finished yet and we are already talking to them asking if there will be things like CCTV . <p> " So that is a way of hopefully stopping crimes before they happen . " <p> With changes on the horizon in how the constabulary goes about policing our streets , PCSO Rowley agrees that increasing the focus on crime prevention is the right way forward but accepts there will always be a ' reaction element ' to the job . <p> The 24-year-old , who is originally from Doncaster , said : " You get to speak to people from all walks of life and find yourself dealing with all sorts of issues . But there 's never a dull day . " 
 <h> Firefighters at the scene of a recent arson attack at a Sheffield tower block ( Tim Ansell ) <h> Robert Cumber <p> New fire safety checks have been promised at council tower blocks across Sheffield in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy . <p> Officers from South Yorkshire Fire &amp; Rescue are due to begin the additional inspections , which the council described as ' purely precautionary ' , from Monday ( June 19 ) . <p> Sheffield Council said the fire brigade already assesses the buildings on a regular basis and daily checks are carried out by housing staff . <p> The new safety checks were announced today ( Friday , June 16 ) as the official death toll from the Grenfell Tower disaster in Kensington rose to 30 , with many more believed to have died in the inferno . <p> There has been speculation that plastic-filled cladding added to the tower 's exterior may have accelerated the spread of the fire , which ripped rapidly through the council building . <p> Sheffield Council has reassured occupants of the city 's 24 tower blocks that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of fire . <p> Councillor Jayne Dunn , cabinet member for neighbourhoods and community safety at Sheffield Council , said : " We know people might be worried if they live in a tower block and , while we do n't yet know why this terrible fire happened , I think it would reassure residents to know that the fire service will be conducting a risk assessment of all our tower blocks . <p> " This is purely precautionary . I also want to reassure people that the type of cladding used at Grenfell Tower , which is currently the source of such speculation , is categorially not used in any properties in Sheffield . All of our cladding is fire proof . <p> " We have also contacted tenants to remind them of our fire safety advice . Although we do n't yet know the cause of this tragic fire , we want to do all we can to ensure that our tower blocks here in Sheffield are safe . <p> " Once we know the reasons for disaster , if we need to change any arrangements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council said 21 of its 24 tower blocks have metal cladding , which it said is fire proof as the insulation consists of mineral and rock wool . It said there are fire breaks at the floor and party walls , creating what it described as a ' fire-proof box ' around each flat to prevent flames spreading . <p> It said the other three blocks are and have a separate metal fire barrier installed . <p> A former council cabinet member earlier this week raised concerns about fire safety in Sheffield 's high-rise flats . <p> Peter McLoughlin , ex-cabinet member for housing on Sheffield Council , complained about broken gates which are supposed to ensure there is space for emergency services to park in the event of a disaster . He also demanded reassurances the cladding used on the city 's council flats was not the same as that at Grenfell Tower . <p> Responding to his comments , the council said ' significant investment ' had taken place at all 24 blocks since the 1990s , with millions of pounds spent on measures to minimise the fire risk . 
 <h> South Yorkshire residents planning to celebrate the warm weather with a barbecue this weekend are being reminded to take some basic steps to ensure their party plans do n't  go up in smoke . <h> Sarah Marshall <p> South Yorkshire residents planning to celebrate the warm weather with a barbecue this weekend are being reminded to take some basic steps to ensure their party plans do n't go up in smoke . <p> South Yorkshire Fire &amp; Rescue say al fresco cooking carries a potential fire risk- but only if barbecues are used incorrectly . <p> Trevor Bernard , Head of Community Safety , said : " Many people will be taking advantage of the beautiful weather this weekend and after a week of rain , who can blame them . All we are saying is before you get started with the sausages and kebabs , take a minute to decide where you 're going to site it . Then , when the coals are properly cooled , dispose of them safely . " <p> The fire service has issued the following advice for anyone planning a barbecue : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from trees , shrubs and grassland <p> - Keep a bucket of water or sand close by , just in case <p> - Never use petrol or paraffin on a barbecue , only recognised lighters and starter fuels <p> - Make sure the coals have properly cooled before disposal and empty ashes onto bare soil , not into the bin 
 <h> English is the common language of tennis <h> Andy Murray <p> I do hope John is not castigating Andy Murray for requiring an interpreter to talk to the French media ( Your Say , June 10 ) . <p> The great Scot is far from being the only non-French tennis player unable to understand the language . <p> The French Open Women 's Singles finalists , a Latvian and a Romanian , were interviewed in English . <p> There is a simple reason for this . <p> English has always been the common language of tennis : the game originated in England and for most of the game 's history it was dominated by the USA , Australia , Britain and France , hence three of the Grand Slam venues being in English-speaking countries . <p> Many foreign players can be heard to urge themselves to " c'm on " and in most international tournaments the umpires call out the score in English as well as the language of the host nation . <p> As for foreign footballers ' command of English , football also originated in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Also , there is a huge incentive for foreign players to play in the Premier League , the richest in the world . <p> Our awkwardness with foreign languages could be partly due to our insularity while landlocked or countries seem to interact more easily with their neighbours . 
 <h> Many of us are n't that well off <h> EU Referendum <p> Re Susan Richardson 's letter , June 15 , YOU are the selfish ones and bigots and racists in some respects , as well as many ill-informed , ( not all thick as you put it ) . <p> The young and spiteful remainers have plunged the country into turmoil , you say . <p> The country was plunged into turmoil the day after the referendum result ( 51.9 per cent to 48.1 per cent vote ) . Hardly overwhelming by any stretch of the imagination , and something your dear Farage said before the result would be unacceptable the other way round . <p> Obviously being a pensioner like myself you are one of the " well-off " ones , you know , the " I am alright Jack ones " . <p> I have news for you , many of us are n't that well off . <p> With regard to the politics being a dirty business , yes I have to agree there . The Tories displayed all the " dirtiness " possible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual aided and abetted by the right-wing press . <p> Do you remember a comment by Margaret Thatcher which said that when personal insults are thrown at individual politicians it means that politically they have nothing left to say ? For once I agree with the lady . <p> The young are not as gullible as you seem to suggest , but in fact are waking up to the realities . Corbyn 's appalling record of dealing with terrorists pales somewhat now that May is wanting to be propped up by DUP . <p> Why was the Tory manifesto only lack-lustre in your eyes , but Corbyn 's was something that could n't be delivered ? <p> Did you not listen to the question more than once put to May about whether she agreed with leaving the EU -- you know the one she refused to answer ? I wonder why , could it be because she believes in remaining but puts power first . <p> Finally there has been a joke doing the rounds , " what 's the difference between a toilet and UKIP " ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the public have woken up to their agenda . <p> Their leave campaign funded by a youngish multi- millionaire who when asked why , answered something to the effect of " something to do " .

 <h> Sheffield cycle team pose at top of diving board as part of unique fundraising campaign <h> The cycle team on the 10 metre high board at Ponds Forge in Sheffield . <h> Lee Peace <p> A charity cycle team went to new heights to officially launch their fundraising appeal - by posing at the top of a 10 metre high diving board with their bikes . <p> The riders posed at the top of the high board at Ponds Forge International Sports Centre in Sheffield to promote their 60/600 fundraising scheme for the Alzheimer 's Society . <h> Steve and Julie Brailey . <p> 60/600 is the brainchild of Julie Brailey who is approaching her 60th birthday and decided that instead of throwing a party she would create an initiative to raise money money for a charity close to her heart . <p> Her idea was to get 60 people to raise at least ? 600 . <p> Her husband Steve Brailey , chief executive of Sheffield International Venue 's which runs Ponds Forge , and 11 of his friends took up the challenge and said they would cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 5 . <p> The ride is nearly 200 miles long and will start early in the morning in Whitby , North Yorkshire , and end up in Derby via Scarborough , Sheffield and Chesterfield . <p> Julie said : " What was initially a simple idea to involve family and close friends has taken on a life of its own , with fresh support coming from the wider community every day . <p> " A couple of participants are experienced riders but the majority are enthusiastic beginners keen to undertake the challenge for such a great cause that impacts so many people . " <p> Julie 's mother died of Alzheimer 's two years ago and Steve 's dad has since also been diagnosed with the disease , so they made the decision to raise money for the Alzhiemer 's Society , which funds research into treatment for Alzheimer 's and dementia . <p> The campaign already has the backing of Sheffield-based musician Steve Edwards , who holds a double Grammy nomination and a World Music Award . His song ' A Good Life ' is available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds going to the charity . <p> The 60/600 challenge has already raised more than ? 16 , 000 through various other events such as golf days , charity head shaves and charity walks . <p> Julie herself will also be taking part in the Great North Run in September . 
 <h> James Shield 's Sheffield United Column : For Pete 's Sake , think of the fans and fix the fixtures <p> Chuck Close touched on it , Gilbert O'Sullivan sang about it and Dr Seuss wrote a book on the subject , sort of , nearly half a century ago . <p> There is always , no matter how bad things seems , somebody worse off than yourself . <p> I was reminded of the saying when the English Football League released its fixture schedule for the new Championship season earlier this week . Sheffield United supporters expressed dismay after learning their team would be visiting Cardiff City , Queens Park Rangers and Fulham on Tuesday evenings . Meanwhile , across the city , Sheffield Wednesday fans were horrified to discover trips to Ipswich Town and Millwall had been handed exactly the same slot . <p> Followers of SKA Khabarovsk , newly promoted to the Russian Premier League , could be forgiven for cracking a wry smile at their angst . Located only 15 miles from the Chinese border , Aleksei 's side face 10,350 mile round trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the capital taking 19 hours , even if Vladmir Putin decides to pump billions into the country 's infrastructure , I suspect they wo n't be going there and back in a day . <p> That , however , does not mean the authorities in this country should be let off the hook regarding matchday planning . Because to do so would represent the same race to the bottom which , whenever public sector workers threaten to strike over their pay or conditions , some members of society seem so keen to organise . " I do n't get all of that so why should they ? " It 's short-sighted , myopic and self-defeating stuff . <p> There surely is no good reason , ( other than the concerns of the emergency services perhaps ) , why the calendar can not be engineered so people are not forced to make long or overnight midweek journeys , using private rather than public transport , to cheer on their respective teams ? Why derbies do not take place on festive or Bank Holidays when , as we know only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halt . <h> Moscow is a long way from Khabarovsk <p> It used to be a tradition . Which , to my mind , pretty much defeats the argument it is impossible to organise now . <p> Devising a computer program which factors mileage into the equation about who plays who , when and where , is surely not beyond the realms of possibility in an era of space travel and driverless cars ? <p> Implement this change and , if any clubs take issue with the concept , let them be named and shamed . 
 <h> Old mansion at heart of ? 17m social project in Sheffield <h> How Mount Pleasant could look after a ? 17m transformation . <p> This could be the ? 17m future of Mount Pleasant , a disused 18th century mansion in Sheffield . <p> Entrepreneurs Pennie Raven and Jonny Douglas have formed social enterprise Avenues to Zero and put together a bid for a huge redevelopment of the listed building on Sharrow Lane , Highfield . <h> Mount Pleasant would be a new Heart of Sharrow . <p> It could include 200 flats , shops , offices and a community skills club . The building is owned by Sheffield City Council , and the pair want to take on a 250-year lease to ensure maximum community benefit . <p> When built in 1777 , Mount Pleasant stood in the country but within sight of the centre of Sheffield , surrounded by farmland and overlooking the River Sheaf on a two-acre plot with stables and coach house . <p> Requisitioned by the Government in World War Two and listed in 1952 , the main building is today owned by Sheffield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years . <p> But Jonny Douglas and Pennie Raven -- who are among eight ' guardians ' who live there today -- have a plan . <p> They want it to form the centre of a hub featuring 200 flats , shops , offices and a community skills club , all with a strong social conscience . <p> Their project , called Avenues to Zero , is competing against five organisations to take control of the building and give it a new lease of life . <p> They are asking for a 250-year lease to ensure maximum benefit for the community and , if successful , will seek ? 17m funding from socially-minded investors to make it reality . <p> Jonny said : " Everyone we speak to including local initiatives , businesses and councillors is enthusiastic but we are very much in the hands of the council . <p> " We want to preserve and regenerate this incredible community asset for local people to enjoy . <p> " People need places to work , learn and play . We will create a vibrant heart in the neighbourhood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opportunities for local people . We will help local people set up business , projects , clubs and try out ideas . We will help provide our young people and youth things to do and places to go . <p> " We will make housing and independence accessible by rethinking the way we live and providing a range of housing and accommodation to meet all pockets , that by the very fact they live on site they help create the vibrant heart of the community we wish to create . " <p> The omens could be good . <p> Jonny and Pennie first discussed their vision with Sheffield City Council chief executive John Mothersole in 2012 . <p> He instructed the property department to work with them to find a suitable location . Initially they were shown a number of buildings , but none of them quite worked until they settled on Mount Pleasant . <p> Their vision is for six overlapping ' avenues ' , each focused on issues : food , housing , health , environment , skills and energy . <p> They will be the catalysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges ' . <p> Pennie said they had had " amazing " help from organisations that believed in them including Sheffield architects Bond Bryan who had helped with designs , produced images and drawn up financial and planning advice . 
 <h> Sheffield Eagles sweating on fitness of key men ahead of Hull KR visit <p> Sheffield Eagles are waiting on the fitness of several key players ahead of Sunday 's hosting of league leaders Hull Kingston Rovers . <p> The Eagles have found themselves low on numbers in recent weeks , which has resulted in several incomings to try and arrest their recent slide . <p> Matters did n't get any better for the Eagles with star winger Garry Lo and experienced half-back Simon Brown both picking up injuries in the recent defeat to Batley . <p> Both face a test to be fit for the weekend , whilst skipper Matty James and veteran centre Menzie Yere have also joined them in the treatment room this week . <p> " Garry actually broke his toe in the early part of the game at Batley , and he played on with it , " director of rugby Mark Aston told The Star . <p> " His shoulder is not as bad as first feared , so it is his toe that is our main concern . The discomfort he is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him later in the week . <p> " Menzie is struggling so the chances are that he wo n't be available for the weekend . Matty James is also struggling , he has done something to his hand . There are a few battered and bruised players . Simon Brown is also still a doubt with his ankle , his Achilles is giving him trouble still . " <p> It is n't all doom and gloom for Aston as winger Ben Blackmore and forward Kyle Trout both completed successful returns to the side last Sunday , whilst Will Hope is expected to shake-off a head injury . <p> Long-serving Duane is also making progress from a troublesome groin issue , but is n't expected to feature this weekend . <p> " There is never a good time , but you get towards the end of the regular season you certainly do n't want it , " Aston added of the injury crisis . <p> " Someone else has to take an opportunity now . We have some issues with injury , but also we are n't playing well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at other options . Will Duane be back for this weekend ? He is maybe a week or so away after the jab he has had . <p> " We do have Will Hope back this weekend , so there are one two coming back to us . We need as many as we can because it will be a tough couple of weeks . " 
 <h> Cladding from Sheffield flats sent away for testing in wake of Grenfell Tower tragedy <h> Harold Lambert Court . Google <h> Sam Jackson , Multimedia Reporter <h> Cladding from a tower block in Sheffield is being to see if it is like that used on Grenfell Tower . <p> The Government has received samples from 14 high-rise buildings in nine local authority areas where the cladding has failed safety tests , including a sample from Harold Lambert Court , in Park Hill , Sheffield . <p> The building is being checked by management firm Together Housing , and samples have been sent for analysis . <p> Sheffield Council confirmed that the city 's aluminium clad tower blocks will be tested for safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy . <p> The announcement comes after it was revealed that 600 tower blocks across the country have cladding " similar " to the tower in London in which 79 people are believed to have died last week when flames ripped through the building . <p> Authorities and councils across the country are carrying out safety checks on residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been given decorative cladding . <p> A Sheffield Council spokesman said : " We will be taking samples on all of our aluminium clad blocks . This is a further check to provide further reassurance to residents . " <p> Earlier this week , the authority announced the installation of sprinkler systems in all of its 24 tower blocks . <p> The council has said it 's already ' spent millions ' on fire safety in its council homes and improvement works have been carried out over the last five years . <p> The council will start consulting on a block by block basis later this year with tenants and leaseholders . <p> Some 21 of the council 's 24 tower blocks have metal cladding . This is fire proof as the insulation is mineral and rock wool , with fire breaks at the floor and party walls . This creates a fire-proof box around each flat to the external structure to prevent the spread of fire to other flats . <p> The other three are and designed to operate in the same way as the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier installed . 
 <h> Part of South Yorkshire flats complex to be removed amid safety concerns in wake of Grenfell Tower tragedy <h> Silverwood House . <h> Lee Peace <h> Parts of a high rise apartment complex in South Yorkshire will be removed amid fire safety concerns following the Grenfell Tower tragedy . <p> Tests revealed decorative window capping on the external stairwell windows at Silverwood House on Balby Bridge , Doncaster , was not up to the best fire safety standards possible . <h> An image of the Grenfell Tower blaze . <p> A Doncaster Council spokeswoman said it will now be removed as a ' precautionary measure in the interests of public safety ' . <p> She added the assessment showed that the capping was found to have some fire retardant properties - fire retardant means it slows fire down , but this is not as good as being fire resistant , which is the best standard . <p> The move comes after it was revealed that cladding from Harold Lambert Court , in Park Hill , Sheffield , is also being analysed to see if it is like that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which 79 people have so far been confirmed dead but this is likely to rise , Doncaster Council and its housing provider St Leger Homes have been working with South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue to review the fire risk assessment for the council 's nine high rise blocks of flats . <h> Harold Lambert Court . Picture : Google <p> Tests confirmed the cladding system used on all of the blocks is an external wall insulation render system which is not the same as was used at Grenfell Tower . It is fire resistant and meets the necessary safety standards . <p> So far cladding on 34 tower blocks in 17 council areas across England has failed fire safety tests , the government has said . <p> Jo Miller , chief executive of Doncaster Council , said : " Although we have not been advised that this decorative capping detail should be removed , we have decided to remove it as a precautionary measure to reflect that the health and safety of residents is our main priority , and hope that this helps to reassure residents . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added : " We have visited residents in Silverwood House today to explain the situation and to reassure them that we have carried out the necessary tests and will go beyond that to ensure their health and safety .

 <h> Man accused of murdering shopkeeper was suffering from drug-induced amnesia at time of attack , court told <h> Judith Ducker died 50 days after suffering serious head injuries during a robbery at Wellgate News in Wellgate , Rotherham <h> Sarah Marshall <p> A heroin addict accused of robbing and murdering an elderly Rotherham shop-keeper can not remember the day of the alleged attack due to suffering from drug-induced amnesia , a court has heard . <p> It is alleged that Storm Blueitt , 36 , hit 64-year-old Judith Ducker over the head repeatedly while she was behind the counter at Wellgate News in Wellgate , Rotherham at around 11am on September 1 last year , before making away with around ? 40 from the till . <p> He said : " A customer found Ms Ducker in quite a state .

" <p> Ms Ducker , who was suffering from terminal breast cancer at the time of the attack , suffered a fractured skull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital on October 20 . <p> During the opening of the trial today , prosecutor Nicholas Campbell , told the court it is the Crown 's case that Ms Ducker was not able to have essential cancer treatment as a result of the serious head injuries she suffered in the attack which would have extended her life . <p> Mr Campbell told jurors that the Crown must prove that the injuries inflicted by Blueitt , of Cambridge Crescent , Rotherham were a contributing factor in her death in order to convict him of murder . <p> He added that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that Blueitt intended to kill her , or that the injuries she is alleged to have suffered at his hands were her only cause of death . <p> When Blueitt was arrested he refused to answer any questions relating to the attack but had subsequently told the court he could not remember any of the events of September 1 , said Mr Campbell . <p> He added : " This is because of the amnesia he asserts he was suffering from on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been prescribed for him and taking other drugs that had not been prescribed . " <p> Mr Campbell told jurors that they were due to hear evidence from Blueitt 's friend , John Brittle , who said that Blueitt was a heroin addict who was taking both heroin and methadone in the run up to the attack . <p> He said it is the Crown 's case that Blueitt robbed the newsagents , which Ms Ducker ran with her brother for around 20 years , with the intention of stealing enough money for his next heroin fix . 
 <p> Sheffield United will continue to search for additional investors in the club after Kevin McCabe , Bramall Lane 's co-chairman , revealed discussions with interested parties were sparked by last season 's league title victory . <p> McCabe and Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud , his United co-owner who acquired a 50 per cent stake back in 2013 , " have had dialogue on looking at bringing other investors on board " , the Sheffield-born businessman revealed , as they prepare to return to the Championship after storming to the League One title last season . <p> " Football is a changing business and industry , and there are two big leagues in English football - the Championship , where we are now , and the Premier League . <p> " So when you talk about January transfer windows , it is at those times where perhaps those extra investors or investment can give you that kick to take you on . " <p> McCabe believes United 's foundations , as well as divisional status , makes them an attractive proposition . <p> " There have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signings since United sealed Championship status , added . <p> " They have n't led to any deals being struck yet , but we have had parties introduced , in part by the Prince and by ourselves . We are a great club and I think anyone who examines Sheffield United will see the infrastructure we have got , at Bramall Lane and at Shirecliffe and at Crookes . <p> " Together with the magnificent support we had in League One , which outstripped most Championship clubs , you can imagine that we will get gates approaching 30,000 next season - you can not fail to be observed .

" <p> He added that supervisors always assessed the risk before sending officers on jobs to ensure they were properly equipped . <p> The Police Federation , which represents officers across England and Wales , has called for harsher sentences for those who assault emergency service workers and has launched its campaign to Protect the Protectors. 
 <p> Neary , a lifelong United supporter , said : " I 've always gone to games with my family and , like any other fan , dreamt of being able to play there one day . To be able to do that , and to be able to lead the team out , was such an honour . It was an amazing experience and I 'd probably say it was the best day of my life . " <p> Neary , a centre-forward , was a key member of the squad which , after being officially partnered with the men 's team , went on to win the East Midlands Premier League title . A graduate of Northumbria University , she was also among five United players to be awarded scholarships in the USA before returning to South Yorkshire . <p> " It was tough playing football when I was younger because there were n't any role models for me to follow , " Neary continued . " There was also some prejudice about women being involved , I used to get teased a bit and although it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Things are really changing now , " she added . " We got invited out onto the pitch at the end of the season and it was great walking around , waving to the crowd . I bet there were a few people in there who used to take the mickey thinking ' look at them now . ' The women 's game is getting much better coverage now and the interest has really grown because we 've shown we can play too . " <h> Sheffield United Ladies impressed en route to the league title last season <p> To emphasise her point , Neary revealed how members of Chris Wilder 's squad , including captain Billy Sharp , goalkeeper Simon Moore and fellow defender Ethan Ebanks-Landell , have demonstrated their support for the Ladies ' efforts . <p> " I 've done charity and hospital visits with the players and they 've been brilliant , " Neary continued . " Billy always comes over now when he sees me , either at the club or out and about , to talk and ask how things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . We train at the academy , we get much more time to work on things and that 's helped us get the same bond as they showed last season . We always make a point of saying that we wear the United badge on our shirts so we 've got to go out there and give everything because we 're representing the club . "

But the Joint Committee of Clinical Commissioning Groups has decided to go ahead with the option , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night in Chesterfield , Rotherham or Barnsley . <p> This would affect 1 in every 10 children needing an operation in Barnsley , 1 in 16 children needing an operation in Chesterfield and 1 in 8 children needing an operation in Rotherham . <p> A business case proposing the future provision of children 's surgery and anaesthesia services in South and Mid Yorkshire , Bassetlaw and North Derbyshire was discussed . <p> A spokesman said the option , option two , had been chosen because " with careful planning to ensure we have the right staff in each hospital , and to make sure patients could get to one of the hospitals within 45 minutes ( as a national standard ) , we believe that option two would give all patients in South and Mid Yorkshire , Bassetlaw and North Derbyshire access to the same quality and standard of children 's surgery services . <p> They added : " We do n't think that option 1 would be sustainable as we would not have enough doctors or nurses to provide cover cross all sites meaning we would risk facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that option 3 would be challenging in terms of the increased amount of patients going to only one of two places . " <p> Option one would have seen Chesterfield continuing the surgery as well as Doncaster , Sheffield and Wakefield . Option three would have seen only Sheffield and doing the work . <p> Led by Commissioners Working Together -- a partnership between the eight clinical commissioning groups in our region - a review , case for change and business case have been developed over the last three years . Clinicians , service managers and patients have been involved in the work , which has looked at patient experience and outcomes , staffing levels and each place 's ability to meet the necessary standards for their service . <p> The public consultation took place between 3 October 2016 and 14 February 2017 and the findings and feedback received has been incorporated into the final business case . The independent report on the findings is available here . 
 <h> Ross Wallace <p> History suggests their recruitment drive will soon gather pace . <p> The Owls acted swiftly and decisively following Carvalhal 's shock appointment at the end of June in 2015 . Jack Hunt , Marco Matias , Lewis Price , Ross Wallace , Alex Lopez and Lewis McGugan were all drafted in by mid-July . Full-back Hunt and wide man Wallace remain key components of the team now . <p> And Wednesday wasted no time in bolstering their forward line last year , capturing Steven Fletcher on a free transfer on July 1 . Things also tend to hot up towards the back end of August at S6 . Key personnel have arrived during this period , including Daniel Pudil , Fernando Forestieri , Barry Bannan and Adam Reach . The Owls left it late to add Bannan and Reach to their squad , bringing the duo in on August 31 in 2015 and 2016 respectively .

" <p> The RSPCA has re-homed the pups and Brook received a caution for animal welfare offences . <p> A spokesman for Sheffield City Council , which rented the plots to Brook 's family , said : " Criminality is something we will not tolerate on our allotment plots , or indeed on any council-owned property . <p> " It does n't matter how long you or your family may have had an allotment - if you are found to be using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hand any evidence to the police . <p> " We are happy to work in partnership with South Yorkshire Police and others , to ensure that our allotments remain safe , family-friendly sites for the community to enjoy .

 <h> Daily Debate : Are you concerned by Sheffield Wednesday 's lack of signings so far ? <h> Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal <p> Some teams have made a lot of signings , others have made a couple and some , like Sheffield Wednesday , are yet to make any . <p> But does that concern Owls fans ? Do you think there should have been at least one new face in by now before pre-season training starts or are you of the belief that there is still plenty of time to bolster the squad ?

 <h> RSPCA release heartbreaking images of animals stuck in nets and warn many have died while trapped <h> Fox stuck in netting - RSPCA <h> Dan Windham <p> Heartbreaking images of animals stuck in netting have been released by the RSPCA to remind people of its dangers . <p> Figures show that the charity rescued over a thousand tangled animals last year . <h> Owl stuck in netting - RSPCA <p> The shocking photos show how easily animals can get tangled in sports or garden netting -which can result in fatal injuries . <p> In total , 1,032 animals were rescued from netting by RSPCA officers in 2016 . <p> The number of netting rescues RSPCA officers carry ou drastically in the peak of summer . Last year in <p> July , 198 animals were rescued after getting tangled in netting - compared to 20 in January . <p> From May to July last year , when the weather was warmer , 501 animals were rescued from netting - approximately five a day . <p> Sports netting , such as football and tennis netting , and pond and fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Recent incidents include a fox which became weak and died after getting his entire body severely tangled in goal netting in Cannock , Staffordshire ; <p> There was also a fox cub waiting next to his brother who had been fatally strangled by a goal netting in Stockport . <p> Llewelyn Lowen , scientific information officer at the RSPCA , said : " We hope that these photos will shock people and make them realise the damage that netting can cause . <p> " Sadly , it is something that our officers see an increase in at this time of year . Some animals survive , but very sadly many animals suffer fatal injuries , often as a result of struggling to get free . <p> " There have been instances , for example , of fox cubs strangling themselves to death because they have been trying to free themselves . <p> " It does n't take too long with them thrashing about trying to escape before they become seriously trapped and are then unable to free themselves . <p> " If they go unnoticed even for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net can cut off the blood supply to their limbs , damage bones where they have tried to frantically escape , or worst of all , they could be strangled to death . <p> " There is one simple way to prevent this from happening - please remove sports nets after use and store them safely away . It only takes a few minutes and yet it could save an animal from suffering a horrible death . <p> " Where netting ca n't be removed , such as pond or fruit netting , we recommend replacing them with solid metal mesh . " <p> When the RSPCA receives a call from a member of the public about an animal tangled in netting , itis classed as an emergency and the nearest RSPCA officer is tasked to go and rescue the animal . <p> If they can free the animal themselves they will carefully cut away the netting before checking the animal over . If they are not injured then they are immediately released back into the wild . <p> However , there are instances where the animal is so severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wildlife hospital for all of the netting to be cut away . <p> Lee Stewart is manager of the RSPCA 's Stapeley Grange Wildlife Centre , in Cheshire - wher suffering from net-related injuries are taken by RSPCA officers to recover . <p> He said : " We have had cases of animals so badly tangled that they are brought in with the netting still round their bodies and the only way to safely free them is to sedate them . <p> " Sadly over the years we have had many wild animals come into the centre suffering from injuries as a result of getting tangled in netting - most commonly foxes and hedgehogs . <p> " As these animals are nocturnal , they have normally been trapped and struggling all night and so by the time they are found in the morning , they often have very serious injuries and often need veterinary attention to sedate them and remove all the netting . <p> " It 's very concerning and we know first-hand that netting can cause devastating and life-threatening injuries to all sorts of wildlife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extra bit careful when it comes to tidying netting away or picking it up off the ground .

" I think that I can get more out of him .

This ca n't be right . Just looking at data misses the majority of the real work that schools do to help young people achieve their full potential . " 
 <h> FEATURE : Joe Root 's raring to get going as England skipper ahead of facing South Africa at Lord 's <h> Joe Root faces the cameras after being unveiled as England captain <p> After almost five months of waiting , talking and thinking about it , the day Joe Root has been groomed for his entire adult life is finally here . <p> July 6 . England v South Africa , at Lord 's . The England captaincy . The start of a new era . <p> An era which began , of course , 143 days ago when Root was officially unveiled as Alastair Cook 's successor to a media scrum in the familiar surroundings of Headingley , Yorkshire 's home ground which has changed immeasurably since he first walked through the gates as a 13-year-old boy . <p> As , it must be said , has Root ; the small , cherubic , baby-faced prodigy who once struggled to get the ball off the square , is now a powerhouse of world cricket . <p> Even if serious facial hair still eludes him , that boy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go now , " 26-year-old Root told The Star . <h> Root and Gary Ballance are close mates , as well as Yorkshire and England teammates <p> " We have such a big six months of cricket coming up , culminating in the Ashes over the winter . It 'd be wrong to put too much focus on that , of course , but it 's at the back of your mind . Always . <p> " But there 's a lot of very important cricket ahead of us before then , and we 've got to take care of two very good opposition in the meantime . " <p> First up are South Africa in a four-match series , before three against the West Indies as a warm-up to the winter 's Ashes Down Under . <p> South Africa are weakened by the absences of AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn , while captain Faf du Plessis is absent after the birth of his child - meaning Dean Elgar will join Root in making his captaincy debut at the Home of Cricket . <h> A younger Root in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Root 's is anything but ; he earned the moniker FEC ( or Future England Captain ) in the youth teams at Sheffield Collegiate , helped as much by comparisons to Michael Vaughan as a classy , flawless technique . <p> Captaincy experience in first-class cricket has been limited since then - he was nicknamed ' Craptain ' by teammates after Yorkshire lost - coincidentally , one hopes , at Lord 's - when Middlesex chased a mammoth 473 on his watch - but has promised to be an attacking , forward-thinking and proactive captain , mirroring his approach to batting . <p> His squad for the first Test has his hallmarks , too , with a recall for Gary Ballance ; the Yorkshire captain who he knows better than most . Despite being born a year and 5,000 miles apart - Root in Dore , Ballance on a Zimbabwean tobacco farm - the two played for Yorkshire 's Academy together , were ' capped ' on the same day and later shared a house near Bradford . <p> " I think it 's really important for captains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Star . <p> " Do n't try and become someone different . Rooty 's got the biggest job in English cricket and he definitely deserves it . <p> " I 've played a lot of cricket with him and we 've spent a lot of time together off the field , too . We 're good mates . " <p> Ballance 's selection is borne out out of runs , rather than cronyism , but doubts remain about his technique against high-quality fast bowling and picking him over Surrey 's Mark Stoneman , for one , was a brave call . <p> In Root 's tenure , there will surely be many . For now , though , the talking , the thinking , the waiting is almost over and a new chapter is about to be written .

 <h> Sheffield University ordered to tighten security at Foundry Bar after death of student who died after taking MDMA on night out <h> Joana Burns , 22 , fell fatally i 'll at The Foundry on June 6 , after taking MDMA <h> Sarah Marshall <p> The University of Sheffield 's Foundry bar has been ordered to tighten its security practices , after a 22-year-old student fell fatally i 'll on a night out there last month after taking MDMA . <p> Members of Sheffield Council 's committee agreed this morning that the bar could keep its license , but imposed 11 additional conditions in a bid to crackdown on drugs being brought into , and sold on , the premises in the wake of the tragic incident . <h> Sheffield Council have added an additional 11 conditions to The Foundry 's license , which include the use of an I 'd scanner on club nights , in the wake of Joana 's death <p> The conditions include the use of an I 'd scanner from 11.30pm at night on club nights from September 4 this year , and the introduction of sniffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four times in the space of 12 months from the beginning of the 2017 academic year . <p> However , an application from the Sheffield Children Safeguarding Board to suspend access to the venue to children aged between 14 and 18-years-old until a ' culture change ' has been brought in , was denied by the committee . <p> Chair of the licensing sub-committee Coun David Barker said it had decided to allow the Foundry to keep its license due to the belief it was a ' beacon of good practice ' for safety . <p> South Yorkshire Police 's acting superintendent , Steve Morley , applied for the license review due to his belief the premises were connected with ' serious crime ' due to the ' consistent supply and consumption of controlled drugs on the premises ' . <h> Joana Burns , 22 , had just completed a mathematics degree at Sheffield Hallam University when she took MDMA and later died on a night out on June 6 <p> This came after 22-year-old Joana Burns , who had just completed a degree in mathematics at Sheffield Hallam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ecstasy , on a night out with friends on June 6 . <p> She had been at Tuesday Club at The Foundry in the University of Sheffield 's students ' union building when she fell i 'll and later died . <p> Witness statements from Joana 's friends , none of whom were named , used in a report that went before the licensing sub-committee said the group of friends had all paid ? 7 for the drug as part of a ' final fling ' before the end of university . <p> One witness said Joana had taken half of the drug in a ' bomb ' before arriving at the venue , and had taken the other half in The Foundry 's toilets after smuggling it in . <p> Another of the group of friends , who had taken the drug on a couple of occasions , declined to take it on the night in question but said she warned the group that the substance they had looked ' too dark brown ' in colour , and smelt like hydrochloric acid . <p> Another student - a 20-year-old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll on the same evening . She remains in hospital , where her condition is now described as stable . <p> Chief Inspector Shakeel Ahmed told the meeting police are investigating claims the woman bought the drug from two unknown men on the premises . <p> Speaking on behalf of The Foundry , Leo , told the meeting there was no evidence that the venue had any issues with serious crime or drug dealing , and that it had a reputation for being ' hard to get into ' . <p> Mr added that Joana falling fatally i 'll at the venue , was the ' exception and is n't indicative of a management style ' that would have allowed that to happen . <p> The report stated that when the South Yorkshire Police licensing manager examined the venue 's drugs bin , where drugs found during security checks are kept , on May 31 that it was ' overflowing ' and had far more in it than normal . <p> A spokesman for The University of Sheffield said : " The University of Sheffield and its Students ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Sheffield Hallam University student . Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this very difficult time . <p> " Keeping students safe and well is our first priority and the Sheffield Students ' Union has advanced security provision , policies and safety plans in place that are regularly reviewed . Today 's licence review hearing concluded with Cllr David Barker outlining how Sheffield Students ' Union is a ' beacon of good practice ' for safety - operating at a standard to which other venues in Sheffield should aspire . <p> " At today 's hearing , the Sheffield Students ' Union proposed a number of additional measures that further support safety and security at the Foundry and we are pleased that they have been agreed . We are committed to working closely with Sheffield City Council and South Yorkshire Police to confirm these safety and security conditions , many of which are already in place . <p> " On the wider issue of drug and alcohol use by young people , the University of Sheffield and its Students ' Union is leading a campaign to proactively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue to highlight these concerns . We will continue to work with Sheffield Hallam University , South Yorkshire Police and other partners locally and nationally to share these messages with our own students and young people who visit us .

 <h> Sheffield Eagles left with problem position ahead of trip to London Broncos <p> Sheffield Eagles must find an answer to their half-back conundrum as they prepare to face London Broncos this Sunday . <p> Danny Richardson has been included in St Helens ' squad for tonight 's showdown with Hull FC , therefore making him unavailable for Mark Aston 's side . <p> Aston had expected the St Helens ace to fill the void left by the injured Matty Smith , and was ready to recall the experienced Simon Brown after a week out to recharge his batteries . <p> But Aston has now revealed a knee injury picked up in training could rule Brown out of the equation , whilst this season 's stand in half-back Elliot Minchella is also a doubt . <p> " I would imagine Danny will play for St. Helens , " Aston confirmed to The Star . <p> " As soon as Matty Smith picked up that injury , I knew that they would be looking at Danny . He 's next in line , and what 's great about Saints is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what the game should be about , blooding young players and showing them a development path . We helped by giving Danny 80 minutes last week , he was great but we will look elsewhere now . <p> " Simon had week off to freshen him up . He had some time to reflect on his performance , he came back in and trained really well at the start of the week . He had that burning desire to get back into the team , but unfortunately he picked up an injury to his knee . He did n't train mid-week , so we 'll have to leave it while Friday to see if he recovers . " <p> Brown has been a regular this season for the Eagles and has at times formed a good understanding with Minchella , who in recent weeks has slotted back into his regular slot at loose forward . <p> Aston can still call upon the improving Remy Marginet , but his partner in the halves looks likely to be regular hooker Matty Fozard . <p> " Someone else might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't be someone from St Helens , we just have the two in Greg Richards and Jake Spedding available again . I thought Remy showed some class the other day , he is starting to grow . If we have to play Matty Fozard in the halves , we 'll do that because Elliot Minchella is another one who is a doubt this weekend too . " <p> The Eagles travel to the Trailfinders Sports Club this Sunday , kick off 3pm. 
 <h> Sheffield dad whose son died in Iraq War defends Tony Blair <h> Bill Stewardson with a photo of his son Alex Green , who was killed in the Iraq War aged 21 <h> Robert Cumber <p> The father of a Sheffield soldier killed in the Iraq War has defended former prime minister Tony Blair in the wake of fresh criticism . <p> Sir John Chilcot , whose long-awaited inquiry into the invasion was published last year , today told the BBC Mr Blair had not been ' straight with the nation ' over his decision to deploy troops . <p> Bill Stewardson , from Woodhouse Mill , lost his son , Kingsman Alex Green , in January 2007 when the 21-year-old was fatally shot while escorting a convoy in Basra . <p> He told the BBC he was ' very ' by Mr Chilcot 's comments , claiming it was easy to try to ' vilify ' Mr Blair for taking what was a ' reasonable decision ' . <p> " I do n't believe that for one second and I 'm very disappointed that Mr Chilcot has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he 's spoken , " he said . <p> " I accepted a long time ago that Mr Blair acted on reasonable evidence placed in front of him and it 's oh so very easy to jump on that issue afterwards and try to vilify him for taking what was a reasonable decision . " <p> Speaking to the BBC , Sir John accused Mr Blair of relying on his ' belief ' rather than the facts presented to him , though a spokesman for the ex-leader said Sir John had made it clear he believed Mr Blair had ' not departed from the truth ' . <p> The Chilcot report found the case for the Iraq War had been based on ' flawed ' intelligence about weapons of mass destruction and that Saddam Hussein had posed no ' imminent threat ' to the UK. 
 <h> VIDEO : What does Chris Wilder think is Sheffield United 's best piece of business this summer ? <p> Chris Wilder has described the news that three of his most influential players are poised to sign new contracts at Bramall Lane as Sheffield United 's most important piece of business since gaining promotion back to the Championship . <p> A fourth member of United 's League One title-winning squad , wing-back Kieron Freeman , is expected to follow suit shortly . <p> The contracts have been verbally agreed , " Wilder said . " Everybody gets a little bit impatient and wants to hear about new signings every week . But these are just as big as anything else we 've done in the weeks that have passed . " <p> " To get the skipper to re-sign , and Basham , they are big players , " Wilder added . " It sends the message out that they are happy here and want to kick on . There 's still a bit of negotiation to do and I understand that . It 's their careers and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with this group . We know they can take the step up and lead us from the front . " <p> Sharp , Coutts and Basham made a combined total of 133 appearances as United finished on 100 points , 14 clear of their nearest rivals , last term . Wilder , who has inserted a clause which could tie them to the club for a further 12 months into their contract proposals , will now focus on reaching agreement with Freeman . <h> Sheffield United trained with the GB Boxing team at the English Insititute of Sport yesterday <p> " I 've spoken to Kez , " the 49-year-old , speaking during a training session at GB Boxing 's EIS base , said . " I 'll get him in the ring and beat him up if he does n't sign . Joking aside , he wants to stop . And why should n't he ? He was outstanding last year . <p> " We do n't want to drag these things on . I do n't want them to go because , if I did , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to an agreement with Kieron . " <p> Stearman 's arrival is designed to bolster United 's options at centre-half . Aged 29 , he started his career with Leicester City before joining Fulham from Wolverhampton Wanderers . <p> " Richard brings experience , " Wilder said . " Every manager I 've spoken to , they say Richard is a great character , a great leader and a great defender . It wo n't be as straight-forward next year as it was last and we all know that , at some stages of the season , we are going to need all those qualities . " <h> Chris Basham has " verbally agreed " to sign a new contract <p> With Swindon Town expected to complete the loan signing of Chris Hussey shortly and James Wilson also set to depart on a temporary deal , Wilder indicated Ethan Ebanks-Landell , Stearman 's former team mate at Molineux , remains a target . <p> " It was important we nailed it down in terms of experience , " Wilder continued . " I still think we are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - whether we play a two or a three . <p> " We 've not quite got as many centre-halves as Wolves have got but I 'd like to try and get another one in. " 
 <h> Sheffield United : Signing of Richard Stearman shows Blades are serious about competing in the Championship <h> Richard Stearman and Chris Wilder <h> Proven Championship experience . A decent age . Physically imposing . <p> Richard Stearman certainly ticks most of the boxes in terms of recruitment , for Sheffield United , who unveiled him on a three-year deal today after paying a " substantial , undisclosed " fee to Fulham . <p> Colleagues who observed him at close quarters remember him as the best player on the pitch in games , on loan for Wolves , against Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds last season . While United 's recruitment has focused on lower-league gems so far this summer , this signing signals their intent at having a serious crack at the Championship next season after last season 's League One title triumph . <p> " Richard was our number one target throughout the summer and I 'm delighted he has signed , " said Blades boss Chris Wilder . <p> " We 've been on the look out for a central defender who has played extensively in the Championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our group . <p> " Richard will undoubtedly strengthen us , he 's a calm influence in the dressing room and every manager who I have spoken to about him says he has outstanding leadership qualities and will offer 100 per cent commitment , on and off the pitch . <p> " He had other opportunities to pursue , but I am delighted we have managed to tempt him to Bramall Lane . " <p> In 2011 , the Republic of Ireland attempted to acquire his services as Stearman has an Irish grandparent . The 29-year-old made 18 Championship appearances for Wolves last season and will always be remembered at Molineux for his early goal at Anfield against Liverpool in the FA Cup . <p> But now , for both United and Stearman , it 's time to look forward and to , they 'll hope , a successful time together . 
 <h> Joe Root falls short of historic double ton but his England side stay in charge against South Africa <h> Joe Root leaves the field dejected after falling at 190 on his debut as England Test captain <p> Joe Root fell 10 runs short of his double-century before Stuart Broad and Moeen Ali took over with bat and ball to help England retain the upper hand against South Africa at Lord 's . <p> Sheffield ace Root , who marked his first day as Test captain with a century and resumed on 184 , could only add six more runs before Morne Morkel had him caught behind pushing forward . <h> But Root 's dejection quickly turns to pride as he acknowledges the superb reception from the crowd for his efforts <p> Root began day two of this Investec series with the most evident chance of a piece of history as he sought to become the first batsman to make two double-centuries at the home of cricket . <p> Instead it was Moeen who joined exalted company as he completed an all-round double of 100 Test wickets and 2,000 runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 87 in the morning session before taking his 99th wicket before tea and then his 100th straight afterwards . <p> That made him only the seventh player from his country and second-quickest behind Tony Greig to reach the elite benchmark . For good measure , he became the only man to round up the statistics in each column on the same day . <h> Joe Root chats with Stuart Broad as he get his teeth into his first attack as Test captain <p> Moeen and Broad - who already had the same double in safe keeping - were both in the runs and wickets to help England retain the upper hand . <p> That came after Morkel ended Root 's stay -- featuring 27 fours and a six from 234 balls -- having him caught behind pushing forward . <p> Root 's stand with Moeen was worth 177 - putting England in an advantageous position , considering they were 17 for two when their new captain first took guard . <p> Broad ( ) and Moeen bolstered England 's total despite a fightback from Morkel ( four for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the off-spinner posted his century of wickets by first of all turning one sharply to trap Hashim Amla lbw and then having Dean Elgar ( 54 ) caught at short-leg . <p> Theunis de Bruyn , who fell just two short of a maiden Test 50 in his second match , and Temba Bavuma responded admirably with a stand of 99 in South Africa 's 214 for five at stumps . <p> Morkel doubled up with the wickets of Root and Liam Dawson -- lbw for a second-ball duck in his second Test -- before Moeen and Broad took over . <p> Broad 's crowd-pleasing turn was a 45-ball 50 which he completed with successive pulled sixes off Morkel to add to his seven fours as he and James Anderson compounded South Africa 's frustrations in an entertaining stand of 45 from just 27 deliveries . <p> Elgar and Heino Kuhn negotiated four overs before lunch in which the former had one scare , when a direct hit from Dawson at mid-on would have run him out for only two . <p> Instead , it was Kuhn who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he edged Broad low to first slip . <p> Elgar was unperturbed , refused to let Dawson settle when Root first turned to spin , and reached his half-century from 90 balls by angling Ben Stokes down to third man for his eighth four . <p> But Moeen did for Amla and Elgar , and then Broad made it two wickets each when he had JP Duminy lbw to one that moved back up the slope . <p> Mark Wood was millimetres from a first Test wicket on his return after his ankle injuries , De Bruyn surviving on 31 via the most tenuous of umpire 's calls at the start of a new spell . <p> Otherwise , though , the fifth-wicket pair were largely untroubled as South Africa dug in to stay competitive - until Anderson was rewarded late in the day when he got one in the perfect spot and De Bruyn was caught behind off a thin edge . 
 <p> " He 's killing it in the Premiership too . I do n't know whether he has anything lined up in Poland but he would be mad not to go out there now because he has speed wherever he goes and can trap too . <p> " It would have been good to race him but it is what it is . I am sure Ricky ( Wells ) will be good guest . <p> " Maybe we can take advantage but I do n't think it will be that clear cut , all of their boys seem to be riding really well up there . <p> " It will be a tough one but every meeting is when you go away . We just have to make sure we 're on it and hit them hard from the start . " <p> The trip to Cumbria sees Grajczonek return to an old stomping ground that has plenty of good memories . <p> " The track and promotion are perfect , " he added . " Workington was great for me but I wanted to give Poland a go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Saturday track . <p> " Everyone at the club was awesome to me and I still get along brilliantly with Laura ( Morgan , owner ) and Jacko ( Tony Jackson , team manager ) . You always see familiar faces and get a good welcome up there so I am looking forward to it . "

 <h> Andy Williams out to prove a point in final year of his Doncaster Rovers contract <h> Doncaster Rovers striker Andy Williams - photo : Dean Atkins <h> Liam Hoden <p> An Andy Williams with a point to prove could be a major asset for Doncaster Rovers next season . <p> That is the verdict of Darren Ferguson following his surprising u-turn in removing striker Williams from the transfer list . <p> After missing out on two or three forwards earlier this summer , Ferguson determined retaining Williams was his next best option , particularly with the positive manner with which the 30-year-old returned for pre-season training . <p> Not only will the striker be determined to prove Ferguson right this season , he is also in the final year of his contract meaning his performances will go a long way to determining his future . <p> " The thing with Andy is he 's always done well when he gets into the final year of his contract , " Ferguson told The Star . <p> " Whether that is a coincidence or not I 'm not sure but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his contract at Swindon , it was his best season .

 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : Owls new boy frustrated over lack of international opportunities <h> George Boyd <p> New Wednesday addition George Boyd has expressed his frustration at the lack of opportunities he has had to represent his country . <p> The midfield workhorse earned the last of his two Scotland caps over three years ago , coming on as a second half substitute in their friendly draw with Nigeria . <h> George Boyd <p> Despite being a mainstay of Burnley 's team in recent years , Boyd has continued to be overlooked by Scots boss Gordon Strachan . <p> The winger , who made his first Owls appearance in Tuesday 's 5-0 friendly win over Alfreton Town , told The Star : " I thought I would have been in the squad in the last few years but I have n't been picked . <p> " Automatic promotion is the aim ; I think all of the other lads will say the same , " he said .

Sometimes my heart literally aches with love for this funny little character I helped to create . <p> But even as her compliment hangs in the air , I brace myself for the question I know is coming next . <p> " So ... " she begins , right on cue . " ... when is the next one coming ? " <p> I grit my teeth and smile . I 've known this woman for all of ten minutes . We 're sat next to one another at a mutual friend 's BBQ and , so far , our conversation has revolved around the lovely weather and the delicious burgers . I 'd prefer that 's where it stayed . <p> " Ah not just yet , " I shrug non-commitally . <p> " You do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's lovely for them to be close together in age , and you want to be young enough to run around with them , do n't you ? " <p> ' Do I ? ' I think , with an inward sigh . I wonder if this stranger , who seems perfectly at ease probing into my personal life , is going to come around to my house at 3am when I 'm exhausted by all night feeds and colic with this second child she 's so keen I have . I remember that first year of parenthood all too well ; the most exciting and rewarding time of my life , no doubt , but also difficult to navigate , exhausting , and filled with worries I felt completely ill-equipped to handle . After nine months of giving my body over to pregnancy and a traumatic birth , followed by 18 months of breastfeeding , I 'm currently enjoying my body serving a purpose other than producing , housing and nourishing a small person - thanks very much and if it 's all the same to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breastfeeding bras to the back of my drawer in favour of underwear that is altogether more lacy and appealing ; my husband is thrilled and so am I. <p> After months of middle of the night feeds - precious as they were , examining every sleepy eyelash in wonder - 4am starts to the day and baby sick nightly all over my bed sheets , I 'm relishing the fact my little girl now sleeps for 12 solid hours , and evenings of nursing and cradling have been exchanged for eating dinner and getting lost in boxsets with my husband . <p> And instead of running along behind her unsteady steps on wobbly legs today , I 'm sitting here in the sunshine , eating my burger and watching the awesome kid I 've made play happily and independently . We 're doing a lovely job with her , if I do say so myself . She 's kind , polite , thoughtful , clever and funny . So why is n't that enough ? Why are people so obsessed with knowing when we 're going to be starting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just satisfy yourself that we 've already contributed one awesome little person to the planet ? And she 's just three years old , she is n't finished yet , and I do n't feel any desire to go back to the beginning and start all over again just now . We 're a family of three and perfectly happy . Thanks for your interest . 
 <h> A year in the life of guild with ambitions for Sheffield 's creativity <h> Jane Shields , pictured at the Des Amis Cafe , Sheffield . <h> Richard Blackledge <p> A society that aims to realise the potential of Sheffield 's creative sector has attracted hundreds of members in its first year , exceeding its leaders ' expectations . <p> The Sheffield Creative Guild was set up just over 12 months ago in the hope of boosting the profile and recognition of businesses , individuals and organisations working in a wide range of fields , from art and music to design , digital technology and literature . <h> Enjoying a creative guild party <p> Over 300 people have signed up so far , with those involved getting the chance to swap skills through a ' time bank ' , attend events and secure a listing in a special online directory , likened to a ' Yellow Pages of creativity ' for the city . <p> Jane Shields , the guild 's development manager , said the response had been ' better than planned ' and there was an ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract more funding . <p> " If you work in the creative sector , and if you work with creative people , then being part of this community is really beneficial , " she said . <p> The guild emerged from Sheffield 's unsuccessful bid to become the 2013 UK Capital of Culture , and was launched with ? 70,000 in funding from the Arts Council , the city council and both universities . <h> Pocket guides have been printed about the guild 's activities <p> Initial members included music producers , stonemasons and performers , but Jane said that , a year on , the society 's make-up reflected the breadth of Sheffield 's creative sector to an even greater degree . <p> " It 's hugely eclectic . You would expect artists , poets , makers and designers to come on board , which they have , but also consultants , people who work for small businesses , architects , designers , and people working in museums and heritage have joined . <p> " There really is a huge pool of knowledge within the guild . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like the time bank are that much more useful . " <p> More than 150 hours of time had been ' traded ' between members , Jane continued . <h> The Sheffield Creative Guild has members from a vast range of disciplines <p> " We were n't sure how popular it would be . Once people understand it , their eyes light up and they realise how useful it can be to them , especially as a freelancer . Once people have used it they have gone back and used it again and again . <p> " This time next year we will have traded a lot more hours with a lot more people involved . " <p> Guild members Laurence Peacock and Hollie Morrell developed Boris the Musical - a satirical production about politician Boris Johnson - with assistance from the guild . <p> " They had professional photos taken through the time bank . I know the guild has been really helpful to them . " <h> The Sheffield Creative Guild has members from a vast range of disciplines <p> More than 20 events have been held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other venues and happenings around the city , such as DINA , Theatre Delicatessen and Tramlines . <p> These are free to members , an offer that entices people to join and take out a subscription - a source of vital money , as the ? 70,000 ran out last year . <p> Jane said another funding application was being prepared , but added : " We now have to make a business model that 's sustainable financially . More members means more income ; it sounds quite crude but it 's true . " <p> A particular goal is to set up a ' library of things ' , a facility inspired by a service in London offering loans of equipment for creative purposes , avoiding the need for members to make expensive commitments . <p> " For example , if you run a theatre company you might need access to a set of theatre lights . " <p> A first anniversary party is happening tonight ( Thursday ) from 7pm at Yellow Arch Studios , , featuring live music , storytelling , stalls and food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ https : **31;98;TOOLONG for details .

 <h> ' Fight the fear of leaving London and embrace Sheffield 's talented workforce ' , city tells Channel 4 <h> Nick Bax , left , with Tom Law at Park Hill <h> Richard Blackledge <h> Channel 4 needs to fight the fear of moving from London and embrace Sheffield 's talented workforce , its ideal location and spirit of innovation -- leading figures in culture , technology and design have urged . <p> The calls come following the broadcaster 's response to a Government consultation on how to boost its regional impact . Sheffield has submitted an ambitious bid to move the group 's headquarters here to a site beside the railway station . <h> Laura Bennett <p> Channel 4 claims that , while there are benefits to being based outside the capital , it could face difficulties attracting the right staff and winning advertising , losing out to its rivals in the process . <p> However , members of Sheffield 's creative community say the time has come to change such perceptions about life outside London . <p> Nick Bax , founder of the Human design studio based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTV and watchmaker Swatch , said the city had to ' trade on its genuine assets ' . <p> " There are things about Sheffield that are different to other places -- it 's a great place to live and work . They are things to really emphasise . " <h> Cameron Spilman <p> He disagreed with any suggestion that Channel 4 would be unable to recruit staff with suitable skills . <p> In its response , the broadcaster said relocation would likely lead to a ' high degree of staff turnover ' , with the lost employees going on to ' strengthen competitors ' . <p> " Such talent could be replaced , but from a considerably smaller and less experienced pool of talent , " said Channel 4 . <p> But Nick argued : " We have two great universities here . That 's one thing big organisations around the city really like -- a supply of good-quality graduates on tap . We 're only an hour from other major cities from where people would quite happily commute , and have a much more stress-free day-to-day working life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick said he thought it would be ' fantastic ' for the broadcaster to move to Sheffield . <p> " I think it would be good for Channel 4 as well . They send a team here for the Doc/Fest and they love it , they know what a great city it is . " <p> Less than a month ago a major report , commissioned by Sheffield University , was published highlighting the strength of the city 's creative digital sector , ranging from video games to computer design . <p> More than 21,000 people are employed in the industry across the city region , said the report , which was written by consultant Laura Bennett , an enthusiastic backer of Sheffield 's Channel 4 bid . <p> " It would be amazing , " said Laura , who used to work for Tech North , a Government-backed initiative . <p> " There 's no reason why it should not be here , especially in this day and age of remote working . It 's entirely feasible for a company to be based anywhere . We just need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple benefits of living here . " <p> Laura said rents would be much cheaper in Sheffield , and recouped costs could be ploughed back into programming . <p> " They are essentially a public service broadcaster . If they do get money from the Government , why are they spending it on rents in London ? Their money would go further in Sheffield . " <p> Cameron Spilman , the founder of research and design studio Paper , on Penistone Road , said : " There is a diverse community of people who will thrive around a media hub like Channel 4 . It will build on our cultural capital and help inspire children to believe they can be part of something they 've only ever thought was locked away on TV sets and in London . <p> " The business community is equally diverse , particularly the digital sector , which is on the verge of become a major digital hub . To me it feels like the right time , and the right place . " <p> Nick said ' fear of the unknown ' could lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it 's the fact it 's not their decision -- that they 're being told they have to do this . The success of the BBC moving to Salford , and how it 's flourished there and helped the economy and creative industries , is definitely proof that it can work . <p> " It 's a bit like saying to young people or students : ' If you want to do anything in the media , or creative , you have to move to London . ' That 's just not the case any more . And I 'd hope Channel 4 would be advocates for that . " <p> And Laura concluded : " We have all the talent here and it 's a commutable distance to Leeds and Manchester . It feels very antiquated that everything needs to be in London . " 
 <h> Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder speaks to the media after his side 's 1-0 win over Malaga in Coin , Spain <h> James Shield in Marbella <p> Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder has made no apology for refusing to pay inflated fees for players during this summer 's transfer market . <p> But Wilder , whose team beat Malaga FC in a friendly last night , insisted United will prove competitive at Championship level next term , despite previously describing the competition as " a casino league . " <p> Five new players , including Ched Evans and Richard Stearman , have arrived at Bramall Lane since May as the 49-year-old 's squad prepares for August 5th 's curtainraiser against Brentford . Ryan Leonard and MK Dons ' Ben Reeves are also known to boast admirers at Bramall Lane . <p> Wilder , who hosted United 's co-owner HRH Prince Abdullah bin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud at the club 's training camp in Marbella yesterday , said : " I ca n't compete with what happens at other places in the division , where clubs are playing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting eleven or team . <p> " We 're at a different level but we are stable and sensible . We are n't going to go ' pop ' or have to sell the training ground . <p> " That wo n't happen and I ca n't let it happen . Because good people lose their jobs . <p> " I believe you can do it differently . " <p> Although United are considering an improved offer for Southend captain Leonard , Wilder refused to get dragged into a costly bidding war during their unsuccessful attempt to sign Ricky Holmes . <p> The Charlton Athletic winger agreed a new contract at The Valley before United 's flew-out to Spain on Monday after the two clubs failed to agree a fee . <p> Former loanee Ethan Ebanks-Landell , who had been the subject of talks between United and Wolverhampton Wanderers , has moved to MK Dons on a temporary deal after Wilder opted to pursue other targets . <p> " We 've got to find a different way to solve the same problem but I think there is a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are going to have to invest to get the better players . <p> " We 're all ambitious and we all know where we want to be . <p> " But we 'll do it in a way that suits us , suits the ethos of the football club and also what the players are about , in terms of their mentality and the academy as well .

Picture : Chris Etchells <h> Sam Jackson , Multimedia Reporter <p> Doncaster Sheffield Airport is one of the most expensive in the UK for dropping off and picking up passengers according to a study . <p> Research by Admiral insurance found is cost ? 6 for a 15 minute wait - more than any airport apart from Stansted and Luton . <p> Six airports charged nothing for a 15-minute stay . <p> Meanwhile , the most expensive parking was found at Luton airport , where a two-week stay in their standard on-site car park came in at ? 191 . <p> Exeter was the cheapest , where an equivalent space cost just ? 65 for the same amount of time . <p> The study also found Stansted charges the highest drop-off rate at ? 8.50 for 15 minutes , followed by Luton and Doncaster at ? 8 and ? 6 respectively . <p> Admiral compared three online car parking prices for an on-site space at each of 30 airports across the UK to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' postcode lottery ' for a 2.4 metre spot . <p> The average car parking rate for two weeks came in at ? 111 , although those flying from Luton will pay ? 80 more . <p> The second most expensive airport was London City at ? 181 , followed by Gatwick North at ? 175 and Gatwick South at ? 167 . <p> Those flying from Heathrow terminals 2 , 3 and 4 will pay ? 146 , and ? 10 more at T5 . <p> Admiral spokesman Alistair Hargreaves said : " We all know that an overseas holiday in the summer time can be costly , but our investigation has revealed that holidaymakers can end up feeling short-changed before they 've even boarded the plane . <p> " This study demonstrates that airport parking prices are a postcode lottery with extortionate price discrepancies for the same 2.4 metre-wide car parking space , depending on where you are flying from . <p> " By planning ahead and researching other car parking options , such as those off-site and factoring these prices into the total cost of the holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprises .

 <h> Hundreds of people sign petition calling for action over dangerous parking outside South Yorkshire school <h> Wales High School headteacher Pepe and Wales councillor and school governor Dominic Beck <h> Sam Jackson , Multimedia Reporter <p> More than 1,700 people have signed a petition to tackle congestion and dangerous parking outside a South Yorkshire school . <p> Students , parents and residents are calling for more car parking space and traffic calming measures around Wales High School , in Kiveton Park , Rotherham . <p> Headteacher Pepe said a number of concerns have been raised about the volume of traffic , dangerous parking and vehicles blocking access to the school and to driveways . <p> He said the situation is an accident waiting to happen and there had been three incidents already this year . <p> Wales High School is on a neighboring site with Kiveton Park Meadows Junior School and over the last five years both schools have grown in pupil numbers . <p> Mr said : " We have over 1,600 pupils and over 200 members of staff coming and going to school day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very busy place to be during drop off and pick up times . <p> " A number of concerns have been raised by students , staff , parents and the local community about the volume of traffic . <p> " Other issues that have been raised include vehicles parking dangerously and inhibiting access to the school and to resident 's drives . <p> " In the last year there have been three incidents , thankfully none of those have resulted in any injuries , but with the number of cars and children leaving and arriving at school we are concerned that there is the potential for an accident and we want to do something about that before it happens . <p> " We want to make sure that all students and visitors to school are as safe as they can possibly be and that people 's concerns are heard . <p> " We have already made some changes but feel more needs to be done . <p> " Therefore we have sent a petition , with over 1,700 names on , to Rotherham Council asking for more car parking spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The petition , which was presented at a full council meeting on July 12 , comes as a bad parking ' wall of shame ' has been created by members of the public angered by the situation in Kiveton Park and Wales . <p> Cars parked on pavements , across pedestrian crossings or on street corners , obstructing views for other road users , are among those earning their owners an unwanted place on the ' S26 Parking Wars and Wall of Shame ' Facebook page . 
 <p> They have been observing lessons , speaking with students and teaching for the first time in five subject areas including history and geography . <p> Assistant headteacher Joshua Fisher , who took part in the Teach First programme in 2011 , said not only were delegates getting vital training over the eight days they were in school , but pupils are also getting an opportunity to meet recent graduates . <p> He said : " We are delighted to have the delegates in school because we wanted as many of them as possible to see our school . This can only be good news for us further down the line . <p> " We also want to make sure our pupils get exposed to high-flying graduates . <p> " A lot of these students have been to Oxford and Cambridge and other top universities . <p> " We want to make sure our students have high aspirations and we believe this kind of thing is a great way of ensuring that . " <p> Mr Fisher said the students are adapting well to the delegates being in school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff and then the participants have been teaching bits of lessons , " he said . <p> " Over the last couple of days they have been taking full lessons . Our students have been brilliant and are working well . <p> " They are having conversations with the delegates about what they are doing and we have been encouraging the delegates to talk to students about university . " <p> The school offers students a range of opportunities to encourage them to continue with education once they reach 16 and consider university , as part of their ' raising aspirations ' agenda . <p> " They get a significant amount of careers advice and guidance , " said Mr Fisher . <p> " They get one-to-one meetings and we have great relationships with universities and run regular programmes and have visits .

 <p> Katy , aged 24 , of Leeds , who trained at the city 's English Institute of Sport during the early part of her career , described the route as " brilliant " which provided cyclists with " a unique opportunity to see their city from a different perspective . " <p> The event is the fifth of 14 free-to-attend HSBC UK City Ride events held across the country this year . <h> Excited riders set off from the start line . <p> It is being supported by British Cycling as part of their ambition to get two million people on bikes by 2020 . <p> Helen Webster , aged 42 , partnership manager for British Cycling , said : " The turn out has been fantastic . <p> " Sheffield is great for the outdoors and is becoming more and more popular with cyclists . " <p> Those taking part agreed it was a fantastic way to spend a relaxing Sunday . <h> Cate Johnson . <p> Cate Johnson , aged 60 , of Sheffield , said : " The roads are closed so you have a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are just starting out . <p> " I have not been out on my bike for a couple of years , but I dusted it off and came down here to take part .

" <p> Stuart Barrett welcomed a recently announced plan by Sheffield Council and Cycle Sheffield to improve access and safety for cyclists around the city , which could include new routes . <p> The 73-year-old , of Swallownest in Rotherham , said : " Some of the cycle lanes just come to a stop so it would be better if they were a bit more joined up . But what a great idea the cycle ride is . It brings people together . " <h> Helen Webster . <p> In addition to the main cycle ride , youngsters were also invited to test their abilities on the HSBC UK Go-Ride course , which featured a series of fun obstacles and challenges .

 <h> Is twenty plenty for city centre 's roads ? <h> 20mph zone sign <h> Richard <p> More than 300 streets in central Sheffield could have their speed limit cut down to 20mph <p> A 20mph speed limit is set to be rolled out on hundreds of streets in Sheffield city centre in a bid to reduce crashes and make roads safer . <p> The council has launched a consultation with the aim of bringing in a new zone on more than 300 roads in the middle of the city , encompassing nearly every street apart from a few major routes such as Arundel Gate , Derek Dooley Way and Sheaf Street . <p> Campaigners have given their backing to the proposal , which continues a drive to reduce speed limits in accident hotspots that has so far focused on Sheffield 's residential areas . <p> Highways chiefs say the measure is needed as the amount of people living in the city centre increases and important developments pick up pace , in particular the new retail quarter . Encouraging more walking and cycling , and the use of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The council hopes the zone will be in place by the end of the year , and has set a deadline of August 11 for people to comment . <p> Coun Jack Scott , cabinet member for transport and infrastructure , said it was ' always the plan ' to introduce a city centre 20mph zone . <p> " We thought it was best to concentrate on the estates where the traffic speed is higher , to lower the number of collisions and help keep people safe , " he said , adding that several crashes had given the project fresh urgency . <p> " It 's important that we take action . Most of the sad collisions and accidents in the city centre have involved speeding vehicles . It 's made us even more keen to look into it and consider the scope of the scheme . " <p> Ian Loasby , of the 20 's Plenty for Sheffield group , welcomed the consultation , saying it was ' long overdue ' . <p> He expressed some concern about 30mph sections that would remain - Eyre Street , Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are pleased to see the majority of the centre both retail and residential will now be a 20mph zone . This , of course , brings us in line with other major city centres such as Edinburgh and Birmingham . " <p> Fellow group member Simon Geller said : " Hopefully it discourages people from behaving irresponsibly , giving people a real choice as to how they travel around the city . " <p> The project will involve putting up signs at the zone 's entrances and on lamp-posts , rather than installing speed bumps , as cuts to funding mean such measures are no longer affordable . <p> However , Simon said : " The important thing is winning people 's hearts and minds - getting them to recognise that this is a good thing for everybody . The schemes that used to be put in , with bumps , have n't actually been very popular . They tend to annoy motorists . " <p> The group has been speaking to police about how zones in Sheffield are enforced . <p> " They have been ambivalent about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they can , " said Simon . <p> " With repeat offenders , they tend to want to do something about it . We know there have been cases where communities have been given speed guns to measure the speed of vehicles . " <p> He believed the key effect of zones was that the ' average speed of traffic comes down ' . <p> " If you 're behind somebody else doing 20mph it 's really difficult to get past them . It brings the speed of all traffic down . On most of the city centre streets you ca n't really do a lot more than 20mph anyway . " <p> Neighbourhoods that already have restrictions include Darnall , Gleadless Valley , Heeley and Stannington , as well as more than 80 streets extending from Greystones to Whirlow . Firth Park and Woodhouse are being considered too . <p> The local Green Party , which supports the initiative , said the city centre had the worst road safety record in Sheffield , claiming it had been ' left behind ' in favour of residential areas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean less air pollution and noise , which is very important in built-up residential areas like the city centre , " said City ward councillor Rob Murphy . <p> " We know 20mph zones produce fewer speeding cars , " said Coun Scott . " They also reduce the number of collisions , but perhaps most importantly they reduce the severity of them as well . If one does happen , it 's far less likely to be fatal at 20mph than 30 . <p> " We want to have a really vibrant city centre . If you look around it 's clear just how much is going on and how much growth there is . We want to capture it , and harness it , and use it in a really positive way .

If it 's not broken , do n't fix it . " <p> Sheffield student , Lena Ward , 44 , said : <p> " I absolutely agree with lowering the speed limit . There 's a lot of people trying to cross these roads as it 's one of the main shopping areas . Drivers are going about 20 anyway because it 's always quite congested so it wo n't make any difference to them . " <p> Paul , 49 , a cutler from Sheffield , said : <p> " I 've got mixed feelings . It seems a bit like the council are just finding ways to increase revenue . But if it 's going to save lives then obviously you have got to go with it anyway .

To be honest , I think the council are looking for any way possible to make money through fining people . " 
 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : 25 years on , the legend of Chris Waddle <h> Chris Waddle in action for Sheffield Wednesday <p> For a generation of supporters , he was the greatest player they have ever seen in the blue and white stripes . <p> Dare I say , that will be the case for a few of the older generations too . <p> A quarter of a century ago today , Chris Waddle arrived at Sheffield Wednesday . <p> And for 25 years since , signing after signing has tried in vain to live up to the magic he brought to Hillsborough <p> One or two Italians came close but Waddle remains untouchable in the modern history of the Owls . <p> Cards on the table , I am a member of that generation who holds Waddle in that God-like status . <p> When he landed in S6 for ? 1million from Marseille I was eight - the age when you 're at your most impressionable as a young football fan and most in awe of the heroes who play for your club . <p> He could do no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every game he played . His name was on the back of my shirt . I came close to wearing out the video copy I had of a brilliant documentary on his time at Marseille . <p> But 20-odd years on , as a much more cynical man and a lot more detached from Wednesday than I would have dared to think as a child , the majesty of Chris Waddle has not diminished . <p> He was the stand out individual , which took some doing in what was an excellent Wednesday team at the time . <p> Indeed , individual actually seems to be one of the best ways to describe him . Waddle seemed to operate on a completely different plain to everyone else . <p> He was playing his own game and it was as though he did n't have a care in the world . Shirt untucked , his play was just as casual , slowing down and speeding up on his command . <p> Opposition players would be left for dead as he ghosted in off the right onto his dynamite left foot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times he was simply unplayable , never more so than THAT game against West Ham - a 5-0 demolition where he turned the opposition into gibbering wrecks with his sheer presence . <h> Waddle , in typically relaxed mood at Wednesday <p> It was an iconic game and there were plenty more iconic moments - none more so than THAT free kick at Wembley . <p> The true significance of that goal - coming against the opposition it did - probably did not strike me at the time . But the brilliance of it did . <p> Inside the first minute , 40 yards out . United never expected him to shoot and stuck one man in the wall . Shoot he did , sending a bullet past Alan Kelly to score one of the most memorable goals in Wednesday history . <p> Iconic moments befitting of an iconic player . <p> He may have remained at Hillsborough a little too long , with Wednesdayites witnessing a decline you do n't ever really want to see from one of the best . In the end he went out on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sunset . <p> And Waddle may be remembered beyond the city limits for mullets and missed penalties . <h> Waddle on signing for Wednesday with then-boss Trevor Francis <p> But here , at least in one half of the city , his star continues to shine bright . <p> I know more than a few of you will have given thought , just as I have , to whether we will ever see anyone as good as Waddle play for Wednesday in our lifetimes . <p> In a brilliant interview on the podcast of journalist Graham Hunter , Waddle described the noise of the retractable wooden seats at Hillsborough clattering shut as supporters rose to their feet when he carried the ball forward . It was an evocative recollection of something that sums him up as a player . <p> He made onlookers stand up and take notice , captivated with a mixture of awe and anticipation for what he would do next . It was a pleasure to watch him in action . 
 <h> Sheffield United : Boss Chris Wilder hails character of new Blades <p> Manager Chris Wilder has hailed the character of Sheffield United 's new signings after they completed their pre-season tour to Malaga . <p> United spent a week in Spain ahead of the new Championship season , culminating in a 1-0 friendly victory over La Liga side Malaga on Friday night , in the Spanish town of Coin . <p> Backed by a large following from Sheffield , John Fleck curled home the only goal of the game and , ahead of tonight 's friendly at Chesterfield , Wilder said : " It was a great trip , very worthwhile in terms of the work we did and what the lads got out of it . <p> " People who think we 've been over here for a jolly up and a good time , they do n't know how we work . We 've done exactly what we do at home , only in searing heat <p> " The lads have all bought in , the new ones , to the group . <p> " They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others have got which is good . <p> United have brought in five summer recruits - Ched Evans , Nathan Thomas , Enda Stevens , George Baldock and Richard Stearman - so far , ahead of August 5 's Championship curtain raiser at home to Brentford . <p> Their pursuit of Ricky Holmes ended when the midfielder signed a new contract at Charlton Athletic , but Wilder remains very much in the hunt for Southend 's Ryan Leonard . <p> Malaga finished 11th in La Liga last season , beat Barcelona back in April and , just four years ago , reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League . And Wilder added : " Malaga are a good team , you can tell that . They 've got some quality players but I think we showed we 've got some quality players as well . <p> " I was pleased with how the lads went about their business . <p> " Back home , we 'll carry on working as we always do . I thought it was a really good workout for us , and I 'm sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank , sincerely , Malaga , the town of Coin and of course , as always , the fantastic supporters who came out to watch . " <p> Meanwhile , tickets still remain for tonight 's friendly at the Proact Stadium , priced ? 10 for adults , ? 5 for seniors 65+ and young adults 17-20 , and ? 3 for juniors U17. 
 <p> The council 's medium-term financial strategy has revealed back in October 2016 that ? 9.3m had been ' temporarily ' taken out of reserves to cover the gap in funding . <p> Some ? 9.8m of the government cash is being spent on council commissioned services along with an increase in ' take-home pay ' for council carers . Council bosses believe a pay rise will encourage more people to join the profession . <p> Just under ? 6m is set to be spent on bed-blocking and the transfer delays from hospital to care environments . The money aims to relieve pressure on the NHS . <p> Council and Sheffield hospital chiefs will be working more closely together to help systems under ' massive pressure ' . <p> ? 8.3m will be used to support existing services under ' significant pressure ' , including mental health and services for people with learning disabilities . <p> Coun Cate McDonald , cabinet member for health and social care , said : " We have no choice but to use part of this money to prop up services which are under significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts since 2010 and whilst we 've protected the funding for adult social care , we have faced increased demands for services and are structurally underfunded . <p> " Carers do a fantastic job looking after the people we love . We 're planning to use some of the funding to invest more in the services we commission , and will be working with our providers on this . <p> " The aim is that carers get more take-home pay , so that more people want to work in care in Sheffield , and stay doing so . This will mean the people who need it receive better care and more consistent care , which is what we all want . <p> " This extra funding , although welcome , does not compensate for years of budget cuts , nor does it properly recognise the scale of the additional demands on our services . But I want to reassure the people of Sheffield that we are doing the best we can to make sure they and their loved ones are cared for properly , and in a way that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding added : " We 've just heard that dementia has overtaken heart disease as the biggest killer and the council could direct some much needed cash to this area of care and respite for carers yet they close Hurlfield View . <p> " For the size of what Sheffield is and the huge challenges that we face , the figure is nowhere near close enough to fully support our most vulnerable . It 's absolutely a drop in the ocean . " 
 <h> Principal of The Sheffield College steps down after three decades in further education <h> Sam Jackson , Multimedia Reporter <p> The principal of The Sheffield College will say a fond farewell on Friday when she takes early retirement after more than 30 in further education . <p> Heather Smith is stepping down after two years in the top role - having worked her way up the ranks from a part-time teacher . <p> During her three decades at the college she has seen huge changes including the demolition of Castle College , the construction of the new ? 60m City campus and the redevelopment of Loxley and Parson Cross campuses into the Hillsborough campus . <p> But despite her continued passion for further education and her love for Sheffield , she is leaving to have a more flexible working life . <p> Heather , aged 56 , said : " My plans are to have a more flexible life . When you are committed to the college and all that it aims to do , it take up so much of your life , that it 's time now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep involved with education - some advisory and voluntary work , but I also want to have time for all the things I love such as running , cooking and coffee with friends . <p> " Sheffield has such a cultural side to it and has so many events , that I have sometimes missed , and I 'll be able to enjoy them now . " <p> Heather trained as a teacher and began her career teaching psychology evening classes at Richmond College , before moving on to become a full-time lecturer . <p> She rose up the ranks at The Sheffield College and was appointed head of general education at the former Castle College , now the college 's City campus on Granville Road , in 2007 . <p> She ran the Hillsborough campus in 2009 and that role expanded to include the former Norton campus and Peaks campus . <p> Heather was appointed principal of The Sheffield College in 2015 , covering all of the college 's four main campuses . <p> " Having that psychology background I have always been interested in people and workplace psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been really interested in how the workplace can be a better place and how we can make it the right environment for people who work there and feel thrive there and have a positive experience . <p> " It seemed like a natural progression to go into people management and think about organisational management . " <p> Heather firmly believes in the power of further education and its life changing impact on students , communities and businesses . <p> And it 's helping students progress and achieving the once unimaginable that are among some of her proudest moments at the college . <p> " To think about one moment that is my most memorable is impossible . It 's about seeing students overcome the odds and going on to do great things " , said Heather , who lives in Sheffield with her husband and teenage son . <p> " There was one A-Level student who had a very difficult time in his personal life . He had to drop out of school and asked us to give him a second chance . He did brilliantly and went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm also proud of how people have changed their careers . We have done a lot of work on enterprise and giving people the opportunity to set up businesses while they are studying . <p> " It 's fantastic to see then have that light bulb moment and they see that they can set up their own businesses and follow their dreams . <p> " We 've had some students who have been really successful . <p> " We had one student wanting to have a career change and came to us to study hair and beauty . She began to see a business and she set up one for Muslim women called Beauty Beneath which is now thriving . <p> " I 'm so incredibly proud of the student and what they have achieved . <p> " I 'm also proud of the way the college has developed its facilities . We 've gone from some really poorly equipped buildings , to some fantastic buildings which students can thrive in . " <p> Heather will be replaced by Angela Foulkes , who is currently vice principal for curriculum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela for being in the sector and she is very student centered and I know the college will be in good hands , " added Heather .

 <h> On trial helicopter cop accused of filming couple having sex was honoured for saving lives of two South Yorkshire boys , jury told . <h> Polly Rippon , Night Editor <p> A police officer accused of misusing his force 's helicopter when it was used to film people sunbathing naked and having sex was honoured for helping save the lives of two boys who were attacked in a " notorious " incident , a jury has heard . <p> Matthew Lucas was an air observer on the South Yorkshire Police helicopter when the boys were attacked by two other boys and left for dead in Edlington , near Doncaster , in 2009 , Sheffield Crown Court was told . <p> The jury was told by Mark Sorsby - a retired police sergeant who later became Lucas 's supervisor - that the officer received a commendation from the chief constable for being " one of the team that saved the lives of those children " . <p> The court has been told that recordings were made from the helicopter on four occasions between 2007 and 2012 - two of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a couple having sex in their back garden . <p> Another officer , Adrian Pogmore , 51 , has admitted misconduct in a public office but Lucas , Walls , Loosemore and Reeves deny the same charge . <p> Paul Greaney QC , defending Lucas , asked Mr Sorsby about his client 's character and professional conduct . <p> Mr Greaney described what happened in Edlington in 2009 - when 10-year-old and 11-year-old brothers attacked two boys aged nine and 11 - as a " notorious " case in which the two victims were " left for dead " . <p> Mr Sorsby said he had worked with Lucas in the air operations unit for 10 years - first as colleagues on the aircraft and then as his supervisor . <p> He agreed Lucas was a " highly professional officer " and was " approachable , happy and professional " . <p> Mr Sorsby said he had never heard Lucas suggest doing anything inappropriate . <p> The jury of six men and six women has heard how the footage at the centre of the trial was found among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only defendant present during all four incidents . <p> One recording , played to the jury , showed a couple who were friends of Pogmore having sex on their patio in a range of positions for around eight minutes . <p> Prosecutors said they were aware of the helicopter as they " brazenly put on a show " . <p> Another piece of footage showed a naked woman sunbathing in a large garden with two girls wearing bikinis . <p> A third clip showed a couple sunbathing naked on sun-loungers , and the fourth featured two naturists sitting outside a caravan on a camp site . <p> Prosecutors have told the jury that Pogmore knew the couple having sex as they " shared his sexual interest in the swinging scene " . <p> , of Crescent , Whiston , Rotherham , was described as " a swinging and sex-obsessed air observer " by prosecutors . He has admitted four charges of misconduct in a public office . <p> Reeves , of Farfield Avenue , Knaresborough , North Yorkshire , denies two counts of the same charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , denies one count . <p> Loosemore , of Briar Close , Auckley , Doncaster , denies one count . <p> Lucas , of Coppice Rise , Chapeltown , Sheffield , denies three counts . <p> Mr Sorsby was asked by Neil Fitzgibbon , defending Loosemore , whether it was possible to spot somebody " giving someone oral sex " from 900ft away in the helicopter . <p> The retired officer , who was deputy commander of the force 's air support unit , agreed it was not possible . <p> He also agreed it was not possible to tell whether people 's clothes were off or on from that distance and it was not possible to say whether someone was sitting on someone else 's lap . <p> Mr Sorsby agreed that the view on the helicopter 's camera - which the jury has heard can read a number plate from two miles away - was very different from what the crew could see through the window . <p> The officer agreed that Loosemore , who was not employed by South Yorkshire Police but supplied by a commercial firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorsby said he did not know Pogmore was a " swinger and a voyeur " , and agreed with Mr Fitzgibbon that it would make him " the least appropriate candidate to be in charge of a high-power camera " . <p> The court heard that Walls was in the Royal Navy before he became a police officer and joined the air support unit in 2000 after suffering an assault as he worked as a front-line officer . <p> Mr Sorsby agreed he was an " excellent " member of the team . <p> Keir Monteith , defending Reeves , told the court his client had 18 years service in the RAF during which he received a Queen 's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air . <p> Mr Monteith said Reeves worked in the commercial sector before he was head-hunted to be a police helicopter pilot . <p> He described an incident in which Reeves saved five people on board his aircraft when it plummeted , spinning to the ground after a drive-shaft broke . <p> The barrister said the pilot 's skills enabled him to bounce the aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " walk away " . <p> Mr Sorsby agreed that he had flown around 800 sorties with Reeves and had the utmost respect for his professionalism and integrity . 
 <p> Adam Reach 's second goal in three pre-season outings ensured the Owls maintained their 100 per cent friendlies record . <p> The left winger 's spectacular 25th minute goal was enough to secure Wednesday 's third successive victory as they continue their preparations for the new Championship campaign . <h> Owls v action in Albufeira <p> Reach was the standout performer in the first half at the Est ? dio Municipal de Albufeira and was a constant thorn in 's side . <p> " I 'm happy with how I have started pre-season and I want to keep my form going , " Reach told The Star . <p> " Results in pre-season are not the be all and end all but they are important because it gives you confidence . " <p> Reach played in three different positions last season ; left-back , left wing and up front . He found the back of the net on three occasions but is keen to improve his finishing . <p> He said : " I want to address goal-scoring this season . I know I can improve on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that mentality into me and the other guys . " <p> Hundreds of Wednesdayites travelled to the Algarve to cheer on the team and Carlos Carvalhal 's side almost broke the deadlock in the second minute . <p> Summer signing George Boyd slipped in Jack Hunt , who made a clever overlapping run , and the right-back 's fierce angled drive was pushed behind by Ricardo Ferreira . <p> Drifting in off the wing to link up with the attack , Reach was a real handful and forced Ferreira into a fine stop midway through the half . <p> Reach deservedly got on the score-sheet following a delightful move . <p> Morgan Fox raced forward down the left and his crisp pull back was coolly dummied by Boyd , allowing Reach to lash an unstoppable left foot shot out of Ferreira 's reach . <p> , who beat the Owls 3-2 in a training ground exercise last year , looked short on ideas on the ball . Wednesday were winning the contest in the stands and on the pitch . <p> Indeed , 's best spell came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agonisingly over the top . Substitute Dener also blazed over when he should have done better . <p> Carvalhal rotated his forward line at the interval . The impressive Reach was withdrawn and Sam Winnall also came off , with Fernando Forestieri and Gary Hooper introduced . Forestieri was stationed on the left but he did n't receive good enough service to weave his magic . <p> As the temperature gradually dropped in the Algarve , so did the quality on show . <p> Primeira Liga new boys should have equalised in the 63rd minute when Bruno Tabata was put clean through by a smart Fabricio pass but the forward 's composure deserted him at the vital moment and he side-footed off target . <p> Wednesday carried less of an attacking threat following a raft of second half substitutions but could still have extended their advantage courtesy of Forestieri . He dragged wide from near the edge of the ' d ' before Hooper was denied a sight at goal . <p> In the dying embers of the match , Manafa wasted a glorious chance to rescue a draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wednesday 's rearguard but sent his shot into the side-netting . <p> It was the final act of hard-fought friendly . <p> Reach said : " The mood is good in the camp . <p> " We have only brought in George and he has settled in really well . The rest of the lads were here last season so the team spirit and togetherness is high . <p> " We look forward to battling it out to get into the starting eleven come the first game of the season . <p> " I 'm sure there will be one or two additions to the squad but we know what the manager does . He brings in players who have a good mentality and a good attitude who will fit into the squad well . <p> " We are all just raring to go and looking to the first game of the season . "

 <h> Dave Simms ' Steelers Column : Prepare yourselves for Blaze of glory this coming season <p> Just over three weeks before the start of the season , on August 12 against Sodertalje at iceSheffield . I ca n't wait . <p> This Friday , the fixtures are released and we can all start planning our weekends for the next eight months . I ca n't wait . <h> Luke Ferrara <p> So as we all get excited I started thinking which fans around the league should be the most excited as the new year gets closer and closer . <p> I guess the real answer is we all should . Each of the 12 teams has upgraded , every team can have hope and aspirations for their conferences , a cup run or even a shot at the league title . <p> The one team that should , however , be more excited than most is the Coventry Blaze . This year , if they get it right , they will have a free pass back to the big time and challenging for the honours . <p> After years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new structure of the Elite League has given the Blaze a chance not only to win their conference but also challenge for the league title in a way the Braehead Clan should have done for the past four years . <p> The Blaze cleaned house after last year 's pitiful season . Deadwood out , fresh broom and a clean start . To date they have n't made a bad signing . Now do I think they will be better than Sheffield , Cardiff , Nottingham and Belfast ? No , I do n't . But here is the thing ; they do n't need to be . <p> If they can dominate their conference against Manchester , Guildford and Milton Keynes and then do the same in the Scottish conference against Fife , Braehead , Edinburgh and Dundee , the points they will amass will see them finish in the top three of the overall Elite League standings . <p> The Blaze , I believe , will be the best of the three line clubs , with those in the Steelers conference all playing four lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and the Blaze organisation , if they complete their recruitment to the level they have started . <p> Their risk is injuries . By carrying only 10 forwards , with former Steeler Luke Ferrara and Russ Venus fighting for the ninth spot , they need to stay healthy . <p> They also need to stay calm ; the Blaze are n't always good under pressure , which is what did for Braehead when they were in a similar position for the last few seasons . <p> Can they handle the nose bleed by being at the top ? It 's not a problem they had a decade ago but times have changed . <p> So whilst the Steelers , Panthers , Giants and Devils are killing themselves and each other every week , Coventry could - or should - be going about their business in a quiet and efficient manner . Top four in the league standings a must , I ca n't see anyway they can finish lower . They should be looking at top two and challenging for the biggest prize of them all . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they can take it . <p> I still think that one of the big four will find a way to win it , find a way to go 500 in the conference and then dominate out of conference . There are a few more out of conference games this season that may help . <p> Good luck to Liam Kirk , Cole Shudra and Kieran Brown this week . At iceSheffield the under 18s and under 20 national squads gather . Kirk and Brown are in both , and Shudra and the Under 20s . <p> It 's great to see the young talent coming through with those leading the way having a Sheffield / Steelers connection . <p> As I mentioned at the top , the fixtures are out on Friday . As a club we want to play more games at the Sheffield Arena , and we believe the fan base is big enough for more games . We believe that being our true home , where the games are faster , more exciting and with more atmosphere , is where we should be . <p> Dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . How good would it be to play 35 games a year there ? It 's possible - just as soon as the dates are made available . 
 <h> Darren Burke , Digital Reporter <p> The family of a Sheffield pensioner who has gone missing in Portugal are growing increasingly worried almost a week on from his disappearance . <p> John Joyce , 72 , has not been seen since last Friday when he was last captured on CCTV in the Portuguese town of Fatima . <p> Now his family have launched a fresh plea for information and urged people to check roadsides and in outbuildings , fearing he may have been injured by a vehicle or is sheltering from blazing sun . <p> Writing on Facebook , niece Catherine Hathaway posted : " This is the seventh day without any sightings and so my family now ask people to please start searching verges and the sides of roads assuming he is injured . <p> " Please also check sheds , outhouses where he may have gone in for shade and got trapped inside . " <p> She says her uncle went out without any money , bank cards or his passport . <p> Mr Joyce was attending a 6 day pilgrimage with the group he was travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lisbon from London Gatwick . <p> According to missing persons website the Lucie Blackman Trust , which supports British people overseas , Mr Joyce met the group for breakfast then went to a video screening in a small studio about 100 yards away from the hotel and after this the group went their separate ways . <p> He was last seen walking towards a museum about 11am . <p> Local police and the British Embassy in Portugal are understood to be helping in the hunt for Mr Joyce . <p> His family say he was last seen at 11am on July 14 , wearing shorts and a shirt and without a hat . <p> He is described as being of large build and about 5ft 6in in height . His hair is a crewcut style , balding and he is missing a lower denture . It is believed he was wearing black mid-calf shorts , a T-shirt and black sandals . <p> Alternatively , from the UK you can call the Lucie Blackman Trust on 0800 098 8485 or you can email any information to <p> Sheffield Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also being urged to look out for Mr Joyce . <p> The squad landed in Portugal on Monday lunchtime for their six-day warm weather training camp and are due to play three friendlies against , SC Farense and Vit ? ria de Set ? bal in the country this week . 
 <h> MP close to tears over death of Sheffield student <h> Claire lewis <h> An MP fought back tears as she spoke of how a 19-year-old Sheffield student who was killed by a drunk driver should have graduated this week . <p> Labour 's Liz McInnes became emotional as she told MPs about music student Bryony Hollands , who was mowed down two years ago while walking along a pavement in Nottingham . <p> Bryony , who was studying at Sheffield University and dreamed of a career in music therapy , should have graduated yesterday afternoon . <p> Ms McInnes , who met Bryony 's father Mark Hollands , from Maidenhead , at the launch of the Roads to Justice campaign , said : " Bryony 's killer was given an eight year sentence , of which he will serve four . <p> " Bryony was a 19-year-old music student and since her death her father has campaigned tirelessly for tougher sentences as well as raising funds for the music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins in his daughter 's memory . " <p> Speaking yesterday , Ms McInnes struggled to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has contacted me to say the family should have been attending Bryony 's graduation ceremony in Sheffield this very afternoon . " <p> Speaking in a summer adjournment debate in the Commons , Ms McInnes criticised the Government for not publishing a consultation on sentencing guidelines for dangerous driving , and said killers were treated ' leniently ' under current rules . <p> She urged the Government to ' make clear its intentions ' by publishing the consultation . <p> " Whilst the Government delays , families who lose loved ones in such horrific and entirely avoidable circumstances should not be made to suffer the added injustice of the killers being treated so leniently . <p> " I am keen that the Government makes clear its intentions as soon as possible for the sake of the victims and their families who have suffered enough .

 <h> David Allen charges back in explosive fashion with devastating KO of Tom Dallas <p> David Allen made an explosive return to action with a savage third round knockout that retired Tom Dallas in Essex . <p> The Conisbrough heavyweight had been out of the ring since losing to Lenroy Thomas in his shot at the Commonwealth title at Bramall Lane in May . <p> But the second go at ' Operation White Rhino ' began in the best possible fashion as he became the latest fighter to fell former contender Dallas . <p> And the third round stoppage looks set to be the last of Dallas ' career after he announced his decision to hang up the gloves following his tenth defeat in 12 contests . <p> While the result may not be the most eye-catching given Dallas ' recent form , the overall performance and manner of the knockout will have forced some in the heavyweight division to sit up and take notice of Allen once again . <p> He toyed with Dallas throughout , keeping his arms by his side and inviting the Kent man to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing and weaving to nullify his opponent 's attack before popping out the jab with decent accuracy . <p> He began to land a few good left hooks that rattled Dallas and suggested there would be an early finish . <p> That came 37 seconds into the third round . Allen swung in two hooks to the body before a superb overhand right that hit flush into Dallas ' jaw and crumbled into the canvas . <p> Referee Lee Every barely began his count before waving the fight off , handing Allen the 12th win of his career . <p> A rematch with Thomas for the Commonwealth title potentially awaits Allen in September in Sheffield with promoter Eddie Hearn continuing to provide a guiding hand . <p> However , he could also be set to settle social media feuds with Tom Little and Ian Lewison. 
 <h> Guiseley 0 Doncaster Rovers 1 - One of those days or reason for concern ? <p> Most pre-seasons tend to feature a game with a lacklustre performance , one which raises a few doubts about just how strong a team is heading into the new campaign . <p> The trip to Guiseley was one of those days for Rovers . <h> STAR MAN : Issam Ben Khemis <p> After an incredibly positive performance against Championship Derby came a lacklustre showing at National League Guiseley . <p> Liam Mandeville scored the only goal of the game - his fourth in as many matches in pre-season - but this was a rather forgettable outing from a Rovers perspective . <p> The swift , slick and incisive passing that characterised Rovers superb run to promotion last season was largely absent in a ponderous display that proved much more of a slog than likely expected . <p> They largely dominated possession and territory but lacked real creativity to undo a hard working Guiseley outfit . They also looked rather leggy . <p> To read to much into this of course - as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a long , hard and taxing pre-season so far . If there was going to be one game where a tired squad may have struggled for real motivation , this was it . <p> Rovers will likely be much better against Sheffield Wednesday on Wednesday night . They will certainly be livelier . <p> On that night , they will probably resemble much more of the side expected to start the season on August 5 . <p> And they will have to in performance as well as personnel if they are going to truly cement the good work of this pre-season so far . <p> Again on Saturday , boss Darren Ferguson took the opportunity to look at trialists . <p> Charlie Harris - formerly of Brighton and Barnsley - produced some eye catching passing but his workrate in the deeper lying midfield role was not up to standard . He simply did not work hard enough to find space to receive the ball . <p> In contrast , fellow uncontracted midfielder Issam Ben Khemis continued his impressive run in the Rovers side with an energetic attacking performance across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman . <p> Ferguson opted for the 3-5-2 system which worked rather well in the second half against Derby . <p> But the problems which characterised the first period against the Championship side were all too prevalent throughout Saturday 's friendly . <p> Rovers looked disjointed , with the three banks of players struggling to link up in the manner in which their manager expects them to play . It resulted in misplaced or negative passes with attacking play far slower than normal . <p> Perhaps the most positive trait that has come out of pre-season so far is Mandeville 's penchant for a good old poacher 's goal . <p> Two of his hat trick of goals at Armthorpe Welfare came from him sneaking in to mop up shots blocked by a defender or parried by a goalkeeper . <p> For a player Darren Ferguson has regularly urged to take more chances , his new found relentless streak in the box is welcome . <p> And he was at it again at Guiseley , bringing the only goal of the game . <p> Trialist Harris brilliantly struck a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxted , who parried , allowing Mandeville to nip in quickly and finish into an empty net . <p> On the goalscoring front , Mandeville is winning the race to partner John Marquis at the start of the season . <p> Guiseley - managed by former Rovers defender Adam Lockwood - caused problems , chiefly with their work rate and energy . <p> And they will feel somewhat unfortunate to have not got on the scoresheet . <p> Lively forward Reece Thompson saw a couple of one-on-ones saved while the confident John Rooney smashed three testing free kicks which forced both Marko Marosi and Ian Lawlor - who came on in the second half - into reaction stops . <p> Rovers had other opportunities to make their advantage more comfortable . <p> Andy Williams headed well over the bar following a superb free kick from Danny Andrew while Ben Khemis drew a decent save from Maxted after cutting in from the left . <p> Mandeville poked wide from a tight angle shortly after the restart while Tommy Rowe - who replaced the injured James Coppinger - drilled a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the box . <p> Substitute Alfie May drew a good reaction stop from Maxted after seeing an initial shot blocked but real chances were few and far between as the game wore on . <p> Ferguson declared afterwards there is still plenty of work to be done for this Rovers squad . And few would disagree . <p> But it is to be hoped the trip to Guiseley can be put down as simply one of those days . 
 <h> Rotherham United : Proctor back in battle of the Millers new boys <p> In-form striker Jamie Proctor is set to be handed the chance to fight off the challenge of Kieffer Moore in the battle of the Rotherham United new boys . <p> Proctor , who has scored four goals in four games since joining the Millers this summer , missed Friday 's 2-1 defeat against Sheffield United with a slight hamstring problem and targetman Moore grabbed his opportunity by turning in an impressive display . <h> Ryan Williams <p> But hot-shot Proctor should be back in the side for tomorrow 's pre-season friendly at Chesterfield as the two men bid for a starting role on League One August 5 opening day at Fleetwood Town . <p> " Procs got tight so he got pulled out of training . It was just precautionary , " said boss Paul Warne . <p> " He has n't pulled anything . He could have played against the Blades , and he wanted to play , but it would have been ridiculous to risk him . He will be available for Tuesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanderers , is favourite to make the team against Fleetwood , alongside another new recruit , five-goal David Ball , although Moore has done his own prospects no harm after arriving at AESSEAL New York Stadium on a season-long loan from Ipswich Town earlier this month . <h> Paul Warne <p> With Warne planning to send a team of youngsters to North Ferriby on Wednesday , senior Millers players have only two more opportunites to press their claims before league action begins - at Chesterfield and at home to Barnsley this Saturday . <p> Midfielder Ryan Williams , signed in June after being released by Barnsley , was another absentee last Friday , with what Warne described as " a little nick on his ankle " , and is also poised to return tomorrow . <p> " There 's a little bit of discomfort but the physio thinks he will be fit , " the manager said . <p> Meanwhile , Warne has praised the approach of another member of his strikeforce , Jonson Clarke-Harris , since the players returned for training nearly four weeks ago . <h> Jonson Clarke-Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on loan if he did n't apply himself and the 23-year-old , despite scoring only one goal , has responded to the warning . <p> " He has had a pretty good pre-season , " Warne said . " The other strikers have scored more but strikers dip in and out of goals . He has been competitive . <p> " He has been buying in to what we are doing . His attitude has been brilliant so I am not knocking anything he is doing . <p> " Whenever he gets his chance , he will try his best to score goals for us. " 
 <h> Man jailed after number of thefts from cars on Sheffield estate <h> George Torr <p> A man has been locked up after committing a series of thefts from cars on a Sheffield estate inside 24 hours . <p> Ashley Godber , aged 34 , of James Street , Masbrough , Rotherham went on a crime spree in the Handsworth area of Sheffield on July 12 . <p> The thief was arrested and charged the following day with three counts of theft from a motor vehicle , one count of vehicle interference , one count of failing to comply with a drugs test , one public order offence and breach of a Criminal Behaviour Order . <p> He was convicted of the offences and was handed a 14-week jail term at Sheffield Magistrates ' Court . <p> Acting Police Sergeant Ryan Griffiths based in Sheffield said : " Godber committed a series of vehicle crimes in the Handsworth area within a 24-hour period . <p> " This came after he was handed a Criminal Behaviour Order in March this year with specific conditions about not unattended motor vehicles without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some fast action by Sheffield officers , we were able to arrest Godber and charge him the following day ( 13 July with a series of offences . 
 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : Owls chief defends lack of signings <p> Time is running out for the Owls to strengthen their squad before the start of the new Championship season . <p> But there is no sense of panic from head coach Carlos Carvalhal . <p> Wednesday have made just one new signing this summer , recruiting experienced wide man George Boyd , pictured right , on a free transfer . <p> " We have not made too many signings so far because the market is very expensive and we have Financial Fair Play ( FFP ) to consider , " conceded Carvalhal . <p> Under FFP rules , second-tier clubs can lose up to ? 13m per season over a three-year period . Teams who breach the regulations face a transfer embargo . <p> Despite a hefty financial outlay and a sharp rise in the wage bill over the last two seasons , Wednesday have failed to secure promotion to the Premier League . <p> The Owls continue to comply with FFP guidelines and intend to keep it that way . <p> Carvalhal said : " There are teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FFP . <p> " They are taking risks by breaking FFP to try and get promoted . But if they do n't get promoted , they will be with an embargo . <p> " That is not our way . <h> Carlos Carvalhal <p> " We are under the rules of FFP and we ca n't go over the limit . <p> " You want to improve quality and to do that you need good players but they cost a lot of money . <p> " It is very difficult and tough to bring in players . <p> " We are very happy to have brought in George Boyd . He was a free . If we had needed to pay a transfer fee for George , it is possible we would not have brought him in . " <h> George Boyd <p> It was a rather revealing comment by Carvalhal on Boyd which may alarm some Wednesdayites . <p> But The Star understands there is still money in the transfer kitty for Carvalhal to reshape his team . <p> It recently emerged Wednesday had a ? 3m bid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since committed his future to the Bluebirds . <p> " We have our targets and know exactly what we want , " said Carvalhal . " We are following the rules and the chairman is doing things in the correct way . " <p> He insists he is not under pressure to sell his prized assets to balance the books . <p> Carvalhal said : " If the chairman wants to sell , he will of course talk to me . But if he has an offer and does n't want to sell , he will probably not talk to me about that because it is not necessary . <h> Dejphon Chansiri <p> " So far he has not talked to me about any offers for players . " <p> Much has been spoken of and written about Wednesday 's recruitment drive in the last two transfer windows . It has been far from perfect but no football club gets all their business spot on . <p> Carvalhal is just one of the pieces in the Hillsborough transfer jigsaw . He and his backroom staff are tasked with compiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global advisers . <p> Extensive background checks go into all transfer targets . <p> " We look at players all the time , " said Carvalhal . " We have three levels of observation . <p> " Some days we may analyse 30 players and that is no exaggeration . <p> " My video analysts look at the details of the player first . If the player passes through them , they will then go to our defensive coach Joao Mario Oliveira , for example . He will check on the player and if he says ' this player is good ' it comes through to me . We organise it like that as I ca n't see 50 players on my own every day . <p> " When the player comes to me , usually I do n't like to ask too many things . I want to see what the player is like with my own eyes . <p> " Nowadays , it is better to see the player live but we can watch clips and games all over the world . We can see a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday thought they had made a breakthrough in their search for new blood on Friday . <p> " We were given the green light to sign the player but the player did n't want to the play in the Championship , " revealed Carvalhal . " He plays for his national team and did n't want to play in the Championship . " <p> Carvalhal is not involved in negotiations with agents . He leaves that to Chansiri , pictured right , and company . <p> A new centre-back remains at the top of Carvalhal 's priority list . Ideally he wants two after losing Vincent Sasso 's services . <p> The heart of the defence is an area where the Owls have lacked strength in depth for some time . <p> The trouble is quality defenders are hard to come by and are not cheap . <p> When asked if he wants to freshen up other positions in his side , Carvalhal said : " We have focused on centre-halves but , of course , all the time , our eyes are open to other options that can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at centre-halves . We are looking at other players . <p> " But again , in other positions , the good players are expensive . " <p> Wednesday , who continue to be heavily linked with Aston Villa right-back Alan Hutton , returned to Sheffield on Sunday afternoon after completing their six-day training camp in Portugal . <p> The Owls played three friendlies in the Algarve . Carvalhal rotated his squad and the team secured one victory and two draws to maintain their unbeaten pre-season record . <p> After two days off , Wednesday 's players will report back in for training today ahead of tomorrow night 's friendly with local rivals Doncaster Rovers . <p> Carvalhal expects League One newcomers Rovers to provide his Owls side with a stern test . <p> " It will be a different kind of game , " said Carvalhal . " With Doncaster , we will try to give tempo and rhythm to all the players . " 
 <h> Sheffield financial adviser found guilty of 16 counts of fraud <h> Lee Peace <p> An independent financial adviser has been found guilty of forging investment documentation relating to his clients . <p> Derbyshire Police said Martin Rigney , aged 68 , invested his clients into a high-risk , unregulated collective investment scheme at a time when most of them were elderly and this type of investment was not suitable for them . <p> Derby Crown Court heard how he forged documents by either signing signatures himself or photocopying the genuine signature of the client . <p> The case came to the attention of police in June 2012 following an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into Rigney and his company , Topps Rogers Financial Management . <p> Derbyshire Police took on the case because Rigney formerly lived in Hope , and the force began a long and complex investigation . <p> Rigney , of King Edwards , Rivelin in Sheffield , was arrested and charged with forgery . <p> He denied the charges but was found guilty of 16 counts of forgery after a ten week trial on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be sentenced on September 1 . <p> Detective Constable Julie Wheeldon , who led the investigation , said after the case : " His clients trusted him and he abused that trust . <p> " It has had a devastating impact on their lives , emotionally as well as financially . <p> " Our job is to protect and get justice for victims . We feel we have achieved that with this conviction . " 
 <h> New girl Millie is star of the show <p> Millie Bright 's breakthrough with the Lionesses may have surprised a few -- but not former England forward Sue Smith . <p> The 23-year-old , who only earned her first senior cap last September , has started both of England 's Group D triumphs at the European Championships in the Netherlands -- a 6-0 win over Scotland and 2-0 victory against Spain . <p> Defender Bright is more used to operating in midfield but Smith , who was a team-mate of the Chelsea player at Doncaster Rovers Belles , is thrilled to have seen her grasp her opportunity . <p> " She was my player of the match from the Spain game " said Smith . " Everything she did was simple , effective -- I think she won every single header . Spain were trying to get the ball out wide and get good deliveries into the box , and when you 've got Steph Houghton and Millie , who are so good in the air , you just think : ' why would you even try and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal which should have stood -- she was onside and the referee got that one wrong -- and it should have been her first international goal , a fantastic header . <p> " She 's also dangerous from set-pieces but she 's crucial for them defensively . She 's shown absolutely no fear . This is her first major tournament that she 's started in and she just seems to have fitted in to that back line seamlessly . " <p> Smith added : " She 's being led by Steph , helping her out , but I thought she was great . I 'm really pleased for her , just because she 's a player that works so hard and deserves an opportunity , and she 's taken it . " <p> While a hamstring injury has hampered ex-England skipper Casey Stoney 's involvement , Bright has still been keeping a number of experienced internationals out of Sampson 's starting line-up . <p> Smith believes that is reason enough to celebrate Bright 's superb maiden major championship campaign so far . <p> " It 's all about taking opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , " said the 37-year-old , who was capped 93 times by her country . <p> " When you look at the players that are on the bench ; Casey Stoney is a quality centre-half , Laura Bassett is a quality centre-half , Jo Potter -- these are top players that she 's keeping on the bench . <p> " It just shows , firstly , how highly Mark Sampson rates her and secondly , how she 's taken that chance . <p> " I 'm really pleased for her .

 <h> Community unites to fight ' disgraceful ' school cuts in one of Sheffield 's most deprived areas <h> Sam Jackson <p> Parents , children and councillors have joined forces to fight education cuts which they claim will ' decimate ' the lives of youngsters living in one of Sheffield 's most deprived areas . <p> Protests have taken place outside Arbourthorne Community Primary in an attempt to persuade the Government to rethink its national funding formula . <p> The Department of Education is making changes to the way it funds schools to try and close the gap between different geographical areas , with some schools expected to receive more funding . <p> But analysis by teaching unions indicates 98 per cent of schools will face cuts in per pupil funding as inflation and school costs increase at the same time that funding per pupil is frozen . <p> Campaigners in Arbourthorne claim the three local schools - Arbourthorne Community Primary , Norfolk Primary and Sheffield Springs Academy - look set to have ? stripped from their budgets , the equivalent of 11 teachers . <p> They say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate and have gone door-to-door with a petition to reverse the cuts . <p> Local Labour councillor Ben Miskell , who is also a secondary school teacher , said : " Children in Arbourthorne need a leg up in life , not increased class sizes and fewer teachers . <p> " This government must stop its ideological attack on the most vulnerable in society and roll back it 's savage austerity programme . " <p> He added : " I represent one of the most deprived wards in the country and our schools provide a safe haven and a route towards a better life . <p> " It 's a disgrace that youngsters face such huge cuts to their amazing schools . " <p> Toby Mallinson , divisional secretary of Sheffield National Union of Teachers , which is supporting the action said : ' It 's clear that schools across the city are struggling to deal with savage funding cuts and things look set to get worse unless the government changes course . <p> " We are already starting to see an increase in redundancies , particularly against teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Last week education secretary Justine Greening announced that the overall core schools budget will rise by ? 1.3bn between 2017-18 and 2019-20 . <p> All schools will receive at least an increase of 0.5 per cent in cash terms . <p> She also confirmed plans to introduce a national funding formula , aiming to ensure money is distributed more fairly across the country , from 2018/19 . <p> Details of an updated version of the formula , with budgets for individual schools , are being promised for the autumn .

 <h> Sarah Marshall <p> A 31-year-old man has gone on trial accused of mowing a man down with his car during an ' apocalyptic ' brawl involving 150 men on a Sheffield street . <p> Jurors were told how Liam Sharp , of Chadwick Road , Woodthorpe ran over Nazeem Hussain in Staniforth Road , Darnall just before 7pm on July 17 last year . <p> Prosecuting , Christopher Rose , said : " The accusation is that he either deliberately drove his car at Mr Hussain or that he drove his car so dangerously that he ran Mr Hussain over . <p> " Either way , he caused Mr Hussain to suffer really serious injuries . " <p> In the moments leading up to the collision , which left Mr Hussain with injuries including a fractured spine and a broken leg , he had been visiting a barbers on Staniforth Road , the court was told . <p> " He was having his haircut when he saw someone being attacked by a group of males . He had gone to intervene . <p> " He recalls seeing cars being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground and being in hospital , " added Mr Rose . <p> Sharp , aged 31 , told police that he does not know Mr Hussain and was in the area because he was in his partner 's grey Ford Focus car looking for his younger brother 's moped , which had been stolen earlier that day . <p> On arriving in Staniforth Road , Sharp came across what he described as an ' apocalyptic ' involving 150 Asian males , some of whom he says he recognised . <p> Sharp says he saw his sister 's partner arguing with one of the people involved in the brawl , and so attempted to get between the pair . <p> But after deciding he was not going to be able to stop the altercation , he returned to his vehicle , which he says was being ' smashed up , ' and got into it . <p> Mr Rose said : " He turned into a dead end so that he could turn around and pick his sister up . <p> " As he was doing that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends but he had not realised that . He panicked and ' put his foot down ' but there was a bang . " <p> Sharp claims he did not see Mr Hussain because he was too busy looking for his sister . <p> He denies one count of wounding with intent and another of causing serious injury by dangerous driving . 
 <h> Swimming : No loss of focus for Max Litchfield as he chases podium finish at World Championships <h> Pippa Field in Budapest <p> He may have set a new British record en route to the 200m individual medley final but there will be no chance of Max Litchfield losing focus with a podium finish now in his sights . <p> Fourth over the 400m individual medley on his Olympic debut in Rio last summer , it could have been argued that Wednesday 's shorter 200m event was an ideal warm up for the Sheffield swimmer for his favoured event on Sunday . <p> Instead Litchfield has put himself firmly in the mix for a medal earlier than predicted on his World Championship debut after a series of impressive performances at Budapest 's Duna Arena . <p> The 22-year-old smashed his lifetime best in the heats by almost a second and a half , touching in a time of 1:56.64 . <p> That not only broke the previous British record held by James Goddard since 2009 but would have also been good enough for bronze at last year 's Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semi-final , going just 0.06 seconds slower to qualify third fastest for today 's medal race . <p> " I 've not really done the 200m IM before at a senior major international before so to go and do that is fantastic , " he said . <p> " I do n't really know what to say to be honest . I just wanted to hit the first race hard and get in there . To get the British record as well is amazing . <p> " My dad is out here so he rang me this morning after my race to congratulate me but it was a case of just trying to switch off from it and focus on the race . <p> " I just wanted to swim the same race in the semi-final , I knew it would be good enough to get through and I did it almost exactly the same . <p> " That was the goal just to get through the final , I 've done that and now it 's just about refocusing for tomorrow . <p> " We are always trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that since Rio . I 've been working hard every day and thankfully it 's paying off . <p> Litchfield will have to lower his time again if he wants to challenge for the title with American Chase Kalisz qualifying fastest in 1:55.88 and Japan 's Kosuke Hagino second in 1:56.04 -- 0.66 faster than the Brit . <p> But the City of Sheffield swimmer is not afraid to mix it with the world 's best , as seen with his Olympic debut last year , and he was not talking down his chances for the 200m medley . <p> " It 's going to be dog fight on the last 50 , but I know I 'm strong there so if I can get in the right place at 150m , then I can put on the afterburners and hopefully get in there with a medal , " he added . <p> " I 've been sat in the stands for the last three days and just seeing everyone swim so well and the two golds on the second night was amazing and then Adam ( Peaty ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50m breaststroke , it was fantastic to watch and that just spurs everyone on .

We would like to move because the place is bad but it is difficult to find an affordable home near our children 's nursery and school . " <p> ACORN Sheffield coordinator Michael Scarborough said : " I know from experience that living in privately rented housing is precarious at the best of times and the possibility of reminds us that we are not in control of our homes or our lives . <p> " But when renters unionise , we can say no to evictions , which is especially important when evictions are illegal and will leave families homeless like in this case .

We were well worthy of four goals but we could have conceded a couple . I think we rode our luck a little bit . <p> " The second half was better than the first half . It 's nice to win at home and score goals at home . I 'm pleased . Today makes us realise what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a good thing . " <p> Proctor banged in an eight-minute hat-trick , which included two stunning finishes , before striker Kieffer Moore wrapped up proceedings in the 90th minute following a raft of Rotherham substitutions . 
 <p> Sheffield Wednesday ended their pre-season campaign with a disappointing home display , losing 2-0 to Rangers in front of a crowd of 20,000 at Hillsborough . <p> Carlos Carvalhal is still on the look out for at least one central defender and that need was apparent as the Owls went down to two poorly-defended goals from Josh Windass and Kenny Miller , one in either half . <p> Wednesday began with Jordan Rhodes and former Celtic striker a Gary Hooper up front , while George Boyd made a home debut for the Owls . <p> Kieran Lee and Glenn Loovens were both on the bench as they continue their recoveries from injury . <p> Amid a great atmosphere in Hillsborough with thousands of Rangers fans bringing colour and noise to South Yorkshire , the players reacted and the game was n't played out like your average friendly encounter . <p> Tackles were strong and so close to the respective seasons kicking off , there was a real competitive nature to the game . <h> Rangers fans celebrate after their side went 1-0 up against Sheffield Wednesday <p> Adam Reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Candeias going in late and catching the Owls winger , forcing referee Ross Joyce to bring out a yellow card on 23 minutes . <p> However , there were no chances for either side in the opening stages with the majority of the match being played in the middle of the park . <p> Rangers had looked the slightly more threatening but Wednesday began to press more towards the end of the first half . <p> Barry Bannan had a couple of long-range efforts on goal from distance , neither of which troubled Wes Foderingham . <p> Tom Lees also got in the end of a well-directed free kick from Ross Wallace but Fabio cleared the danger . <p> Then , with the home side on top , Rangers sneaked in with the opening goal after the game 's first shot on target , two minutes before the break . <p> Wednesday made two changes at the break and immediately looked more threatening , particularly with Reach moving onto the left flank . <p> Fernando Forestieri came on for Gary Hooper and Loovens replaced Ross Wallace with George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred left back role . <p> The Owls should have been level four minutes into the half when Reach 's ball from the left was n't cleared but Rhodes could only hit the keeper from a couple of yards out . <p> However , despite that strong start , Wednesday were 2-0 on 54 minutes . <p> A quickly taken Rangers free kick again caught the defence flat-footed and when the ball fell to Miller he made no mistake , finishing superbly into the roof of the net from 12 yards . <p> Soon after , the Owls were dealt another potential blow as Westwood collided with Lee Wallace and after receiving treatment was forced off and replaced by Joe Wildsmith . <p> Westwood did at least walk off the pitch having been down for some time . <p> Steven Fletcher came on for Rhodes as Wednesday looked to get back into the game but after that second goal , although Forestieri looked a threat at times , the Owls lacked a killer instinct in the final third . <p> It may have been a friendly but Rangers , themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the game and that does n't bode well for Wednesday a week before the start of the Championship campaign . 
 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : Owls hope for change of fortune on injury front <p> Wednesday 's squad is largely looking fit and healthy as the countdown to the new season continues . <p> Kieran Lee remains the Owls ' only big fitness concern heading into Saturday 's Championship encounter with Preston North End . The energetic midfielder played no part in any of their pre-season friendlies due to a long-standing hip injury . <p> Lee was scheduled to get a run-out in a behind-closed-doors match with Lincoln yesterday only for the fixture to be called off . <p> Captain Glenn Loovens looks poised to start at Deepdale , having recovered from a hamstring knock . The Dutchman featured in their last two warm-up matches . <p> A stomach complaint kept Sam Hutchinson out of Sunday 's disappointing loss to Rangers . Head coach Carlos Carvalhal said the lost " three to four " kilograms in weight in the space of a " few days " . However , both Hutchinson and full-back Liam Palmer ( Achilles ) should be available for selection when they go to Preston . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hampered their promotion challenge last season . The Owls missed a host of key players at various points , including Lee , Hutchinson , Tom Lees , Ross Wallace , Fernando Forestieri and Gary Hooper . <p> " I hope that we do n't have too many injuries , " Carvalhal told The Star . " There are teams who sometimes do n't achieve promotion because they miss one or two players . <p> " But we , at one stage , missed six or seven players from the first eleven from the previous season but we still put the boat in a good direction at the end . <p> " I hope we do n't have these issues this season and other teams have these problems . It is not easy to drive the team into first positions if you have this kind of panorama . " <p> A hamstring knock deprived Wednesday of Hooper 's services in both legs of their heartbreaking play-off semi-final defeat to Huddersfield Town while Wallace was also forced off in the early stages of the second leg . <p> Carvalhal said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played better against Huddersfield if we had had Ross and Gary on the pitch . " <p> Wednesday overhauled their physio department over the summer , parting company with Paul Smith , Stephen Gilpin and David Henderson . First-team masseur Jake Tweedie also left . <p> The Championship club have since brought in three new physios . <p> Carvalhal said : " I must thank the people who worked with us in the past because they did good work . <p> " But we decided to bring new programmes to the club for the prevention of pains . It is a different philosophy . " 
 <p> Sheffield United have this afternoon confirmed their squad numbers for the 2016/17 Championship campaign . <p> Most of United 's squad have retained the numbers they wore in last season 's title-winning campaigns , with a few changes . Simon Moore is now No.1 and Leon Clarke has taken Caolan Lavery 's No.9 shirt , with Lavery now 22 . <p> New signings George Baldock and Enda Stevens have taken two and three respectively , while Richard Stearman will wear 19 and Jamal Blackman 27 .

Samir Carruthers retains last season 's 44 , with wonderkid David Brooks still 36. 
 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : It is the end of the road for Jose Semedo at Owls <p> Jose Semedo is back in Portugal and training with Primeira Liga side Vitoria de Setubal to maintain his fitness . <p> The 32-year-old midfielder is a free agent , having officially left Wednesday at the end of June . And Semedo dropped a big hint on social media earlier this week that he is unlikely to return to Hillsborough . <p> He tweeted : " You are always in my heart #swfc - lots of love . " <p> Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal , who 's team drew 0-0 with Vitoria in a pre-season friendly last month , claimed he tried to ring Semedo over the summer to discuss his future . <p> " I tried to call him one or two times and some colleagues also , " said Carvalhal . " He did n't reply . " <p> Semedo spent six years at Wednesday , racking up 167 appearances . <p> He quickly established himself as a big fans favourite with his whole-hearted performances in the centre . <p> Semedo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping the South Yorkshire club pip arch rivals Sheffield United to the second automatic promotion berth . <p> But the former Sporting Lisbon trainee found it difficult to force his way into Carvalhal 's starting eleven . Semedo featured on just 11 occasions last term . His final Wednesday outing came in their 2-1 home defeat to Fulham on the final day of the regular 2016/17 season .

 <h> Sheffield Steelers welcome the chance of playing NHL pedigree opposition <h> Bob Westerdale <p> Steelers ' captain Jonathan Phillips is licking his lips at the prospect of facing former NHL stars in the club 's friendly games . <p> Sheffield play S ? dert ? lje of Sweden 's second tier first , before facing the more onerous task of competing with import-laden Nurnberg Ice Tigers . <h> House of Steel <p> The German DEL side 's roster is like a ' Who 's Who ' list of one time NHL regulars . <p> Among them is defenceman Tom Gilbert , who boasts no fewer than 672 NHL games with Edmonton Oilers , Minnesota Wild , Florida Panthers and Montr ? al Canadiens and Los Angeles Kings . <p> The 34-year-old signed for the German team in Summer and will be looking to impress . <p> He shares a new locker room with Brett Festerling , 89 NHL games with Anaheim Ducks and Winnipeg Jets , David Steckel , 456 games with Anaheim , Washington Capitals , New Jersey Devils and Toronto Maple Leafs , Brandon Segal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas Stars , Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Rangers and Phillipe Dupuis , who has had 116 games with Colorado Avalanche and Toronto . <p> Phillips says : " If that 's not hard enough , our opponents will have been in training for a month and we will be stepping straight into those games ! But hopefully pre-season will do for us what the CHL games did last year - get us at that fast pace and the high calibre you need . " <p> The skipper points out Rob Wilson 's German team represents the most foreboding task . <p> " The Swedes will bring quality and skill - and they 'll be quick . It will be like playing 23 Markus Nilssons ! Most of their players are not far off or on the verge of being Swedish elite league players . They will be more like HV 71 were last year than Aalborg were in terms of quality . But the Germans will just be stacked with talent . <p> " Nurnberg have guys who have been amongst the best in the world . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this often , so to play them gives you an idea where you are . " <p> Phillips said the pre-season games will be " not just about fitness but about setting the tone for the season . <p> " We used to play a Hull or another elite league team but with games like this and last year 's CHL it helped us become so much quicker and put on a good level . <p> According to their website , S ? dert ? lje have just one import , Thomas , a Norwegian international , signed in June . They are coached by Mats , who played 236 international matches and won Olympic and World Cup medals . 
 <p> Home furnishings giant IKEA has made a cheeky bid to claim credit for inspiring Sheffield Wednesday 's new away kit . <p> Staff at the Swedish retail chain - which opens a new superstore in Sheffield this autumn - is claiming to have inspired the Owls ' latest away strip.The orange-y yellow hue , coupled with the dark thin stripes , has led IKEA to draw the comparison with its staff uniforms . <p> In a statement released tonight , the firm said : " IKEA inspired the fashion world back in May when Balenciaga launched a new creation which was a replica of the iconic FRAKTA bag . <p> " Three months on and the brand has moved from making waves on the catwalk to the pitch by capturing the eye of the Sheffield Wednesday football team for their 2017/2018 kit which seems to be inspired by the IKEA co-worker uniform . <p> " With IKEA coming to the city of Sheffield in the autumn , the team seemed to be so delighted with the arrival that they have based their strip on the retail favourite in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager Gary Deakin said ' We 're thrilled to see the home team out in full support of the new store ahead of the opening with their IKEA inspired strip for 2017/2018 .

 <h> Sheffield United : Which member of Chris Wilder 's squad says using his brain has helped him get more game time ? <p> At first glance , he looks like someone who plays off the cuff ; a footballer who relies on instinct rather than complex methodologies . <p> But as David Brooks prepares for the new Championship season , he has revealed how studying formations and tactics is fuelling his push for a starting role at Bramall Lane . <p> " I watch all the games on TV and I take notes on similar players to myself , " the Sheffield United midfielder said . " Obviously there 's only so much you can do because everybody 's individual attributes are a bit different . You have to be specific to yourself . It is all about picking up little things and listening to people , basically just developing yourself .

A peripheral figure during last term 's match to the League One title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Yorkshire this weekend having scored four goals in six friendly appearances . <p> Although Brooks ' impressive displays for England at the recent Toulon Tournament ultimately persuaded Chris Wilder to cancel his proposed loan to Chesterfield , the youngster cited a greater appreciation of strategy and system as another reason . <p> " It 's mainly tactics because , if you 're not in the right position , you ca n't do what you want on the ball , " Brooks continued . " It 's mainly mental because you need to be where you need to be . You need to visualise passes before you receive the ball . There 's a lot more thinking goes on ( in football ) than it might seem . " <p> " I think that 's an area where I 've improved , " he added . " Playing and training with the first team last season really brought me on . If you do n't learn , you 'll get nailed really quick . " 
 <h> Regeneration of Castlegate <p> I welcome the plans to regenerate the rundown Castlegate area , ( Star July 31 ) , which , with ingenuity and of course the necessary funding , has the potential to be a huge success and give the area a much needed new lease of life . <p> Let 's face it Castlegate has been deteriorating for years long before Castle Market was demolished , but at long last there is the chance to uncover one of the most important parts of this city 's history with an archaeological excavation of the castle 's remains . <p> It is also good news that vacant shops will be brought back into use and that essential repairs will be carried out on the badly neglected Old Town Hall which are long overdue . <p> This wonderful historic building urgently needs to be fully restored and brought back to life so that it can serve the people of Sheffield once again as , with careful and sensitive planning to preserve its features , it can be put to a variety of new uses . <p> Sheffield needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has failed to do , as I firmly believe that most of our old buildings , ( the few we have left ) , with their beautiful architecture can be adapted for the 21st Century and attract footfall back to neglected areas of the city . <p> I hope we can soon see the plans for this area become a reality as with a thousand years of history Castlegate deserves to be put back on the map as a place that people will want to visit for business , shopping or for its historical features once the castle 's remains are unearthed . <p> Susan Richardson <p> Westminster Crescent , Lodge Moor , Sheffield , S10 <p> Digging Sheffield <p> The Star 's admirable piece , ( July 21 ) , on the archaelogy of Hollis Croft deserves a response . <p> It was good to see Dinah Saich , South Yorkshire Archaelogy Service , hard hatted and hi vis vested against the extensive background of the site . There 's many a Sheffielder hoping to see Dinah against a similiar background of the remains of Sheffield Castle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is going on the site of what some have called ' the people 's castle . <p> The Hollis Croft - a historic name in its own right - dig was on the site of the former Footprint Tool works . I note how the Star 's reporter referred to the site ' under another block of student flats ' . To the best of my knowledge the only piece of city centre archaelogy uncovered for Sheffield folk to see is outside Irwin Mitchell 's in seems a pity as more features such as the latter would add interest to central Sheffield 's cityscape and alleviate the need for the seemingly ineviatable public art - some of which is frankly meaningless . <p> A final point- there is a memorial plaque to a Sheffield Cutler - William Bradshaw - dated 1750 that was preserved in the wall of Footprint Tools . The developers to their credit have advised me they intend to incorporate it in the new development . Personally I would have liked to seen it in the Cutlers Hall or Kelham Island where the Sheffield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mind your own business <p> I have tried to remain impartial over the tree felling issue but I feel I must comment after reading yet more letters on the subject in Saturday 's Star . <p> It seems that there is a small but vocal group of people bombarding us with tales of " shocking heavy handed tactics " . I have witnessed first hand groups of strangers driving round my estate in cars and on motorcycles , parking haphazardly and hanging about round my property . On the couple of occasions I have engaged in conversation with these people I have found some , ( not all ) , to address me in a very superior manor . I came away feeling that they obviously thought they were a cut above everyone else and did n't need to listen to anyone else 's point of view . <p> Contrary to what Susan Richardson wrote , I found the tree felling crews to be polite and extremely long suffering while I witnessed a protester pretending to be pushed ! <p> As I have said I was an impartial onlooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business - let them protest about trees in their own areas and leave us to judge each tree individually . <p> We all have a right to a point of view and I would n't dream of standing outside someone else 's house imposing my views on them . Just to be clear , I love trees and our green city and if these people are so concerned about our environment perhaps they should stop driving their cars needlessly . <p> Is this the same Paul who was Diana 's so called rock , the one who wrote a book about her and has been dining out on his Royal stories ever since ? <p> He did n't care about hurting her family 's memories . <p> Pot , kettle , black . <p> Jayne Grayson <p> by email <p> No pride in Sheffield <p> Is Sheffield still a part of Yorkshire ?

 <h> Report : Edinburgh 39 Sheffield Tigers 51 - Tigers go top of table <h> Nigel Pearson <p> Defiant Sheffield pulled off one of the results of the season winning 51-39 at play-off rivals Edinburgh - despite being without two of their top riders . <p> With Josh Grajczonek on Premiership duty with Somerset and Danish ace Lasse Bjerre ruled out yesterday morning following a crash on Thursday , the odds looked stacked against the Tigers . <p> But the Owlerton outfit produced a stunning second half display to storm to the top of the league . <p> The Tigers fell behind early on and found themselves six points down after captain Kyle Howarth demolished the starting tapes . And despite his efforts in the re-run , the Tigers No.5 was unable to stop a 5-1 maximum to the hosts . <p> But he soon found his gating gloves and redeemed himself with two comfortable tapes to flag wins from his next three outings . <p> Luck seemed to turn towards the Tigers in Heat ten when home skipper Sam Masters suffered an engine failure on bend four of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . <p> And the visitors finally struck level with a 5-1 in Heat 11 .

 <h> RETRO : The history of Sheffield cutlery manufacturer family the <p> This week we trace a city cutlery manufacturer 's family right back to the 1700s . <p> The bell-push in the clue picture can be seen on the side door of 51 Westbourne Road . <p> In 1879 it was the home of cutlery manufacturer Henry Nowill who had the house built for himself and his family , and next door , at 49 , lived his brother Thomas Mathias Nowill . <p> The firm can be traced back to 1700 when a D* mark was granted to Thomas Nowill . When Thomas passed away in 1808 this mark passed to his younger brother , William . <p> From this two separate companies came into being and they were Nowill &amp; Kippax and John Nowill &amp; Sons . <p> In the 1787 directory &amp; Kippax had premises on High Street as Cutlers and ( not a typo this is how they are listed ) . <p> John is also listed on his own as a dealer in furniture and clothes from the same premises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership with Thomas Hague at 7 Meadow Street , he also had premises on Garden Street . <p> When Mr Hague retired in 1797 , John renamed the business John Nowill &amp; Co . <p> In 1825 Thomas retired and his sons , William and John , ran the business . They had the foresight to register a silver mark with the assay office , in 1825 they are listed as follows , Nowill Thomas and Co. manufacturers of silver fruit and dessert knives , fancy pen and pocket knives , &amp;c. 7 , Meadow St. <p> Shortly after Christmas on December 28 , 1836 , Thomas Nowill died of , as what was then termed natural decay , old age to us now . <p> Just three years later in 1839 the brothers separated and William set up his concern in Rockingham Street while John continued at the Meadow Street premises . <p> John Nowill retired from the firm in 1847 . In 1811 he had married Elizabeth Spencer and the outcome of this union produced eight sons , no television then , five of these sons entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1820-1892 , Edward 1822-1871 and Arthur 1825-1896 . <p> Thomas Mathias Nowill died at College Gardens in Dulwich on September 13 , 1892 , he was 71 years of age . <p> John Nowill took up the reins of the firm , in 1851 employed over 31 workers , around 31 years late the firm employed 100 men , ten lads and 15 women , this number included girls too . <p> John passed this life in 1900 aged 82 , he had already produced the next generation of to keep the business going . <p> In 1914 the firm had 300 workers and they were producing highly sought after good pocket knives , pen knives , sporting knives , razors , scissors , in fact any type of implement with a good cutting edge , scissors for trimming lamp wicks , pruning scissors , any type of scissors you could think of , they made them . <p> In the late ' 20s , the firm had part of the family handling exports in Istanbul and Athens , their goods were high quality and quality sells . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was knocked about a bit by German bombs , the firm was sold to F.E. &amp; J.R . Hopkinson Ltd and the firm was relocated to the Works on London Road . <p> Their knives , especially their bowie knives , were still being made under the name well into the 1960s , sadly the firm took less and less of the market and eventually the and Hopkinson name was acquired by Jack Adams , he keeps these world famous names alive . <p> On this part of Westbourne Road lived some notable people who put Sheffield on the map , at No 47 , lived Lawrence Hoole , son of the Stove &amp; Grate manufacturer Henry Elliot Hoole whose Green Lane works is now under restoration finally . Besides stoves and grates they made fenders and fire irons . <p> Today children have never seen the welcoming sight of an open fire , these open fires were in every home in the land even from Mr Dawson and Mr Sorsby , the earliest named cavemen . <p> The clean air act of 1956 was the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer could we burn all our unwanted rubbish . <p> Wood burning stoves are making a welcome return but not everyone has the ability to have these fitted with the result that the rubbish that was always burnt is now dumped anywhere for other people to remove , Progress ? No , I do n't think so . <p> When I called at 51 Westbourne Road a very pleasant young woman answered the door and when I asked if I could take photos of her home she was more than willing to give me her permission , she was also very interested in the history of her home and the people who lived there . <p> The majority of this information is from Geoff Tweeddale 's Directory of Sheffield Cutlery Manufacturers , it 's my Bible . 
 <p> The statement said that it was the first time the band has had to cancel a show through illness . <p> The band thanked Scottish musician Midge Ure , who extended his set ' at almost no notice at all ' to cover for them . <p> " We have no doubt he was fantastic and gave everyone at Lytham a wonderful performance , as indeed he always does , " the statement read . <p> " So many thanks again Midge , we owe you one . " <p> The band also thanked festival promoters Cuffe and Taylor . <p> " They had less than 30 minutes to sort out an alternative plan for the rest of the evening in order to give the audience the best possible experience , and again , we are sorry for the situation they found themselves in. " 
 <p> Ben Whiteman and substitute Rodney Kongolo added notable quality to a midfield already blessed with the talent of the evergreen James Coppinger . <p> And a newly bulked up Liam Mandeville gave the Gills a constant headache with his clever link-up play and movement . <h> Niall Mason battles for the ball in Rovers ' draw with Gillingham <p> The obvious down side for Doncaster was not displaying the sort of ruthlessness in front of goal that saw them waltz to promotion last season . <p> There will also be much tougher tests to come than Gillingham , who were well organised but unable to sustain any pressure on the Rovers goal . <p> But , as goalless draws go , this was very much of the encouraging variety - something to build on . <p> DYNAMIC DONCASTER <h> Doncaster 's Matty Blair prepares to make a challenge <p> Doncaster had the look of a more dynamic outfit and that was in no small part down to the three new signings who featured on Saturday . <p> Andrew is a smooth operator whose long throw and set piece delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defensive holding role , ahead of Mason , was something of a surprise given his reputation as a box-to-box midfielder with an eye for goal . But the Sheffield United loanee justified that call by displaying a calm head on young shoulders , maturity on the ball and also his appetite for a tackle . <p> And he came within inches of netting a sensational winner when his 40-yard piledriver cannoned off the crossbar . <p> He and Kongolo add a whole lot more than sheer size and presence to the Rovers midfield . <p> Kongolo 's touch and mobility , in particular , gave them a new spring from the middle of the pitch when he came on for the last 20 minutes . He has the potential to become a real crowd favourite . <h> Doncaster Rovers manager Darren Ferguson . Picture : Marie <p> CASE FOR THE DEFENCE <p> The Gills occasionally threatened on the break in the second half and , in seasons gone by , this is a game Rovers might have ended up losing . <p> But Doncaster defended diligently and Butler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave his doubters a timely reminder of his warrior-like qualities . <p> Rovers , however , did at times play themselves into a bit of bother and still look susceptible from set pieces . <p> POST MATCH REACTION <p> Darren Ferguson : " For the majority of it I was very pleased with the performance . We played some very good stuff , some very good football . <p> " But the most important thing is always the result . It 's two points dropped . " <p> Ady Pennock : " It was a tough place to go , we were up against supporters where every decision again them they were loud but we stood our own , we had chances as well . " 
 <h> Concern for future of iconic Sheffield music venue following closure rumours <h> Sarah Marshall <p> Concerns have been raised for the future of an iconic Sheffield music venue , following claims it has suddenly been closed down . <p> Queens Social Club is rumoured to have closed down over the last fortnight . <p> There has been no official confirmation from the venue 's owners , who can not be reached for comment , but its official Facebook page has been closed down . <p> The venue , located on Queens Road , has attracted a number of big acts over the years including Charlatans front man Tim Burgess , The 1975 and The Crookes . <p> The organiser of the Burly Q ' Blessed are the Freaks and Geeks ' event says she was forced to find a different venue at short notice after being told the Queens Social Club has now closed down . <p> She said : " Last Friday July 28 I was shocked to discover that Queens Road Social Club had closed , with no information about if or when it might re-open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , and a killer cast that was a year in the making raring to go for Saturday 23rd September , team Burly Q was quite literally all dressed up with nowhere to go . " <p> The event , which will feature a number of burlesque , nerdlesque , circus and drag acts , is now scheduled to take place at Walkley Working Men 's Club on September 23 . <p> A number of music lovers have also taken to social media to mourn the apparent loss of Queens Social Club . <p> said on Twitter : " Still ca n't believe the Queens Social Club has closed .

 <h> Makers of new Diana documentary defend use of controversial tapes <h> Sarah Marshall <p> With controversy building about the use of private tapes in a new documentary on the late Princess Diana due to be shown tonight , we hear from the people behind the programme . <p> It 's tempting to think there is n't anything more to say about the life and death of Princess Diana . <h> Prince Charles in 1981 with his then fiance , Lady Diana Spencer , arriving at the Goldsmith 's Hall in London for their first royal engagement together . PA Archive/PA Images . <p> However , with the 20th anniversary of her death in a Paris road accident at the age of 36 approaching , controversial video tapes are now set to be broadcast for the first time as part of a new TV documentary which will air on Channel 4 at 9pm tonight . <p> Prince Charles in 1981 with his then fiance , Lady Diana Spencer , arriving at the Goldsmith 's Hall in London for their first royal engagement together . <p> As her marriage to Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the desperate measures she took to save the relationship to her voice coach , Peter and it is these which form the basis of the Channel 4 's Diana In Her Own Words which airs this Sunday . <p> With contributions from former confidantes , including private secretary Patrick Jephson , personal protection officer , Ken Wharfe , and ballet teacher , Anne Allan , the footage finds her between 1992 and 1993 , shortly before her famous BBC Panorama interview . <h> The Princess of Wales following Prince Harry ( right ) , five , and Prince William , seven , on Harry 's first day at the Wetherby School in Notting Hill , West London . Ron Bell/PA Archive/PA Images . <p> " This is the definitive account of Diana 's life as she saw it , " says producer Charles Furneaux , " and it would be very hard for anyone to supersede it . <p> We hope it will be the resource that people come back to when revisiting the story of the Windsors . <p> It will give viewers an insight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , suddenly launched into this strange world . " <p> Ralph Lee , the broadcaster 's head of factual , describes the tapes as a " treasure trove " of footage marking a period in royal history as significant as Edward VIII 's abdication . <p> Diana tells her trusted interviewer , who apparently reluctantly released the rights to the footage everything from the best time of her life living with girlfriends in Earl 's Court , to Charles ' courting technique which involved him " following me around like a puppy " . <p> After marrying the heir to the throne at barely 20 years old , she tells of her realisation that her husband 's heart belonged to another woman , and how even the royal family 's " top lady " failed to offer much in the way of support . <p> Viewers will see how her isolation drove her towards an eating disorder and a deeply loving ( but , she insists , non-sexual ) relationship with her then protection officer , Barry Mannakee . <p> While the relationship between the Prince of Wales and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana , Jephson maintains that it was the key reason why some sought to demonise the young princess . <p> The former monarchist accuses Clarence House , Charles and Camilla 's London residence , of encouraging public enthusiasm for their relationship through a campaign painting Diana as ' inadequate , unsuitable and unworthy ' . <p> " If there is popularity , it has been the result of a sustained and systematic campaign involving the finest PR people money can buy , he insists . <p> " But people eventually tend to see through spin , and Diana 's authenticity is one of the reasons that we are still talking about her 20 years after her death . " <p> As well as describing the 180-minute edit as a demonstration of Diana 's " backbone of steel , " Jephson says : <p> " What you get beautifully through those tapes is her sense of spontaneity and fun . <p> She was a fabulously inspirational boss , because even when things were tough there was never a day so tough that she could n't see the lighter side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the British monarchy , " breaking its " theatre " to engage with hard-hitting issues of public life and , most importantly , passing that legacy onto her sons . <p> Jephson adds : " If Diana was still alive I reckon she would still be surprising people . <p> There was nothing spun about Diana , she was wonderfully unpredictable and her sense of anything being possible is an important element in the monarchy 's future viability .

 <h> Council in need of legal advice ? <p> Your article about Veolia 's waste contract made me wonder if the council could use a better team of legal advisors ! <p> Whoever draws up the contracts with their numerous partners could obviously do with some lessons in get out clauses . <p> According to Lee Peace 's article council officers are frustrated with lack of savings being made in the service to the extent they feel it worth paying out millions of pounds in compensation to end the contract early . <p> Is n't it sensible to write clearly into the contract the level of service which is acceptable , below which the operator will incur penalties or even face its termination ? <p> Certainly I would not be happy if the council paid public funds to Veolia for doing nothing after doing things badly , but the alternative seems to leave us shackled at their tender mercy for another 19 years ! <p> Who decided to make a contract for 35 years anyway ? <p> Surely way too long ! <p> Before I retired I was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unfortunately the hours of my work varied week on week so I had to submit weekly time sheets to support my claim . Sadly the benefits agency had somehow managed to get six months behind in their work so I was constantly getting letters about unpaid rent and threats of eviction . <p> The council insisted I was responsible for paying the rent , whilst I insisted I was paying my share and it was the company they had employed to pay the benefit to which the law said I was entitled which was failing in its duty . <p> I finally had to get a solicitor to prove my point ! <p> I suggested the council should sack the company concerned but I was told they could n't because they were tied into a contract with them for another four years ! <p> I asked then why there were not get out clauses within the contract enabling the council to end it if specified service standards were not met ? <p> I had no answer but I did think they would have learnt from the experience . 
 <h> Three police officers could face misconduct hearings over death of former Sheffield Wednesday striker Dalian Atkinson <h> Robert Cumber <h> Three police officers could face misconduct action over the death of former Sheffield Wednesday striker Dalian Atkinson . <p> The forward , who made 38 appearances for the Owls , scoring 10 times , died last August after police fired a Taser in his home town of Telford in Shropshire , where they had been called to an incident . <h> Dalian Atkinson made 38 appearances for Sheffield Wednesday <p> The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) today said its investigation into Mr Atkinson 's death was nearing completion . <p> It said three West Mercia Police officers had been interviewed under criminal caution , having earlier been served with gross misconduct notices . <p> Investigators have spoken to around 15 other police officers , more than 15 members of the public and to paramedics as witnesses , it added , as well as consulting a number of forensic experts . <p> The IPCC also said investigators had listened to police radio transmissions , and a Taser deployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report could not be finalised until the full pathology and toxicology reports had been provided . <p> IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said : " At the conclusion of our independent investigation I will consider whether to refer our investigation report to the Crown Prosecution Service to make a decision on any potential charges against police officers .

We will share our finished report with HM Coroner , Mr Atkinson 's family and West Mercia Police . We have been keeping the interested parties as informed as we can throughout our enquiries . I am grateful for the patience shown by all concerned during the course of this rightly thorough investigation . " <p> Dalian Atkinson played for Sheffield Wednesday during 1989 and 1990 .

 <h> Sheffield Tigers aim to stretch lead at the top of the table <h> Nigel Pearson <p> Peter Mole says there is more to come from Sheffield 's table-topping side as they prepare for tonight 's Owlerton clash with Workington ( 7.30 ) . <p> Tigers can extend their lead with seven points available over the next two nights as they also head to Redcar tomorrow . <p> And club co-owner Mole believes the addition of new reserve signings Jan Graversen and Georgie Wood ( pic ) makes the team complete and ready to push for the title . <p> He said : " The top five in our team have been a credit to us all season , but since firming up the reserve berths a little with Jan and Georgie , we 've really stepped up to the plate , taking maximum points in all our meetings since the changes were made . <p> " Without fuss , we have gone about our business , and now sit on top of the table . <p> " From being just inside the play-off positions a couple of weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course now is not the time to get carried away , the season has a long way to go and there is the small matter of the play-offs to come . <p> " We need to make sure we get there first ! It is important not to peak too early , when there is still much left to ride for . However let 's all enjoy the position we 're currently in , stay under the radar , continue to go quietly about our business and see where it takes us .

 <h> FEATURE : " Life truly is complete now for our family of three " <p> " I remember looking down at the positive pregnancy test , and not believing it was true , " smiles Jade . <p> " I took a bunch more just to make really sure , it was such an exciting time ! " <h> IVF family <p> For Jade , and her wife , Charlotte , that positive test was the result of months of wishing and waiting , and thousands of pounds . <p> The couple , who married in Las Vegas two years ago this month , had approached CARE Sheffield fertility clinic in January 2016 , eager to investigate the possibility of starting a family together . <p> " We 've been together seven years , after meeting through mutual friends , " says Jade , aged 28 . <p> " Like most couples , we 'd talked about children and knew we 'd love to have a family , so shortly after we were married , in the summer of 2015 , we started doing a little research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success rate , so we made an appointment . <h> IVF <p> " The staff were so helpful from the very beginning . They took the time to talk over every option with us , answered all our questions and gave us all the information we needed . In the end , we decided to go for it . " <p> The couple , who live in Dewsbury , decided that they would use Charlotte 's egg , fertilised using donor sperm , and that Jade would be implanted with the embryos . <p> " We looked at all the different options , and this felt like the right choice for us , " says Jade . <p> " As the baby would be Charlotte 's biological child , we chose a sperm donor with physical qualities similar to me - so blue/green eyes and brown hair . <h> IVF family <p> " We had to wait a few weeks to see how many sperm donors matched what we were looking for , and in the end there was just the one that matched , so it felt like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The process was a little stressful at times , with the hormone changes . I think it 's a difficult process for anyone . I started with injections the day after our first wedding anniversary , and Charlotte started hers just after . " <p> A spokesman for CARE Sheffield explains : " During the IVF process , the woman 's natural menstrual cycle is suppressed with medication . We need the ovaries to produce more than the usual one egg , so injections are given to increase the number of eggs . Patients are monitored closely with ultrasound and blood tests to check the development of the eggs and to help them mature . <p> " When the time is right , the eggs are collected with a simple internal procedure . The eggs are then mixed with partner 's or donor sperm in the lab so that fertilisation can take place . <p> " When the embryos have reached the optimal stage , they are placed in the womb . A pregnancy test is taken around 16 days later . <p> " The procedure is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARE , we believe that family is for everyone and we have a long history of supporting gay and lesbian couples in creating families and making dreams come true . <p> " Same-sex couples can use CARE 's sperm bank or purchase sperm from a number of specialist providers . All sperm donors are rigorously health and infection screened and the number of families they can help is limited to ten . <p> " We also have an arrangement whereby same sex couples can donate eggs to each other in a shared motherhood arrangement . They may also want to with another woman in order to reduce the costs of IVF . " <p> Jade continues : " We 're lucky that we had a few friends who 'd been through IVF , so we had some idea of what to expect . <p> " We were told from the beginning that we had about just a 30 per cent chance of it working the first time . " <p> But work it did . Jude was born on June 7 2017 . <p> " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had a really good pregnancy and worked right up until my 37th week . I was diagnosed with high blood pressure on the first day of my maternity leave , and was induced at 39 weeks . <p> " Jude is just perfect . The three of us are settling into family life wonderfully , I 'd highly recommend it , " she adds with a grin . <p> " He 's just turned eight weeks and he changes every day ; I ca n't believe how much he 's changed already . <p> " Even though biologically , he 's Charlotte 's son , I still look at him and see my boy . I already ca n't imagine life without him . <p> " He has beautiful eyes , that are still blue at the minute , and his hair was quite dark to begin with , but it 's getting a little blonder now as the weeks pass . " <p> In the UK , babies were born as a result of IVF treatment between 1991 and 2013 . For an increasing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only remaining chance of having a baby . In the UK over 85 per cent of healthy women will get pregnant naturally within a year of trying for a baby , and this number increases to 92 per cent within two years . However , women aged over 35 are more likely to have fertility problems and it may take up to three years for them to get pregnant . By the age of 38 , only 77 per cent of women get pregnant within three years . <p> Official figures have shown that record numbers of lesbian couples are now becoming parents through fertility treatment and - in fact - the number of two-mum families jumped by more than a third in 2012 , according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority . <p> Women in same sex relationships conducted 766 cycles of IVF in 2012 , up 36 per cent on 2011 .

We think this is due to greater awareness , openness , and more acceptance of LGBT parenting . <p> " Our patients choose to come to a licensed clinic where there is safety and regulation of treatment and donors . We offer specialist counselling and advice at every step and our success with this group of patients is well known . <p> " We have lots of happy same-sex families made in CARE Sheffield .

 <h> Laura Jones Owls fan column : A week full of highs and lows for Sheffield Wednesday <p> Well maybe not Joe Wildsmith who went off injured but there is a certain level of joy that comes with watching an outfield player in goal . David Hirst , Lee Bullen , Lee Peacock , Steve Nicol , Andy Booth and now Sam , what a prestigious club to be a member . <p> It 's been a week of emotional contrasts for Wednesday . Preston was a low point ; outplayed , out thought and for a team with a plethora of strikers , out shot . <p> Earlier this week Mr Chansiri released a statement to explain the pricing structure for tickets , merchandise and hospitality . The tone was to assuage the escalating tension of the fans about the rising prices . The statement , on the whole , worked because the chairman appealed to the fans nature of ownership and chipping in where we can , as he ca n't do it alone . Opinions and emotions were mixed but supportive of what the club is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos Carvalhal about Forestieri 's positional play as well this week . Carvalhal has received criticism for playing players out of their natural position , but for once there was an explanation about where Fernando 's best position is , and this season he will play a more central role . <p> Against Chesterfield on Tuesday , the general feeling was that Gary Hooper and Steven Fletcher play better together as a central striking partnership , a less frustrating pairing . If Fernando wants to play a central role , who partners him ? He needs a stable , workhorse and that is n't Jordan Rhodes . <p> The fact that we 're still discussing who our best team is and who plays better where , when we have n't changed the team significantly since January , is vexing but in a week of highs , lows and straight-talking at least we 're trying to address our shortcomings . 
 <p> David Topham , from CTP , said : " BDP 's decision to relocate to 3 St Paul 's Place is a pleasing endorsement of our development . <p> " It is also extremely encouraging that a company with BDP 's reputation for quality , innovation and excellence has chosen our building as their base in Sheffield . <p> " They join global civil engineers Arup and leading Swedish bank Handelsbanken at 3 St Paul 's Place , two other companies with superb reputations . We are very proud of our occupiers . <p> " Our decision to develop a speculative Grade A office building in Sheffield in the midst of the recession has been vindicated and we are very proud of the quality of the office space we have created . There is now strong interest in the remainder of the building and we look forward to announcing new tenants shortly . " <p> Mr Topham said it was an ' exciting ' time for the St Paul 's Place complex which marked the ' revival of confidence ' in the city centre . <p> Head of BDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy decision for us to make the move to 3 St Paul 's Place as it 's a great space with well proportioned , column-free floor plates providing very good daylight and views . <p> " It 's also in a brilliant location in the very heart of the city , benefitting from the full range of Sheffield 's amenities and the city council 's investment in high quality public realm , particularly the area around the Peace Gardens , as well as the important route from the train station via Howard Street . " <p> He added : " The new studio will incorporate onsite cycle storage and shower facilities to accommodate the high percentage of staff who cycle to work and exemplifying the practice 's commitment to sustainability . " <p> And the council 's cabinet member for business and investment Mazher Iqbal said : " This is another important milestone for 3 St Paul 's Place which now has a number of fantastic international businesses operating in the heart of our city . <p> " This building and others close by are setting new standards for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses alike . <p> " Sheffield is a place that is of huge appeal to the business community and we look forward to welcoming others to the city in the months ahead .

 <h> Sheffield nightclub agrees to raft of new conditions after drugs alarm <h> Robert Cumber <p> A Sheffield nightclub has agreed to a raft of new conditions , including sniffer dog searches , after two men believed to have taken the drug MDMA fell critically i 'll . <p> The men , both aged 20 , fell i 'll outside Tank nightclub on Arundel Street in the city centre during the early hours of Saturday , July 15 , but police said later they were recovering . <p> South Yorkshire Police applied for a summary licence review in the wake of the incident , with councillors meeting yesterday to decide the club 's fate . <p> Members of Sheffield Council 's licensing sub-committee allowed the venue to remain open providing it complied with a raft of new conditions . <p> The 14 conditions , which were accepted by the club , include : <p> * employing at least one bouncer per 100 customers <p> * enhanced searches including the removal and inspection of footwear and socks when required <p> * installation of a drugs box <p> * having a drugs sniffer dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements are in addition to any existing conditions on the club 's licence . <p> Following the hearing , the club posted on its Facebook page to say : " The review went very well . Police and local authorities are more than happy with the way we have been running our venue in general and also during our current situation . " <p> The club had been ordered to use sniffer dogs at every event pending the review and to carry out full searches on all customers , but it said these measures were no longer required , which would ' speed things up ' . <p> It promised to be back ' bigger than ever ' and reminded customers it would always have a ' zero tolerance ' when it came to drugs and would continue to carry out random searches . 
 <h> Thousands of jobs under threat in major shake-up at Wilko <h> Robert Cumber <p> The home retailer , which has five stores in Sheffield , two each in Barnsley and Rotherham , and one in Doncaster , announced it has entered redundancy consultation with nearly 4,000 staff . <p> It said that following a review of its operating functions , changes were required to ' ensure it is best placed to continue to thrive within an ever-changing retail landscape ' . <p> Wilko said it is consulting with 3,900 of its store supervisory team about a new management structure , alongside trade union the GMB . It added that 1,000 new senior supervisor roles will be created as part of the shake-up , along with a ' significant amount ' of customer service positions . <p> The news comes after the company posted an 80 per cent drop in pre-tax profits , to ? 5.1 million , in the year to January 28 , and weeks after it complained about a rise in costs due to the falling value of the pound since the Brexit vote . 
 <h> Have your say : what do you think of outsiders getting involved in Sheffield 's business ? <h> Robert Cumber <p> Environment secretary Michael Gove this week waded into the row over tree-felling in Sheffield , calling for the controversial programme to be halted . <p> His intervention appears to have divided opinion within the city , with some hailing him as its ecological saviour and others questioning what his edict will mean for ongoing work to upgrade its once infamous roads and pavements . <h> Bryan Lodge <p> Whatever your views on the fate of Sheffield 's trees , the one-time Tory leadership hopeful 's letter to Sheffield Council has opened up another can of worms entirely . <p> It appears the environment secretary did not visit Sheffield , or even attempt to raise the matter with the city council , before making his very public announcement . <p> As the environment secretary , his view on the matter undoubtedly holds some clout . <p> But are Sheffielders fed up of being told what to do by people who neither live nor work in the city and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worse ? <p> Or do they welcome the opinions of those who might offer a fresh perspective or expertise which is not available within the city ? <p> Mr Gove has had his two pennies ' worth on our trees , and the riposte from Sheffield Council environment chief Bryan Lodge was not long in coming . <p> Now the political bigwigs have had their say , we want to hear from the ordinary people of Sheffield . <p> But we 're not asking for your views on trees . <p> We 're inviting anyone who lives or works in the city to pen 300 words on whether they welcome the input of outsiders when it comes to matters affecting Sheffield - be they crime , transport , education , or the environment - or whether they 'd prefer those people - to put it bluntly - not to stick their oar in . <p> You need n't have a fancy job title or letters after your name to have your say . <p> All we ask is for you to keep it brief ( no more than 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photo . <p> We plan to feature the best responses , reflecting both sides of the debate , in the paper . <p> Please email your thoughts to , with the word VOICES in the subject line . 
 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : Ian Holloway ready for one of their toughest matches of the season against Owls <p> Queens Park Rangers manager Ian Holloway has described today 's encounter with Sheffield Wednesday as " one of the toughest fixtures of the season " . <p> The R 's head north full of confidence following back-to-back home victories . They beat last season 's play-off finalists Reading a week ago and followed up that success with a hard-fought Carabao Cup victory over Northampton Town in midweek . <p> " They have got a lot of expectation there now after how well they have done in the last two seasons . They do believe their club is on the rise , and that can bring its own pressure . <p> " We 'll go there and look to do what we do well , and that 's get in people 's faces , disrupt the way they play , and look to break off of that . " <p> QPR are sweating over the fitness of striker Conor Washington . The Northern Ireland international suffered knock against Northampton in midweek but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Defender Alex Baptiste is in contention to make his debut following his free-transfer switch from Middlesbrough . Grant Hall ( tendonitis ) and Jordan Cousins ( thigh ) are ruled out . 
 <p> Second half goals from John Marquis , James Coppinger from the penalty spot and Alfie May saw Doncaster net their first win of the League One season . <p> Dominic Samuel headed in a late consolation for Blackburn , who were booed off at the final whistle . <p> But while the home side flattered to deceive , Doncaster defended excellently as a team and looked increasingly threatening as the game wore on . <p> Andy Butler and Joe Wright stood up to the physicality of Danny Graham , Ben Whiteman again showed a mature head on young shoulders in midfield and Rovers counter-attacked with gusto and flair , punishing Blackburn 's mistakes with real authority . <p> The victory was Doncaster 's first ever win at Blackburn in 12 attempts . <p> Blackburn saw more of the ball in the first half but Doncaster had their moments in front of goal and kept the hosts at arm 's length . <p> Marquis saw his volley from Niall Mason 's cross deflected wide and also curled over after a neat one-two with Tommy Rowe . <p> Ian Lawlor remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of a Graham long range effort and was also relieved to see Richie Smallwood drill wide after finding space in the box . <p> The visitors seized the initiative seconds after the re-start when Marquis was gifted the ball on half-way , ran clear and slammed it past David Raya . <p> And they doubled their lead midway through the second half after referee David Webb adjudged that Charlie Mulgrew brought down Coppinger in the box and the captain picked himself up to lash home from the spot . <p> Doncaster continued to threaten on the counter attack but they were indebted to Lawlor who was at full stretch to keep out substitute Ben Gladwin 's curling effort . <p> The away side extended their lead when substitute May latched onto a weak clearing header from goalkeeper Raya and fired into an empty net . <p> Blackburn reduced the deficit when Samuel nodded in a cross from the right with four minutes to go but it could not take the gloss of an excellent away day for Doncaster . 
 <p> Barnsley 's opening home game in this season 's Championship ended in another defeat but it could have been so different . <p> Tom Bradshaw had the Reds in front in the first half and Paul Heckingbottom 's side threw everything at the visitors defence in the opening period , only to find Ipswich Town keeper Bartosz Bialkowski in superb form . <p> And after weathering that storm , the Tractor Boys revved up in the second half and overturned the deficit with a goal apiece from substitutes David McGoldrick and Martyn Waghorn . <p> Watch the highlights to see how Barnsley were kept out before the break . 
 <h> What Wilder and the Blades made of that last-gasp ' no goal ' decision : Middlesbrough 1 Sheffield United 0 <h> James Shield <p> Beforehand , if Chris Wilder had been asked to identify the biggest threats to his Sheffield United team , he would almost certainly have cited Patrick Bamford , Britt Assombalonga or the other members of Middlesbrough 's ? 30 million strikeforce . <p> An assistant referee with a dubious grasp of the offside law is unlikely to have featured prominently on the agenda when the 49-year-old delivered his pre-match address . <h> Jack O'Connell is consoled by boss Chris Wilder <p> But , after over an hour and a half of hard-fought action , Wilder laid the blame for this result squarely at the feet of Paul Hodskinson , whose decision to rule out Jack O'Connell 's last-gasp equaliser condemned the visitors to their first defeat in seven months . <p> Insisting that colleagues , coaching staff and television analysts alike were all baffled by the official 's interpretation of events , United 's manager branded the adjudication " ridiculous " and claimed , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied his side a " deserved " point . <p> Chris Basham , initially suspected of straying into a prohibited position as players jostled to meet Mark Duffy 's free-kick , agreed . <p> " I ca n't understand why it was n't given , " he said . " I 've run over to the referee and asked . He told me it was ' the number five ' , which was Jack , but , really , I do n't see how it could be him . He 's hardly done anything at all . It does n't make any sense , but that 's why it 's such an intense game , I suppose . They will be buzzing because of it but we 're all gutted in there . " <h> Jack O'Connell thinks he 's scored <p> Middlesbrough were leading courtesy of Rudy Gestede 's goal midway through the opening period when O'Connell appeared to have secured the draw which , despite appearing improbable at one stage , on balance United 's efforts probably deserved . <p> There were spells , particularly before the break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad expected to dominate the Championship after being relegated last term . But , try as they might , Middlesbrough were unable to kill off United 's spirited resistance and were under growing pressure when O'Connell looked to have scored . <p> " It 's a tough place to come . They are the best team in the league and that 's why it really hurts so much , " Basham continued . " I thought we deserved that goal . Everyone was celebrating like wildfire because we thought we 'd scored . " <p> WILDER BEWILDERED <h> David Brooks in action <p> Despite their sense of injustice , United can take encouragement from the fact they pushed Middlesbrough so hard . Monk 's players , and Bamford in particular , caused all manner of problems following Gestede 's intervention . <p> But the direction of travel changed after the interval , with Paul Coutts , arguably United 's most effective midfielder , forcing Darren Randolph into a fine save before the late drama . <p> " Danny Higgingbotham , Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink and everyone else on Sky , our video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are confused , " Wilder , asked for his thoughts on O'Connell 's disallowed goal , said . " Apparently he started off in an offside position , then he moved back into an offside position and then impeded their centre-half from heading the ball . <p> " So let their centre-half just head it clear in the last minute when we are going for a result , after we have been unbeaten for about three years . You ca n't get those decisions wrong , in my point of view . " <p> " I do n't want that to happen to us again , " Wilder added . " I want to make sure , first and foremost , that a linesman gets a decision right . We go to all these FA meetings , with the Football League and . If you do n't , you get fined ten grand and there are new initiatives about key match decisions . There is definitely a report going in about a key match decision in the 93rd minute . " <p> IMPORTANT LESSONS <p> Although United 's complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The free-kick which led to O'Connell 's ' equaliser ' was soft - Basham appearing to trip over his own feet as he charged towards Middlesbrough 's box - and there were times when the Blades struggled to cope with the hosts ' movement and speed of thought . <p> Gestede 's goal , his first since March , also served to remind that mistakes at Championship level will be ruthlessly punished . Bamford 's cute chip caught United napping and , when they failed to clear , the Frenchman turned the ball home beyond Jamal Blackman . <p> " The centre-half should come and head it , " Wilder said . " We had another couple of bits and pieces , but as soon as the goal went in , their tails went up and they showed their quality . We had to hang on in the game and it was important we showed those qualities . " <p> Gestede went close again as Middlesbrough threatened to overwhelm United after taking the lead . But earlier , after Basham had set the tone with a crunching tackle on Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control themselves and ensure the match official 's mistake did not carry so high a price . <p> An incisive move , involving Samir Carruthers and Kieron Freeman , presented Leon Clarke with a clear-cut chance to score . Rather than shoot on sight , the United attacker took a touch and assessed his angles . By the time those calculations were over , the opening had gone . <p> John Fleck also tested Middlesbrough 's defensive capabilities . <p> " The gaffer told us at half-time to go for it because we had nothing to lose , " Basham said . <p> " We probably showed them too much respect during the first half , but in the second I thought it was all us.

Mr Payne was thrown across the carriage , while witness Paul Carr described how Mrs Tonner was ' catapulted ' out of the carriage window . <p> Once the train had been brought to a halt , several people climbed out to try and come to Mrs Tonner 's aid , using bottled water , cotton wool from the first aid box and cushions and pillows to try and make her comfortable . <p> Mr Payne was coming in and out of consciousness from wounds he suffered in the derailment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonner sadly passed away from the multiple injuries suffered in the crash , prior to the emergency services arriving at the scene at around 1.25pm . <p> Speaking after this morning 's inquest , Mrs Tonner 's family made a moving tribute to her . <p> They said : " She was a bold , adventurous , positive Glaswegian with a sharp sense of humour .

 <h> EFL to look into earlier closing of summer transfer window <h> EFL clubs are to debate changes to the summer transfer window next month . <p> Responding to concerns from Premier League clubs surrounding the dates in which the window closes and criticism particularly of that fact that players can move after the season has already begun , the EFL have released a statement which indicates that the matter will be brought up amongst their members . <p> An EFL Spokesman said : " The EFL Board and its Clubs have previously expressed the opinion that closing the summer transfer window in advance of the season commencing would be an improvement on the current position . On this basis we will be tabling the matter for discussion with Clubs in September . <p> " It will be important that all the consequences of such a decision are fully considered , as the requirements of our Clubs are different to those in Europe 's top flight leagues .

 <h> Sheffield Wednesday : Why Owls are wary of old boy Aiden McGeady <p> Things went so badly for Aiden McGeady during his brief spell at Hillsborough that the talented winger seriously contemplated retirement . <p> He spent the second half of the 2015-16 campaign on loan with the Owls but he struggled to hold down a first-team place , appearing on just 13 occasions . The final insult for McGeady was being axed from the matchday squad for the Championship Play-Off Final . <h> Flashback : Aiden McGeady celebrating his goal for Owls against Forest <p> It was , by McGeady 's own admission , one of the lowest points in his footballing career and he conceded he lost his " love of the game " . <p> " It did n't happen here because it was probably difficult for Aiden , " Wednesday midfielder Barry Bannan told The Star . " He came at a time when everyone in the starting team was flying . <p> " We were winning most games so it was hard for him to break in . <p> " There was no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time were doing really , really well and kept him out . " <h> Aiden McGeady <p> It is fair to say McGeady 's temporary switch did not go according to plan but he is not the only loan winger who has failed to shine at Wednesday . Callum McManaman also did not produce the goods last year . <p> Owls boss Carlos Carvalhal said : " The problem with McGeady and Callum McManaman was the same - they did n't play before too much . <p> " They came here with their competition levels not very high . They need time to play , they need to play often , they need to play 90 minutes . But at the same time we need to win games and the players were not fit , not ready to play 90 minutes . " <p> But since leaving Wednesday , McGeady has rebuilt his reputation and recaptured the form he once showed at Celtic . <h> Aiden McGeady <p> He enjoyed an impressive season on loan at Preston North End , with manager Simon Grayson bringing the best out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to play often , often , often , " said Carvalhal . " I believe , because I spoke with the coach , that in the first one , two , three four games he was not so good . <p> " After more games he plays well . But for us , when you are playing to a high level , trying to get promoted and so on , it is often not compatible . <p> " Some new signings have difficulties , and when they play often we know that we chose good players . McGeady 's a good example . When we brought McGeady , we knew that we were bringing a good player , even if in that moment people criticised . " <p> It was no surprise McGeady followed Grayson to Wearside this summer . The 31-year-old cost a measly ? 250,000 . It is early days but that already looks one of the Championship bargains of the season . <p> McGeady caught the eye in Sunday 's triumph at Norwich City , scoring one goal and creating another in their fine 3-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his former teammate will pose at S6 tonight . <p> He said : " Aiden is one of the better players in that team . He makes things happen for them . I watched the Derby game a couple of weeks ago and he was lively . Aiden is a good , good player . " <p> Wednesday bolstered their wide options , bringing in George Boyd on a free transfer at the beginning of July . <p> Bannan said : " He is a great signing for us . That keeps people on their toes . But , too many signings can affect the team because it takes players longer to get used to the way we play . " 
 <h> Advocate of destruction ? <p> Julie Dore appears to advocate destroying anything regarding the heritage of this city . <p> She and the council have over many years destroyed its historical sites , especially its industrial sites , and she and the council made an utter mess of the Women Steel roll of honour list and still not rectified it . <p> The tree fiasco is yet another debacle with no regard for Sheffield or Sheffield opinion . For the council to say the majority of Sheffield public are in favour of the tree felling is nonsense . Tell all her councillors to resign and seek re-electon on the tree issue and we will see if what she says is true . Good luck to Michael Gove but he is wasting his time unless he imposes it on them . <p> RG <p> Sheffield <p> Villages on the 57 route <p> Recently I heard that the bus route number 57 from Sheffield to the Stocksbridge area may be cut at " off peak " hours from every half-hour to an hourly one ! <p> Since the " abolition " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , etc. , it is hoped that if any alterations do take place then in this particular situation an exception to the rule could be made and have one printed ! Otherwise , the situation could become really bewildering to bus commuters on this route . <p> Communication in recent times to bus users has been pathetic in this city ! However , no doubt somebody somewhere will suggest that they go into their computer system to suss out the bus times , but the point is , not everyone is on the system , so it could entail them being left standing at bus stops for long periods at a time - stranded as it were ! Elderly people who shop in Hillsborough and rely on the 57 bus a lot would be hard hit . Especially those who live in the villages on the 57 route . <p> B Wilkinson <p> S36 <p> Keep an eye on the ball <p> You have received many letters highlighting that parts of Sheffield City Council 's PFI Streets Ahead contract are redacted and unavailable for the public and experts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenting on the laws surrounding the arguable trespass of tree campaigners . <p> However , to an extent , these matters are red herrings . The parts of the contract that can be reviewed - by anyone - clearly show that SCC has a responsibility to deliver sustainable management of our street trees and to deliver standard good practice . It is this that they are clearly failing in - with lots of evidence already gathered by the public . We do n't need to see yet more of the contract to realise this , prove it and evoke change . We still do n't have a Tree and Woodlands Strategy promised two years ago . We still are n't seeing evidence that SCC and their contractor Amey are applying any alternatives to felling . Chasing up redacted parts of the PFI contracts is vital and principled , as is challenging any Council 's draconian application of trespass laws under the guise of altruism . However , we need to keep our eye on the ball . <p> LW <p> by email <p> Seems we 're not so good <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBC regarding our track and field athletes , apparently they are all medallists before they have even run , jumped or thrown . <p> In the main they have failed to podium and we have had the apr ? s event , breathless interviews with tears and " well I 'll take the positives I 'm only 20 so roll on Tokyo " , forgetting that the American who won was only 20 too ! I 'm sure at some stage we will persuade the IAA to strike a medal for 4th place , we 'd win a bundle of those ! Most of these athletes are living on grants , some decide to train in France , ( why ? ) , they all look good with well groomed hair styles and in some cases artistic tattoos , ( who pays ? ) , what a pity that most of them fail to achieve AND we 've now gone from performance enhancing drugs to performance restricting bugs . The highlight has been seeing that class act Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill receiving her belated gold , a true star and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tree policy support <p> I write in support of the tree replacement policy being carried out by Sheffield Council . I have lived here for more than 30 years as have many of my neighbours , the majority who I have talked to feel the same way , there are a small minority who are against the tree policy , but tend not to have a tree directly in front or adjacent to there own property . <p> Our road has a number of very large mature trees , they look nice but have many undesirable side effects , uneven pavements , kerbs jutting out into the road , front boundary walls leaning and broken , roofs that have to be cleared of moss growth , gutters that have to be cleared of leaves and finally the limiting effect of warmth and light through front windows . As an example a neighbour had a mature London plane 4.5m from their bay window , these trees grow to a height of 20-25m twice as high as their house and a spread of 15-20m with root systems spreading up to 12m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to your property ? <p> My house and some of my neighbours have trees directly in front of their houses , we are the people who are directly affected , not the people who have been protesting and disrupting the tree replacement program who have a selfish attitude and are only bothered with their own agenda , because of this disruption the pavement and kerb work has now been delayed and will probably delay the planting of new more suitably sized trees . <p> I would also like to commend the restraint and civility shown by the various contractors when confronted by the protestors climbing past the safety barriers erected for the safety of the general public . Reports of contractors banging on peoples doors telling them to move cars is not true , when a car needs moving for safety reasons I observed them being more than civil in their requests . <p> A number of the trees have been felled , including the one in front of my and other neighbours houses and we all agree we now have much more light and warmth filling our front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our gutters cleared of leaves and moss scraped off the front roof . <p> Hopefully the planned road and pavement work will proceed along with the replanting of the more suitable , sensible sized trees this autumn . <p> Mr T Parkin <p> S8 <p> Not a suitable environment <p> I was interested in an article about the Levang restaurant , Nether Green , wanting planning to erect outdoor seating which can be used from midday until 11pm . No-one in your article mentions the fact that you have a school opposite and when the children leave school there are lots of parents and children in the area , which will be overlooked by diners and drinkers , and smokers . When it is not being used by the restaurant it will be used as a climbing frame for any reveller who is on the way home from a night out . This is not a suitable environment to have this decking which will alter the ' green ' at Nether Green . 
 <h> Sheffield Wednesday Fan 's Column : With flashes of great play , does Adam Reach sum up this Owls team ? <h> Laura Jones <p> Is Adam Reach the personification of this current Sheffield Wednesday team ? <p> We know there 's quality there , but we 're never quite sure when it might appear ( it changes from one-half to the next ) . <p> We know he can cross a ball because we 've seen it with our own eyes but then we think we 've imagined it and it 's always in the back of our minds that we might have paid too much for him - reportedly ? 5million . <p> Quality , crossing and cost , these subjects are simply a game of two halves for the Owls . <p> Reach had a great second half at Hillsborough against Sunderland . <p> At Middlesborough , he was primarily a left-back and utilised as a winger when needed . <p> Carvalhal seems to see him as more of a winger and a stand-in full-back . <p> His inconsistent crossing and ability to beat a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period where he plays like he did against Sunderland on Wednesday night and it lulls you into a false sense of security . <p> Could it be that he is n't a confident winger and is more comfortable at full-back or wing-back ? <p> A draw was a fair result on Wednesday evening as it was a fair result the previous Saturday against QPR . <p> I 've been thinking about last season and the games where the results were n't fair . <p> We robbed some teams last year with our performances , but we labelled it a gritty determination . <p> With the team we have , we should have better quality throughout the team , better crossing and set-piece play for the cost and quantity of players in the squad . <p> But as we have n't changed much at all from last season should we be shocked that the fair results do n't end with three points for us ? 
 <h> Sheffield United Fan 's Column : A week of mixed feelings about where we are <h> Matthew Bell <p> I did n't see the trouble after the match last Saturday so ca n't really comment on what went on , except to say that the policy of penning people in for ten minutes , as we were in the Riverside coach park , only encourages mobs of idiots to gather either side of the separating fence goading each other . <p> If everyone was let out together , then the few braindeads who indulge in this sort of activity would be dispersed and diluted amongst the many thousands of sensible , civilised fans who just want to go home . But what do I know that the police do n't ? <p> I also shake my head in bemusement at those who stand about in the concourse under the stand drinking ( plus others in the toilets smoking ) and looking at their phones while the game is going on after paying ? 30 for a ticket and probably the same on travel . But to say they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . <p> As for the match , after a good start for United they barely kept their heads above water for the rest of the first half . The second was much different , and by the end United had mustered more possession and shots on target than Boro . Such stats do n't tell the whole story , but they ( and what we saw ) suggest that United can maybe live with the best teams in the division . The disallowed goal was as inexplicable as people who have paid for a ticket not watching the match , but then it was never a foul in the first place . Nevertheless , it 's gutting when something like that happens so late . <p> However , another defeat to a team not considered by those who consider themselves experts to be one of the best in the division ( but which now has a 100% record ) suggests there is a lot of work to be done . For a team that is n't accustomed to losing to lose two in a row must be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition keep the ball better and generally do things that opponents last season were n't capable of doing . <p> Footballers tend to improve by absorbing the things that happen on a football pitch . This is called experience . As in any walk of life , when you know what to expect you can try to plan for it , a skill that comes through experience , whether it be in football or in a factory . The difference is that in football the ability levels rise sharply as you go up the divisions and some players will never improve enough to cope , regardless of experience . If United have any players in this category , you can be sure that Chris Wilder will replace them at the earliest opportunity . Sentimentality wo n't come into it . <p> As I said last week , it 's highly unlikely that the Blades team that started the season will be the same as the one that finishes it . In fact - as it did last year - the team might even change markedly before the end of August . 
 <h> The end of mankind <p> In the last 50 years there have been numerous world meetings to discuss the reason for climate change and the running out of the planet 's resources without ever identifying the real reason we are in the state we are , namely the population explosion . <p> If the planet 's population was three billion and not seven billion all the current problems would not exist and yet we are making the problem worse by pouring money into scientific research to improve health and increase life expectancy when we should be finding ways to control the worlds population . <p> Otherwise the problems we have now will pale in to insignificance when the population hits 10 billion . <p> RD <p> by email <p> Waste disposal <p> Well I 've just had an eye-opener . <p> We have a young Polish couple living next door to us , decent neighbours , very sociable , both work etc . <p> The other day they asked me how do they get rid of unwanted household goods , so he filled his car with what he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Shirecliffe . <p> That just left him with three larger items , including a large fridge/freezer which obviously would n't fit in his car . <p> So he asks me if I could ring the appropriate authorities to have them taken away for him because he does n't speak very good English . No problem , I tell him . <p> Now I 've always thought you could have large unwanted furniture taken away for free . <p> So I phone them for him only to be told to make sure he has the items out for easy access and when he pays over the phone , they will give him a date . <p> Now it all becomes clear now why there is so much fly- tipping . <p> I know I will get people coming back at me in here , saying things like , it 's your obligation and your moral responsibility too . <p> Well I 'm sorry , even though you would be right in saying so but people will not pay to have to have rubbish taken away . <p> It 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can remember years ago when you could hire a 10-ton skip for ? 50 , then someone doubled the price and I remember saying to my wife that this will just encourage people to fly-tip and sure enough it did , practically overnight . <p> I know it 's a big problem but surely charging people is not going to solve it ? <p> How about placing communal skips in designated areas ? <p> Ted Fowler <p> by email <p> Trees a silent majority view <p> I am writing to try to present the views of those of us who have strong feelings about our Sheffield trees but who do not protest loudly enough . <p> I am lucky to live close to Ecclesall Woods in a road lined by huge trees , mainly London plane , lime , ash and sycamore . <p> When I moved into the road 35 years ago the trees were lopped annually by a tree gang working out of Ecclesall Woods , ( now the Saw Mill ) . <p> Two trees near our house were removed due to disease and replaced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the houses but still dwarfed by the older trees . <p> Due to lack of money the care of our trees in Sheffield was neglected and many have grown out of their environment . <p> Sheffielders moaned constantly , and with justification , about the state of our roads and pavements but now that we have grants to rectify this a small but loud minority are preventing work from being done . <p> The pavements at the bottom of our road are virtually unusable due to the tree roots . <p> My husband has tripped and fallen twice in the dark , mothers often push their children 's buggies along the road and several elderly people have resorted to walking in the road rather risk tripping and falling . <p> Last week the council workers arrived to remove an extremely large London plane tree , ( more suited to London parks ) , from outside a neighbour 's house . <p> This has caused the pavement to rise and break up badly and the roots have been growing into my neighbour 's cellar . <p> Sadly a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being felled . <p> They did not live on our road and had no thought , time or courtesy to listen to the views of those of us who do and are desperate to have the trees that are causing damage removed , and replaced by smaller and more suitable species . <p> The council is removing and REPLACING trees . <p> I am sure that no one wishes us to lose our title of Greenest City , we love our trees but sadly many have outgrown the position that they are in . <p> Many obstruct the view of on-coming vehicles when turning onto major roads , ( Rivelin Valley and Hagg Hill , top of Road and Ecclesall Road to name two that I regularly use ) , and have been planted too close together . <p> So much publicity has been given to those who shout the loudest and now Michael Gove has joined in . <p> Has he ever been to Sheffield ? <p> I would challenge him and the protesters to walk blindfold with a stick or to use a wheelchair along our pavements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this but many of our trees were planted at the same time , have been neglected and will eventually die at around the same the time . <p> If we do not have a rolling programme of replacement and management we will , one day , become a city with far fewer trees . <p> I feel that the time has come for those of us who keep silent , or just chunter among ourselves , to raise our voices . <p> Many of us support the Council , ( apart from the way they went about things in Rustlings Road , ( under the cover of darkness ! ) , and welcome the removal of trees that are causing damage and their replacements . <p> Mrs B Houghton <p> by email <p> Sandwich shops <p> There are plenty of independent sandwich shops open in Sheffield finding making a living hard . One Pret A Manger does n't make a summer . <p> Ron Clayton <p> S6 <p> Iconic Cole 's Corner <p> In reply to Susan Richardson 's letter , ( August 15 ) , calling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fargate . <p> Instead of razing it to the ground , it would be better to stoneclad the on- time Gas Board showrooms and fit a doorway canopy and other features similar to the iconic Cole 's Corner which once stood on the site . <p> It would turn an eyesore into a lovely structure and blend in well with the Cutlers ' Hall , the Cathedral and other adjacent Victorian architecture in the area . <p> Other of Sheffield 's less desirable buildings could be given the similar treatment and the city centre would be a more attractive place . 
 <h> Mark Aston picks from position of strength as Sheffield Eagles go for three in a row <h> Matt Young <p> The Eagles are looking for their third straight victory as they take on Neil Kelly 's improving side , with Aston having an almost full-strength squad to pick from . <p> Regular half-backs Simon Brown and Remy Marginet both available again after a short spell on the sidelines . <p> In their absence , emergency halves Jack Owens and Elliot Minchella have both excelled , giving the Eagles chief food for thought as he looks to make it a hat-trick of victories in the Championship Shield . <p> " The nice thing for me is that there is a choice , " Aston told The Star . <p> " Jack Owens has really stood up in the halves , and Ryan Millar has done really well at full-back . He is certainly looking like he is developing into that player we all know he is capable of being . <p> " Elliot Minchella has scored five tries in two games . He has that versatility and he can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different half-backs ; they are runners , whereas Remy and Simon are more focused on the game-management side . It is a nice headache to have . " <p> With Sam Scott and Will Hope both passing fitness tests this week , the only absentee looks to be St Helens loanee Calvin Wellington who has a hamstring issue which could rule him out for the rest of the campaign . <p> Fellow loanees Liam Cooper and Jonah Cunningham are back , but Aston confirmed that they will again play for St Helens reserves this week to build up their fitness . <p> " We have Sam Scott back who was missing last weekend , so that 's good news and more competition , " Aston confirmed . <p> " He is not the only one back . We have been close with Will Hope and this week he has passed a fitness test so we have him available again , which is great news because he has been one of our top performers . " 
 <h> Paul Goodwin <p> " I have to find a way of beating these , it 's doing my head in , " joked Darren Ferguson after his side 's 3-3 draw with Blackpool . <p> If you believe in bogey clubs then look no further than the Tangerines . <p> They virtually consigned Rovers to relegation when they won 1-0 at the Keepmoat Stadium last year . <p> They repeated that scoreline in April to complete a double over Doncaster last season . <p> And on Saturday they simply refused to roll over as they came from behind three times to earn a share of the spoils from what Ferguson described as an ' unusual ' game . <p> Blackpool have never lost at the Keepmoat Stadium and have now gone nine league games unbeaten in Doncaster . <p> Ferguson 's problem was not with the visitors , though , who he accepted had scored two excellent goals through Sean Longstaff and Oliver Turton . <p> It was with his own players ' lack of concentration and nous as they continued to surrender their advantage and twice conceded within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in the lead you would have to say it 's two points dropped , " he said . <p> " I thought we controlled large parts of the game so I 'm slightly disappointed . <p> " I think we 've got ourselves to blame for not winning the match . <p> " Sometimes you have to say the opposition did this or that but we 've done it to ourselves with just lapses of concentration . <p> " It 's rare that you get two goals of the quality of Blackpool 's first two in one game . <p> " But the third goal is terrible . It 's less than a minute after we score and we 've not touched the ball . <p> " I thought with concentration and being careless , we 've done that too much for my liking . " <p> story of the match <p> Clearly confident following their excellent 3-1 win at Blackburn , Rovers were on top during the early part of this game and had a good opportunity when Tommy Rowe and John Marquis raced clear only for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The home side survived a huge let-off when , against the run of play , Mark Cullen went clean through on goal only to pull his hamstring and play no further part in the game . <p> Callum Cooke replaced Cullen and his extra bite in midfield allowed Blackpool to wrestle back some control . <p> However , it was Rovers that went ahead on 37 minutes when Rowe 's 20-yard half volley hit the crossbar and went in off the back of goalkeeper Ryan Allsop . <p> The hosts were caught off guard from the re-start , however , when Longstaff found space 25 yards out and smashed a stunning effort past Ian Lawlor . <p> Rovers retook the lead before half time when Matty Blair headed back across the face of goal and John Marquis converted from close range with a clever bicycle kick . <p> The lead lasted 20 minutes this time , before Turton cut in the from the right and curled a delightful left-footed effort into the far top corner . <p> Blackpool sensed an opportunity to go and win the game and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went ahead for a third time when Clark Robertson failed to clear Blair 's cross and super-sub Alfie May prodded in from six yards . <p> The home side 's joy quickly turned to anguish , however , as straight from the kick off they worked the ball into the Doncaster area and Cooke coolly home the third and final equaliser . <p> CASE FOR THE DEFENCE <p> Despite conceding three goals at home , and switching off twice immediately after scoring , Ferguson was keen to absolve his defenders of the blame . <p> " The third goal was really poor defensively from us a team , " he said . <p> " The second goal we need to stop the shot quicker but it 's one hell of a shot . Nine times out of ten their first two goals do n't go in most Saturdays . We conceded three and everyone will be screaming ' it 's the defence ' . I thought my defence were fine . <p> " It was n't an issue with the defenders , it was what was in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second half we lost a grip of the game in midfield . We were n't aggressive enough . <p> " When it went to 2-2 I changed the shape to 3-5-2 and matched them up and it helped us get control of the game again . <p> " I thought we finished the game very strongly but our conentration let us down . " <p> IMPACT FROM THE BENCH <p> Alfie May 's impact from the bench has been noticeable , coming on to score for two Saturdays in succession . <p> He gives the side a real lift , energy and spirit when he appears . <p> And Rodney Kongolo did the same this weekend , bolstering the midfield during the closing stages - although the youngster appeared to fail to track the run of Cooke for the third equaliser . <p> ON THE PLUS SIDE <p> The Rovers players trudged off the pitch with glum faces at the final whistle , knowing they had let two points slip from their grasp . <p> But on the flip side they remain unbeaten this season . And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proving to be a problem . <p> " We 've got goals in the team , all over the team , " said Ferguson . <p> " John 's got two on the bounce , Alfie May 's got two on the bounce in the league , Rowey 's got off the mark . 
 <p> Chris Wilder has revealed Sheffield United are close to making a breakthrough in the transfer market after confirming both he and Alan Knill have signed new contracts at Bramall Lane . <p> Speaking ahead of tonight 's Carabao Cup second round tie against Leicester City , Wilder explained the deal , which ties him to the Championship club until 2020 , was officially ratified before the start of the present campaign . <p> The 49-year-old , who guided United to promotion after being appointed manager last summer , was reacting to speculation the agreement remained unsigned after being ratified " in principle " two months ago . <p> " I 'm delighted to be here , " Wilder he said . " Knilly is too . It 's a one year extension , on top of what I already had when I came in . It got sorted out the day before the first match of the season . " <p> Wilder , who previously warned he wanted " no fanfare or big announcement " regarding the development , has been linked with the likes of Darragh Lenihan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his squad before this month 's transfer deadline . <p> " We 're hopefully of getting something done , possibly before the weekend , " he added . " We 're just waiting on other people to do a bit of business themselves first . They want to do that before they let people out . I would imagine the vast majority of Championship managers , who are looking at people , are in the same position . " 
 <h> Robert Cumber <p> A Sheffield man has appeared in court accused of committing a string of robberies at supermarkets across the city . <p> Craig Houlston is charged with five counts of robbery , four counts of possessing an offensive weapon , four counts of shoplifting and one count of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence . <p> The 34-year-old , of Rowsley Street , near the city centre , appeared at Sheffield Magistrates ' Court this morning and was remanded into custody until his next court date . <p> He was arrested after five robberies were reported at supermarkets across Sheffield during a three-week period beginning last month , where a man is alleged to have entered and threatened staff with a weapon . 
 <h> Life-saving work of Yorkshire Air Ambulance shown on TV again <h> Claire Lewis <p> The life-saving work of Yorkshire Air Ambulance is to be shown on TV again , with a new series of Helicopter ER due to start on Monday . <p> The dramatic rescue of a cyclist after a high-speed crash features in the new series of the reality TV programme , which starts its second series at 9pm on Really . <p> Triathlete , cyclist and endurance runner Tom Phillips was on a 130-mile cycle ride through the Yorkshire Dales when he lost control on the steep Buttertubs Pass descent and smashed into a drystone wall . <p> He suffered a broken neck , spine , sternum , several ribs and collarbone in the crash . <p> Yorkshire Air Ambulance paramedics stabilized Tom before airlifting him to James Cook University Hospital , Middlesbrough , in 20 minutes . <p> The journey by road would have taken an hour-and-a-half . <p> The 53-year-old underwent seven hours of surgery to repair his back and collarbone , with metal rods inserted on either side of his spine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since raised ? 3,000 for Yorkshire Air Ambulance . <p> The first episode of the new series also features an elderly dairy farmer attacked by one of his own herd and a crash on the A1 in which a car careered over a bridge and burst into flames on the motorway below , trapping the driver . <p> Helicopter ER is made by York-based Air Television , which recently won two Royal Television Society awards for the first series . 
 <p> Enda Stevens pauses for a moment and rocks back and forth in his chair before answering the question which , despite being designed to end our conversation , instead steers it into an entirely different realm . <p> " Who is the best player I 've come up against ? That 's a tough one , it really is . I 'd have to say Diego , the little Brazilian to be honest . He was excellent , really something else . " <h> Enda Stevens has played in some of its most hostile arenas too . <p> Stevens ' choice might come as a surprise to those unaware of his career path , because , before joining Sheffield United , the wing-back found himself leading a sometimes nomadic existence in English football 's lower leagues . Notts County , Doncaster Rovers and Northampton Town , where he first met Chris Wilder , were all ports of call as opportunities at Aston Villa proved limited . But it was back home in his native Ireland , at St Patrick 's Athletic and Shamrock Rovers , where Stevens found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era . <p> " In my first season at Shamrock , we ended up drawing Juventus in the Europa League , " he remembers . " They had people like Alessandro Del Piero , David Trezeguet and Giorgio Chiellini in the squad and they all played . So that was n't a bad team was it ? <p> " The next season , was when we qualified for the group stages . We beat Partizan Belgrade to qualify and then got Spurs , Rubin Kazan and PAOK of Greece . It was a brilliant experience but we did n't go through , unfortunately . As far as learning goes , though , it was absolutely invaluable . To come up against people like that , the really top pro 's , teaches you what they do to reach the level they 're at . " <p> Stevens is sitting in the Steelphalt Academy 's media suite as he traces his journey to Bramall Lane . The 27-year-old has supposedly finished his round of interviews but the opportunities to talk more football over a cup of tea proves impossible to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense as factors behind United decision to sign him from Portsmouth three months ago . Nevertheless , as Stevens sheds light on two trips behind the old iron curtain , another reason becomes clear ; the ability , even in the most difficult of circumstances , to beat the odds and perform . <p> " Belgrade was intense , let 's just say that . I 've been to some places where the atmosphere is totally different to here . It was so heavy , they were n't in a good place and were under a lot of pressure from their own fans . <p> " Russia , in Sovetov , was probably the best I 've played in . That was with St Pat 's . It was just electric . The crowd were singing non-stop and it was just a different feel . The noise they made was something else , the more they did , the louder it got . Still , it was really , really enjoyable . " <p> Stevens ' masochistic streak is likely to prove invaluable as United attempt to establish themselves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's visitors to Bramall Lane , former European Cup semi-finalists Derby County , are among the biggest spenders in the division after lavishing nearly ? 25m on players in the past two seasons alone . Although new manager Gary Rowett has adopted a more prudent approach towards recruitment , the presence of Tom Huddlestone , Curtis Davies and Tom Lawrence in the visitors ' squad confirms the purse strings could hardly be described as taut at Pride Park . Wilder , despite negotiating deals for seven players since leading United to promotion , has utilised around eight per cent of that amount . <p> Stevens , who arrived on a free transfer from Portsmouth after electing to leave Fratton Park , turned professional with UCD before moving across Dublin ; first to St Patrick 's and then Shamrock . His displays for The Hoops convinced Alex McLeish , then manager of Villa , to bring him to England in January 2012 but it was a brief spell at Sixfields , where Wilder was working at the time , which proved the defining moment of his career . <h> Juventus striker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was n't in a great place when I went there , " Stevens admits . " My head was n't right and I was stuck in a rut at Aston Villa . I did n't show him everything I could do but it was brilliant . I was delighted when he came back in for me again . He made an impression . <p> " In the short spell I was there , he taught me a new way of playing the game . Him and ( assistant manager Alan Knill ) coached me along . He told me what I needed to do with my career . " <p> As well as resurrecting his partnership with Wilder , joining United , Stevens explains , held another attraction too . Fellow Irishman Daniel Lafferty , previously of Derry City , was a member of the team which cruised to promotion last term and agreed a new long-term contract earlier this year . <p> " I know Daniel from back home , " he says . " We played against each other a few times and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . To be fair , though , all of us here are really good mates and there are n't any separate groups .

 <h> Lee Peace <h> Police officers have received specialist training on how to deal with acid attacks - after shocking figures revealed nearly 30 similar incidents across South Yorkshire in the last two years . <p> Statistics obtained using the Freedom of Information Act reveal there has been 26 alleged crimes reported to South Yorkshire Police since 2015 in which chemicals including ammonia and bleach have been used to attack people with . <h> Barnsley Road , Fir Vale . Picture : Google <p> The figures reveal that the victims suffered burns on two occasions after having corrosive substances ' thrown , sprayed , squirted or daubed ' on them . In the last several weeks there has been reports of yobs throwing a noxious substance out of a car window at a woman 's face in Sheffield , along with two similar alleged incidents in Doncaster . <p> South Yorkshire Police has now given extra training to more than 5000 members of staff - including over 2500 officers - advising how to deal with a victim of an alleged acid attack . <p> Detective superintendent Caroline Marsh , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks are one of the most distressing assaults a person can commit against another . <p> " The victims of these attacks are in many cases , left with extremely painful and life changing injuries , which undoubtedly will have a long lasting and detrimental effect on their wellbeing . <h> Doncaster Royal Infirmary .

 <p> Sheffield United have received an offer , believed to be worth around ? 200,000 , for James Hanson ahead of tomorrow 's transfer deadline . <p> The bid , from League One club Scunthorpe , means Chris Wilder must decide whether to part company with the centre-forward only seven months after signing him from Bradford City or reserve judgement about his Championship credentials until the window reopens in January . <h> James Hanson was injured against Walsall : Simon Bellis/Sportimage <p> Hanson has played less than 60 minutes of football since helping United win promotion last season after with a muscle injury during their Carabao Cup tie against Walsall . <p> " We 've had people ask about some of our lads who have n't been involved much yet , " Wilder said . " We 've got things we are looking to progress ourselves but obviously there are decisions to be made there as well .

Blackburn Rovers are also known to have been monitoring Hanson 's situation during the close season . 
 <h> Sheffield Heritage Open Days 2017 : Following the trail of family that helped to design city <h> Richard Blackledge <p> There is a strong link that connects many important buildings in Sheffield - from King Edward VII school in Broomhill to St John 's Church at Ranmoor and the old bank that now houses the city centre 's Head of Steam pub . <p> All were designed by the same firm of architects , Flockton 's , who over four generations in the 19th and early 20th centuries left an indelible stamp on the city 's surroundings . <h> Neil Orpwood at Laycock House . Picture by Marisa Cashill <p> Working in an age before uncluttered , clean lines were the planner 's ultimate goal , their creations favoured an elaborate style - all stone carvings , columns and costly grandeur . <p> The Flockton legacy will come under the spotlight on Sunday , September 10 , during walking tours organised by the Sheffield Society of Architects for the annual Heritage Open Days . <p> Neil Orpwood , an associate director at HLM Architects in Tudor Square who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim is to encourage people to ' stop and look ' . <p> " The idea is to identify 16 fairly well-known buildings by Flockton 's , but also to pick up on some of the other developments happening in Sheffield today . " <p> The idea for the walks was triggered when the society - a branch of the Royal Institute of British Architects - bought an archive of around 300 Flockton drawings and began studying them closely . <p> " There are some beautiful drawings on vellum , and some on poor quality paper that 's started to tear , " he says . <p> The firm 's roots were laid in the early 1830s when William Flockton , the son of a carpenter and builder in Sheffield , established himself as an architect . He operated the business from 1845 to 1849 with partner William Lee and son Thomas James as Flockton , Lee and Flockton , continuing with Thomas as Flockton &amp; Son until his death in 1864 . <p> This era produced many familiar buildings , including The Mount in Broomhill , dating from 1830 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a miniature Chatsworth ; 1838 's Wesley College - later King Edward 's - and Tapton Hall , finished in 1855 . Like most Flockton projects , these are all at least Grade II listed . <p> The company continued as partners came and went , changing names through the years - Flockton &amp; Abbott , Flockton &amp; Gibbs , and finally with Thomas 's son Charles as Flockton , Gibbs &amp; Flockton . Endcliffe Hall , from 1865 , St John 's church , built in 1887 , and The Towers - a striking , baronial country house on Sandygate Road , completed in 1896 , belong to this period . <p> Neil says afterwards the practice ' quietly stopped working ' , but points out that the society are n't experts on the history - just enthusiasts with an interest in their forebears ' work . <p> " We 're trying to pick up as much information as we can as well . There might be people on the tours who know more about these buildings than we do . " <p> Pointing out a few stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Surrey Street - " A really nice space - people constantly walk past the shops below but do n't necessarily see what 's above " - and Laycock House , a five-storey scheme from 1896 comprising flats , shops and a courtyard on Cross Burgess Street , which Neil thinks highlighted early on what a modern city centre should look like . <p> " You do n't want everyone to go home and leave the city centre behind . " <p> The observation is a pertinent one as , just yards away , the first phase of the Sheffield Retail Quarter is getting under way with offices for HSBC . <p> " As architects we try and make the public spaces we occupy more enjoyable and healthier , " says Neil . <p> " A lot of that is to do with aesthetics , landscaping , the quality of the air and so on . What we 're trying to do is get people to look a bit more closely and recognise what makes a space good , rather than just getting a feeling . " <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheffield Water Works Company Offices on Division Street , adorned with sculpted heads of Greek and Roman water gods . <p> " It 's very difficult for us to argue for expensive embellishments , " Neil concedes . <p> The free tours are happening at 10.30am and 2.30pm , starting at the entrance to King Edward VII school on Newbould Lane and finishing at the Head of Steam . Registration essential , deadline next Friday , September 8 . Another two routes are being compiled that people can download from the internet , print off and embark on in their own time . <p> Visit **39;380;TOOLONG to book or see **27;421;TOOLONG for details of the open days , taking place from September 7 to 10. 
 <h> Alan Biggs : Sheffield Wednesday need signings to get players out of their comfort zone <p> I write about Sheffield Wednesday on a Wednesday as usual . Hopefully Thursday will provide some sort of catalyst for a club and team needing a spark . <p> This regime 's emphasis has been on signing quality players of good character with essentially British traits whether foreign or not . <p> Look through the players who have started regularly this season and I think you 'll find a good professional in every case ; 100% triers with a genuine affinity to the club . <p> Doubtless you can probe deeper into the squad and find much of the same . It 's been a foundation of the last two seasons . <p> But sometimes , in whatever field of work , we all need an outside stimulus . Just occasionally we need to feel under threat . Not because we do n't give the job our best but because competition , and even a touch of insecurity , can drag out that extra something we might not have thought we had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collectively , are producing it all too rarely at the moment . <p> I hope that by the time the window closes tonight there will have been some significant shift in the squad - including players out if that brings players in , and not only because of FFP . <p> There is no suggestion of anyone slacking . It 's more a suspicion about the sub-conscious effect on all of us when the environment becomes comfortable , arguably too comfortable . Carlos Carvalhal makes a point of creating an enjoyable one . That 's great and not the point at issue . <p> Neither is any lack of competition a factor . How could it be with some 30 odd players in the senior squad ? <p> But the core of this has been largely unaltered for the best part of two years . That 's a very long time in football . <p> Most of the players therein are substantially paid on medium-to-long contracts . Importantly , they have not seen any of their team-mates sold or moved on , only more players added on attractive contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Owls , in my opinion , have passed the point where total continuity is a good thing . <p> The chemistry is no longer working as it did . People need bringing back to the boil . There has to be some heat for that to happen . <p> I do n't say it ca n't be generated from within in the absence of a mini shake-up but right now Wednesday bear an ominous similarity to last season 's Norwich City who largely kept a team that had been up to the Premier League and came down again . They were favourites but flopped and , in losing his job , manager Alex Neil admitted the squad had needed an overhaul . <p> I 'm not sure Carlos Carvalhal has had the power to effect something like that because he does not have overall control of transfers . So blaming a head coach with a fine overall record is simplistic and unfair . A review of the club 's transfer trading structure in order to join up the dots between deals is , I believe , a must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some fire coming back , however it is kindled . <p> Talking of which , the Owls ' 150th anniversary dinner at Pond 's Forge on Monday casts a blazing light on one of football 's most famous clubs and one the game needs back at its top table . 
 <p> It also helped that the team of the time was successful and joy to watch . Hirst , Nilsson , Williams , Pearson , Wilson , Palmer , Sheridan . Their football was the reason I lusted after more of the same . <p> Heady days of cup finals are intoxicating , and you know you want to be together forever . <p> The honeymoon period and rose tinted glasses ended with David Pleat . A little less na ? ve but still addicted . <p> Traditionally a 10th anniversary gift is tin . Instead , we got relegation from the Premier League . Even through our steady decline from richer to poorer , when Sir Dave Richards nearly ruined you , and you became stuck in a rut with Turner , Shreeves and Yorath , I was there . <p> Although love is conditional and you may get annoyed by their faults , the memories of what you 've been through together will outweigh a dip in attraction . <p> On our 15th anniversary you brought me Lee Bullen , Steve Maclean and hope for the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the world who will one day walk into Hillsborough and hopefully feel the connection that I did . <p> In your 150 years , you have brought pleasure and pain to many a fan . I may vent you at times and say things I regret , but you were my first love . Happy anniversary Sheffield Wednesday , I vow this relationship is till death do us part . 
 <h> Why has one Sheffield United fan pledged to have a tattoo of the Blades ' latest striker signing ? <h> Clayton Donaldson has yet to play a single minute for Sheffield United after arriving from Birmingham on Deadline Day - but is on course to be a permanent fixture on the backside of one Blades fan . <p> And it 's all in the name of charity , as United supporter Brett Gregory prepares to get in the tattooists ' chair in support of the LJS Foundation , set up by Blades skipper Billy Sharp and his wife Jade after the tragic death of their newborn son Luey Jacob . On Deadline Day , as the clock ticked towards the 11pm cut-off , Brett tweeted : ' Sign someone and I will get his name tattooed on my a*se ! " Striker Donaldson was confirmed as a United player soon after but , rather than back out , Brett has stuck to his word and pledged to raise money in Luey 's memory instead . He said : " I thought I was safe , until Clayton Donaldson signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweet . " Then a fellow Blade suggested I should do it for the LJS Foundation . So here goes . " If we raise ? 250 I will have the name ' Clayton Donaldson ' tattooed , but if we manage to raise the full ? 1,000 I will have a picture of Donaldson 's face tattooed . " So please get donating and sharing . We already have a tattoo artist donating the tattoo - massive shout out to Ben Smalley , the owner of Skin in Woodhouse . " The campaign has raised ? 185 in a day so far . Last week , a troll was banned by Derby after tweeting vile abuse about Luey after United beat the Rams.

 <h> One player is n't happy about incredible behind-the-scenes video of Sheffield United 's transfer deadline day <p> It offered a unique glimpse of what managers , players , scouts , coaches , agents and admin staff get up to on transfer deadline day . <p> Sheffield United allowed a film-maker a behind-the-scenes look at the mechanics of getting a deal over the line ; the ruthless nature of trading players and the constant back-and-forth between all parties on a highly-stressful day . <p> The video , made by Bleacher Report , revealed that although two players ended up bolstering the United squad , striker Clayton Donaldson and defender Ben Heneghan , there could have been five standing that night holding up the United shirt having made the move to Bramall Lane . <p> As it turned out , the video showed the battlefield faced by managers ; the difficulties in dealing with agents and clubs who are doing their utmost to get the best possible deal . <p> Wilder said , once the window had closed after 11pm that the deadline day experience this time around was ' worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was seen by from United side as a moving of the goalposts from different protagonists in negotiations and the revelation that one of the targets , Watford 's Jerome Sinclair had allegedly got the train to Sheffield from London and was sat at the station , waiting to be told by his agent of the next move . <h> Jerome Sinclair had appeared set to join Sheffield United from Watford <p> United also failed to tie up an agreement to take highly-rated Portuguese youngster Domingos Quina - who it was stated has the same agent as Sinclair - from West Ham and Fleetwood Town forward Devante Cole . <p> " Mixed emotions really , " a clearly frustrated Wilder told Bleacher Report . " Getting a young player in and seeing the delight on his face , coming to a club like this is great . Looking at Clayton Donaldson , an experienced boy , getting on with it with his agent . Easy as . Getting on with it , wants to come and play football . <p> " Maybe the disappointment ( of the day ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to play football and be involved in a proper football club . It 's just amazing how it goes , right to the end and people are prepared and allowed to do it , really ( hold up transfers ) . All five players wanted to be here and only two of the five are here . <p> " I know agents want to get the best deals and clubs want to get the best deals , but there has got to be a better way of dealing with the crazy situation that 's happened today . " <p> One of those players mentioned is not happy with the video , however . <p> Sinclair tweeted on Sunday , taking exception to the mini-documentary . He stated of the video : " This footage is one-sided and very misleading . I was approached , but nothing was agreed . " In a second tweet , Sinclair added : " I am very happy at Watford and am looking forward to the season . Do n't believe everything you read or watch ! " 
 <h> 150 years of Sheffield Wednesday : A night in the Adelphi ... where it all began <h> Jason Dickinson <p> Today marks exactly 150 years since the birth of ' The Wednesday ' at the Adelphi Hotel in Sheffield . <p> As part of their celebrations , Wednesday have launched two new books written by club historian Jason Dickinson . <h> Sheffield Wednesday FC Official History 150 years <p> ' Sheffield Wednesday FC -- the Official History , 150 Years ' and ' -- Fans ' Memories Through the Generations ' went on sale as a package at Owls in the Park yesterday . The anniversary history book covers every facet of the club 's long , rich existence in 13 distinctive chapters . Two extracts have been revealed exclusively to The Star , outlining the formation of the club . <p> At a general meeting held on Wednesday last , at the Adelphi Hotel , it was decided to form a football club in connection with the Sheffield Wednesday Cricket Club , with the object of keeping together during the winter season the members of the cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the desirability of forming the club , there is every reason to expect that it will take first rank . <h> George Senior - Wednesday 's first chairman 1899 <p> Above sixty members were enrolled , without any canvas , some of them being the best players of the town . <p> Sheffield and Rotherham Independent , Friday 6 September 1867 - The above announcement began the next chapter in Wednesday 's history as the members of the cricket club agreed a motion to start a football section . <p> The relatively new sport of association football was already starting to make inroads into the town 's sporting scene , having first began on an organised basis in 1857 when the world 's oldest football club , Sheffield FC , was founded . <p> They were followed by Hallam FC in 1860 , who , like Wednesday , were a cricket club that formed a football section , while teams such as Milton , Pitsmoor , Norton , Norfolk and Collegiate were now playing regularly in the town ; interest was such that in March 1867 the Sheffield Football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The medieval game of football had been played for centuries around the globe in such destinations as China , Greece and Italy , while a ' mob ' version was recorded in England as far back as the fifteenth century , with towns and villages involved in games that could take days to complete . <p> It was not until the 1840s that a new regulated version of association football emerged from the public schools of England and this quickly spread countrywide as the various scholars , responsible for formulating those early rules , returned to their hometowns after completing their studies . <p> The game was recorded in Sheffield in the 1830s , 1840s and 1850s but actually it was two Acts of Parliament that provided the biggest boost to the sport -- the Factory Acts of 1847 and 1850 , which increased the hours of work but put in place regular working patterns and , crucially for football , ensured that work ceased on a Saturday no later than 2 p.m . With Saturday afternoons now at their disposal , the workers started to explore leisure pursuits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination -- within two decades it grew from just the universities to almost every town and village in England . <p> The new game was fast , exciting , highly competitive , easy to play and involved passion and rivalry that would quickly divide loyalties in work places , public houses , clubs and even families ; football was here to stay and quickly became the national sport of England . <h> 1867 Cromwell Cup <p> The town of Sheffield was also expanding rapidly and Victorian society placed great emphasis on fitness , sport and well-being , duly promoting football as a way of achieving all three . <p> Of course , today 's product bears little resemblance to those early years with games being played between teams ranging from 11 to 15 a side , hacking , tripping and handling of the ball were all allowed , and the shape of the ball more similar to the modern rugby ball . <p> There were also no formations to speak of with most of the players running around the field following the ball -- like you would expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The only constant was a gentleman guarding the goal and two men who just hung around their opponents ' goal in the hope of forcing the ball in -- such niceties as throws ins , crossbars , team strips and penalty areas were still years away . <p> Players would often dash straight from their place of employment and play in their work clothes with one side tying handkerchiefs around their arms to distinguish themselves from their opponents . <p> It should also be noted that despite rules being introduced into the game , there was in fact two differing sets , with ' Sheffield Rules ' played in the north of England and ' Cambridge Rules ' in the south . <h> Jack Earp 1896 <p> At the end of the 1876/77 season one unified set of rules was adapted by all , and these have remained ever since , with several notable adaptions and additions . <p> It was against these social , economic and lifestyle changes that the members of Wednesday Cricket Club took the momentous decision , on Wednesday 4 September 1867 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Official History , 150 Years ' include all the managers , club presidents , chairmen and the various grounds that Wednesday have called home since 1867 . <p> There are also in-depth profiles of the club 's greatest players . <p> In ' -- Fans ' Memories Through the Generations ' , Dickinson has interviewed a number of Owls fans , who share their stories on the ups and downs of following the club . <p> Supporters give their opinions on their greatest matches , players and managers , including well-known Wednesday fans Pete McKee and Martyn Ware . <p> The retail price for the two books is ? 35. <h> 1890s Olive Grove <h> Paul Firth - 1901 <h> COPY PICTURE of Sheffield Wednesday , inside right player Harry Davis who played in the Owls side that won the FA Cup Final in 1896 
 <h> Sheffield United : Why does Chris Wilder think Caolan Lavery deserves a huge pat on the back from supporters ? <p> Chris Wilder does not believe Caolan Lavery will change his uncompromising approach despite suffering a horrific facial injury against Derby County last month . <p> The Sheffield Unitred centre-forward visited a specialist yesterday as part of his ongoing treatment to repair the cheekbone and eye socket he shattered during an accidental collision with Marcus Olsson . <p> Although the skill of surgeons at a local hospital and quick-thinking of team doctor Subhashis Basu ensured Lavery is unlikely to suffer any lasting physical damage , fears have been expressed the extent of his injuries could have psychological implications when he returns to action . <p> But , praising the Canadian 's " attitude and work ethic " , Wilder said : " Caolan gets bumps and bruises , he 's a committed player . He puts his body on the line and , with that , come some bad things . He wo n't change through and I do n't want him to change . It was a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " He 'll still look to get stuck in and , like me , he knows this is a contact sport , " the United manager added . " Making contact is n't something we like the players to do , it 's expected . " <p> News of Lavery 's lay-off - he is expected to be ruled-out for around two months - comes at a particularly inopportune moment for both the club and player himself . With Leon Clarke suspended and James Hanson nursing a hamstring complaint , new signing Clayton Donaldson is expected to be thrust straight into action when United visit Sunderland this weekend . After being used predominately as an impact player last term , Lavery also hoped to use the meeting with Derby to stake his claim for a starting role in Clarke 's absence . <h> Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder <p> Confirming reports the 24-year-old could have lost his sight had Dr Basu not spotted a build-up of pressure around Lavery 's right eye , Wilder told The Star : " The doctors are part of the team and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball has n't he ? If that happened on a park , on a Sunday morning , it might have come to a different scenario entirely . Him seeing what happened and being alert has enabled him to take a big decision . " <p> Lavery , who joined United from Sheffield Wednesday last summer , is scheduled to undergo another operation before continuing his rehabilitation at the Steelphalt Academy training complex . Depending upon Donaldson 's impact , his absence means the club could be forced to tweak the 3-5-2 system which has proved so effective since Wilder 's appointment 16 months ago . <p> " Caolan will go for an operation this week and be out for a while , " Wilder said . " If we have to alter the formation , or do things a little different , then that 's what we 'll do . Personally , when I saw him , I thought he 'd be out for a lot longer . " 
 <h> Sheffield Council awards the freedom of the city to Aung San Suu Kyi ( not pictured ) in 2006 . <p> The former activist fought for human rights and democracy in a country that was under military rule for years , and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 . <p> But she now leads a country where the military have been targeting a Muslim group known as the Rohingya for years . Violence has increased in recent weeks , with reports of people being burned and beheaded by soldiers in response to an attack by militants . <p> About 60,000 Rohingya are thought to have fled over the border to Bangladesh in the past week , and Suu Kyi has come under international pressure to condemn the violence . <p> Sheffield community campaigner Shahid Ali , from Nether Edge , believes the leader 's lack of action is cause for her freedom of the city to be revoked . <p> He has set up a petition calling for that to happen , asking the city council to write to the Foreign Office and Myanmar ambassador to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rohingya . So far 340 people have signed . <p> Mr Ali , 38 , said : " There was a time that the citizens of Sheffield fought hard for Aung San Suu Kyi in standing up for democracy and promoting human rights in Myanmar , but now she has become complicit in possible crimes against humanity . <p> " This is a real opportunity for the city of Sheffield to take the lead against such actions and withdraw the freedom of the city that was once bestowed upon Aung San Suu Kyi . <p> " The freedom of the city is the highest honour that the city of Sheffield can bestow . It is symbolic of the esteem that the city holds that person in . " <p> Foreign secretary Boris Johnson this week called for the violence to end . He said the treatment of the Rohingya was ' besmirching the reputation of Burma ' and appealed to Aung San Suu Kyi to act . <p> About 10 years ago Sheffield helped resettle members of the Buddhist Karen community who had fled persecution from the military government Suu Kyi was trying to oust .

In that scenario Barnsley and Doncaster could be the big losers . " <p> But devolution has been taken off the agenda and moved to a special meeting next week . <p> Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 <h> Louis Reed fires home <p> With the fans calling for his head Caldwell managed to get a much-needed response from his players , but the same defensive frailties haunted them again . <p> Goalie Tommy Lee stuck up for his boss before the game and he put words into action with a string of fine saves before the break . <p> The Spireites ' shot stopper had to have his wits about him to keep Nicke Kabamba out at full stretch . <p> Lee was at it again to deny before keeping the potent youngster out minutes later . Kristian Dennis forced a decent save out of Sam Walker with the visitors ' first real effort on goal six minutes before the break . <p> Against the run of play Caldwell 's charges took the lead after 43 minutes - and what a goal it was . <p> Sheffield United loanee Reed rifled a rocket of an effort into the top left corner . <p> The Spireites had to sit back as the U 's held the ball without doing much with it after the restart . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sam Hird on hand to clear the danger . <p> should have equalised when he was charging down on goal but he failed to even work Lee . <p> After defending for their lives for the most part the Spireites cruelly conceded late on . <p> It took 82 minutes for the visitors to be broken down and it was another poor goal to give away . <p> The Spireites switched off as Ryan Jackson 's long throw was flicked on for Hanlan to head home . 
 <h> Alex Moore <h> Hundreds of new trees will be planted to honour Sheffield 's war dead - and the council wants Star readers to help choose where . <p> The authority 's parks department is working with the Royal British Legion on plans for a series of new monuments as it looks to move on from controversial plans to fell trees planted in memory of soldiers killed in conflict . <h> Memorial trees in Western Road . <p> The future of trees in sites such as Western Road in Crookes is yet to be decided , but it is possible some will still be cut down and replaced as they are damaging the pavement . <p> The council says it has recognised people 's passion for commemoration , however , and wants to create new memorials in the city 's parks and open spaces so they are unaffected by any future highway works . <p> It has promised to plant about 300 new trees in time for the centenary of the end of the First World War next year - a number that will be maintained ' in perpetuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheffield to suggest where and in what way the fallen should be remembered . <h> Oxford Street , Crookes . <p> Cabinet member for culture , parks and leisure Mary Lea said : " Over the years , many memorial trees in Sheffield have been removed without replacement . <p> " Today , we are delighted to announce that the council will create a brand new memorial site in the city 's parks , consisting of around 300 trees , to remember all those from Sheffield who sadly lost their lives in conflict . <p> " In addition , we 're making a commitment to ensure these new trees remain , in their entirety , so that future generations will be aware of the sacrifice of others for many years to come . " <p> The council says there are at least nine memorial sites across the city where trees play a part , and is trying to work out exactly how many were originally planted and still remain . <h> The memorial to HMS Sheffield outside Sheffield Cathedral . <p> The aim is to reflect these memorials and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also wants Star readers to suggest how to commemorate those who have died in more recent conflicts . <p> " Currently , there are just under 300 registered memorial trees planted in the city and through this new project , we want to replicate this number in parks by providing a fitting and long-lasting new memorial , where people can gather to pay their respects and remember the fallen in a peaceful and serene environment , " said Coun Lea . <p> " We 're inviting the people of Sheffield to support us in this exciting new project by sending in their ideas for the new sites , which we hope to memorialise in 2018 , to commemorate the 100 year centenary of the First World War . <p> " The memorial will provide an accessible tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and will offer a quiet alternative to those memorials that are located on busy streets or hard to reach areas . <p> " Working with the Royal British Legion and communities across Sheffield , we will plant a future-proof memorial site which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that trees planted in memory of soldiers who died for their country could be cut down has stirred plenty of passion in Sheffield residents . <p> Campaigners have expressed outrage at the thought of chainsaws being taken to war memorials , and thousands have signed petitions calling for trees at sites across the city to be saved . <p> The most publicised example is in Western Road , Crookes , where opposition to the proposed felling and replacement of 23 of the 54 memorial trees led to the formation of a cross-party council group to consider their future . <h> The plaque outside Sheffield Cathedral . <p> Their future has yet to be decided , and some may yet be felled - although the group tried to reassure campaigners by saying Western Road should be returned to its ' original concept ' of about 97 trees that commemorate pupils of nearby Westways Primary School who died int the First World War . <p> Plenty are still not convinced by that response .
