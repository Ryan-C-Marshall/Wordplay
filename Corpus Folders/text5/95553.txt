The number of you that answered yes was actually higher than we anticipated , but still left us at an almost 50/50 split . <h> Why This Matters and What We Learned <p> This information was important to us for one big reason : focus .

Glucocorticoids are used in low doses ( physiologic ) to treat endocrine disorders and in high doses to treat nonendocrine disorders such as arthritis and asthma. n2 . Glucocorticoids are beneficial in nonendocrine disorders primarily because they suppress inflammatory and immune responses. n3 . Glucocorticoids produce their effects by penetrating the cell membrane and activating cytoplasmic receptors , which then travel to the cell nucleus , where they modulate the activity of genes that code for specific regulatory proteins. n4 . Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation by multiple mechanisms , including suppressing ( 1 ) the synthesis of inflammatory mediators ( prostaglandins , leukotrienes , histamine ) , ( 2 ) infiltration of phagocytes , ( 3 ) release of lysosomal enzymes , and ( 4 ) proliferation of lymphocytes. nImportant nonendocrine indications for glucocorticoids include arthritis , allergic disorders , asthma , cancer , and suppression of allograft rejection. n5 .

By combining the content from all 96 Q&amp;A fields into one , we were able to dramatically decrease the number of fields of data stored in the database . Furthermore , these fields are now a part of the board - not a separate piece of content - so the back and forth requests for each board have been dramatically reduced as well . <p> Long story short , we were able to take 107+ fields and narrow them down to just 12 .

@@41481315 @1481315/ <h> It 's Been a Fantastic Year ! <p> It 's hard to believe that an entire year has passed since we started this site . On February 23 , 2014 , several months of building an idea finally launched to the public . It started off slow - as any new site does - but picked up steam quickly after a few quick mentions on Edmodo and Twitter . <p> The site grew to 1,000 registered users in less than a week and to 5,000 in about a month . We 've built new features at a steady clip and launched a PRO offering in May of 2014 . <p> I am , personally , incredibly humbled by the reception , both on social media and in person , that the site has received and it drives me to make sure that FlipQuizG is the easiest to use , most reliable , and most engaging tool for students and teachers alike . <h> By the Numbers <p> FlipQuizG- has already become more successful in its short life than we expected . Here are just a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered users from 140 different countries ! <p> Over 17,000 quiz boards have been created , 5,188 that have all 30 questions completed <p> More than 300 social followers , with thousands of tweets- and Facebook posts mentioning @flipquizme <p> 20+ blog articles <p> 1 Ice Bucket Challenge video <p> 2 contests <p> 100- FlipQuizG- logo t-shirts <h> Social Reach <p> In addition to the fantastic numbers above , we 've also seen some great success on social media . Twitter is by far the most popular , with hundreds of people tweeting thousands of times about FlipQuizG ( @flipquizme ) . We 've seen photos and videos on Twitter and Instagram of folks in the classroom reviewing with their students . <p> Facebook , which is admittedly not our most regularly- updated channel , - has still seen its fair share of conversation , most recently causing some people to grab some Limited Edition FlipQuizG- T-shirts ( there are still some left if you 're interested ! ) . <p> YouTube , which we have n't engaged in at all ( yet ) , has seen multiple videos uploaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promoting demos at conferences . We 've even started a playlist of sorts to curate some of the best ones . ( If you have one you 've made , let us know so we can add it . ) <h> What 's to Come <p> With all the great things that have happened in the last year , how could we not talk about the future ? We 're just getting our walking legs under us . We have so many great things planned for you in the coming year ! While some new features will be for our PRO members , many will be for all our wonderful users . <p> We ca n't give too much away , but over the next year you 'll see improvements in speed , new options to customize your boards , better printable boards , methods for exporting your content , and some .. - well .. - secret features we just ca n't give away yet ! <p> Thank you , thank you , thank you to all of you that have made this a fantastic year for everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone has shown and the kind words that have been shared with me and other educators . <p> If you have ANYTHING that you would like to see implemented at FlipQuizG , PLEASE do n't hesitate to let us know using the support request form .

@@41481329 @1481329/ <h> About FlipQuiz <p> FlipQuizG has been a long time in the making . Over the course of almost a decade , FlipQuizG has existed as an idea , an index card adaptation , and a limited feature static page . <p> For ages , teachers have utilized the gameshow-style test review process to keep students engaged . I know my teachers did when I was in school . These review quizzes are often crafted from a pack of index cards , magnets , a chalkboard , and some markers . The setup process includes attaching index cards with number values to the board with magnets and this happens over and over again for each class period . Questions are rarely on these cards , rather on a separate sheet of paper that the teacher must also keep organized . <p> The whole process is tedious and , well , primitive . <h> My First Attempt <p> In 2008 , I created a digital version of the tedious process using HTML , CSS , and some limited jQuery - code named " JQ-pardy " . I created a board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by refreshing the page ) and contained a grid of number values . When each rectangle was pressed , the number would fade out leaving a solid shape denoting that the box for this value had been chosen already .

It solved the problem of quick resets and kept students mildly more engaged , but it was lacking in many ways for long-term reuse and true classroom integration . <h> Giving It Another Go <p> I left it as is for far too long and , in February 2014 , I decided to revisit this concept .

@@41481411 @1481411/ <h> News , Features , and Other Goodies <p> For the last year , visitors have been given the option to upgrade to a PRO membership . Along with team scoring , image uploads , flashcards , and more , one of the perks of being a PRO member is the ability to mark your boards as private . This mean that your boards would no longer show up in listings at the site or at search engines . <p> At its inception , FlipQuiz- was meant to be a tool for one very motivated ( not to mention , beautiful ) teacher to make her classroom test reviews more fun and engaging . Students win , teacher wins . Unfortunately , that was " teacher " - singular , not plural . So we changed that by opening- FlipQuiz- up to all who want- to make the classroom just a little bit more fun . <p> See how we uphold that same spirit of giving by donating to charitable organizations each month ... <p> Over the last few weeks , we 've run two polls - one building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this platform , we want to find ways to make it easier to create boards and use them in ways that make the most sense to you , the members of this community . <p> As we watch the social channels and check out FlipQuiz quick start videos that are created by you all , we 've noticed that the most time consuming part of the process is entering 30 questions and answers for each board . Hopefully we 've helped that process along for PRO members by allowing the copying of user boards , but there are still many instances where it would be nice to be able to import from a third-party source . <p> Although it 's important to take care of our planet every day , Earth Day holds a special place in our hearts . No matter who you are : male or female , younger or older , or any religion , we can all agree that our earth is important and we should actively protect it . <p> That is why we are giving 100% of our new PRO monthly signup money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . <p> Although Jeopardy.Rocks has only been around for a little over six months , it is likely that many educators have heard of - or even tried - the similar quiz board site . The concept is very much the same , but no real accounts are created and boards are saved as orphaned entities , waiting to be played or edited . <p> That 's why we created an importer for Jeopardy.Rocks game boards ! We believe that you should be able to keep your boards together in an account , where you can see them all in one place , easily edit them without having separate passwords , and add more than just a line of text for questions and answers . <p> Last week , we started our series of Quick Question polls to find out some information about our site visitors in a **44;3338;TOOLONG way . <p> Our first question was regarding the availability of a tablet ( or similar ) set of devices in the classroom . Almost 300 of you answered this quick question ( thank you ! ) and the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , our navigation structure has remained largely the same. - Unfortunately , some of the links shown when logged in were a bit confusing . What happens if I click on my name ? Where does the little cog/gear wheel take me ? What 's that icon on the end ? ( It was for logging out . ) It also provided some mobile device issues , since the menu would start to break out of its box at smaller screen sizes . <p> One of our most requested features is the ability to print boards . Not only is this convenient for creating a paper copy of- what you 've crafted , but it helps enable students without computers or ones with various disabilities to have access to the same content ! <p> Starting right now , you can print one of your board overview pages and get a pretty nice printout .
