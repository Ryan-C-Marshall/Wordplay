The 125+ members of our diverse , dynamic and highly educated faculty are also coaches , advisors and leaders . They serve as role models and findteachable moments everywhere : in the classroom , performance hall , art studio , gym , fields , and the community beyond our campus .

I was in the area for the summer staying with my sister , who worked in Landons Development office , and my plan was to have a fun summer playing with the kids and hanging out with my sister . That all happened ... but I also met my future husband , college counselor Andy Luther . After three summers as a counselor , I was an activities teacher for seven years and , along the way , I also became Mrs. Luther . ( Andy and I have been married 15 years , and he is now LSs director of aquatics . ) When the GDCs previous director , Jackie Wyncoll , moved to the Philippines , I became the camps director , and this summer is my 10th in that role . <p> The Girls Day Camp is n't just a summertime activity ; planning begins as early as November .

As a result , I love running into the campers outside of camp during the school year . On a recent trip to Target , I bumped into a family who has attended LS the past two years . Their children gave me hugs , showed me missing front teeth , and told me they would see me this summer that 's one of the things that keeps me coming back ! <p> Something else I love about camp is working with our staff . About three-quarters of our counselors were campers when they were younger . Many of them told me during their last summer as campers that I would be seeing their application when they turned 14 . Some of them have worked at the GDC for five or six years . Having a staff full of former campers is one of the many amazing parts of the GDC .

" People often ask me why I go back to the GDC every summer working six weeks leaves very little time left over before I start my school year in August . I tell them all the same thing : It would be difficult not to return because Landon Summer has given me so many amazing experiences , both personally and professionally , and the people are like family . <p> We had heard good things about Landon and that the Summer Day Camps were very sports- and activity-oriented , which we liked .

In addition to being extremely nice , they are very concerned about all the campers and create a wonderful experience for the kids and the parents . And Andy Katz and Meredith Luther , who run the Boys and Girls Day Camp , respectively , are such great people . <p> Dylan loved so much about Boys Day Camp : playing baseball , building paper planes , and taking part in " Bow and Arrow Day , " where they had a " Water Olympics " and tug-of-war .

There is just a nice , friendly atmosphere here , and we love having our kids in the programs . <p> As Landon Summer 2015 comes to a close , Middle School English teacher Jamie Sorge ( pictured far right ) tells us about the four camps he led that gave him the opportunity to share with kids his passion for community service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least food . <p> I grew up with camp and I love the idea of camp , whether its off-campus field trips or just running through sprinklers and playing capture the flag . So when I decided to do Landon Summer this year , I picked things I was passionate about so that I could share my interests with the kids . I thought : I 'm just going to do the things I love ... and who wants to come with me in a van ? I came up with " Community Service Week , " " Camping &amp; Survival Skills , " " City of Symbols : The Architecture and Evolution of Washington , D.C. " and " Restaurant Week , " which we did twice . <p> Although my camps are different , I feel that they are all somewhat related in that they have the same soul : They focus on learning about the environment , whether socioeconomic , historic or naturalistic , around us through firsthand experience . <p> For example , for Community Service camp , I had each kid pick an issue that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area to volunteer and interview the professionals who work for them . One girl was interested in homelessness and hunger , so we packed nonperishable food bags for the shelter Thrive D.C. and learned about how mental illness can lead to homelessness . I think it helped the kids to see the homeless as more human , more real . <p> The Camping &amp; Survival Skills camp explored some of the great outdoor environments in the D.C. area . We learned about the plants , animals , ecosystems and history of each place we visited . We went hiking and bouldering in Great Falls , Virginia , and then went over to the Maryland side of the river to hike the Billy Goat Trail . We also hiked Sugarloaf Mountain near Frederick , Maryland , learned about fire building at a camp in Rockville , went crabbing and clamming ( although we did n't  catch anything ) at Sandy Point Beach , and visited Anacostias Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens , where we saw snakehead fish , great blue herons , egrets and the most enormous lotus gardens . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program I did for Landons Mini-Mester in March . Its about the neighborhoods and the buildings in D.C. and how they have changed over time . It is really an anthropological and cultural study of the history and culture related to that building or neighborhood . We visited Union Station , the Washington Monument , Mount Vernon , Old Town Alexandria , the National Building Museum , the U Street corridor and Georgetown , where we learned the history of the C&amp;O Canal which many were amazed to learn predates the city of Washington ! <p> The aim of Restaurant Week was n't just to eat delicious food ( although we did that ) ; it was to get the kids out into different neighborhoods in the D.C. area to try a certain style of food each day ... and to learn in the process . One day , the theme was Thai food , so we went to H Mart on Georgia Avenue in Wheaton and toured the whole store to make it a cultural experience . We talked about cultural sensitivity and learned how people eat all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helped to season ( and sample ) the brisket at BCS Barbecue in Bethesda . The most culturally immersive experience of Restaurant Week and one of my favorite memories from this summer was making homemade El Salvadorian churros from scratch with Mariza , the owner of El Sabor Latino Bakery in Wheaton . <p> The kids had fun and learned a lot which , when it comes down to it , is what I think camp is all about .

@@47617885 @1117885/ <p> The Family Contribution ( FC ) is the amount that a family can pay toward education of all their children in tuition-charging schools . By Landon policy , this includes day care through the first four years of undergraduate-level college . <p> The FC is determined through a methodology developed by SSS . This methodology takes into consideration gross taxable and non-taxable income , assets , liabilities , family size and the number of children in tuition-charging institutions . After allowances for basic necessities and required taxes , a portion of remaining resources are considered available for education on a sliding scale . <p> The financial aid award offsets the cost of tuition . Financial aid does not cover books ( which students purchase separately online ) . The Financial Aid program does help with some of the other costs beyond tuition , however , such as some required field trips , instrumental music lessons , and Landon-sponsored bus transportation . These costs are reduced in proportion to the tuition covered by financial aid . <p> If you do not have a W-2 handy , you can figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using year-to-date information from your most recent paystub . This can be done by following these steps : <p> 1 . Find gross regular earnings year-to-date from paycheck stub . <p> 2 . Subtract any pre-tax contributions . For example : <p> Flex Plan/125 contribution <p> 401(k) or 403(b) contribution <p> Other pre-tax income deductions <p> 3 . That figure should be close to what would appear in Box 1 of the W-2 , so please include that on the Parent Financial Statement . <p> Landon recognizes that families have the freedom and the responsibility to make choices regarding their financial status . If only one parent works outside of the home , the Financial Aid Committee , by Landon policy , will add to the income of the family . An exception to this policy might occur if the parent at home is caring for a preschool-aged child , a child with a disability , a seriously i 'll child , parent or grandparent , or if there are other special circumstances . Please make these possible exceptions known to the Financial Aid Committee in writing when applying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item 32 . <p> The Financial Aid Committee expects that all parents will contribute financially to their son 's tuition . All parents are required to submit a completed PFS form to SSS as well as all of the required documentation in order for the school to gain a realistic picture of family resources . If the non-custodial parent refuses to comply , the Financial Aid Committee will determine whether or not the family will be eligible for an award . If the custodial parent has not had contact with the non-custodial parent for a period of time to be determined by the Financial Aid Committee , the PFS adn other forms from that non-custodial parent may not be required . However , a letter of verification from a third party ( minister , attorney , social worker , etc. ) will be required . Each situation is unique and will be handled on an individual basis . <p> The Financial Aid Committee would expect that the parent enrolled in graduate school will continue to earn income and has arranged to fund his or her education without depending heavily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time , and is thus unemployed , the Financial Aid Committee will add to the income of the family . <p> Assuming that your family 's financial status does not change dramatically , funding will generally be renewed at previous levels of funding . As tuition increases , however , the family will share the burden of that tuition increase , dependent upon the level of the previous year 's grant and the computed need for the following year . <p> Children who are living with guardians will be reviewed on an individual basis . However , if the parents are still living and are claiming their son on their tax return , the parents and guardians must complete the PFS and submit it to SSS . If other family members have custody , they must also complete the PFS . The Financial Aid Committee may also require copies of proof of custody . <p> Yes .

Renewal is contingent upon the student remaining in good ethical , social and academic standing at the school . LEARN MORE <h> 10 Helpful Hints from Financial Aid Director Russ Gagarin <p> 1 . Please note deadlines so that grants are not delayed or forfeited . <p> 2 . You only have to complete one Parent Financial Statement ( PFS ) , even if you have several children applying for aid at Landon and/or other schools that uses School &amp; Student Services by the National Association of Independent Schools ( SSS by NAIS ) .

Keep track of your SSS by NAIS login and passwords , as you will use this information to see your PFS and in future years . <p> 9 .

Losing Will to an ACL injury in the MSJ game was a huge setback and would test the resiliency and mental and physical toughness of this team . <p> Two of the biggest wins of the year were against Brunswick ( Connecticut ) and Saint Ignatius ( California ) . The defense was sensational against Brunswick , Justin was once again outstanding , and senior Will Oliver chipped in two timely goals to hand Brunswick their only loss of the season . Evan 's Sportscenter-worthy goal and a Drew-to-Jace goal in transition were momentum changers . After losing to Saint Ignatius in 2015 , we waited nearly two years to get revenge .

He played with confidence and finished . His scoring barrage continued through May and into the IAC playoffs . Four goals against the Saints , seven goals against Bullis in two games , four against Saint Ignatius , and five against St. Albans ( STA ) . He thrived playing with a pair of All-Americans in Nate and Joey .
