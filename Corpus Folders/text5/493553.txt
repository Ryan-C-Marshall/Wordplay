If you choose to purchase a t-shirt printing machine , there are a few different methods that can be used which will then determine the type of printer that you will need to buy . <p> There are pros and cons to each printing technique and before making a large purchase such as a printer , you should be well informed of them . There are 3 ways to print a t-shirt . You can either use a heat transfer , digital printing , or screen printing and each type require a different process as well as machine . <p> Image from Digital Printing Dubai <p> Although digital printing can be very costly , it is widely used for t-shirt printing . Digital printing is also referred to as " direct to garment . " In order to use this method an inkjet printer is required . The special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment . The only piece of equipment required for digitally printing is the actual printer . This is not the best route to go for bulk printing ; however , individual orders of custom t-shirt designs are very effective . There is are some high costs associated with the maintenance as well as the actual price of the machine . Certain elements of the printer have to be maintained and cleaned on a regular basis . If it is not kept up regularly , this resorts to some defects printed on the t-shirts . Aside from printing defects , on other issue with digital printing is that most of the digital printers are limited to printing only on pure cotton or garments with a cotton blend . <p> Image from Best Buy Today <p> The next option for t-shirt printing is by heat transfer . Heat transfer t-shirt printing is when the image or design is printed to a special heat transfer page . Then that page is used to transfer the image onto the garment by applying heat and pressure . To use this technique , you must purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a heat press . It is unfortunate that the designs or images printed on the t-shirt or garment do not typically last as long as digital printing . The advantages of heat transfers are that they are more affordable and faster .

It is a cost effective technique for printing and is great for mass production . When screen printing , you should print starting with the light inks and ending with the darker inks . One of the largest disadvantages of screen printing is that it is not an easy process to perform without prior knowledge of the printing machine and methods to use . <p> Other than these 3 ways to print a t-shirt or garment , there are more various printing techniques . Dye sublimation and vinyl heat transfer are just 2 of the additional forms of printing that can be used for t-shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Die sublimation as well as the heat transfer process both utilize a heat press in order to transfer images to the t-shirt . However , dye sublimation uses a gaseous process that is triggered by heat transfer . Vinyl heat transfer printing is excellent for printing vector signs or basic symbols . This transfer is easy to execute for smaller scale printing with many individual orders . In order to use a vinyl heat transfer for printing , all you need is a vinyl cutter that shapes large images into segments from a special vinyl film which is then transferred by heat to attach the cutout onto the t-shirt . <p> It is extremely important to determine which method best fits your business and to implement it prior to the start of your t-shirt printing business .

@@47729557 @1229557/ <h> Restaurant Mobile Apps <p> Restaurant apps have taken over the food service industry and this is due to all of the competition as well as low profit margins on the food itself . I set out to give an upfront and honest review of the 3 biggest names in restaurant mobile apps . Then , I decided to examine and investigate their role on the food service industry . <p> 1 . Eat 24 Hours Eat 24 Hours was on the forefront of online food courts . Their site and app is very high quality . You can even select what device you are using in order to access the most optimal version . You can also access the Yelp reviews to a restaurant that you are unsure of trying . <p> 2 . Seamless Seamless arrived a little after some of the other online food courts ; however , it is still a very successful site . Seamless does not offer its app for quite as many devices as Eat 24 Hours , but it does offer a $7.00 discount for first time users . Seamless does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there are still a few main images for each restaurant . One feature that Seamless does have that Eat 24 Hours does not is a rank by price from least to greatest when you enter your location to pull up all the restaurants in your area . Eat 24 Hours has this feature , but it does not automatically do this for you . Seamless allows you to quickly find low to moderate priced meals . Seamless also only takes credit card through their secured servers which can also be a hassle , but the site does have an option that I really enjoyed called " eco-friendly ordering " where you can opt out of plastic utensils or napkins . <p> 3 . GrubHub GrubHub is a great app for the consumer because of all the discounts and rewards that the company has in place for retention . Similar to Eat 24 Hours , GrubHub connects to Yelp so that their customers can see the restaurants reviews . However , there is a down side to using GrubHub . There are no images of the food that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . The one feature that I really enjoyed on GrubHub was the coupon button on the right side of the screen where the restaurant can list special discounts for using the site or app . <p> In 2014 , it is hard to compete with the ease of online ordering from food court type sites such as GrubHub , Seamless , &amp; Eat 24 Hours if you are a smaller restaurant . These sites take large percentages ranging from 15-30% of orders and even if it is a return customer , they take the same percentage of profit every time . If a restaurant is selling $4.00 sandwiches , this can add up pretty quickly . Also , as a restaurant owner in order to stand tall against your competitors , - it is absolutely necessary to have some type of website with online ordering capabilities . <p> It is important to keep up and stay relevant if you are a restaurant owner and iScripts has a solution to competing with online food courts . Our software is a solution to a struggling restaurants inability to compete with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile app that can be used not only to set up online food courts , but can also be used for individual restaurants to set up their own online ordering web page or branded online restaurant order app . The restaurant can customize everything with their logo and set up a full menu with descriptions to each dish along with images . <p> Restaurant Mobile Apps was last modified : September 30th , 2014 by Aji Abraham

In this model , there is a client , the outsourced company and the employees " a dedicated testing team . The outsourced company acts as the middle man , finding employees that will be able to complete the project assigned by the client and meet their requirements fully .

We have seen media related websites surging to have their application trend on Play Store &amp; Apple App Stores . According to few smart Insights we have known that around 90% mobile users prefer using apps to access media instead of going to a website , highlighting the importance of mobile application in today 's time . <p> As we can already find that there is a growing number of mobile users and businesses offering their own application .

@@47729676 @1229676/ <h> iScripts is developing a new PHP framework <p> When you develop an application in PHP you have the option of developing it Core PHP or a PHP framework . Core PHP is the language in its framework . It gives you maximum control , but you have to create everything from scratch . PHP frameworks on the other hand , make application development faster by providing a basic structure for which to build the web applications . These PHP frameworks help to rapid application development , which saves developers time by providing building blocks , and roadmaps to follow . Frameworks can also help developers to build more stable web applications as most of the bugs in the structure would be addressed already . The basic idea behind a PHP framework is called MVC ( Model View Controller ) . MVC isolates the business logic from database layer and presentation layer . This is similar to tier architecture in other technologies like . net . <p> Historically , iScripts applications are developed in core PHP . Even though we use similar components , the development time for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application is when a third party designer tries to modify an application . Without basic understanding of PHP , it was difficult to make modification . In early 2010 , we completely separated designs and code in most of the application . This helped third party design integrations to an extent . Anything you did in the design area was limited to the design area only . Design changes would n't mess up the functionality or security of the application . We started this with iScripts Multicart , iScripts Socialware and then implemented it for other applications . <p> In early 2010 , we started using frameworks . We decided to use CakePHP as the framework of choice after a long and exhaustive study . We designed a couple of products using CakePHP . Both iScripts VistaCart and iScripts Gostores uses CakePHP framework . However , in the months after the release , it was apparent that there were many short falls to the frameworks . Another issue was that we had to train our growing development team in the CakePHP framework . <p> For the last few months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our goal is to port all the new applications and existing applications to the new iScripts framework . We hope this will make customization and improvements easier in terms of using the framework . Like most of our new applications , this framework will support multiple languages natively . As of now , we have 2 new products being developed in the new framework . We have a separate application also being developed in the framework . We expect to port the first existing iScripts product for a new version starting January 2011 . <p> Current plan is to release iScripts framework to market April 2011 .

The last thing you want to do is panic when any sort of emergency happens , let alone something like a website error ; these things happen . If it can be said that a website hiccup is equal to the website being confused , the last thing you need is to be panicked and confused , yourself ! <p> Record the error . Taking to your web designer or webmaster about website hiccups is very close to speaking to your doctor about being sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt ? Since you are not your website , you may have to do a little research and record exactly what is wrong with your site before repairs can begin . Visit your site just like anyone would do when they arrived from Google and see what they would be seeing . Save any emails from users mentioning the hiccup and refer back to them . The more information you can collect , the easier it will be for the programmers to find the error and repair . <p> Configuration changes : Did you make any changes you your site recently ? Was anything added to your software ? Changes large and small are equally important so be sure to document them all . <p> Hosting changes : If you did not make any changes , large or small , to your site it is often likely that your hosting company has made some small changes to their settings .

This means that he can focus on getting your site up and running ASAP and you back in business . <p> Check daily for updates . If your web designer is any good , you are probably not his only customer . He likely has many other things on his plate as well as attending to your hiccups . While your situation should certainly be a priority to him , it does not stop the phone from ringing with other customers and their needs . He is only human and can get distracted . Feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily to see if he needs any additional information .

@@47729691 @1229691/ <h> What do Amazon.com and handcrafters have in common ? <p> We created iScripts MultiCart almost 18 months back after 6 months in development . Initially the idea started out as a website for handcraft products . There are a lot of people who makes these cute little things with clay , clothes- and anything you can imagine . Most of them do this as a hobby or side business. - They are good in crafts. - Well most are. - They never strike me as good marketing folks . So the idea of them managing their own ecommerce store selling these crafts did not make much sense . As a one man/woman show they can either spend time on creating new- beautiful crafts items or doing web marketing . It is a crime to ask them to do the marketing by themselves . if they hire they need fork over most of the money from the sales to the so called experts ( including us ) for any meaningful results. - It did not make much sense . So we thought would n't it be wonderful if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do is list the products and ship out to the buyers . We would in turn take care of the marketing , technical aspects , payment processing , tech support for the handcrafters. in turn we would charge them a small fee based on the cost . as its a narrow vertical , we can market things well . <p> After talking to bunch of handcrafters in the summer fairs we created handcraftweb.com . Initially it was working out very well . but it turned out , we are very good in creating web software . Not very good promoting a website . It meant going to all those craft fairs and selling this idea to hard crafters . Then visiting bunch of forums and magazines for crafters and advertising . It sounded too much work , in an area where we have not much interest or experience . So the site kind of slowed down . <p> then we got a call from somebody looking for a multi-vendor site for baseball cards . He asked if we willing to sell the software and customize it for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their business was doing pretty good. - Then we realized this is a good software for small industry niches , where it does not make sense for individual players to create their own stores . So this offers entrepreneurs an opportunity for creating a one stop shop for that niche . The niche could be handcrafts or baseball cards. - Finally we decided to make the software more customizable and make it an official iScripts product . so we created iScriptsMulticart as a multi-vendor shopping cart . <p> I looked around and did not see many products competing with it directly . So I was happy we came up with something very unique and new. - Explaining this to customers who calls to find out exactly what this software can do for them . Most of them had some business model in mind and wanted to find out if this can meet their need off the shelf or can we customize to make it to meet their model . I used to explain it as a multi vendor system with a single store front . Then folks where confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc .. - So to make things clearer we used to explain it as a virtual mall software . So as a mall , you would have a number of vendors selling their own things . But it would be under the umbrella of single entity(mall). - Most of the potential customers called during the time was looking for a business model where individual shops need to manage their payment processing as well as fulfillment . So I was looking for better ways to explain what exactly iScripts MultiCart do ? <p> Last week when I was explaining- the software- to a potential customer for this script , she asked- if it works like the new Amazon.com . Well it is .. It was an interesting realization that Jeff Bezos settled on the same- business model for Amazon , as we did for handcrafters. - The only business model which made any money for Amazon after all these years . If you notice lately(2006-07) Amazon is not just selling products under their brand . They push customers to other vendors , even competitors , who does the fulfillment. - Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers and then push to other vendors for almost everything under the sun .
