@@59583388 @8583388/ <h> Hardness , Alkalinity and Carbon Dioxide - Tech Talk 76 <p> What is hardness and why is it important ? You know you have hard water when soap does not lather well . Hard water causes scale deposits after it evaporates , and it forms clogging deposits in pipes and air diffusers . In aquatic systems , adequate hardness is important and depends mostly on the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions . Hardness is particularly important to newly hatched fish that obtain much of their calcium directly from the water . Generally , freshwater fish do best when hardness is maintained near 100 mg/liter @ CaCO3 ( calcium carbonate ) . <p> To increase hardness , use calcium chloride ( CaCl2 ) . <p> Why is alkalinity important ? Alkalinity is the buffering capacity of water . That is , its ability to maintain a pH of 7.0 or above . In aquaculture , alkalinity is most often influenced by the bicarbonate ion ( the negative ion in sodium bicarbonate , NaHCO3 ) . When kept above 100 mg/liter @ CaCO3 , alkalinity will usually be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CO2 ) in the water ( see graph ) . Alkalinity should not fall below 80 mg/liter @ CaCO3 , as it is the source of carbon for nitrifying bacteria and is consumed during nitrification . To increase alkalinity , add sodium bicarbonate . <p> To decrease alkalinity , add acid . <p> How are hardness and alkalinity related ? Hardness and alkalinity are both expressed as mg/liter @ CaCO3 . In tap water , when the concentration of hardness and alkalinity are the same , both are probably due to dissolved calcium carbonate . Calcium carbonate does not dissolve well above pH 7.0 , so other chemicals like calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate can be used to adjust hardness and alkalinity independently . If alkalinity and hardness are too high , calcium carbonate will precipitate on air diffusers , heaters and other submerged equipment . <p> How is alkalinity affected by carbon dioxide ? Carbon dioxide may build up in water as a result of respiration by fish and bacteria . In poorly buffered water , this can cause a drop in pH below 7.0 that can inhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , raise the pH . Adequate alkalinity will ensure stable pH and provide carbon for nitrifying bacteria . Carbon dioxide level can be estimated , using the graph on this page , if the pH and alkalinity are known . 
@@59583389 @8583389/ <h> How Our Products Can Help <p> Carbon dioxide causes problems in recirculating aquaculture systems without aeration or degassing . Carbon dioxide must be removed , or it can build up to levels that are dangerous to the fish and to humans if the fish are raised in a closed building . <p> Gases in water naturally reach their equilibrium when the water is exposed to air , but Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems has solutions to help this process when gas balancing that occurs naturally is not producing optimal levels . <p> For indoor operations , air ventilators are sometimes used , but they can also remove a lot of heat along with the carbon dioxide . We suggest that carbon dioxide be stripped with a degassing column that is ventilated to the outdoors . Outdoor air can be drawn directly into the bottom of the degassing tower , forced up through the water and then directed back outdoors . In cold weather , there will be a significant cooling effect on the water because it is being degassed through cold , dry air . A simple air-to-air heat exchanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CO2 <p> The objective of gas balancing is to have the concentrations of all dissolved gases approach a state of equilibrium with the gases in the atmosphere . Most important to raising healthy fish are the levels of oxygen ( O2 ) , nitrogen ( N2 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . The balancing process naturally occurs whenever water comes into contact with atmospheric gases but may be achieved more quickly and efficiently with gas-transfer equipment . A common function of most gas-transfer equipment is to break a flow of water into droplets or thin films . This greatly increases the exposed surface area of water and accelerates the transfer of gas molecules into and out of the water . Alternately , small bubbles are passed through the water to introduce gas into the water . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> PR Aqua OxyTowerG <p> The PR Aqua OxyTower series of gas treatment systems deliver maximum value , performance and security .

It will also cause the water to become acidic , especially if alkalinity is limited . Therefore , removal of excess CO2 is absolutely critical , especially in recirculating aquaculture systems .

If you only have 208V power and ca n't find a motor that is rated for it , you can install a " buck-boost transformer " to raise your voltage . <p> Mostbut not allAC motors are built to tolerate a 10% up or down voltage variation from what is shown on the motor nameplate . A motor labeled as 115V can operate reliably between 108 and 132V . The range for 208V motor is 187 to 229V . The range for 230V is 207 to 253V . After reading these ranges you might think , " A 230V motor can work at 208V . " That would be true if your service always gave a minimum of 208V . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , if your service is 208V , you will experience normal voltage variations as low as 187 . This is why some 230V motors operate on 208V service for a while , then , when other equipment starts up , the voltage drops below 207 and the motor draws more amps , overheats and fails . <p> Buck-boost transformers reduce ( buck ) or raise ( boost ) supply voltage to the required level . A common application is boosting 208V to 230V . <p> If your motor is a long distance from your power meter you will also incur " line losses . " These will show as lower voltage and higher amperage at the motor . To be sure your installation is correct , always measure the volts and amps at the motor location , while it and everything else on that line is operating . Both must be within the motor label 's specifications . See Tech Talks 5 , 10 and 11 for more information .

@@59583420 @8583420/ <h> Mechanical Filtration and Biofiltration - Tech Talk 65 <p> In the world of aquaculture , mechanical filtration and biofiltration are very distinct and separate entities , and they must be treated as such . Filtration is the removal of solid waste , whereas biofiltration is the biological process that converts toxic nitrogenous wastes to non-toxic nitrate . <p> Solid waste is typically categorized by its size and specific gravity . Settleable solids are those solids which have a relatively high specific gravity compared to the water in which they exist . They will settle to the bottom . Suspended solids are those in a category that have a specific gravity the same as , or slightly higher than , the water . They tend to stay in suspension and will only " drop-out " over a long period of time . Dissolved solids are those which actually become a part of the water . The dissolved solids are eliminated by reverse osmosis , anion and cation resins , activated carbon , etc . <p> One method of removing solid waste from a round fish tank is to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a separate area from the main flow . The settled solids can be directed into a small clarifier , much smaller than one sized to handle the entire flow of recirculating water . The other drain takes the suspended solids along with the nitrogenous waste . <p> Suspended solids can be removed by several methods . One is the bead filter , which incorporates the use of small polyethylene beads that have a positive electrostatic charge . These beads have an affinity for the negatively charged suspended solids . As the particles pass these beads , they are " statically " drawn to them . When the beads are loaded with solids , it is time to backwash them . <p> Suspended solids can also be removed by mechanical means such as bag filters , drum filters and vegetative filters . <p> Biofiltration is the aerobic ( with oxygen ) breakdown of dissolved nitrogenous fish waste . The process is accomplished by two or more strains of autotrophic bacteria . These bacteria are naturally occurring and will ultimately colonize the bio-media in the biofilter as well as the tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on temperature , pH , salinity , surface area , flow rate , etc . <p> The autotrophic bacteria use oxygen in a two-step process to first convert the toxic ammonia ( NH3 or NH4+ ) to nitrite ( NO2- ) . Another strain of bacteria converts nitrite ( NO2- ) to nitrate ( NO3- ) . Nitrate is much less toxic and typically tolerated by most cultured species until it reaches very high levels . Controlling nitrate is accomplished by diluting with clean water or by using a denitrification chamber that converts nitrate into nitrogen gas ( this is an anaerobic process that uses a group of heterotrophic bacteria ) . A third method to keep nitrate levels in check is the use of plants . You can have a green water system ( using algae ) , a vegetative filter or even use a hydroponic plant system to remove nitrate . <p> Regardless of which type of filtering equipment you decide to use , the one thing to keep in mind is to stage the filtration .

@@59583431 @8583431/ <h> Flow Rate Estimation For RAS <p> Summary:The water quality in recirculating aquaculture systems is generally a function of the tank size , biomass , feed inputs and waste treatment efficiency . Adequate biofiltration can control the build-up of ammonia-nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen in the systems . Mass balance can be used to estimate the water flow required to go from the culture tank or tanks to the biofilter to maintain the desired total ammonia-nitrogen concentration . Carefully specifying the required maximum TAN concentration can be instrumental in reducing energy use for pumping water . <p> Even if a facility has a properly sized or even oversized biofilter , as in this large moving-bed biofilter with ultraviolet treatment , yet the flow between the biofilter and culture tank is too slow , the biofilter capacity will never be fully utilized , and ammonia nitrogen can build up in the culture system . Photo courtesy of Mote Marine Lab . <p> The production of aquacultured species in land-based systems using tanks and recirculating aquaculture system ( RAS ) technology is expanding globally . This trend is driven by the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement to reduce the volume and strength of system effluent . One important element of the unit processes involved in RAS technology is estimating the flow rate requirements for the water recirculated from the culture tanks to the biofilter . Using mass balance analysis , an estimate of the flow requirements can be made in order to control the build-up of ammonia-nitrogen and nitrite-nitrogen in the system . <p> Operating Parameters <p> The water quality in a recirculating system is generally a function of the tank size , the biomass in the tank , the rate of feed input , and the waste removal and treatment efficiency of the system . The first operating parameters that need to be determined are the tank volume and maximum allowable stocking density . Stocking density is determined by the species being cultured and its life stage . As an example , assume fish are in the growout stage of life and will reach market size at an average 680-g weight in a 50-m3 culture tank . For the species in question , the maximum culture density is assumed to be 80 kg fish/m3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this tank would be 80 kg/m3 x 50 m3 = 4,000 kg or 4 mt . Assume the daily feed rate at this maximum density is 1.5% of the fish body weight . In this example , the maximum daily feed rate will come near the end of the production cycle and peak at 4,000 kg fish x 1.5% of biomass/day = 60 kg feed . Assume for this example that the protein content of the feed is 40% . Ammonia-Nitrogen Production , Conversion Ammonia-nitrogen is excreted from the gills of fish as they assimilate feed and is also produced when bacteria decompose organic waste solids within the tanks and other components of the RAS . The amount of ammonia produced in an RAS is directly related to the rate of feed additions to the system , the protein content of the feed and an estimate of the nitrogen being wasted , which is related to the culture species and system design . In general , estimate that 50% of the nitrogen added to the system via feed is not utilized by the fish and is a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein is nitrogen and there are 1.2 g TAN/g nitrogen , the production of TAN in the example production system can be estimated as : TAN produced ( kg/day ) = 60 kg Feed/day x 40% Protein x 50% Nitrogen wasted x 0.16 g Nitrogen/g Protein x 1.2 g TAN/g Nitrogen TAN produced = 2.3 kg TAN/day <p> This formula estimates that roughly 4% of the feed becomes TAN within the RAS . In general , with feed protein content varying from 30 to 55% , this equation estimates TAN production rates as 3 to 5% of the weight of the feed , a reasonable estimate that is often cited . The next step is to estimate the amount of TAN lost from the system in effluent . First estimate the volume of daily effluent from the system in liters and the TAN concentration desired in the culture tank . In this example , assume the TAN in the effluent is the same as in the tank , which is not always the case . The amount of TAN lost in the effluent can be estimated as : TAN discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mg/L ) x Effluent volume ( L/day ) / 1,000 ( mg/g ) <p> For this example , assume the desired TAN concentration is 1.5 mg/L , and the amount of effluent is 10% of the system volume per day or 5,000 L. This calculating is not really necessary in a typical RAS due to the minimal discharge volumes and low TAN concentration . Only 7.5 g of TAN would be discharged in the effluent in this example . However , there is a secondary ongoing process in the RAS called passive nitrification . This is due to the nitrifying bacteria within the system growing on all of the surfaces of the system . These bacteria , like their " cousins " on the biofilter surfaces , can convert at much as 30% of the TAN to non-toxic nitrate-nitrogen . In this example , assume 20% passive nitrification . As such , the biofilter would need to nitrify 80% of the TAN produced within the system or 1.84 kg of TAN . <p> Estimating Biofilter Flow Rate <p> Mass balance can be used to estimate the flow required to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the desired TAN concentration . The efficiency of a biofilter depends on the TAN concentration of the water entering the biofilter , biofilter type and flow rate through the biofilter . <p> For most biofilters used today , approximately 50% of the TAN is removed per pass through the biofilter . Using this estimate and the numbers above yields an estimate of the daily flow required to go to the biofilter as : Recycle flow to biofilter ( L/day ) = TAN available to biofilter ( kg/day ) /Biofilter efficiency ( % ) x Desired tank TAN concentration ( mg/L ) /1,000,000 ( mg/kg ) In the example , the TAN available to the biofilter after accounting for passive nitrification is 1.84 kg/day . The desired tank TAN concentration is 1.5 mg/L , and the biofilter removal efficiency is estimated at 50% . <p> Using the numbers given for this example in the equation , the flow rate from the tank or tanks to the biofilter can be estimated at 2,453,333 L or 2,453 m3/day , which is 102,000 L or 102 m3 hourly . Note that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tank will need to flow through the biofilter more than twice every hour . It is instructive to note that if the concentration in the tank is allowed to be higher , say up to 3 mg/L , the flow rate to the filter would be cut in half to roughly one hourly exchange . Hence , the lower the required TAN concentration , the higher the required biofilter flow . <p> Therefore , carefully specifying the required maximum TAN concentration in the tank can be instrumental in reducing the energy use in pumping water to the biofilter and back to the tank . Coldwater RAS for salmonids commonly operate with tank turnover rates of 30 minutes or less , while warmwater RAS often operate with 60-minute turnover rates . The difference can be attributed to the lower TAN concentration required to grow coldwater species . <p> Editors Note : This article was based in part on research conducted by the author and Alexander Hobbs at North Carolina State University and published in the Volume 23 , 2000 journal of Aquacultural Engineering .

These products contain reducing agents that cause the oxidation/reduction potential ( ORP ) to drop significantly .

@@59583449 @8583449/ <h> Water Pump Efficiency and Redundancy - Tech Talk 75 <p> We know what you 're thinking ... here they go again , talking about efficiency . Yes , and we 'll keep doing it . The problem is that , in the US , electricity is so cheap , we all but ignore it . Then , when we get the power bill , we complain about how high it is ! <p> Sound familiar ? <p> Here is a note on energy efficiency from our 1981 Aeration Handbook andCatalog : " ... one kilowatt-hour is equivalent to about two days of hard work by one man . " A man 's labor for 5 per daythat 's cheap ! <p> As efficiency relates to aquaculture , pumping and aeration are the two biggest consumers of electricity . After feed costs and labor , electricity is probably the next highest overhead expense . Be careful when selecting a pump . Do not compare them by horsepower alone . Often , a cheap pump has an undersized motor that must work very hard to do the job . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications , but not where the lives of your animals are concerned . Often , pool type pumps , when used for low-pressure aquaculture applications , keep the motor in a continuous overload condition . <p> Operating an undersized motor in the duty range of its service factor is acceptable from the pump manufacturer 's point of view , but not a fish farmer 's point of view . It lowers the pump 's cost ( which looks good when you are comparing pumps ) , but increases energy consumption and operating temperature . Higher operating temperature shortens motor life . <p> We 've painstakingly selected and tested all of our pumps for power consumption . We 've illustrated ratings , specifications and power consumption clearly . We use the term " aquaculture duty , " to indicate long-term reliability and efficiency in humid , industrial applications . <p> Multiple water pumps provide redundancy . <p> Bigger may not be better when it comes to pumping water . For example , to pump 300 gallons per minute ( gpm ) to a height of 20 ' , you could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100-gpm pumps , four 75-gpm pumps , five 60-gpm pumps , etc . To determine which is best for your application , consider the following options . <p> Large pumps may only be available with 3-phase motors . If 3-phase power is not available , an expensive , power-robbing phase converter must be used , or multiple single-phase pumps . Even if one large pump can be used , another one must be available as a back up , if the pumping need is critical . <p> Consider multiple pumps . If one pump moves 100 gpm , two of the same pumps together will move 200 gpm , three will move 300 gpm , and so on . If less than 300 gpm is ever needed , multiple smaller pumps will save electricity , as they can be individually turned on or off as needed ( installing a check valve on each pump will prevent water from flowing back when that pump is not in use ) . Also , multiple pumps may be preferred , as then only a portion of the total water flow would be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pump on hand for backup is much less than a large one . For a " ready-to-go " backup , extra pumps could be plumbed into the main line ( put the pumps on separate circuit breakers ) so that the reserve pump is ready when needed . Alternate the use of the pumps to keep them exercised . <p> Simplify the backup and spare parts inventory at your facility by using multiples of the same pump instead of several single-purpose pumps . Similar multiple redundancy can be used with air blowers , heaters , chillers , filters , etc.

@@59583464 @8583464/ <p> Within the industry , a surface aerator is a device that takes water from the vicinity of the surface and throws it into the air , where it picks up atmospheric oxygen . Submerged aeration typically uses air bubbles that are released below the surface and give up the oxygen they contain as they rise . Another method is the Synergistic Technique . It destratifies and puts oxygen on the bottom where it will improve the overall water quality of the lake . Surface aeration is excellent in an emergency . It can quickly put a lot of oxygen in a small area where the fish can come to survive . Never use submerged aeration systems in an emergency , as the oxygen put in is diluted throughout the water column and the higher oxygen levels normally found on the surface are made lower by upward pulsing bottom water . <p> 2 . Will aeration control algae and weed problems ? <p> Algae obtain their nutrients from the water , while submerged weeds typically obtain nutrients from root systems in the soil of the lake bottom . Aeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can have a profound effect on the algae , depending upon many circumstances . In the right situation , a well-designed aeration system will greatly reduce algae primarily by reducing nutrient cycling from the formerly anaerobic bottom . As the water clarity improves , the plant community may shift to submerged weeds . <p> 3 . How does aeration put oxygen into the water ? At what rate ? <p> Lake aeration devices , from surface aerators to synergistic airlifts , put oxygen into the water between the rates of 1-10 pounds of oxygen per horsepower per hour ( .6 - 6.0 kilograms per kilowatt ) . Fountains are at the low end of the oxygen transfer rate , as they expend much more energy putting on a show than they do transferring oxygen . Synergistic airlifts are at the other end of the spectrum because they expend very little energy and circulate huge quantities of water upward . In this case , the interaction at the surface of the lake adds to the majority of the oxygen added to the water . <p> 4 . Will aeration improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done correctly will it improve water quality and water clarity . All lakes are different and they often need an engineered approach . When a stratified lake is destratified , water quality is improved by reducing the nutrient cycling and increasing the assimilation capacity . In some lakes with very clear surface water , destratification can reduce water clarity . <p> 5 . How long will it take for aeration to improve a lake ? <p> In general , the time will vary between 2 and 12 months before visually significant improvements are reached . If the lake is a good candidate for aeration , and if the aeration system is designed correctly , it will definitely continue to improve the water clarity year after year , unless more nutrients re added . <p> 6 . Why is the synergistic diffuser manifold more efficient at deeper depths ? <p> It is not efficient at shallow depths because of the short distance between the low pressure and high-pressure areas of the water column . Since high pressure will flow to low pressure , the close proximity of the boil at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes a short circuit . In a deep lake , the distances between the high pressure and the low are too great for this effect to take place . <p> 7 . How loud is a Great Lakes System ? <p> All of our cabinets have been designed to provide significant sound attenuation and , in most cases , the noise level is below 55 dB at ten feet and inaudible 50 feet from the cabinet . <p> 8 . Does the aeration system have to run continuously ? <p> Yes . We design all of our systems to be small in size and to operate continuously , as opposed to a large system that operates intermittently . However , they can be shut down completely or intermittently during cold months . <p> 9 . Can the Great Lakes system be used during the winter ? <p> This depends upon how cold the area gets . If the water gets cold and the bottom D.O . remains above 5 ppm , the system can be turned off . When very cold , the rate of oxygen consumption is so low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aeration system . If the lake ices over briefly and does not have a history of winter fishkill , the system can be turned off . If the lake freezes hard and has a history of winter fishkill , a small portion of the summer aeration system can be operated during the cold months . Remember that an open hole will exist in the ice around a diffuser boil and can pose a danger to people and animals , especially at night . <p> 10 . What is the maintenance for the Great Lakes system ? <p> Depending upon conditions , typical maintenance consists of quarterly checking and cleaning of the air filter , replacement of carbon vanes in 9-12 month intervals and cleaning of the diffusers as necessary after about three years . Sometimes , after three years , either the entire compressor or its motor bearings should be replaced . AES provides factory-rebuilt units and ships the same day . <p> 11 . How much will it cost in electricity per month ? <p> One horsepower , running continuously at a rate of ten cents per kilowatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $36 . One-third horsepower will cost $24 . The cost may be less because of lower electric rate and actual power consumption . <p> 12 . Should bottom aeration or surface aeration be used in a lake where trout are raised ? <p> Trout generally require water colder than 68F ( 20C ) . If the surface temperature of the lake in the summer does not rise above this temperature , then bottom aeration will work fine . If the surface temperature goes above 68 in the summer and the cold bottom layer of the lake does not have sufficient oxygen at the end of the summer to support the trout , then neither type of aeration would be applicable . Either a hypolimnetic aeration system or a pure oxygen system adding to the bottom strata only would have to be used ( AES can design both pure oxygen systems and hypolimnetic systems ) . <p> 13 . How long does it take to install the system ? <p> The most difficult part of installing an aeration system is getting the electricity to the site . The good news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed near an existing electrical location and the air line(s) can be run from that point to the lake . HeavySet tubing can be used from the water 's edge to the diffusers . This tubing can be laid out just as fast as a garden hose can be uncoiled . Some care is required in lowering the diffuser manifold from the boat . Include time for trenching airlines into the ground and pouring a small concrete pad for the compressor cabinet ( if desired ) . <p> 14 . What is the difference between a 4- and a 6-diffuser manifold ? <p> The 4-diffuser manifold is designed for shallow applications where more manifolds are needed because of the shallow water short-circuiting ( see #6 ) . A 6-diffuser manifold lifts significantly more water in deep applications . Eight diffuser manifolds are available for very deep applications . <p> 15 . If a 6-diffuser manifold is required for depths of 8 ' or greater , how can a 4-diffuser manifold be used on a DA1AAD aeration system in water up to 20 ' deep ? The smaller aeration system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adequate because the pond is small . More horsepower would be needed to run a large diffuser , which would be oversized for the pond . <p> 16 . Will the diffuser manifolds stir up mud on the bottom of the pond ? They will not , if the underlay included on all the Great Lakes manifolds is used . Be sure that the underlay is installed flat on the bottom . The sediment that rises to the top at initial start-up is just the very loose sediment that was disturbed in the area where the diffuser was placed . <p> 17 . How many diffusers should be used ? <p> Fill out one of our Sizing Guides and e-mail or fax it to us . Call to talk with our Lake Department experts , who will provide a free recommendation . Call for a Pond/Lake Aeration and Water Quality Questionnaire or complete one on our website . <p> 18 . How far apart should the diffusers be placed ? <p> As a general rule , the diffusers should be an equal distance from each other and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this general rule . Mail or fax a sketch for help from our experts . <p> 19 . Can ozone be run through this system ? <p> Yes , when it is injected after the air compressor . However , we do not recommend its use in natural lakes . If you were to use the appropriate amount of ozone for the BOD and water volume , you would kill many organisms necessary to a natural lake . <p> 20 . If I live on a large lake , can I just aerate my backyard portion ? <p> In most cases , this would not have a beneficial effect on the lake in total . If a diffuser were placed above the thermocline , it would induce circulation and act as an artificial structure that would be a fish attracter . If the diffuser were below the thermocline , it would be lifting some of the coolest , heaviest , worst quality water and putting it on the surface in front of your property .

By increasing the pressure , the total amount of oxygen that can be dissolved is increased even further . This is the principal used in oxygen cones , oxygen saturators and pressure columns . <p> Cones and saturators suspend small oxygen bubbles in the flowing water , using the vessel geometry to prevent bubbles from carrying out of the vessel before the oxygen is absorbed . Pressure packed columns break the water flow into thin films as it passes through a vessel filled with an oxygen-rich gas . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> Point FourG Pressurized Column <p> Ideal for commercial recirculating aquaculture systems , our pressurized column is a high-performance gas injection system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as it cascades down through chambers in the column , the water absorbs oxygen entering from the side . Oxygenated water leaves through the bottom and is returned to your fish tanks . <h> What is Needed to Get Right Amount of Oxygen <p> At a given pressure , water can only hold a certain amount of gas . An oxygen-rich environment causes the saturation concentration of oxygen to increase while the saturation concentrations of all other gases ( such as nitrogen , argon and carbon dioxide ) decrease proportionally . As a result , as oxygen transfers into the water , these other gases transfer out . This is the principal used in an oxygenation concentration system . Within it , small streams of water rain through low-pressure chambers filled with oxygen rich gas . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> PCI Deployable Oxygen Concentration Systems <p> Our proprietary reversible blower Vacuum Swing Absorption technology uses half the power of equivalent systems along with a significant reduction in footprint . This is a turnkey integrated solution that eliminates the need to size and source air compressors , dryer systems and product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costs of Expensive Gases <p> Fine bubble diffusers can be used to deliver bubbles of oxygen directly to each culture tank . As the oxygen bubbles rise , they are absorbed . <p> Although efficiency increases with tank depth , diffuser efficiency is low relative to other oxygenation equipment because any oxygen in bubbles that reach the water surface is lost to the air . However , diffusers can be incorporated into an effective emergency back up oxygenation system as they do not rely on water flow to deliver the oxygen to the fish . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> Point FourG Micro Bubble Diffuser <p> Micro Bubble Diffusers use an ultra-fine-pore ceramic plate to produce a cloud of bubbles of approximately 100 to 500 microns . These diffusers are far superior to air stones , porous hose or membrane-type designs . The flat plate ensures uniform bubbles across the entire surface and achieves an absorption rate in excess of 80 percent , depending on depth and flow rate . <h> There is Only One Sure Way to Know Oxygen Level - Check It <p> Successful fish farmers measure dissolved oxygen levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test kits . Water temperature , altitude and salinity all can affect oxygen levels , so its important to select test equipment that can measure and compensate for these factors to provide you with reliable test results . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> Dissolved Oxygen Meter Kit <p> Our meter kit measures dissolved oxygen ( D.O. ) and its programming and functionality are easy to follow . The meter simultaneously displays D.O . ( in ppm or mg/L ) , temperature readings ( in C or F ) and the date , and automatically adjusts for salinity and altitude . <h> Clogging Problems ? Skip the Filters <p> Diffusers or so-called air stones can be an inexpensive solution to provide oxygen , but they can be expensive to maintain . Their large surfaces provide areas for algae and solid wastes to collect which can lead to clogging . Some diffusers are installed with filtering equipment and need to be cleaned regularly to maintain their functionality , especially when they are installed as an emergency or back-up source of oxygenation. 161473 @qwx571473 <h> Sweetwater Air Diffusers <p> Sweetwater diffusers are the highest-quality ceramic-type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid block of glass-bonded silica .

@@59583528 @8583528/ <h> How Our Products Can Help <p> A key challenge aquaculturists face is the buildup of ammonia nitrogen resulting from fish metabolism . Biofiltration , a prominent component of recirculating aquatic systems , uses cultured bacteria to metabolize ammonia nitrogen into less toxic forms . There are three distinct processes a biofiltration system must be designed to manage : nitrification , mineralization and denitrification . At Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems , our biologists and engineers can help you identify the biofiltration equipment needed to maintain healthy water quality for your fish stock . <h> Nitrification - What You 're Filtering to Keep Animals Healthy <p> Nitrification is the most commonly discussed and widely known facet of biological filtration and is undoubtedly the most critical since it deals with the breakdown of strongly toxic animal wastes . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> SweetwaterG SWX Bio-Media <p> Robust bacteria colonization is essential to the nitrification process of converting ammonia to nitrite and ultimately nitrate . With a surface area of 274 ft2/ft3 , this proven geometric design provides an abundant amount of surface area for bacteria to colonize . <h> Denitrification - Safely Remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mineralization and fish metabolism . Bacteria can use the ammonia nitrogen for food and in the process convert the ammonia ( NH3 ) to a less toxic compound , nitrite ( NO2 ) . Nitrite , however , can still be lethal to fish in small amounts ( in the 15 mg/L range ) . The last biological filtration process , denitrification , uses bacteria to remove nitrate from the water . While nitrate is not strongly toxic , animals do n't  live with elevated nitrate levels in nature , so keeping nitrate levels low is important in reproducing natural conditions for aquatic life . In addition , municipalities want to limit the discharge of excess nitrogen into natural waterways and sanitary sewer systems . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> HE Cyclonic Bioreactor <p> This is a fluidized sand bioreactor also known as a fluidized sand bio-filter . The Cyclonic Bioreactor nitrifies ammonia with silica sand . This is a two-stage process in which nitrifying bacteria form a biofilm on the surface of the silica sand that oxidizes ammonia into nitrite ( nitrosomonas ) and nitrite into nitrate ( nitrobacter ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system water quality with the lowest operating and maintenance cost <h> Mineralization - Breaking Down Solid Wastes <p> Mineralization is a fancy word for decomposition , whereby complex organic material is degraded by bacteria into its simplest parts . In aquaculture , this organic material is typically fecal material and uneaten food from the animals . Heterotrophic bacteria digest this material , preventing it from building up to unsafe levels in displays or farms . The end products of mineralization are mostly inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus . 161473 @qwx571473 <h> SweetwaterG Low-Space Bioreactor Filter <p> Fully automatic , self-adjusting and continuously self-cleaningThis is a robust , nonpressurized biofilter that is much less sensitive to flowrate variations and power interruptions than fluidized bed sand biofilters.When operated in low-head recirculating systems , it can easily be sunk intothe floor to reduce the pump pressure .

@@59583556 @8583556/ <p> Ozone is a powerful oxidant and is very beneficial with improving water quality in Aquatic Life Support Systems ( ALSS ) . Ozone oxidizes NO2 &amp; NO3 , helping to remove color , dissolved organic wastes , and micro-flocculates fine organic particulate , as well as improving dissolved oxygen levels . <p> Ozone delivers a noticeable benefit in water quality , especially when applied to Recirculating Aquaculture Systems ( RAS ) , which is why many system designers and operators are attracted to it . <p> At the same time , ozone also optimizes conditions for UV disinfection . Yes , both ozone and UV disinfection can work together within the ALSS to offer superior results , specifically , improved UV light transmittance , which increases the UV systems effectivenessboosting the germicidal disinfection capacity . <p> Primary Disinfectant <p> Ozone is not Instant Treatment , rather it requires that the target pathogen be exposed to specific concentrations for an extended period of time . For example : successful ozone disinfection in freshwater , targeting IPNV ( Infectious Pancreatic Nacreous Virus ) , requires an ozone concentration of 0.15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1992 #670 ) . If this is the case , it means a Flow-Through or RAS with a water flow of 3,000 GPM 11,355 LPM ) would require an ozone contact area large enough to effectively complete disinfection , and for most RAS , this is simply not practical . <p> UV disinfection is Instant Treatment and at a fluence ( UV dose ) of 246 mJ/cm , it achieves a 4-log ( 99.99% ) reduction of the pathogen IPNV . This means that a UV system with a disinfection capacity large enough to treat 3,000 GPM ( 11,355 LPM ) will successfully achieve germicidal disinfection on a single-pass inside the UV vessel . Therefore , UV disinfection is the best choice as a primary germicidal disinfectant . <p> An Effective Combination <p> OZONE ( clarifier ) and UV ( disinfectant ) well work together ! Ozone , being the powerful oxidizer it is , improves the UV Transmittance ( UVT ) in culture water , helping the UV system , positioned downstream of the ozone treatment , to perform more effectively . For instance , testing an RAS for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 75%T could be increased to 90%T . The increased %T , from 75%T to 90%T dramatically increases the efficiency of the downstream UV system , and in many cases , reduces the size of the required UV system . All ALSS are unique , and so we are forced to apply ozone and UV differently based on the specific conditions and requirements of each application . <p> TRO ( Total Residual Oxidant ) Alert <p> If bromide ( Br ) is present in the water ( ground water or seawater ) , a reaction is possible with the by-product being hypobromous acid and hypobromite , which are harmful to aquatic life . Controlling ozone addition in seawater applications is necessary . There , ozone should only be used as a clarifier ; enough to clarify ( 0.001 mg/l 350 mv ) , and yet even with this super low concentration the formation of TROs ( Total Residual Oxidants ) remains possible . <p> The accepted method among the Aquaculture community to measure ozone concentrations , especially super-low concentrations ( 0.001 mg/l 350 mv ) is to use an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned that due to the unstable characteristics of ozone , ORP meters are not as reliable at measuring ozone concentrations as Ozone Analyzers . Unfortunately , few analyzers are available that can measure such super-low concentrations ( below .05 mg/l ) . Therefore , in seawater applications ( especially RAS ) , both an ORP meter/controller , to measure and maintain the low ozone concentration , and a Total Residual Oxidant ( TRO ) Meter , to measure and detect dangerous TROs , should be employed . <p> As mentioned previously , all ALSS are unique ; however , there is one important similarity , in that a residual concentration of ozone greater than 0.001 mg/l can be harmful to fish and invertebrates . Safety protocols must be established and closely followed . For example , an ozone concentration of 0.03 mg/l is effective at controlling Saprolegnia , but allowing that same ozone concentration to reach the eggs or fish would cause them harm . Reliable ozone control is required . Placing a properly sized UV system downstream of the 0.03 mg/l ozone treatment can provide reliable ozone destruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Integrating the ozone generator operation with the UV system establishes a safety-firewall , protecting vulnerable livestock from potentially dangerous ozone . Applying a quality TRO Meter and implementing these control measures are especially important when applying ozone treatment to seawater systems . <p> LHO O3 UV <p> The greatest challenge working with ozone in ALSS is getting it into the culture water . Various methods exist that include : venturi injection , bubble contactors , and pressurized reactors . Larger systems with high bio-densities , and high flows , create additional challenges ; many associated with cost . Shown here is a stacked CO2 stripper with an LHO ( Low Head Oxygenator ) tower . This arrangement , with the substitution of ozone for oxygen , combined with UV disinfection creates a powerful and efficient filtering combination . <p> LHO-O3-UV Process <p> Mechanically filtered ( minimum 60 m ) water enters the CO2 stripper where it is de-gassed , increasing pH and gas-exchange . <p> Ozone injection takes place at the LHO ; concentrations of up to 0.3 mg/l are possible . <p> The towers sump provides additional contact-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culture water . <p> Culture water exiting the tower is at its highest water quality within the ALSS . <p> The properly sized UV system destructs any residual ozone while providing reliable and effective germicidal disinfection . <p> In this ALSS scenario , the ozone generator controls are interfaced into the UV systems PLC . The UV system PLCs integrated ORP Meter measures ozone concentration and , with set-points inputted , controls the operation of the ozone generator . Ultimately , if the UV system was to fail or an ozone ( ORP ) measurement exceeded the safety set-point , the UVs PLC would shut down the ozone generator.

Activated carbon is the generic term used to describe the family of carbonaceous adsorbents with an extensively developed internal pore structure . A wide variety of activated carbon products are available , exhibiting markedly different characteristics . They are commonly made from wood , coal , lignite and coconut shell . <p> In activated carbon 's manufacture , the material is first subjected to a heating process called carbonization , which forms a fixed carbon mass full of tiny pores . It is then activated by a second heat/steam treatment ( 2001,600C ) while regulating oxygen level , which creates an even larger internal pore network and imparts surface chemistries that give carbon its unique filtering characteristics . Some carbons are activated with phosphoric acid , potassium hydroxide or zinc chloride , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activated carbon , consider the adsorptive characteristics of that carbon on the chemicals to be removed . <p> Activated carbons adsorptive characteristics are based on the principle that the greater the surface area , the higher the number of adsorptive sites available . The pore size and the pore size distribution are extremely important , as they affect the efficacy of the carbon . The macropores ( larger than 25 nm ) are used as the entrance to the carbon , the mesopores ( 125 nm ) for transportation and the micropores ( less than 1 nm ) for adsorption . It is a generalization to say that the porosity of an activated carbon can be measured by adsorption of iodine from solution , but this measurement may not at all predict its ability to adsorb other chemicals . <p> The finer the particle size of an activated carbon , the better the access to the surface area and the faster the rate of adsorption .

In general , ( for recirculating and flow thru systems ) , the higher the fish density and the lower the water flow rate , the more critical this issue becomes . In intensive fish culture , dissolved oxygen is usually the first limiting factor . <p> ITS ABOUT BALANCEWhen water is in contact with air , each of the gases contained in air ( N2 , O2 , etc ) will move into or out of solution to achieve equilibrium between the liquid and gas pressure phase . At the point of equilibrium , the water is said to be " air-saturated " .

In a recirculating system only a portion of the fish diet fed is actually converted to fish biomass . The remainder is discharged from the system as solid waste or remains in the system as dissolved nutrients the fish can no longer use . These dissolved wastes can accumulate and negatively affect fish production . Dissolved nitrogen in the form of ammonia is toxic to fish and has to be controlled . Biological processes in the system help to convert toxic ammonia to less harmful nitrate through the nitrification process . Over time nitrate can accumulate in the water . Traditional methods to control nitrate are dilution of the system water volume or utilizing denitrification processes . Environmental regulations may prevent water exchanges to avoid polluting nearby water bodies and denitrification requires special components to convert the nitrate to nitrogen gas . An alternative option is to use plants to remove dissolved nutrients from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nutrients come from inorganic fertilizers or aquaculture effluent if nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium and other essential dissolved elements are available for uptake . <p> Aquaponics combines fish production with hydroponic vegetable crop production in a recirculating aquaculture system and has received considerable attention as a result of the systems capability to raise fish at high density , sustain water quality , minimize water exchange , and produce a marketable vegetable crop . The dissolved nitrate and phosphorus in the water , along with other essential elements from the fish diet , provide the majority of nutrients for the hydroponic plants . The plants remove and help to maintain appropriate dissolved nutrient concentrations in the production system . The hydroponic plants also help the farmer diversify their production strategy . Small and medium scale aquaponic systems can fit in backyards , on balconies and roof tops . Larger systems are being located in greenhouses or renovated warehouses close to urban settings to supply fresh fish and produce to these areas . <p> Recirculating aquaculture and hydroponic technology have existed independently from one another for some time now . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but appropriate components will ensure successful integration the two production techniques to enable unimpeded flow of the dissolved fish nutrients in the aquaponic system . One of the most important processes to not hinder water flow from fish components to hydroponic components is mechanical removal of solids . The solid fish waste does contain nutrients , but the nutrients are not in an available form for immediate plant uptake . If solids remain in the system they will begin to break down resulting in chronic health issues or acute mortality of fish and plants . Filtration components capable of removing solids as quickly as possible from the aquaponic production system is required to maintain optimal water quality and ensure aquaculture and hydroponics can be integrated successfully . Keep in mind the solid and liquid components discharged from the filters can be used for soil-based gardens , containerized plants , vegetable seedlings and compost . <p> There are three basic hydroponic technologies commonly used in aquaponics : <p> 1 ) Raft system : plants are placed into circular cutouts in styrofoam boards and roots are suspended in nutrient solution . Floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems because of ease of operation and maintenance . <p> 2 ) Nutrient Film Technique ( NFT ) : plant roots are located in shallow channels and exposed to a thin film of nutrient solution passing through the channel . This technology can be used in aquaponics , but solids filtration is critical and daily maintenance is a must to maintain proper water flow through troughs . <p> 3 ) Ebb &amp; Flow : plants are supported in inert substrate ( i.e. clay pebbles , pea gravel ) that is flooded and then allowed to drain multiple times daily . The flood and drain method is typically used for small aquaponic systems . Its not recommended for large systems because substrate needs to be cleaned to prevent clogging overtime . <p> Seedling germination will be necessary for whichever hydroponic technology you use to grow your plants in the aquaponic system . There are many variables that need to be taken into account when choosing your growing medium , including type of system , crop being grown , environment , availability , price and personal preference . Below are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either raft systems , NFT or ebb &amp; flow systems . <p> 1 ) Rockwool is derived from volcanic rock .

The operator must have technical knowledge to identify high level issues in system management and form a specific solution to fix the problem without hampering fish or plant production . The following are a few important strategies for an aquaponic system : <p> 1 ) Feed input : fish feed input should be balanced to the volume and area of the hydroponic grow area . An optimum ratio for raft systems is 60 -100 grams of feed/m2 of plant growing area/day . This equates to approximately 1/8 to + pound of fish diet/yd2 of plant grow area/day . If the fish are being fed one pound of feed daily a then the plant growing area could be 4 8 yd2 in size . <p> 3 ) Aeration : Plant roots are living cells and require oxygen . Raft systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems aerate the nutrient sump before it returns to the plants . Ebb &amp; Flow systems rely on atmospheric air getting pulled into the porous substrate when the nutrient solution drains from the grow area . <p> 4 ) pH control : The fish and nitrifying bacteria prefer pH levels at 7.0 to 7.5 and the plants prefer levels of 6.0 to 6.5 . There must be a compromise with aquaponics therefore pH levels are maintained at 6.7 to 7.0 .

Ammonia can be lethal to some species in concentrations less than .5 mg/L . It 's well known that certain bacteria can oxidize ammonia first to nitrite and finally to nitrate under the proper conditions ( called nitrification , where each compound gets converted to something less toxic ) . Setting up these ideal conditions is the main focus of biological filtration design . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an appropriate material ( substrate ) for the nitrifying bacteria to grow on . Creative people have used everything from hair curlers to lava rock to plastic army men for homemade biofilters . The real science of biofilter design is optimizing the process to get the biggest usable surface area for bacterial growth in the smallest possible space ( footprint ) . Other considerations are choice of substrate , oxygen utilization , biofouling and flowrates . <p> There are two general classes of biofilters : moving beds and static beds . The static bed is the traditional " trickle filter " where water is sprayed over a bed of stationary substrate . Moving bed filters have the media suspended in the water column inside a container , and the media is kept in constant motion by air , water or a combination of both . The pros and cons of both types : <p> Static Bed Filters <p> Pros <p> Cost . Static bed filters can be made out of lengths of pipe , garbage cans , buckets or almost anything to hold the media . <p> Gas exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of empty space for oxygen and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) exchange . While the empty space reduces the surface area available for bacterial growth , it does promote gas exchange for CO2 and supersaturated gas stripping . <p> Simplicity of design . There 's really not much to break or go wrong with a filter that can be as simple as a Rubbermaid garbage can filled with lava rock . <p> Cons <p> Optimization . The empty spaces in static bed filters that are great for gas exchange give them less than ideal usable surface area . Also , spraying water randomly over the media typically leaves some of the surface area dry ( the water evaporates ) and therefore unused . <p> Biofouling . Because the media does n't move , layers of bacteria ( biofilms ) will tend to build up on the media . These can result in lost usable surface area . If pockets of anaerobic bacterial activity form in the thicker biofilms where oxygen exchange is low , you 'll have to clean the media occasionally , which can stress or even kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters are named that for a reason . If water goes into a static bed filter at too high of a speed , the bacteria can actually be blown right off the media . <p> Moving Bed Filters <p> Pros <p> Optimization . Moving bed filters tend to use smaller media ( to keep it in motion ) with better surface area to volume ratios . Since the media is submerged , all available surface area can be colonizeda much more compact footprint than for static bed filters . <p> Resistance to biofouling . Moving media is constantly bumping into itself , a natural " scouring " action that causes the older , thicker biofilms to slough off . This sloughing also removes the older bacteria , which get rid of ammonia and nitrite slower than younger bacteria . So you do n't have to clean the media , which could stress or kill the bacteria , and the biofilter runs at higher efficiency . <p> Capital cost . Being more complex , moving bed filters are usually more expensive , but this cost must be weighed against the added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are so efficient and contain higher densities of bacteria , moving bed filters tend to use more oxygen and generate more CO2 , which can require additional gas balancing in the water after it passes through the biofilter . <p> Common Biofilters <p> Static Bed <p> Most static bed filters are variations of the packed column ( trickle filter ) simply an open container filled with biomedia , bio balls or barrels , lava rock , crushed shell or corrugated media ( Brentwood ) .

A.E . can potentially provide appropriate physical , chemical and nutritional parameters for tomato plant growth without the need for watering with nitrogen fertilizer . <p> Consumer-driven demand for aquaculture products has resulted in the adoption of intensive fish production facilities . Initial efforts to intensify aquaculture operations were linked to water quality degradation because of increased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in discharged wastes .

Substrates were prepared prior to each experiment by mixing a commercial peat- and pine bark-based growing mix ( C.M. ) and dewatered aquaculture effluent ( A.E. ) based on the volume of each substrate . <p> After mixing , it was important to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of each substrate , because they are important factors in plant growth response . Physical properties like air space affect gas exchange in the substrate , while water-holding capacity affects water retention in the substrate . In general , container substrates should provide physical properties with 10 to 30% air space and 40 to 50% water-holding capacity . Also , the chemical properties of most horticulture substrates should provide pH values of 5.5 to 7.0 and soluble salt levels below 2.5 S/cm2 . <p> ExperimentsThe first experiment evaluated tomato seedlings grown in four different substrates partially replaced with dewatered aquaculture effluent . Treatments included a 100% C.M. control and substrates with 25 , 50 or 75% A.E . All plants were watered with municipal water daily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulated from a 20-10-20 water-soluble fertilizer . After 30 days , tomato plant growth parameters decreased in the substrates with 25% and greater A.E . The bulk densities of the substrates with these greater amounts of A.E . increased and resulted in decreased air space for plant roots . Plant roots require space for gas exchange , and the decreased air space negatively affected plant growth . The substrates with 25% or greater A.E . content had pH values elevated above 7.0 and soluble salts measured above 2.5 S/cm2 . <p> A second experiment evaluated the growth of tomatoes in five different substrates partially replaced with dewatered aquaculture effluent . For this experiment , treatments included a 100% C.M. control and substrates with 5 , 10 , 15 or 20% A.E . All plants were watered with municipal water and provided 100 mg/L nitrogen twice weekly . After 30 days , plants grown in substrates with 15% or lower A.E . grew similar to or better than the control . The physical properties of substrates with 15% or less A.E . were sufficient for tomato seedling growth . The chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimal pH and soluble salt levels . However , pH and salt levels began to increase in substrate with 20% A.E. , and plant growth parameters decreased . <p> Water SourceThe second experiment demonstrated that for tomato seedling production , partial substitution of commercially available potting mix with dewatered aquaculture effluent had a positive effect on plant growth and quality if used at a 15% or lower portion of the mixture . But it did n't  determine if the nutrients in the aquaculture effluent could replace commercial substrate and provide adequate nutrition for tomato transplants , because all plants were provided a complete nutrient solution twice weekly . <p> A third experiment evaluated tomato seedling growth grown under specific combinations of substrates and water sources . All plants were grown in one of the following substrates : a 100% C.M. control or substrates with 5 or 10% A.E . Half the plants grown in each substrate were watered only with municipal water for the entirety of the experiment . The other half were additionally given water that contained 100 mg/L nitrogen from a 20-10-20 water-soluble fertilizer twice weekly . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the tomato seedlings . Tomato seedlings watered with fertilizer and grown in substrates with 0 or 5% A.E . had better growth than those grown in the same substrates and watered with municipal water only . These potting mixtures alone were unable to supply the plants with an adequate amount of nutrients , but watering the substrates with 100 mg/L nitrogen improved plant growth . Water source had no significant impact on growth for plants grown in 10% A.E. , indicating this substrate could provide optimal physical and chemical parameters and sufficient nutrients for tomato plant growth without the need for watering with 100 mg/L nitrogen . <p> Economic AnalysisA basic economic analysis determined the material cost of dewatering solids using the geotextile bag and polymer . It was based on an actual five-month production period with Nile tilapia produced in the 100-m3 biofloc system . The cost of the geotextile bag was U.S. $171 , and two , 19-L biopolymer buckets ( $102 each ) were required to flocculate the discharged effluent . The total cost of materials was $375 . A total of 1,505 kg of dry-weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . Approximately 284 kg of dry-weight solids , or 19% of the diet fed , was discharged and captured in the geotextile bag . This equated to U.S. $1.32/kg of dry-weight solids . <p> PerspectivesConcentrated aquaculture wastes will have to be treated on site as RAS facilities intensify their production . Geotextile technology can treat the discharged aquaculture effluent and create a solids component for traditional horticulture production systems . Through a series of experiments , the authors observed that dewatered aquaculture effluent can replace commercial potting mixes and provide tomato seedlings with adequate nutrients for growth . This information could be useful for farms integrating aquaculture and horticulture on site . 
@@59583703 @8583703/ <p> Algae Growth ( Photosynthesis ) Kio ponds are usually closed recirculating aquatic systems , meaning that these systems , unlike natural ponds with streams flowing through them , lack a fresh water flow-through source . Rather , closed recirculating aquatic systems rely on filtration to purify and reoxygenate their water . Outdoor ponds that are closed systems are subject to seasonal algae blooms and attached filamentous algae growth due to nutrient and carbon dioxide buildup . Increased levels of nutrients and carbon dioxide create the potential for a healthy algae population . <p> Pigments ( chlorophyll , fucoxanthin and carotenoids ) in the algae absorb light energy and use it to convert carbon dioxide and nutrients into new cell biomass through photosynthesis . The primary nutrients of concern are nitrogen and phosphorus . Nitrogen is a by-product of decomposed fish waste , uneaten fish food and accumulated sludge in the bottom of the pond . View the Nitrification Process . <p> Planktonic Algae <p> Planktonic Algae are waterborne , single-cell algae , most commonly referred to as Green Water . Planktonic Algae ( algae bloom ) usually occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide in pond water , combined with the energy of sunlight . Planktonic algae can be controlled with aquatic plants , shade , ultraviolet sterilization or chemical methods . Using aquatic plants as a algae control requires that a specific number of mature plants are added to the pond to compete with the algae for the available nutrients and carbon dioxide . Shade is available only if foliage or a shelter inhibits the pond 's exposure to sunlight . Chemical treatments can be successful , but they can be expensive , temporary and potentially harmful to plants and fish . <p> The advantages of UV sterilization make it an attractive option for algae control . <p> 1 . It is a physical treatment , so it does not change the water chemistry of the pond water <p> Filamentous Algae Attached filamentous algae can be seen growing on the rocks of a waterfall or on the sides of the pond . The growth of filamentous algae results from high levels of nutrients ; carbon monoxide and the catalyst , the Sun 's energy . Methods of controlling filamentous algae include increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water changes and the use of chemicals or plecostomus ( algae-eating fish ) during the summer months . <p> Algae Is n't Bad , Is It ? Algae can be either beneficial or detrimental to a pond , depending on the owner 's viewpoint . Algae provide nutrients for newly hatched fry and indirectly act as a color enhancer . As algae grow in a pond a population of zooplankton will also develop , on which the fish feed . These natural live feeds help develop the intense coloration desired in most koi . Unfortunately , algae blooms prevent viewing the fish so sick fish can go undetected for days or even weeks . <p> Algae influence the water quality of the pond , mainly by affecting the balance among dissolved oxygen , pH , carbon dioxide and nutrients . During photosynthesis , algae produce oxygen , remove nutrients and take up respired carbon dioxide from both the fish and the algae itself . In heavily stocked ponds , the water becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide . High levels of carbon dioxide can quickly depress the pH of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain proper alkalinity levels and adequate aeration for stripping . During active periods of photosynthesis ( during daylight hours ) , algae can quickly strip the carbon dioxide out of the water and pH levels can rise above nine in a matter of hours . Fish not acclimated to such sharp shifts may initially show signs of stress . <p> At night , both algae and fish consume oxygen from and exhale carbon dioxide into the system . Algae compete with the fish for available oxygen in the water . A potentially serious impact of an algae bloom is the risk of an " algae crash " triggered by temperature or barometric pressure . When an algae bloom collapses , dead algae cells settle to the bottom of the pond adding to the decomposing sediment 's oxygen demand . If the crash is severe , the pond 's oxygen supply can be quickly depleted , endangering the fish , unless backup aeration is available . Additionally , as the dead algae cells rupture , they can release organic nitrogen and phosphorus back into the water adding to the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria converting the organic nutrients to inorganic elements . Which are then available to be recycled , and the algae bloom continues . <p> Practical Algae Control View your pond as an ecosystem , one requiring you to manage it to maintain proper balance . Fish ponds without adequate plantings are most susceptible to algae bloom problems . These ponds are usually well stocked with overfed fish . The absence of aquatic plants eliminates competition with algae for available nutrients in the pond water . Practical fish stocking densities and feeding must be managed closely . <p> UV Sterilization is a proven method for controlling waterborne algae . Combining UV Sterilization with adequate mechanical filtration , and operating the two properly is most effective in eliminating algae blooms and maintaining clear water . This combination will not , however , control nitrogen or carbon dioxide levels .

PAES has particular expertise in designing and supporting UV systems in aquaculture field applications . In addition to new installations , PAES also provides consulting and support for UV systems that are installed in existing aquaculture facilities . UV treatment has been used successfully for approximately six decades to treat and sanitize water in many critical applications . When designed , installed , and maintained properly , UV systems are extremely robust , reliable and effective . <p> In this article , we will describe the array of UV system configurations along with their associated lamp technologies , to serve as a high-level guide to important design and operating considerations for UV systems . <p> UV Process discussion <p> Ultraviolet or UV energy is located in the electromagnetic spectrum with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light , and longer than x-rays . When UV systems are deployed to treat water , the reactions are instantaneous , taking only a few seconds to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not required , and the associated hazards of chemical handling and storage are not present . UV treatment does not alter color , odor , taste or pH . As such , UV processes are environmentally safe and are considered ecologically-responsible technology . The science behind UV technology is well-established ; and its efficacy is well-proven . UV systems are trusted in a wide range of industries including drinking water production , aquaculture farming , and other applications . <p> UV light is comprised of electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths ranging from 100nm to 400nm . <p> UV-A ( long wave UV ) : 315-400nm <p> UV-B ( middle wave UV ) : 280-315nm <p> UV-C ( short wave UV ) : 200-280nm <p> Vacuum UV : 100-200nm <p> Disinfection <p> When a UV system is used to treat water , UV light at the 254 nm wavelength penetrates the cell wall of microorganisms that are present in the treatment water . The amount of UV delivered to the organism is called the dose . The UV energy permanently alters the DNA structure of the microorganism in a process called thymine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " inactivated " and rendered unable to reproduce or infect . <p> Photo Catalysis <p> Another useful way that UV can be utilized is in the destruction of oxidants that are present in post-treatment water in the form of residuals . Ozone ( and some other oxidant chemicals ) can be eliminated by the application of UVC radiation . UV energy in the wavelength of 254 nm has the ability to catalyze ozone into harmless oxygen and water . UV is very effective at destroying ozone ( O3 ) . O3 molecules absorb 254 nm UV radiation and this absorption causes decomposition of the O3 molecule . O3 concentrations at less than 0.5 mg/l can be eliminated with a UV dose of 60 mJ/cm2. 1.0 mg/l ozone concentrations require a minimum UV dose of 90 mJ/cm for complete destruction . <p> UV Reactor Types <p> UV reactors for processing fluids are generally either enclosed or oriented in channels without an enclosure . UV reactors can be in-line in a pressurized piping system or fed by gravity without requiring pumps . <p> Enclosed Reactors <p> Enclosed reactors can be installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " U " shape , or with the inlet and outlet on opposing sides . They are cylindrical and can be manufactured from stainless steel , various plastics and polymers such as PVC , HDPE and others . <p> Open Channel and Gravity Fed Reactors <p> Open Channel reactors are either installed in concrete channels or in pre-manufactured troughs , typically stainless steel or fiberglass reinforced plastic ( FRP ) . The lamps can be oriented horizontally in racks or mounted vertically , perpendicular to the flow . Open channel systems can treat very large flows and are economical if gravity feed is available . Gravity fed reactors can also be offered in enclosed FRP vessels with the lamps mounted vertically . <p> UV Lamp Technology <p> UV lamps used in disinfection and photolysis applications are categorized into two basic types : low pressure and medium pressure . Both types of UV lamps utilize mercury which becomes vaporized when energized by the application of electricity . As a result , photons are generated in the UVC spectrum . The following are characteristics of both lamp types : <p> Low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are much larger due to the lamp size and quantity required to apply the same dose . Medium pressure systems , however , generate much more heat , are more expensive to operate and have lower effective lamp life . Medium pressure UV systems have the advantage of smaller overall size and ease of maintenance due to the reduced numbers of lamps . Both systems are commercially-viable and application appropriate , and effective in terms of disinfection and photolysis performance . <p> UV Design Considerations : <p> There are several critical parameters which apply when designing or sizing a UV system . <p> All of these conditions should be considered prior to choosing a UV design . The most critical aspect of properly sizing a UV system is the UV transmittance ( UVT ) of the fluid being treated . Accurate knowledge of UVT is essential for ensuring that a system will perform properly after it has been installed . Unfortunately , UVT is often overlooked or incorrectly estimated ; which may result in poor UV system performance . Always consult a qualified expert or use a good-quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . <p> UV Transmittance <p> The amount of UVC light that is absorbed by the fluid being processed dramatically affects the amount of energy available to apply the germicidal dose required to inactive the target pathogen , or catalyze the target compound such as ozone . A UVT analyzer is used to measure the 254 nm UVC light absorbed across a 1 CM cuvette , providing a UVT measurement . UVT analyzers are easily obtained and are inexpensive , valuable tools . Table 1 illustrates the importance of providing an accurate UVT reading by showing the additional energy required at various UVT values : <p> Ninety percent UVT is a common UVT assumption for many UV applications . At 90% UVT , 36% of the UVC generating capacity is absorbed by the water being treated . If the UVT drops to 80% there is a corresponding loss of almost 57% of the UVC dose being absorbed . It is therefore essential to test the UVT at various times of year to ensure that the required dose is available at all times . <p> Water Quality Issues <p> Water quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , turbidity and suspended matter physically shields the pathogen from the UVC dose , rendering the UV process ineffective . As a general rule of thumb , pretreatment to UV systems is generally recommended , and defined as filtration down to 40 microns and 3 NTU turbidity . <p> Factors which have an impact upon UVT are : <p> Shielding ( Turbidity ) <p> Organics <p> Chelating Agents <p> Halogen Stabilizers <p> Pharmaceuticals <p> Water Additives/Conditioners <p> Minerals especially Iron and Manganese <p> Sleeve Fouling <p> In UV systems , the lamps are enclosed in quartz sleeves to allow UVC light transmittance , while protecting the lamps from treatment water . Minerals , hardness and organic matter can form on the outside of the sleeves , reducing the amount of UVC light transmitted to the fluid , thus reducing the dose . The UV system can be rendered ineffective if enough build-up occurs . Wiping systems can be employed to keep the sleeves clean . Periodic manual cleaning of the sleeves can also be done if wipers are not used . If a drop in UV intensity is noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamp Life ( EOLL ) <p> Low pressure and medium pressure lamps have a useful lamp life . Lamp performance degrades over time as the mercury degrades within the lamp . The lamp degradation process is unavoidable and eventually requires the lamps to be replaced . Lamps have life ratings which vary by type and manufacturer . Depending on the lamp type and manufacturer , the degradation loss over the lamps service life varies between 15% and 40% . To ensure the design dose is applied over the complete life of the lamp , it is best to initially size the lamps for the 15 to 40% degradation loss . In this way , the lamps will actually produce a higher dose when they are new , and will degrade to the design level until the end of lamp life , ensuring correct dose for the entire lamp life period . <p> Pathogen Dose Response <p> Pathogens respond to UV differently and they are inactivated at a variety of dose levels . When designing for multiple pathogens , it is critical to design for the pathogen with the highest resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as log reduction . <p> Table 2 the dose required for various pathogens . If log reduction is not indicated , this is the generally accepted dose value for inactivation . <p> Dose Determination <p> UVC dose is calculated using an " Ideal Reactor " referred to as a collimated beam . A collimated beam is laboratory apparatus that is used to deliver very precise UV doses to samples of fluid containing the target organism or chemical that is to be inactivated or decomposed . The UV beam is comprised of uniform UV light that is easily quantified . A petri dish is used that contains a thin layer of fluid with the target organism or chemical distributed within . This is intended to represent perfect hydraulic design . The dose required for log reduction is considered Ideal and is the base comparison for reactor performance ( efficiency ) and used to determine inactivation rates of organisms or chemicals . <p> Conclusion <p> UV systems are effective , economical , environmentally responsible , and low maintenance tools for disinfection and photo catalysis for aquaculture facilities . Attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proper dose , UVT and EOLL conditions are frequently overlooked or designed with an unrealistic UVT causing poor performance . It is therefore essential to consult with a reputable , experienced UV provider prior to installing a new system or retrofitting an existing system to ensure satisfactory consistent UV performance . UVT testing routinely is inexpensive and ensures that the system operates as intended ; systems can be designed to pace the lamp output based on flow and UVT in order to obtain lower power consumption on both lamp types .

@@59583741 @8583741/ <h> Artemia Decapsulation - Tech Talk 100 <p> Artemia or brine shrimp is commonly used as a larval feed for several aquatic species . In order to ensure the highest nutritional value , Artemia cysts should be decapsulated prior to hatching . This will disinfect the cysts , remove the chorion ( the indigestible portion of the cyst ) and will also reduce the amount of energy that the Artemia has to exert to hatch . The process increases the nutritional value and hatch rate of the newly hatched Artemia and minimizes the risk of bacterial infections and gut obstructions by the chorion . <p> There are two common methods used to decapsulate the cysts . For both of the methods described , the first step is to hydrate the cysts by soaking them in either fresh or salt water for one hour . Dry cysts have a " dimple " that makes uniform removal of the shell difficult . <p> Chlorine MethodThis method uses household bleach ( 6% sodium hypochlorite solution ) or industrial chlorine ( 11% sodium hypochlorite solution ) . 15 g of hydrated cysts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution .

They are suitable for all species and pond depths . It operates by creating a partial vacuum under the water , drawing air through the shaft and dispersing it into the water in a horizontal direction . As the propeller rotates , it induces a flow of atmospheric air through the air intake ports on the shaft located above the water surface . This air is then drawn through the shaft , past the propeller , and exits in a high velocity stream of fine bubbles ( less than 2.2 mm in diameter ) as it is diffused into the water . This is critical to both oxygen dispersion and oxygen transfer . The smaller the bubble from an aerator , the longer this bubble stays in the water .
