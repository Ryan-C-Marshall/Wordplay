@@42338344 @2338344/ <h> How-To7 Easy Tricks to Immediately Improve Every Email <p> October 17th , 2016 <h> By Jared Blank <p> Running a successful email marketing program requires constant testing and optimization . Although formal A/B testing is a major part of this , that is n't the only way to improve your overall program . In fact , some of the most impactful ways to improve your emails are easy ( and free ) enhancements you can implement right away.Whether you 're looking to improve open rates or click through rates , here are seven simple tricks to improve your emails immediately . <h> 1 . Tie the Subject Line to the Preview Text <p> In general , - people tend to underestimate the power of good copy in emails , but having- a distinct voice makes a big difference . Not only will it help your emails stand out , theyll- also be- easier to read- and write . <p> Although there are a lot of areas within an email where copy comes into play , one of the most common mistakes- we see marketers make is wasting- preview text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give context to the subject line . This gives- marketers far more flexibility with subject lines , allowing them to be creative with something- short , punchy and attention grabbing , instead of trying to cram the entire context of an email into 50 characters . <p> In the example above , Outdoor Voices- preview text , " A fresh collection for Doing Things . Rival the changing leaves in autumns new palette . " not only gives context to the " Fall has arrived " subject line , but it also has a distinct voice unique to the brand . <h> 2 . Make Sure Alt Text Makes Sense Without the Image <p> Although the alt text for website images and alt text for email images serve very different purposes , many marketers often make the mistake of treating them the same . Alt text for website images helps with SEO , and therefore should include any keywords you 're targeting for organic search . Alt text for email images , on the other hand , is used to reinforce email copy , and therefore should make sense if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alt text of , " Wait , who are you talking to ? " for the email image , which complements the article title , " 32 Text That Will Make You Laugh Way Harder Than You Should . " If this email image simply had the same alt text used for SEO , this may read something like , " Funny Text Messages " which does n't  really provide any additional value to the rest of the text . <h> 3 . Use- Emotion Instead of a- Coupon for Re-Engagement <p> For re-engagement emails , many marketers immediately resort to including discounts or coupons to encourage action . Not only is this not a cost-effective strategy , but its also risks your brand coming off as too eager . Instead , marketers should first try simply injecting emotion into these emails.In the example above , Dropbox tells the user his account is " feeling kind of lonely " and encourages him to login . If Dropbox , a B2B data storage technology , can think of a clever way to do this , consumer brands can certainly come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go Big <p> When email was first going to mobile , marketers immediately assumed they needed to shrink everything in order to accommodate the smaller screen . But when you think about how people use their phones , shrinking images does n't really make sense . <p> People are used to scrolling , both in apps ( think Facebook and Instagram ) and in email . So instead of making everything smaller , marketers are actually better off making things bigger . Having one powerful image is much impactful than having multiple smaller ones . <p> In the example above from The Standard , one large image dominates the email and clearly communicates the message ( plus bonus points for great copy ) ! Now imagine if this image was replaced with three smaller ones . Would be nearly as impactful ? Probably not . <h> 5 . Lose the Site Navigation to Focus on the Content <p> Staying with the theme of less is more ' , emails are better off having a simple , clear message instead of having a handful of little things above the fold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny navigation is n't very user friendly . Eliminate any noise and use clear imagery to ensure your email has a distinct focus . <h> 6 . Do n't  Use the Same Call-To-Action Text as Everyone Else <p> Going hand-in-hand with great copy , do n't  be afraid to get creative with your emails ' calls-to-action . Its another great oppo-rtunity to inject personality and make your brand stand out . <p> Most marketers resort to basic , generic verbs for calls-to-action . Really Good Emails looked at the most used calls-to-action verbs and found these to be the top ten : <p> Get <p> Shop <p> Take <p> Read <p> Book <p> View <p> Start <p> See <p> Find <p> Join <p> Nothing too exciting to see here on their own . <p> In the example from Litmus , the calls-to-action are " The case for single opt-in " and " The case for double opt-in . " These are much more engaging than something like " Single " and " Double " or " See Single " and " See Double . " <h> 7 . Include Value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Abandonment emails , is that there always needs to be a coupon or discount offered to entice a purchase . But there plenty of other ways to induce a shopper to buy now . Think about common value propositions that are included in a checkout path , such as guaranteed next day delivery , free financing and pay with PayPal . If you 're including these value propositions in your checkout process , why not include it in your triggered emails too ? <p> In the example above , Ice.com includes a " Buy Now , Pay Later " value proposition . This is n't a time-sensitive offer , but rather something the brand does for all its customers . However , the brand knows that this kind of offer is something that differentiates them and encourages an immediate purchase . <p> No matter how sophisticated your program is , there 's always room for optimization and improvement . Simple tricks like these are great ways to enhance your email marketing without taking bandwidth from your team . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866 
@@42338350 @2338350/ <h> How-To4 Simple Ways to A/B Test Your Email Subject Lines <p> September 19th , 2016 <h> By Liz Bedor <p> Although there are several- best practices- marketers should follow when it comes to A/B testing email programs , sometimes choosing where to- start can feel overwhelming. - A great way to prioritize which components- to test , is to- think about the steps- a shopper takes to engage with an email . So- what 's the first step they take ? Opening it . <p> While there- are a few different aspects that can affect your email marketing programs open rate , perhaps the biggest opportunity to- impact this metrics performance is in the subject line . There are a handful- of ways to approach testing this , so to help you get started , - here- are five- thought-starter ideas : <h> 1 . Include the shoppers name <p> Dynamic subject lines are used to provide personalization before a shopper- even clicks into the email , and what 's more personal than someones- name ? Including a shoppers- name in the subject line immediately grabs attention and can- potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests this tactic in its Cart Abandonment triggered emails with the subject lines , - " First Name , Your Blooms are Waiting " or simply " Your Blooms are Waiting . " <h> 2 . Include a product attribute <p> Another way to use dynamic subject lines is to include product attributes , such as the product name , brand name- or category viewed by a shopper . Including this information can help trigger the shoppers memory- about the recent session they 've had on your site and the specific products theyve viewed . Jeromes- tests dynamic subject lines with its- Cart Abandonment triggered emails by including the- product name . In the example above , a shopper can receive an email with the general subject line of , - " We Thought You Might Like " - or a dynamic subject line of " Product Name and more " - For triggers that engage shoppers higher in the purchase funnel , such as- Search Abandonment , marketers should use broader attributes , such as product category or brand name . <h> 3 . Ask a question vs. make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is- a go-to tactic for attracting readers . This works well because peoples- brains are- hard-wired to solve problems , and phrasing headlines as questions- tells the- reader they must read the article to find the answer . But- how does that tactic- translate into email subject lines ? According to a recent study by Mailchimp , subject lines phrased as questions performed better than similar subject lines that were phrased as statements . As a best practice , be sure your subject line asks a question the reader can not easily answer , otherwise they have no reason to open your email . In the example above , DermStoretests Cart Abandonment subject lines with a statement , - " Take Them Home " - or a question , - " Did You Forget Something ? " <h> 4 . Play with character count <p> The KISS principle ( keep it simple , stupid ) - is usually a good methodology for marketers to follow in order to avoid overcomplicating things . Email subject lines are no exception . The same study by Mailchimp also found that longer subject lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only display up to- 50 characters , its best to test below that range . In the example above , Pura Vida tests subject line character count in its Back in Stock triggered emails . The first subject line keeps things short and sweet with , - " Its Back ! " - while- the second option also reminds the shopper they had previously wanted to buy a- product with , - " You wanted it and now its back ! " - Even though both subject lines are simple , slight variations can sometimes make all the difference . <p> Every email sent is an opportunity to test and optimize. - A/B testing your email marketing subject lines can not only have a huge affect on your programs open rates , but also have a waterfall affect on your other marketing metrics , which will ultimately impact your bottom line . Use the tactics above to get started and be sure to follow our best practices to make the process as easy an effective as possible . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866 
@@42338351 @2338351/ <h> How-ToIs a Lack of Onsite Personalization Holding You Back ? <p> April 17th , 2017 <h> By Sharon Shapiro <h> Retail marketers who pour time and resources into personalized emails only to send customers to a generic site are leaving value on the table <p> Picture this : You spend days building ultra-targeted audience segments so that you can send highly personalized emails to your customers . Shoppers who receive these emails get the feeling that you know who they are and what they want , so they click through to your site expecting more of the same . But more often than not , that 's where the personalization ends . <p> It 's an interesting predicament why do retail marketers spend so much time personalizing emails only to send customers to a generic site ? It 's a mismatched experience that falls flat , especially at a time when expectations for personalized and seamless experiences have hit an all-time high . <h> The Case for Onsite Personalization <p> Once upon a time , people went to a local store , found what they were looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase . There was no whipping out phones in the store aisles to compare prices with competitors or researching options ahead of time . Today , all of that is a distant memory . <p> When the only option was the local retailer , the experience was automatically personalized if you had a question , you asked a store associate and you had a one-on-one conversation based on your needs . Online shopping raised the bar on convenience , but it stripped personalization from the entire experience . <p> As we dive deeper into the digital age , it 's time to tip the scales back in the favor of personalization . Now that consumers have more choice in where they shop , one of the best steps retailers can take to set their brands apart and add value is to personalize the end-to-end experience . The data says it all , with 53% of shoppers believing that retailers who personalize the shopping experience provide a valuable service and 45% of online shoppers saying they are more likely to shop on a site that offers personalized recommendations . Additionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in excess of 10% from onsite or mobile app personalization . <h> Getting Started with Onsite Personalization <p> So how do you actually extend personalization beyond email to deliver a more value-add experience for customers ? When it comes to personalizing the onsite experience , you need to consider two components : What on the site you will personalize and how you will segment audiences . <h> What to Personalize : 4 Focus Areas <p> There are countless components on your site that you can personalize , but it 's important not to overdo it . As you get your feet wet , consider these four potential focus areas : <p> Hero images : Change the hero image on your homepage or other landing pages for visitors that fall into certain audience segments . <p> Banners : Add banners that only display for specified audiences to the top of web pages . <p> Lightboxes : Create lightboxes for target audiences . Unlike the previous two options , the benefit of a lightbox is that it can appear on any page , so visitors do n't need to hit a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated audiences from the homepage to a more relevant landing page . This approach is an easy place to start since it requires no new creative elements . <h> How to Segment Audiences : 5 Targets to Consider <p> Arguably the most importance piece of personalization is deciding who to target . Again , there are countless different ways to segment audiences to deliver a personalized experience , so it 's simply a matter of deciding where to start based on the data that you have and the approaches that will provide the most value for your company and your customers alike . The following five audiences are good places to start : <p> Category Preference : Target audiences with a strong affinity for a specific category , brand or product by adding hero images that direct visitors to related sections of your site or by creating lightboxes that display relevant new arrivals . <p> Predicted Customer Lifetime Value : Pinpoint your most valuable customers and create a custom site experience for them by showcasing high value products , creating banners with special offers to join a loyalty program or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lifecycle Stage : Segment customers by lifecycle stage to deliver reactivation and special offers to at-risk or lost customers who return to your site or to encourage non-buyers and one-time buyers to make more purchases . <p> Email-Identified Visitors : Segment visitors based on whether or not you have their email address so that you do n't keep pestering the ones you do have with email collection pop-ups and so that you can be more aggressive with email collections with the ones you do n't have . <h> Making Onsite Personalization a Reality <p> If you 're pouring time and resources into personalizing your emails only to send customers to a generic site , you 're leaving value on the table as shoppers wonder what happened to the brand that seemed to know them so well . Following the best practices for onsite personalization described here can go a long way toward remedying that mismatched situation . <p> For proof of the power of onsite personalization , look no further than Bluecore 's own customers who have achieved a 150% lift in engagement , a 56% lift in revenue per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing such capabilities . <p> What does this onsite personalization look like in action ?

@@42338355 @2338355/ <h> StrategySiloed Data Is n't a Bad Thing <p> April 10th , 2017 <h> By Jared Blank <p> The now widely-accepted idea that having siloed customer data is a terrible mistake is , itself , a terrible mistake . <p> Do n't get me wrong if you 're trying to create a unified customer experience in which you can track customers ' activities as they switch devices and channels , including going from online to offline , having all of your customer data in a single place makes sense . But it 's not the only solution . <p> In fact , if your customer data already exists in siloed systems , you can actually get value out of it faster by leaving it as is . Let me explain <h> The Backstory on Siloed Data <p> At one point in the not too distant past , putting your customer data in silos was actually considered a smart move to make . That 's because those silos emerged alongside new technology , such as email service provider ( ESP ) and social media management tools , that made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For example , when ESPs entered the market , they made it easy to send messages , track email activity and personalize outreach . The alternative ? Tasking IT to create a data warehouse to collect the information and tying it to an in-house messaging system . In other words , avoiding the silo would mean a lot of complicated backend development work and an extended time-to-market , while simply implementing an ESP made getting up and running with the same activities far faster and easier . <p> So , although these different point solutions did create data silos ( which did n't necessarily even matter 10-15 years ago ) , they also allowed marketers to activate several new use cases quickly and easily . <h> Yesterday 's Solutions = Today 's Headaches <p> Fast-forward to today , when consumers expect to switch devices and channels without any interruptions to their brand experience , and it 's clear that the data silos that once simplified customer engagement are quickly becoming a hindrance to it . But how much of an issue are they really ? Not as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power the type of consistent experience consumers now expect you need to view and understand data across channels , but that does n't mean all of your data needs to live in a single location . Instead of centralizing your data , what you really need to centralize is your decision-making . <p> By centralizing your decision-making , you should be able to answer questions like : <p> Who are my highest value customers ? <p> What category preferences do different customers have ? <p> What 's the best creative to get in front of people ? <p> Which channels should I use to connect with different customers ? <p> Which of my customers need a discount ? <p> Who should n't I email because they have a high likelihood to unsubscribe ( and where should I try to reach them instead ) ? <p> How do you do that ? We now have tools that allow you to take data , even if it is siloed , and use it to make channel agnostic decisions . This technology should allow you to connect data that lives in multiple places in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to reach and engage with those audiences . You can then push those audiences back into the silos to take action . <h> History Repeats Itself : Silos Allow for Fast Results Once Again <p> Just as putting data into silos made it faster and easier to activate new use cases and channels back in the day , keeping those existing data silos in place makes it faster and easier to create a consistent experience today . <p> I know what you 're thinking that just does n't make sense . Afterall , how can you understand customer activities across channels if all of that data lives in different places ? But when you get down to it , the key to creating an optimal experience for customers is n't about viewing data , but making decisions and taking action based on that data . So if you can get the decisioning piece of the equation into a single place , your data silos can remain intact . And much like the situation that got us these silos in the first place , this solution allows you to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backend development effort than the alternative . 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

@@42338372 @2338372/ <h> By Cameron Lewis <p> Because product catalogs are complex and always changing , eCommerce brands usually drop prices on old merchandise when new merchandise is added to the site . Price Decrease- triggered emails are sent to shoppers who have previously completed abandonment actions for full-price products that are now discounted , and therefore are great- if your objective is to move discounted merchandise and expedite the process by giving shoppers who are already interested a heads up about the sale . These- emails essentially re-enter those shoppers into the sales funnel and give them a great incentive to purchase . If- you 're considering running a Price Decrease triggered email campaign , here are a few best practices to keep in mind . <h> 1 . Target only those who are already interested in the product <p> No marketer- wants to condition their customers to only purchase when products- are discounted .

By targeting this triggered email specifically to individuals who already viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days , Blue Nile- limits the Price Decrease- triggered email audience size to those it is only relevant to. - Blue Nile- and other Bluecore customers- drive sales through this type of precision targeting without the negative effects of batch and blast sends . Meaning , they can segment their subscriber list and target only those customers who are not likely to convert unless a promotional offer or Price- Decrease incentive is in place . Bluecore customers- are seeing an average of $3.80 in revenue per Price Decrease triggered- email . <h> 2 . Send immediately after the price changes- <p> In order for Price Decrease triggered emails to be effective , customers- should- be able to act on the notification and purchase the product at the discounted price . To do this successfully , Price Decrease triggered emails should be sent immediately after the price actually changes in your catalog . This gives your target customers prioritized access and will give them a sense of exclusivity . ( It also does n't  hurt to tell them they 're the first to know ) . <p> By detecting price changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform key customers that the price of a product has changed , resulting in an average open rate of 40.46%. <h> 3 .

@@42338378 @2338378/ <h> How-To7 Dos &amp; Donts of Triggered Email Template Design <p> December 14th , 2016 <h> By Natalie Dollinger <p> Designing triggered email templates presents a number of challenges to account for . Dynamic content , changing product recommendations and responsive design- are just some of the hurdles eCommerce email marketers deal with every day . Lucky for you , - we 've outlined our top best practice dos and donts- so you can be sure to design triggered email templates that are- both beautiful and effective . <h> 1 . DO- think of your template with- varying numbers of products <p> eCommerce emails can and should always vary in the number of products that are displayed , based on the type of email that is being sent or the type of products being recommended . Because of this , product grids are specifically built to allow for varying numbers of products . This allows for marketers to maintain a sufficient- email volume by sending promotions to customers- that viewed either one product or six . All of our layouts center when there are less than the desired number in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dynamic text on images <p> Although text overlays look great in some emails , it usually is n't worth the headache it causes. - Since background images and positioning properties are not available in most email clients , elements like this require complex slicing , dicing and fancy code work in tables that fall apart in mobile environments and create the dreaded QA nightmare . The only other option is to go outside of your email creation flow , use a tool like Photoshop or some other software to add text on top of your image , and reload it back into the email building tool . This process , however , is cumbersome , especially since you cant make any changes or updates . Its best to put function ahead of form here and avoid this practice . <h> 3 . DO keep personalized content above the fold <p> Bluecore emails have higher success rates in clickthrough and conversion for a good reason . They are personalized to the customer . If a customer opens an email and just sees a giant banner like any other newsletter , performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding the personalized- recommendations further down in the email . Put your best foot forward and display them- at the top to grab the customers attention . <h> 4 . DO NT hide desktop- content on mobile <p> Sometimes templates can- create very different mobile and desktop experiences by hiding desktop content- on mobile and hiding mobile content on desktop . There are a few reasons this is a bad practice . One is that many email clients , Gmail being the number one offender , clip an email that becomes to large . When there is a lot of hidden content in a template , hitting this limit becomes common and causes footer elements , such as unsubscribe links , to be clipped off taking away CAN-SPAM compliance . <p> The other reason for this is email forwarding . If a user forwards an email with hidden content , that content will no longer be hidden from the recipient , causing the email to appear broken to them . While we can never guarantee the fidelity of a forwarded email , we can be assured hidden content will break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only element we recommend hiding in mobile is the desktop navigation at the top of the templateand moving this to a list format at the bottom of the template for mobile . This is standard practice and the only real necessity in terms of cross-device support . <h> 5 . DO always include related products <p> Related products- are secondary products- that are related in some way to the primary input products . These commonly appear as something like " You May Also Like " or " Our Best Sellers . " These are best placed in a second section below the primary input products- as they have- slightly less relevance to the customer , but could be of interest to them based upon the products- interacted with- above . <h> 6 . DO NT use custom fonts stacks <p> There are many special considerations when it comes to typography in emails . Although it may be tempting , marketers should avoid using custom fonts . Custom font stacks are not currently supported by the most popular email clients , so it is important to design all dynamic- text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non web-safe font , it simply wont- show up correctly on most computers or browsers . Its just like- downloading a PowerPoint that uses a font your computer does n't  have installed " - it changes the font to something else outside of your control , and generally looks pretty bad . Web-safe fonts marketers should use- include Arial Black , Lucinda Grande , Tahoma , Trebuchet , Verdana , Georgia , Palatino , Times New Roman , Courier New , Courier and Impact . <h> 7 . DO design to support retina displays- <p> With the rise of retina displays in the most popular devices , it is recommended that marketers- design in such a way as to support this without imagery becoming fuzzy . The best way to do this is to double the size of all design assets and allow for- resizing these to fit the 600px maximum . So a template intended to be 600px wide should be designed at 1200 px and a mobile template intended to be 320px should be designed at 640px . This will allow you- to build templates that maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

@@42338388 @2338388/ <h> By Liz Bedor <p> Imagine yourself window shopping . You 're not particularly interested in buying anything at the moment , just taking a look to see what 's out there . Then you walk- into a store . You browse the selection of items , picking up a few as you go and carrying them around as you continue to look . Once you 've done a lap of the store , you go try the items on . Some work , some do n't  . After you 've finished , you take a look at what you liked . Keeping in mind you originally werent interested in buying anything , you 're now finding it difficult to put any of it back . Has this ever happened to you ? You 're not the only one . <p> In 2014 , UCLA conducted a study to find out- if- touching an object influenced a shoppers- perception of it . The research- found that a shoppers feeling of attachment increased after even merely touching an object . They feel as if they own it and value it more highly than if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , this makes sense . It explains why the traditional layout of so many retail stores place dressing rooms and registers tucked away in the back . It forces you- to carry items as you walk through- the store . But how does this behavior and influence transfer online ? Are you more likely to buy something the more times you touch or in this case view it ? <p> We set out to answer this question by- exploring data from over 250- of Bluecores eCommerce brands- which collectively- experience over 380 million product views- per month . We analyzed purchases that occurred within 30 days of an initial product view to determine which number of views resulted in the highest conversion rate . Heres what we found : <h> Overall conversion rate decreases as price increases , until $5,000- <p> We began dissecting this information by looking at overall conversion rates by price . Before seeing the results , we expected to see conversion rates decrease as prices increased . We figured the larger the price point , the more important the purchase , and the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially within 30 days . Our data mostly supported this theory , but unexpectedly only until $5,000 . Purchases above $5,000 saw an increase in conversions ( albeit minimal ) from 1.32% to 1.66% . Even more surprising is the significant increase in conversion rate at the $10,000 price point . From the $5,000 $10,000 range at 1.66% , the $10,000+ conversion rate jumps almost two percentages to 3.45% . <h> Average eCommerce Conversion Rate by Price <p> According to a 2014 study by Epsilon , 57.5% of luxury spenders are actually male , which is important to consider because men and women shop very differently . Women are generally more selective and shop around before making a purchase , whereas men seldom compare prices and would prefer to buy a less than ideal product than continue to shop- around. - According to another study by iProspect , 70% of affluent males regularly shop online . So in general , luxury shoppers are more likely to be men , more likely to shop online and more- likely looking to actually buy versus just- shop around . This could be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases . <h> A single- view has lowest conversion rate across all price points- <p> The next step was to break down the conversion rates to see how they differed by number of views at each price point . Across the board , we saw that no price point had the highest conversion rate after only one view . We were actually surprised to see this behavior at the lower price points , especially for items under $10 , thinking these- would be a " one and done " purchases . What 's more surprising is how significantly lower the- conversion rate was at one view compared to two . For items between $0 $500 the difference in conversion rates between one view and two averaged to about 3% . <h> Average Conversion Rate by Price &amp; Number of Views <p> Interestingly , buyers at a less than $10 price point and over $10,000 have similar online shopping habits . For both groups , the highest chance of conversion occurs at two views and drops significantly at four views or more . There are a few reasons why this could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a necessity item , such as toiletries , or a small add on accessory . It may justify minimal comparison shopping , but at the end of the day , the shopper likely wont dwell on whether or not they can afford or justify the purchase . On the opposite end of the spectrum , we previously mentioned that luxury buyers at the $10,000+ price point are likely online shopping with the intention to- actually buy versus browse . Regardless , it is interesting to see such similar behavior at either end of an extreme ( and expensive ) spectrum . <h> Under $10 &amp;- over $10,000 Conversion Rates <h> 3- views has highest conversion for purchases between $10-$500 <p> Shoppers making purchases that fall between $10 and $500 also shop very similarly , which is more expected . For these buyers , three views results in the highest chance for a conversion and only drops slightly at four or more views . Although an- online shopper- viewing a product three or more times- within 30 days certainly shows intent to purchase , - it also may signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4- views has highest conversion for purchases between $500-$10,000 <p> Finally , shoppers making purchases between $500 and $10,000 are most likely to buy after viewing products four or more times ( although it is worth noting that conversion rates for three and four views of- purchases between $1,000 and $5,000 only see a minimal difference of 0.01% ) . - - Based on this behavior , shoppers at these- price points do not fall into the uber luxury category we 've depicted earlier . These shoppers are likely purchasing something they consider an important investment and thus want to ensure they make the right selection . <h> Between $500 $10,000 Conversion Rates <h> Customize marketing messages for optimal views at- each- price point- <p> Whether these- viewing and purchasing behaviors surprise you or not , its important to understand when your optimal chance for conversion is at each price point to deliver the right marketing message accordingly . For example , its more appropriate to send a shopper making a $5 purchase a more urgent message after one view , since you know your highest chance to convert them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shopper making a $700 purchase will require a more gentle sell with four or more- touch points . Particularly when it comes to a marketing tactic like triggered email , its important to understand how many touches will result in your highest chance of conversion at- each price point . To do this : <p> Look at the various price points your products fall within <p> Analyze the different purchase sizes your shoppers make <p> Segment your shoppers- into separate audiences and market to them accordingly with- the appropriate number of touches and messages by price point <p> Knowing this will enable you to customize your strategy for each customer and give your marketing program the best revenue potential . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

But when you think about how people use their phones , shrinking everything does n't really make sense . <p> People- do n't  expect all content- to fit within one snapshot on their phone- screen . Instead , they expect to scroll . Because- were- all- used to scrolling in apps ( like Facebook and Instagram ) , email is no different . Scrolling is n't a hassle , its simply how we navigate on our phones . <p> Although a- recent- study from Boomerang- claims the optimal length of an email is between 50 and 125 words , a typical email from the theSkimm is between 800 and 1,000 words . Granted , one could argue that promotional emails- will naturally be shorter than newsletters due to their purpose , the Madewell example below shows how both types of emails can be lengthy and still impactful . <p> On the right , a Thanksgiving promotional email from Madewell showcases various outfits for the holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is still lengthy and requires the reader to scroll almost the length of a full newsletter from theSkimm . Allowing the email to be lengthy lets- Madewell tell a complete story instead of simply showing four small images of outfits . <h> Have a Voice <p> Retail is a visually-driven industry , and always has been . Since- retailers- are selling tangible products , it makes sense for them to lead with imagery . However- because of this , most retailers have a distinct " look , " but not many have a unique " voice " or tone . <p> This is an interesting phenomenon , because tone has always been important in marketing and branding . Tone is expressing personality through vocabulary and its how your brand should make- people feel when they read what you 're saying . But since many retail brands have focused so much attention on imagery , their tones have defaulted to become- generic , - with copy- such as , " New Arrivals For You . " <p> Unlike most retail marketing emails , theSkimms are- almost completely void of imagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lean on visuals as a crutch to communicate its brand . theSkimms tone is the brand . <p> Let 's take a look at an example . The headlines- below both cover the same story of Snapchat filing to- IPO . One headline is from theSkimm and one is from The New York Times : <h> Headline #1 <p> " What to say to your friend who overuses the flower crown filter " <h> Headline #2 <p> For marketers- thinking about their companys tone , consider what the- brand represents . For example , compare a brand like Calvin Klein to a brand like Tommy Hilfiger . Calvin Kleins- style and branding is , " provocative , modern , sensual and iconic . " Tommy Hilfigers branding is classic- " preppy with a twist " American fashion . The two brands could- arguably be targeting a similar demographic , but the tone they use to represent themselves is- very different . <h> Put Social Sharing Front &amp; Center <p> Finally , just because theSkimm engages their- audience through email , that- does n't  mean they do n't  want to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than most other marketers is- how- their- audience uses email and how they use social media . <p> Their target demographic- is happy to receive content from a brand through email , but they typically share content with friends through social media . Because of this , theSkimm delivers its content via email and heavily optimizes it for social sharing . <p> The takeaway here is that email marketing will continue to evolve , so best practices that were true a year ago , may not necessarily still apply- today . Do n't  be afraid to innovate , test and try new things in your emails . If anything , rejecting- industry norms can- differentiate your brand and make your marketing stand out even more . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

In addition to this , brands should also seek to understand- how consumers , of all ages , actually use email . Do younger generations use different email providers than older generations ? Which device do consumers primarily use to check their email ? Does that differ throughout age groups ? If so , by how much ? <p> Our- same study dove a bit deeper to answer these questions in order for brands to deliver a better email experience for all audiences . Heres what we found : <h> Gmail- is the provider of choice , especially for Millennials &amp; Gen Z <p> When looking at preferred email providers , Gmail reigns as the most popular choice across generations . What 's more interesting is how drastically Gmails- marketshare increases as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Gmail , adoption increases only slightly for Generation X ( 39% ) , then jumps 22% for Millennials ( 61% ) then finally peaks with- Generation Z at 70% . <p> Strong Gmail adoption for younger generations likely has to do with what- the email landscape looked like when these consumers- joined the market . When Baby Boomer and Generation X consumers began using email , most- providers were legitimate contestants in the race for marketshare . But year after year , Gmail continued to innovate while others lagged behind . This trend ultimately positioned Gmail- as the thought-leader of the space , and adoption followed . By the time- Millennial and Generation Z consumers were old enough to join- the email- market , Gmail had established itself as the obvious provider of choice , which is reflected in its popularity today . <h> What provider do you use for your personal email ? <h> Consumers check their email on the go with- smartphones <p> When we look at which devices consumers are using to access- their messages , not surprisingly , we find that- email- is largely being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true for all demographics . More than half ( 53% ) of all consumers say their smartphone is the primary device on which they check email , which increases when taking a look at today 's younger audiences : 67% of Generation Z and 59% of Millennials report using their smartphone for email . On average , consumers ' second option for reading email is a laptop ( 24% ) and third is a desktop ( 18% ) . Interestingly , tablets lag behind at only 6% . <h> What device do you primarily use to check your personal email ? <h> What should brands do with this information ? <p> Clearly , based on these results , mobile- is probably- how your audience will be consuming your email content . At a fundamental level , brands should always make sure emails are responsive and optimized for a mobile experience , especially with- Gmail . Tools like Litmus are great resources to ensure this consistency for all your email- communications . But that 's just the beginning of what brands can and should do . <p> Take the experience a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not just about the online experience " email is a great forum to leverage and invite cross-channel engagement , such as promoting- in-store tech uses , barcode scanning and mobile-only deals .

Because theyre- early adopters of new- technologies and channels , they can be a difficult demographic for brands to keep up with. - Although every few years , a new social channel manifests claiming to be the new way to connect with younger generations , a recent study- by Bluecore and NAPCO Research- has found that most of these consumers do n't  actually turn to social channels to learn about new products from brands . Instead , they- use social channels- as a place to connect with family and friends . Melissa Bell , Vice President of Vox Media explains , " At the end of the day , social media- is- a- place where people want to share things that matter to them , whether its a news story or their child walking .

Using data to predict actions and preferences would enable marketers to know when to speak to which customers , identify who is important and who is n't and understand who needs marketing and who wants to be left alone . But its more complicated than that . <p> Historically , data to inform predictive marketing has either been siloed or incredibly difficult to gather . These hurdles have resulted in lower sales , more unsubscribes , missed opportunities and wasted discounts . Perhaps the most frustrating part of the whole challenge is that psychologically , marketers have an intuitive strategic understanding of what they want to do and how they want to do it , but they do n't know exactly who to talk to in these cases . <p> From the very beginning , it has been Bluecores mission to make it easy for marketers to leverage customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers should n't take a team of data scientists and weeks of analysis . Weve been working hard to give our partners access to all of the audiences they always wished they had , and as a result , were excited to introduce our Audience Builder , allowing marketers to turn customer data into actionable insights and predictions . <p> So what can marketers do with this data ? In short , answer previously unanswerable questions and improve your marketing ROI . <h> 1 . Predict Customer Churn <p> While growing a customer base is incredibly important , keeping the customers you already have is arguably more important to a companys success . Regardless of industry , new customers cost something to acquire , whether it be outbound marketing or field sales . If your business only focuses on generating new customers and neglects the ones you have , you will be left constantly treading water and never experience growth . <p> So what if you could tell who is about to stop buying from your brand ?

Predict and Grow Customer Lifetime Value <p> Have you ever been prepared to purchase something at full price and then are pleasantly surprised to receive a discount code ? You are a retailer 's worst nightmare . Every year , brands forfeit hundreds of thousands of dollars by awarding discounts to shoppers who would still purchase items full price . By understanding which of your customers would buy from you without a discount , marketers are able to spare themselves from throwing away their margins . <p> Taking that one step further , marketers can also better understand discount shoppers in order to provide them with markdowns that mean something to them and will spark action . For example , offer at-risk shoppers a large discount , but not your active repeat buyers . On the flipside , a retailer may actually find it more beneficial to offer discounts to customers with a higher predicted lifetime value , because over time they will spend much more with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the most valuable aspect of predictive data in email marketing is to anticipate customers actions in regards to how they engage with your brand . Although there are certainly trends reporting how people of different ages and demographics prefer to receive communications from brands , customers are individuals with unique behaviors . Understanding an individual 's propensity to open , click or unsubscribe from an email , or engage with advertisements and push notification can mean the difference between them turning into a loyal customer or opting out of your brand 's communications forever . Identify these customers before the point of no return , fight email fatigue , and engage customers in the channel that they most prefer . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

It 's always important for marketers to understand that marketing should n't always be about best practices , but about testing and discovering new methods that push the envelope . <p> For retail email marketers , the holidays mean an influx of new products , sales , and a lack of sleep that would terrify most people . Today we want to focus on New Product Arrival emails for the holiday season , and how experimentation can help improve their effectiveness . <p> We 've outlined three strategies for new arrivals emails below that you can test in the coming weeks . <h> Wrap New Products In An Editorial Bow <p> Sur La Tables Live Segments emails show how reimagining the content of triggered emails can improve their effectiveness . <p> Let 's start with a reimagining of the structure and content of New Product Arrivals emails . <p> Bluecore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send thousands of personalized emails like these each week to a segment of customers who have recently viewed recipes on their site . The emails include links to recipes customers have viewed as well as links to products needed to create that meal . This is email nirvana highly targeted , highly personalized emails distributed at high-volume . <p> To take it a step further , imagine if Sur La Table sent emails like these to customers who view recipes regularly , but use only holiday-themed recipes . They could use these emails to sell new products that will help make holiday parties a smashing success by targeting the customers that will be interested in their editorial content . <h> Give Last Year 's Seasonal Shoppers a Holiday Gift Reminder <p> Embroidery Online will regularly use New Arrivals emails to tell customers that browse their patches that new ones have arrived . <p> Retaining recently active shoppers is n't nearly as challenging as those that have n't returned since the last holiday season . <p> When it comes to seasonal inventory and holiday-themed products , new arrivals emails are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases this holiday season . <p> Take a look at this New Arrivals email from our partner Embroidery Online . It shows several new patches they added to their inventory , and customers who browsed similar patches received the email . <p> With tools like Live Segments , retailers can target shoppers from last year 's holiday season with New Arrivals emails focused on seasonal products targeted to their preferences . Sure , sending an email about your latest collection of snowmen and candy cane patches to customers who have been browsing in the past 30 days will lead to some conversions . But what about the customers you already know are interested in these products , the customers who purchased similar ones last year ? <p> Customers who bought similar patches last holiday season will likely be interested in similar products this year . Bluecore partners in the Specialty retail vertical see an average click-through rate of 5.6% . While this is great performance for the industry , by changing the way New Product Arrival emails are approached could create impressive improvements in the industry . <h> Go Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't want retailers to just think of new customers they can target with these emails , or even new times to send them . We want to completely revolutionize the way New Arrivals emails are customized to customer preferences and behaviors . <p> For example , this New Arrivals email from Indochino focuses on a customer who browsed ties and suits recently and recommends new products in those categories . <p> This type of email is incredibly effective at producing conversions , but why only recommend based on browsing behavior ? You have access to customer browsing and purchase data that can illuminate new ways to reach your customers . <p> Instead of recommending new arrivals based on what customers have previously browsed , cross-sell new products based on what they 've purchased . If a customer purchased a three piece suit and you have a shipment of new ties , use emails to show the customer new ties that pair well with their suit . <p> Imagine how much more revenue-per-email apparel retailers would get with emails like this . With our partners in the Apparel industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email , the gains would definitely be worthwhile . <p> Look , these are just three ideas that I came up with for rethinking how retailers use New Arrivals emails in an afternoon of thinking and caffeine-binging . Imagine what you could do with your entire team of merchandisers an email marketers . <p> It 's like the lesson we learned from the FirstMark Marketing Summit : marketing should n't always be about best practices , it should be about experimentation . Go change the way your emails reach your customers , and you may just develop better brand relationships than you ever thought possible . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

According to Quartz , although the first unit wont be shipped until 2018 , about 50,000 people have already registered to be notified when pre-orders begin in 2017 . Sounds crazy , right ? For todays consumers , - it actually is n't . <h> Todays families are money-rich and time-poor <p> In 2015 , Pew Research Center conducted a survey- of- 1,807 U.S. parents with children younger than 18 . The study aimed gain insight into- how households with working parents share the load of doing chores , raising children , etc . Not surprisingly , the- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the- past several decades . The share of two-parent households in which both parents work full-time now stands at 46% , up from 31% in 1970. - The median household income for families with two full-time working parents and at least one child under 18 at home is $102,400 , compared with $84,000 for households where the father works full-time and the mother works part-time and $55,000 for households where the father works full-time and the mother is not employed . <p> While the extra $50,000 for two-parent households provides the comfort and stability , it comes at a cost ; and that cost is time . According to the same study , - four-in-ten full-time working moms always feel rushed. - So what does a family with extra income and little time need to purchase ? - Well , more time. - <h> How much is your time really worth ? <p> A- recent article- by behavioral science journalist , James Clear , asks readers , - " How much is your time really worth ? " According to Clear , not all uses of time are equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . For example , should you buy a nonstop flight and save two hours or get the flight with a stopover and save $90 ? Clear states that everyone has an hourly value , but very few people can actually tell you what that number is . While he takes a very black and white standpoint on the economics and value of time , there is something to be said for this way of thinking . For- households- with two working parents , free time is precious . Does it make economic sense for them- to spend that free time doing household chores or should they- outsource it to a product or service at a lower cost ? - <p> To find your hourly value , you need- to know the amount of time you spend earning money and the amount of money you earn during that time . As a baseline , - Clear recommends estimating you spend- 2,500 hours per year earning money . Going back to Pews Research Centers study , let 's find- the value of the additional $50,000 per year earned by a- second working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour. - ( Clears article instructs you to deduct taxes , but well stick with $20 for the sake of simplicity ) . <p> Now let 's get- back to the $850 FoldiMate- robot . <p> Assume- folding laundry takes 30 minutes of your time every week ( not far-fetched for a family of at least three people ) . That 's 26- hours per year . <p> Assuming FoldiMate is making a quality product , we can hope its- robot will- be our- trusty laundry-folding companion for at least 5 years . Over that same period of time , youd spend 130- hours , or 5.42- days- of folding laundry . <p> But with- the FoldiMate , you could- buy that time back for $6.54 per hour. - <p> If youre- someone who hates folding- laundry , that probably sounds like a- " shut up and take my money " price . <h> Time is in demand <p> If we look at the marketplace today , products and services- are popping up everywhere- that allow people to essentially buy back their time . Blue Apron caters to those who want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find new recipes and go to the grocery store . Glamsquad delivers professional beauty services to your- home , office , hotel or wherever you may be . Trunk Club- was specifically created for executives who value time more than money- ( and probably- also simply hate shopping ) . Even a recent consumer trends study by Euromonitor International argues that the rise of- athleisure- is partially a result of time-constrained- professionals saying , " Athleisure- can be seen on the way to and at work , sparing workers the need to carry extra gym outfits to the office . " <h> How will your brand provide- the supply ? <p> Although not every existing business model caters to this trend , supplemental services and even seamless user experiences can essentially supply the- time people need , making your products more attractive to todays consumers . Many grocery stores , for example , have now created delivery services to compete with the takeout alternative , - Seamless. - For the consumers- who- always feel rushed , time is in demand and businesses need to come up with products and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right product or supplemental service for your industry , your business too may generate a 50,000 waitlist for pre-order . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

@@42338425 @2338425/ <h> By Sarah Cascone <p> A few weeks ago , - we announced- Bluecore 's 2nd Annual Explore Summit , an invite-only , one-day gathering of senior-level digital marketers taking place in New York City on September 15th . As we get closer to the event , were excited to share- our second keynote speaker , - Kit Yarrow , Ph.D. , an award-winning consumer research psychologist , professor , author and consultant . Kit 's unique ability to apply clinical psychology to business issues has won her four endowed research professorships and recognition as the 2012 Outstanding Scholar of Golden Gate University . <p> In her keynote presentation , Yarrow will discuss how the use of technology has changed the psychology of consumers and what that means for marketers . <p> As a preview to her keynote , here are a few of many great- insights- from Yarrow <p> On our- individualistic society : - People are less motivated by what other people have today than they have been in the past . For the first time ever , they want to be the one to discover something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's this craving to be unique . Were less motivated by " Keeping up with the Joneses " than we are the treasure hunt of finding something special . Were a much more individualistic society than collectivistic . Standing out through having something unique is getting to be a much more effective way to tapping into consumer needs than telling them , " Everybody else has this so you should too . " ( From Ethan Bearman ) <p> On guilt : - There are a lot of things we get from- shopping and buying that we like to guilt ourselves for. - Wanting things is absolutely normal- and healthy . If we go back to caveman days , we find that trading in the marketplace was a favored activity and that mummies are- buried with products . People have always enjoyed products , so in some ways , nothing has changed . <p> On lingering- effects of the recession : - The recession taught people that if they wait , - they can win the game of chicken with retailers . There 's always been this , " Whos going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there long enough until retailers really slash those prices ? All that collapsed during the recession and retailers pretty much gave up and started giving consumers big bargains . That changed the psychology of purchasing and made consumers really feel like they deserved a big discount . <p> On consumer trust : Consumers do n't  trust organizations . Consumers rely on other consumers- to understand if something- is believable- or if a product is worth having . They 're using social media , using ratings and- reviews , using YouTube channels . They 're using all of these ways of learning about products through people they perceive to be like them rather than through push messaging . Companies buying ads saying " This is what our product is all about . Please believe us and buy it " does n't  work anymore . Today what 's more effective is when people learn about products from their friends or people they perceive to be like them . Hearing those voices through digital communication has become a primary way for consumers to come to trust and want products . <p> On consumer- satisfaction : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have even worn yet , or that they wear really infrequently . A lot of times its something they got on sale . Once the thrill of getting it at a cheap price wears off , they realize that it does n't  really fit in with their lifestyle , or maybe they did n't  really like it that much , so they buy more . Part of it is that they 're never really satisfied because they did n't  get exactly what they wanted , so they keep shopping , looking for the right thing . But the other part of it is that a lot of times they 're just looking for that feeling of the win again and they 're more focused on how much money they 're saving than how much money they 're spending . ( From CreditCards.com ) <p> On- holiday shopping : Consumers do spend a lot during the holiday season , and its for a couple of reasons . Its kind of a huge time of the year for self-gifting , and that 's because consumers have been trained in the past few years to anticipate big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for themselves until they feel like they 're getting the best variety and the best prices of the year . I think people also just cant resist some of the doorbuster deals and the frenzy feeling of shopping that comes along with the holidays . Retailers have really become- very masterful at- offering up discounts that feel very enticing to consumers and the temptation is just more than a lot of people can handle . 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866 
@@42338426 @2338426/ <h> StrategyDo Triggered Email Benchmarks Differ by Price Point ? <p> August 8th , 2016 <h> By Liz Bedor <p> Without a doubt , the most common request we receive from- email- marketers is- for- triggered email marketing benchmarks . While it is certainly important to benchmark your program against industry standards , doing so- can sometimes result in comparing apples to oranges . <p> eCommerce- marketers market- products that fall within- an incredibly wide range of price points and order values . Consumers- looking to make a $100 purchase and consumers- looking to make a $10,000 purchase shop differently , and as a result , may respond just as differently to triggered emails . <p> Bluecore 's customer base reflects this wide spectrum . We send triggered emails for retailers with products that range from dish towels to diamonds and target- shoppers- who- range from- making purchases weekly to annually . In an effort to- improve- benchmark accuracy ( and offer apple-to-apple comparisons ) , we decided to break down triggered email benchmarks by average order value . <p> To do this , we- pulled data from over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of triggered emails per year . We found- the average order value by dividing a customers total- triggered email attributed revenue by the total number of conversions over- a full year of data . As an example , if a customer had $1,000 of attributed revenue from- 10 conversions , the average order value- would be $100 . Here 's what we found : <h> Larger Order Values- Have- Highest Revenue Per Email <p> Starting with probably- the most obvious insight , we found that retailers with larger average order values- overwhelmingly have a much higher revenue per email . The consistent correlation between the- increase in average revenue per email with the- increase in average order value highlights the importance of segmenting out triggered email benchmark metrics this way . Just imagine the discouragement if retailers with an average order value- of $25 compared their average revenue per email to- retailers in the- $1,000+ order value range. - <h> Average revenue per email by order value <h> - Larger Order Values- Also Have Highest- Unsubscribe Rate <p> Sometimes you ca n't have the yin without the yang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue per email by significant margin , it also sees the highest unsubscribe rate . Because of this , retailers with large average order values need to be particularly careful when they think about how many marketing touches a shopper will receive throughout the purchase funnel . <h> Average unsubscribe rate- by order value <h> Large Order Values- Have Highest Average Open Rate and Click Rate <p> Generally speaking , open rates and click rates tend to improve as order value- increases. - This could be due to a number of reasons . Larger orders typically have longer sales cycles as they warrant more thought and consideration prior to- purchase . Shoppers in this price range are more likely to do comparison shopping and view product pages a number of times . <h> Average click- rate- by order value <p> At the same time , - smaller purchases may fall into impulse or necessity categories . A $10 order could be an impulse accessory , like a headband , or a necessity , like socks . Because these order values- do n't  require much consideration , if the shopper decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise later on . For retailers that fall within these lower average order values , be sure to look at how many views will result in your highest chance for conversion to optimize your triggered email program accordingly . <h> Average open- rate- by order value <h> Conversion Metrics- Peak at $50 $100 Order Value- <p> Finally , when it comes to metrics that email marketers probably care about most , - conversion rates perform the strongest- within the $50 $100 order value . This may be due to the fact that orders- in the- $50 $100 range fall within a sweet spot between affordable- impulse or necessity purchases and expensive luxury or investment buys . These- mid range purchases require some consideration and- an additional triggered email touch is enough to push a conversion . <h> Average conversion- rate- by order value <p> Overall , conversion metrics seem to decrease- as order values increase . This could be because- the eligible audience who can afford to make the purchases- gets smaller and smaller as price tags gets bigger and bigger . It could also be due to these having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently . <h> Average click-to-conversion- rate- by order value <h> Benchmark Your Program by Order Value to Optimize Appropriately <p> Although every triggered email marketing program is different , benchmarking your program against retailers with similar average order values will help you gain more accurate insights into your programs performance . However regardless of where your program falls , - the best way to measure and optimize- your triggered email program is to measure against yourself and try to improve your metrics month over month .

@@42338428 @2338428/ <h> By Liz Bedor <p> In today 's marketplace , it 's imperative for small businesses to be able to compete head-to-head with enterprise brands . Despite having fewer resources and a fraction of the budget , consumers today expect the same level of personalized service and communication from small businesses as they do from massive retailers . <p> In order to do this , small businesses need to enlist the right marketing tools that drive high amounts of value without- adding organizational bandwidth constraints or complexity . <p> Zachys Wine + Liquor- has found a solution that does just that . Since 1944 , the family-owned business- has been offering one of the- most complete and exclusive- selections- of fine wine and spirits to collectors and enthusiasts around the world . The company has several divisions and services , including auctions and storage for rare and aged wine , as well as- a premium buying experience at- its brick and mortar location in Scarsdale Village , New York . <p> Looking to expand its online business , Zachys enlisted- Victor Castro- as its Director of- eCommerce . Within- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent 23% of the companys revenue and has seen 53% growth in the last 2 years . <p> We sat down with Victor to find out how he transformed Zachys with a- triggered email marketing program . <h> Tell me a little about your background . <p> I actually studied- engineering in college and that 's where I began my career . After a few years in that field , I transitioned into product development and consulting work for eCommerce brands . That provided me with a lot of eCommerce and user experience expertise so then when I transitioned to eCommerce and marketing , it was pretty organic . <p> Before I joined Zachys , the Director of eCommerce position did n't  exist . There were a lot of things with their eCommerce business that werent necessarily up to best practice so I saw- a lot of opportunity . The product is obviously interesting as well , so I was excited to join . <h> How big is your marketing team and how is it structured ? <p> Our digital marketing department consists of five people , including myself . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including email templates , website user experience , banner ads , etc . Our social media manager takes care of all our social accounts , and some PR and events , such as in-store wine tasting and things like that . Our eCommerce project manager handles big initiatives- like implementations of new systems , such as- a new ESP . - We also have an eCommerce coordinator who helps with day-to-day operations and content . Then there 's me , - I oversee all the strategy , manage partners and budgets , and help my team roll out projects and manage priorities . - - <h> What was your email marketing program like prior to triggers ? What kind of communications did you send ? <p> Zachys- really prides itself- on service and having a strong relationship with our customers , so our email marketing has traditionally been- very high touch- with a smaller- database of contacts . On average , we send 2-3 hyper-segmented emails a day , with 95% of those being product pitches and the rest are in-store tasting events . <h> Why did you decide to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our- ESP . When I joined Zachys , I knew I wanted to implement an email trigger program , but doing so- through Silverpop was really complicated . It required a lot of planning , a complex IT integration and ongoing maintenance <p> I knew we were missing opportunities to- recapture the traffic we had been- working so hard to develop . There was no follow up . Originally , I just wanted to send a welcome email trigger to new customers to introduce- the brand and explain what- kind of information they could expect to receive . The second trigger I wanted to do was an abandoned- cart , but that required way more integration in Silverpop. - I ended up with a long list of priorities , lacking the means of executing against it . <h> How did you hear about Bluecore ? <p> I actually heard about Bluecore from one of your existing customers , BCBG , at a conference . She was speaking about her program- at an event and- I thought it was really interesting . It all kind of snowballed from there . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most important to you during your evaluation ? <p> The biggest consideration for me was speed to launch- and ease of integration . It is a lot easier than most people would ever expect . Bluecore enabled us to launch multiple triggers with a single , comprehensive integration . That one-time setup launched every single trigger , even as we 've added more since our initial launch . No one believes its just adding a pixel but its actually true ! That was a big selling point. - <p> There was also the flexibility . Were unique in that our site is n't necessarily up to best practices in how we store and capture data . Bluecore had the flexibility in how it received data that worked for us . <h> What triggered emails did you initially decide to implement ? <p> Per the recommendation of Bluecore , we started the program with three email triggers : abandoned- search , abandoned cart and abandoned product . We originally just wanted to do abandoned cart but the other two were easy to add in . In retrospect I 'm really glad we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more email triggers to your program . Can you tell me about those ? <p> Zachys Back In Stock Triggered Email <p> The- in-stock trigger- is somewhat- unique to our business . Many times we - buy product ahead of of its release and sell it upfront , like a pre-order . Some people will buy wine- ahead of time because they know theyll get to drink it eventually . Some people wont buy wine- ahead of time though , so we use this trigger to alert that audience when its available and ready to ship . I suppose most- companies would use it as a " restock " trigger . <p> Zachys New Merchandise Triggered Email <p> The- new merchandise trigger- has really supplemented the premium service and selection- we pride ourselves on at Zachys . Traditionally we 've offered personalized- recommendations for- our customers through our sales associates. - Because this- trigger also generates personalized recommendations , it essentially- helps us replicate that premium- experience online . - Also typically before we buy a product , we have an idea of who we want to pitch it to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a timely manner . Now when a new product hits the system , Bluecore finds the people to sell it to . It- just complements our sales process perfectly . <p> Zachys Price Decrease Triggered Email <p> The- price decrease trigger- is basically an " on sale " play . It alerts people about things theyve looked at- before , but did n't  buy and are now at a lower price . The approach is very personalized , with the name of the product in the subject line and typically people recognize the name . In the past , putting things on sale did n't  really do anything organically , but now it does and we do n't have to use a mass email to announce it . <h> How has your email trigger program changed the way you work ? <p> To be honest , at first the organization was not convinced and hesitant , but- now its building trust. - We have shown great return so far , so we know its working . Actually because its working so well , we are considering cutting out a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so effective and efficient , were somewhat- transitioning to a quality over quantity strategy. - Calculating the exact direct return on investment- of each mass email can be difficult , but with triggers you know when and how well that specific email works . <p> The email triggers have- also added a ton of value to our prospecting efforts . In the past , if we prospected , customers would just get a generic email . Now getting someone- on site gives- them a much more relevant and personalized experience than it would otherwise , which is very powerful . <p> The really nice part is that because the Bluecore integration was a one-time setup for any trigger , we 've been able to grow and scale our program without any additional work . <h> Have you A/B tested the design of any of your emails ? If so , any key learnings ? <p> We actually have n't done this very well . The triggers worked so well out of the gate , we just worked on other things instead . Looking back , I wish we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were planning to do a- full re-haul of all our triggers- to fully optimize. - Even small things , like changing the tone in the copy , can be so powerful . Currently our copy is- pretty generic , so were bringing our brand voice out more . <h> How are you measuring success of your triggered email program ? <p> We really focus on revenue per email , and volume sent to keep an eye on the health of the program. - Our eCommerce business now accounts for 23% of our revenue and over the past 2.5 years we 've seen 54% cumulative growth . <h> Any surprising or unexpected results ? <p> Honestly that the- performance is so positive ! We knew the opportunity existed , but the performance was much higher than expected . It also highlighted other areas we could improve on . Now that the triggers kind of handle themselves , we can focus on some of those areas for improvement , such as driving more traffic to the site . <h> Do you have any plans to add more- types of email triggers ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To somewhat counter the- " price decrease " - trigger , were going to add a- " price increase " - trigger- that will let someone know when a product is about to go off-sale . Were also adding a- " brand affinity " trigger. - Some people always buy from the same producer , so this new trigger will alert them if that- producer- comes out with a new product , even if its not the type of wine they normally buy . For example , if you always buy Pinot Noir from the same producer , this will let you know if they came out with a new champagne . <p> Finally , and funny enough , - we actually never did the welcome series we originally planned ! - It does n't  have as high of a return , but I think its an important touch point with our customers and should improve our mass email performance , so were going to launch that now . <h> What are your other marketing priorities for 2016 ? <p> Prospecting new customers is definitely the top priority . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better when we have more fuel in the funnel . Were also revamping our paid search program . That will be a heavy push this year . <h> Any final pieces of advice ? <p> Always be looking to optimize the programs by doing more A/B testing . Leverage the ease of execution to try new things . Do n't  get complacent just because it works well . <p> Something that I 've realized recently is that not every trigger is the same and therefore we should n't measure them all the same . They all reach the customer at different points in their buying process. - What if the goal of one trigger is to create more traffic for a future trigger ? Theres kind of an endless sea of possibilities if you get creative with it . <p> Thank you so much for your insight , Victor ! <p> Also be sure to follow Victor on Twitter @vcastro to learn more about eCommerce small business marketing and- @Zachys for- wine industry news and insights . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

Whether this be finding a review from a third party site , seeking a better price from a competitor or asking a friend through social media , their options have ultimately broadened and as a result , the consumer has become much smarter . <p> In order to find both online and offline success with multichannel marketing , it is essential for your organization to diversify your messaging , visuals and product assortments while also testing a variety of other factors as they become relevant . Take the following tips into consideration as you focus your marketing campaigns to encompass a multichannel strategy . <h> Consider All Avenues When Marketing to the Needs of Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has focused on the importance of a strong digital or mobile presence , it is only one of the many factors to consider for your marketing efforts . With online retail sales continuing to grow , there is n't much of an argument against focusing your attention online . <p> However , multichannel marketing is about considering all customer interactions and aligning your marketing efforts with the needs of your audience consistently , no matter what channel they choose and focusing on only mobile marketing or digital strategies could mean that you 're missing out on several other marketing opportunities . <p> The brands that can seamlessly balance both their online and offline channels by creating a focused marketing plan , can effectively build a stronger multichannel campaign and have more control over the avenues that influence their customers . <p> For example , US fashion giant Nordstrom has highlighted many of their channels by incorporating a variety of marketing strategies , such as direct mailings , physical product catalogues , social media content production and mobile app campaigns , amongst others . This directly contributed to a 45.8% increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No.19 in the Internet Retailer Top 500 Guide ( 2015 ) . Many of these US multichannel giants , including Nordstrom , have capitalised on current marketing trends by expanding their online and social marketing efforts , yet have n't neglected to continue marketing their brand through more traditional avenues as well . In short , you 'll find that there is a lot for European eTailers to learn from their American counterparts . <p> While print advertising and newspaper circulars have recently been on the decline , for retailers that market to diverse audiences , these avenues can still influence customers to visit both physical and online stores and ultimately lead to purchases . By continuing to produce product catalogues and deliver newspaper circulars , Nordstrom has ensured not to alienate their existing customers that prefer to shop using those channels . <p> To differentiate your approach to multichannel marketing , you should consider the needs of your customers on each channel and how your brand should be aligning your messaging to meet the needs of both your customers and marketing goals . <p> This does n't necessarily mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel , build a mobile application , or publish on all social networks , it means that you should listen to your customers and conduct comprehensive market research to identify the channels that your audience prefers and ensure that you market a consistent message across those properties specifically . <h> Influencing Purchasing Decisions with a Consistent Experience <p> All of your company 's content , social messaging or advertising campaigns offer an opportunity for your customers to interact with your brand . Although this can often be a challenge , a consistent message that aligns your business and marketing goals is essential . <p> It 's also important to consider that a consistent customer experience goes well beyond your typical branding guidelines and design principles . Both your tone and marketing copy should be designed with your customer 's buyer journey in mind , and serve a consistent purpose to help your reach your marketing goals . <p> Nordstrom understands that their customers are likely to engage with their brand across many platforms and by adapting their marketing approach to accommodate the needs of a diverse audience , Nordstrom can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find most important when making a purchase . The idea here is that the customer recognises the look , feel and tone of Nordstrom 's messaging , wherever they are engaging with the brand , making it a familiar experience that will more likely drive the desired action from their marketing . <p> To put it succinctly , follow these tips to differentiate your approach to multichannel marketing : <p> Consider both online and offline channels where your customers can interact with your brand . <p> Manage a consistent marketing message over a mixture of these channels . <p> Ensure that each channel can help your audience through their buyer journey . <p> eTail Europe 2016 brings together 1,000 ecommerce directors , VPs , and C-level attendees from Europe 's biggest retail brands .

@@42338443 @2338443/ <h> Strategy4 Triggered Emails To Jump Start Your Behavioral Marketing <p> February 11th , 2015 <h> By Max Bennett <p> It 's a fact of life most consumers go to eCommerce sites and the majority of them do not end up purchasing on their first visit . However , not all is lost . Each visitor leaves behind a wealth of behavioral marketing data based on what products , categories or brands they view , what items they felt were worthy of adding to their Wishlist or Cart , and ultimately what items they purchase . The importance of leveraging this data can not be overstated ( we clearly believe so ) . How you take action on this data what separates the great marketer from the average one . The following four behavioral-based triggered emails leverage the most popular channel in your marketing mix to drive highly reliable conversion rates : <h> 1. - Window Shopping <p> Brick-and-mortar retailers have always utilized window shopping to drive sales , but eCommerce companies have had trouble taking advantage of the window shopping model . Traditional retail can identify window shoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions in order to curate products and deals to showcase to each customer . Although this type of customer service has been thought to be out of reach for online shopping , Bluecore brings this type of intimate and relevant shopping experience to eCommerce . By identifying products that customers have searched for , viewed , and purchased , Bluecore automatically surfaces the right products to customers who are window shopping on your site . <h> 2 . Cart Abandonment <p> Everyone talks about cart abandonments and yet only 16% of e-retailers send them , and a lot fewer maximize their effectiveness . According to Forrester Research , 75% of people who abandon a cart had the initial intention of purchasing ( the rest are simply saving for later consideration ) , implying a huge lost opportunity . The primary reason for abandonment is shipping costs ( 44% ) . Whereas only 25% of people abandon carts due to product costs . The other layer of complexity is that of those who will purchase , 72% do it within the first 12 hours of viewing a product . These two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following two features : ( 1 ) They are immediate and ( 2 ) they offer primarily shipping coupons . <h> 3. - Post Purchase with Related Products <p> Customers who have purchased from your site spend , on average , 3 to 5 times more than first-time purchasers . However , the likelihood of repeat purchasing falls dramatically after three months . This means that the three month period following a purchase is a highly critical period of time for e-retailers . Post Purchase emails curate both related , category top sellers and matching products for past customers while they are in the critical post purchase part of their engagement cycle . According to an advisor who ran triggered emails at Sears , their Post Purchase emails were easily one of their most profitable . <h> 4 . Dynamic Reactivation <p> One of the most frustrating activities for e-retailers is watching an email list go cold . These dead lists become trophies of lost opportunities . Do n't give up so soon ! - It is possible to algorithmically determine when a user is about to churn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer churn , we automatically empower a specific call to action ( such as a free shipping incentive ) to give the user a meaningful reason to come back to the site . <p> These are just some of the many ways that marketers can take advantage of on-site behavioral marketing data based on customer actions to power more effective email marketing . <p> Bluecore powers these four triggers and many more out-of-the-box . Meaning no data feeds no API to write to or any deep eCommerce platform integration required because we are built from the ground up to natively understand eCommerce semantics . Bluecore intelligently prioritizes the best email for an individual consumer so that more triggers result in better emails , and not necessarily more emails. 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

Mary Kate works with our amazingly talented team of Market Development Specialists to identify retailers that may benefit from Bluecores triggered email automation platform . <p> Learn- why this talented colleague- took the plunge into the world of startups and what she thinks about the constantly changing world of email marketing automation . <p> Where did you grow up ? <p> I grew up on Cape Cod in Massachusetts . <p> Did you go to a small school ? <p> Surprisingly not really . I graduated with almost 500 people . <p> Where did you attend college and what was your degree in ? <p> I attended Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina . My degree is in Business Administration and Marketing . <p> First job out of college ? <p> I was actually a nanny for the first year after college . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was in Cape Cod for the summer between Junior and Senior year and ended up getting a part time job as a nanny for three kids . At the end of summer the year I graduated the parents asked me to stay on as their nanny near Boston while the kids were in school . <p> What was next ? <p> I decided that it was time for a change and moved to New York City . I did n't have a job , but all of my friends were here . A good friend of mine introduced me to an event planner at the Brick Women 's Association . I ended up working there as an Events Assistant for seven months before deciding to find a position on a team with more people . <p> What made you focus your job search on startups/how did you find Bluecore ? <p> After the Brick Women 's Association I was referred to RichRelevance by a friend of mine and transitioned there to work in Market Development . They still consider themselves a startup despite being around for about 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being part of a larger , more collaborative team . <p> How did you end up in market development ? <p> When I started at RichRelevance I was working in market development . I really had no idea what I was getting myself into moving to a technology company . I went to school for marketing , so it was pretty easy to pick things up . By the time I moved on to Bluecore I had a great handle on the tech startup space and was able to pick up things quickly and dive right into important issues . <p> How did you discover Bluecore and select them over other opportunities ? <p> When I was looking at potential opportunities in the tech startup arena I realized I had a friend who knew someone working at Bluecore . I talked to them about the company and heard nothing but great things about the culture and what we do here at Bluecore . After applying for a position in market development and meeting the team in person I fell in love with it and could n't wait to get started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluecore so far ? <p> I 'd have to say it was becoming the lead for the Market Development Representative ( MDR ) team . I tried my hardest from day one to gain an understanding of our client base and how we solved their pain points when it came to email marketing automation . After about five months I was named team lead for the Market Development Representatives and really felt like I could accomplish a lot with my teammates . I 've never had to be a group leader in the workplace before so I 'm really thankful for the incredible growth opportunities that I 've found here at Bluecore . <p> What makes you skip up the stairs to work each morning ? <p> Well , first of all I do n't skip up any stairs because I 'm in the dungeon on the bottom floor . <p> ( Editor 's note : To clarify , it is n't an actual dungeon . The Sales and MDR teams moved to the first floor of our new office to make space for the expanding Engineering and Client Success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> Honestly we have an incredible team here at Bluecore and our leadership through Gavin is phenomenal . I also really like the workspace that we have . It 's very open and we 're always talking about new ideas for our roles while having a good time . Everyone is also really hard working and driven , so it 's a huge motivator to be around people dedicated to the same goals . <p> So the Sales and MDR teams are well-known for playing music in the afternoons while everyone works . What 's your favorite song that the Sales and MDR teams play in the afternoons ? <p> It would have to be one of the songs from the Lion King soundtrack . Completely ridiculous , but really motivating . I also really like our Alesso playlist . It always pumps me up ! <p> Best memory of Bluecore ? <p> Probably the Bluecore Booze Cruise we had to celebrate the Sales team meeting its goal in the last quarter of 2014 . Something about people drinking bottomless mimosas on a boat in the rain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's really great to have friends from work you can hang out with after hours , it makes it really easy to become a part of the team . <p> How has your experience with email marketing evolved since your time at Bluecore ? <p> I really did n't have very much experience with email marketing before working at RichRelevance . Out of the six or so products RichRelevance has , only one is related to email marketing . <p> Since moving to Bluecore I 've really learned everything I could possibly imagine about email marketing . There 's so much to find out about it and I try to learn as much as I can . <p> For any folks out there interested in joining the MDR team at Bluecore . Give us the pitch ? Why should they join ? <p> First off , the company is amazing , from the team themselves to the product . The MDR team is a group of young , intelligent and also hilarious members who joined to start or continue their career in Sales . At the pace this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity across many different fields . This role is great to get your foot in the door and be a part of a great success story . <p> What do you think is the biggest misconception about email marketing ? <p> Before I worked at Bluecore I was constantly getting all these emails from websites I 'd shopped at , but I did n't know why I was getting them . I did n't really understand the data that was behind the emails and how much targeting companies can do with customer segmentation based on our browse behavior . I think that many companies do n't know exactly how much they can do with the information they already have . <p> Dream job outside of triggered marketing automation ? <p> I 'm obsessed with fashion . I would love to own my own brand of designer clothing , but I ca n't draw and it will probably never happen . I also really want to work for myself one day . <p> Secret talent that most people do n't know you possess ? <p> Well , I ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play the piano really well . I took lessons for five years when I was younger . I can still play a little bit , but not as well as I used to be able to . 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

@@42338448 @2338448/ <h> By Cameron Lewis <p> When we here at Bluecore took a look at the levels of customer abandonment and disengagement across over 100 of our retail partners , we found something pretty amazing . An astonishing 47.71% of customers who abandon retailers ' sites at any point will not return within 14 days . <p> That 's nearly half of your customers who are leaving with no intention of re-engaging with your brand . So now that I 've broken that awful news I have an important question for you , what the hell are you doing about it ? <p> How are you addressing this 47.71% of customers who just leave ? Triggered emails can help , but sometimes a timely search abandonment or product abandonment email wo n't get the job done . Before you know it , a customer has n't been back to your site in six or seven weeks . So how do you bring them back ? <p> Enter Product Notification triggered emails . It 's important for retailers to develop alternative strategies to bring these lost customers back into the purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this . <p> Product Notification triggers , which combine knowledge of customer browsing data with significant product catalog changes , are able to produce personalized messages for customers that notify them of everything from price decreases and low inventory to back-in-stock items . These emails , which are a powerful way to extend the customer shopping experience , have a proven ability to return customers who have become disengaged to the customer journey . They enable retailers to extract additional revenue from customers they may have lost permanently otherwise . <p> The customer who received this email viewed the 2.31-Carat Radiant Cut Diamond that changed in price , but never made a purchase . By utilizing a product notification trigger that automatically detects price changes in their product catalog , Blue Nile is able to immediately inform potentially disengaged customers about this change and price . When this is done , customers will often come back and complete their purchase . <p> Not only can these emails effectively retarget customers who have n't returned to retailers ' sites for more than sixty days , they also can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at the table below . It shows that on average 50% of re-activated customers receive at least one more Bluecore email , and on average 4.5% convert over the two week period post re-activation . Additionally , converting customers will spend substantial amounts post re-activation . <p> Let 's take a look at the retargeting capabilities of these emails with the chart below , which shows the indexed values for audience size based on week since last visit across over 100 of our retail partners using product notification triggers . <p> By enabling retargeting for customers who have n't returned to the site in as long as three months , these emails are able to produce incremental revenue gains for retailers equivalent or greater than the value of their Abandoned Cart email programs . <p> Look , no retailer will be able to retain 100% of their customers . Even with triggered emails , retailers ca n't retain 100% of abandoning customers . But Product Notification triggers , by integrating up-to-date catalog data seamlessly with individual customer insights , can help retailers regain lost customers and further increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes a purchase . <p> If you 'd like to learn more about Product Notification emails and their incremental revenue generation potential , be sure to check our our 2015 Triggered Email Marketing Benchmark Report .

@@42338454 @2338454/ <h> TrendsKey Takeaways from the 2016 Triggered Email Benchmark Report <p> September 6th , 2016 <h> By Liz Bedor <p> Running a successful triggered email marketing program is no easy task . It takes proper testing , measurement , analysis and optimization in order to grow and scale a cohesive program. - But even with this dedication , marketers want to understand how their programs stack up against the rest of their industry . And so , were excited to announce- the- 2016 Triggered Email Benchmark Report . Leveraging data from more than 280 customers and 332 million emails , this is the most extensive examination of triggered email metrics we 've ever produced . <p> Although this report will provide universal benchmarks for triggered email metrics , we also recognize that providing blanket data points may only tell one side of the story . With so many variables always in play , such as program size , order values- and sub-industries , it 's virtually impossible to deliver uniform benchmarks that are realistic , accurate and applicable for every program . <p> Because of this challenge , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different variable : baseline , adoption and revenue contribution , order values and industries . This will allow you to pick and choose which factors matter most , and as a result , measure your program against the best benchmarks for your business . <p> As a sneak peak to the report , here are a few key takeaways : <h> 1 . Price Decrease Triggered Emails are Strong Revenue-Driver <p> Most marketers expect abandonment emails , especially Cart Abandonment , to be the best triggered email types for driving high conversion and revenue . However , Price Decrease triggered emails actually- are the second top performer in revenue per email ( $2.83 ) , beating out other abandonment emails . As a few best practices , we have seen even greater click and conversion rates with Price Decrease triggers when retailers message a limited time offer and/or keep prices hidden within an email . <h> 2 . Most Retailers are Running 2-4 Triggered Email Marketing Programs <p> When it comes to building a scalable triggered email marketing program , almost all marketers use several triggers to engage at various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two different types of triggers and 65 percent run between two and four types . <p> As expected , shoppers looking to make a $100 purchase and those looking to make a $10,000 purchase respond differently to triggered emails . For example , order values between $50 $100 perform the strongest in conversion rates . This may be because orders in this range fall within a sweet spot between affordable impulse or necessity purchases and expensive luxury or investment buys . Understanding how behavior changes by different price points is important for retailers to keep in mind when scaling triggered email programs and recommending products . <p> When compared to industry-agnostic benchmarks , industry-specific triggered email benchmarks can differ greatly , as many industries have common characteristics of other variables included throughout this report . For example , here we see that the Jewelry industrys triggered emails typically perform higher than industry-agnostic averages .

@@42338457 @2338457/ <h> By Ryan Luckin <p> Tommy Hilfiger , a leading eCommerce brand , recently worked with Bluecore to publish a case study detailing how the retailer was able to rehab a limping triggered email program through- data and- a variety of A/B tests . <p> The removal of barriers between data sources , as well as a focus on speedy implementations and testing , enabled Tommy Hilfiger to explore new email marketing techniques that powered their six different triggered emails to drive revenue and improve relationships with customers . <p> Below we detail two of the unique findings that Tommy Hilfiger discovered through A/B testing . <p> Triggered Email A/B Testing <h> Two-Touch Abandoned Cart Programs are More Effective <p> The first of Tommy 's major findings came after developing a two-touch Abandoned Cart email trigger . The first email is- followed 24 hours later by a second touch , much like the one you see here . <p> Tommy Hilfiger 's two-touch program integrates the concept of spacing out sends with regular reminders for customers extremely close to completing their purchase . <p> This strategy helped increase overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to have an 15.3% average conversion rate for retailers in the Apparel industry ( according to Bluecores 2015- Benchmark Report ) . <h> Addressing Individual Customers by Name Grabs Their Attention <p> The second valuable finding from Tommy Hilfiger 's A/B testing surrounds the addition of first names to the address line to improve email performance . In a world where email inboxes are more crowded than ever , it becomes more and more important for retailers to set themselves apart . <p> An easy way to do this is addressing individual customers by their first name through a combination of customer data and content personalization . Tommy Hilfiger 's A/B testing around this found that adding individual customers ' names to their subject lines improved Open Rates as well as overall email performance . <p> Customers want this kind of personalization , and they 'll be more likely to engage with retailers that are using their data in order to customize messaging for them . A 2012 study by Digital Trends found that 73% of consumers surveyed said they prefer to do business with retailers who use personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond Tommy Hilfiger To Show or Not To Show Price Decreases <p> Several Bluecore partners have also run A/B tests on Price Decrease emails to determine if showing the change in price within the email itself is beneficial to conversions . <p> A recent A/B test run by a Sporting Goods industry partner revealed that Price Decrease email triggers showing new , reduced prices ultimately produced twice as many click throughs and conversions than the versions without pricing . This is just a single instance and there may be examples of other retailers experiencing the- opposite result from such a test . The learning here is to keep testing .

Tommy has actually worked with Bluecore for a number of years with a handful of different brands , including Lucky Brand , BCBGMaxazria and Dermstore . Now at Teleflora , Tommy shares his biggest challenges , proudest moments and more . <h> 1 . What Does- Retention &amp;- Loyalty Look Like at Teleflora ? <p> My department is run by a team of four , including me , with a lot of cross-departmental collaboration . I focus on the strategy and have experts in each channel who help me execute . We have a solid loyalty program in place today , but are looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features like user-generated content through Olapic and social sharing . <h> 2 . How do you work with other marketing departments ? <p> We work very closely with our partnership marketing and eCommerce teams . Our partnership marketing team does a lot of promotions such as , " Buy a bouquet from Teleflora using your Macys card and receive 20% off . " Right now were rolling out a few of those pilots on various partner sites , so I 'm excited to see those results , especially with our airline partners . Our eCommerce team really focuses on the customer experience and optimization , so ensuring our site functions and looks its best . <h> 3 . What has been your biggest challenge ? <p> I think our biggest challenge is similar for many other brands : communicating differentiation and value proposition . If you compare Telefloras product to our competitors , however , its really no contest . We source 100% of our bouquets from local florists , so anytime you buy from us , you 're also supporting a local business . Our presentation is another big differentiator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or without a vase , whereas our arrangements are personally delivered , hand-made , and ready to display . <h> 4 . What 3 things could you not run your program without ? <p> Data Integrity : Our data teams are so amazing and patient . Since then , we 've improved inboxing by 21% . That 's all just from improving data hygiene and cleaning up dormant emails . <p> Triggered Emails : We are in a low-margin industry , as opposed to fashion or beauty with 50-60% margins . Cost is king over here , so when you have a solution like Bluecore , which runs 3% of our email volume but makes up 20% of our revenue , that gives us the cushion we need . Batch and blasts , on the other hand , include much larger discounts and more expensive promotions that eat at our precious margins . <p> Internal Creative Services : We essentially have a full fledged marketing agency in-house here . They are a huge resource , they 've been a tremendous value in improving our emails and overall design . <p> If were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are almost always purchasing for someone else on a special occasion and there is a big difference in consumer mindset . In essence however , we are often seen as a commodity with our customers focused on bottom line price . We 've been successful because we are able to convey the quality and value of our brand ; our arrangements are hand-made and personally delivered . <h> 6 . What has been your proudest moment at Teleflora ? <p> I 'm really proud of the results we 've seen in email optimization from January to July of this year : <p> 72% increase in email contribution <p> 64% better spam rates than our competitors <p> 35% increased the list size <p> 30% increase in revenue from just our welcome emails <p> So much of this was cleaning up our data and the design of our emails . We tested and updated the layouts , subject lines and imagery . I 'm very happy with improvements . We will soon be launching a welcome series of 3 emails using Bluecore functionality . <h> 7 . What has been your biggest learning experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts was going to be challenging , but I did n't  know how challenging . While there are plenty levers to pull , it 's a completely different game . <h> 8 . What advice would you give to marketers looking to grow into a role like yours ? <p> Write your wins down every day . Just make a quick note , otherwise you 're going to forget it . Eventually , you 'll want to put together a presentation of , " This is what we 've done , here 's where we 're going , here 's where we 've been , etc. " - If you do n't write it down , you wont be able to find those numbers and it 's really motivating to take a moment to look at your progress and accomplishments. <h> 9 .

@@42338476 @2338476/ <h> StrategyWhy Cart Abandonment Emails Wont Suffice This Holiday Season <h> By Cameron Lewis <p> Every retailer using triggered holiday emails has Abandoned Cart up and running for the season . So the question is , how are you- going to set yourself apart from the competition ? <p> The answer lies just beyond that trusted cart abandonment program you have running . When we took a look at email performance across our partners during the 2014 holiday season , we found that partners using post purchase , abandoned search , and window shopping triggers saw impressive results well worth emulating this time around . <p> Let 's get down to the nitty gritty of how you can use these emails effectively this year . <h> Bring em Back For More The Post Purchase Cross-Sell <p> Post purchase emails are a very simple triggered email type that many retailers use , but not to the fullest extent of its capabilities . They 're designed to bring back buyers with product recommendations or best-sellers related to those they 've purchased . These emails are a great opportunity to reach out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presents ! <p> evo uses post purchase triggered emails like these to bring customers back for bundled items that will go well with their original purchase . <p> For example , the evo- post purchase email you see below is a great example of cross-sells customers . The customer that received this email purchased a snowboard , but everyone knows a board without bindings and boots wo n't have you carving up the slopes anytime soon . By understanding the relationships between products , evo 's post purchase emails will incentivize customers to make that extra purchase this holiday season . <p> These emails performed exceedingly well during the holidays as well . In the 2014 holiday season , Post Purchase emails sent by our partners were 79% more likely to be opened on Cyber Monday than the average day and 41% more likely to be opened on Black Friday . Additionally , these emails produced conversions 3-5 times more often and revenue-per-email 4-5 times higher than the average day in 2014 . <p> The lesson here is retailers should use triggered emails during the holidays to help gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alright Rudolph , These Searchers Need Presents ! <p> Your customers have holiday shopping experiences cloudier than the night Santa first met Rudolph , but that does n't mean you ca n't lead them straight to the presents they 're looking for with Abandoned Search emails ! They provide product recommendations within the category searched by customers as well as best sellers , making them a great tool for staying top of mind during the busy holiday season . <p> Take a look at this abandoned search email from Calvin Klein . The customer searched for handbags , but never made a purchase . This email was sent four hours later with recommended handbags and best sellers . It 's a great example of how Abandoned Search can take customers who did n't get as far as the online check-out counter and bring them back for more . <p> As always , data leads the way for our recommendations . Open Rates were twice as high on Cyber Monday and 68% higher on Black Friday in 2014 for these messages . When we took it a step further we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be clicked through and 122% more likely to result in a purchase . All of this came with 114% more revenue-per-email than the average day . <p> Based on the data we found from our partners in 2014 , the best days to send these triggered emails during the holidays is Black Friday and Cyber Monday . Many partners schedule out abandoned search messages go out four hours after the browsing session , but given the differences in performance and the limited amount of time for these holidays a shorter period of time would make emails more immediate and product better results . <h> Merry Christmas To The Creepers In Your Store Window <p> Diamond Candles uses these Window Shopping emails to help sell holiday best sellers related to products customers are browsing . <p> So what about those customers who get as far as a product page , but do n't make a purchase on your site ? Marketers should ensure that window shopping emails are a part of their triggered holiday emails to retarget their customers . <p> Take a look at this example window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tropical Retreat candle , and this email uses popular candles in similar categories for product recommendations . After all , who would n't want a Pumpkin Spice candle in the middle of the holidays ? <p> What does the data say ? Window shopping emails will do best on Cyber Monday . These emails were 52% more likely to be opened on Cyber Monday in 2014 as well as 58% more likely to be clicked through . Conversions were most likely to occur on Cyber Monday for these emails as well . <p> By sending emails like this one within three hours of site abandonment , retailers will take advantage of their great performance during the first half of the holiday season. - At the end of the day , retailers should carefully consider utilizing additional triggered email types during this holiday season to reach customers at each stage of the purchase process . There is still time left to move beyond the cart this holiday emails season , and if you do you 'll make your email marketing programs significantly more effective . 11864 @qwx421864 11867 @qwx421867 11863 @qwx421863 11865 @qwx421865 11866 @qwx421866

Not only are these emails more likely to be opened if they are received in advance of the holidays , certain email types also perform significantly better than on the average day . <p> With a head start and a few minor tweaks to emails used during these weeks , email marketers can achieve results head and shoulders above their competition . <h> Why start early ? <p> Over a third of holiday eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc . <p> Bluecore did an analysis of triggered emails sent leading up to as well as during Black Friday and Cyber Monday .

This week provides the unique opportunity to publicize potential Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals that enables retailers to keep themselves top of mind among consumers that are receiving dozens of emails a day during the holidays . <p> Retailers will need to seriously consider alternating messaging for Black Friday and Cyber Monday shoppers , as data shows they are distinct groups with little overlap . Bluecore analyzed the shopping behavior of partners ' identified customers and found that only 1.4% of holiday shoppers will make purchases on both Black Friday and Cyber Monday . Marketing to the two groups differently creates a powerful revenue generation opportunity for marketers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 're ready to start marketing to your customers throughout the beginning of November to showcase your great Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals as well as to collect as much revenue as possible from early holiday shoppers .

Abandoned Search emails had 122% more conversions on Cyber Monday than the average day in 2014 , even with slightly lower Click-Through Rates and barely any change in Open Rates . <h> Post Purchase <p> As this is the holiday season , post purchase emails are a great way to offer products related to those purchased as additions to the gifts people will purchase for others in their lives .
