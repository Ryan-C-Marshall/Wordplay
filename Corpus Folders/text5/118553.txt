Evolution of the list : The first list of wonders of the world is attributed to Herodotus . The list appeared in Ancient Greece . All the wonders were on the island Samos . This enlisting consisted of three wonders of the world : * The aqueduct in the form of a tunnel ; * The dam in the port on the island ; * The temple of the Goddess Hera . Subsequent lists extended up to seven wonders . The new list of seven wonders appeared in the III BC . Historians consider the small poem of authorship Antipater of Sidon ( English ) as the source of the list ( also there is a version that it was written by Antipater of Thessalonica ( English ) ) : 1 . Statue of Zeus at Olympia ; 2 . Colossus of Rhodes ; 3 . Hanging gardens of Babylon ( Hanging Gardens of Semiramis ) ; 4 . Pyramids of Egypt ; 5 . Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walls of Babylon The classical list and its subsequent interpretations : Historians relate this list to the Empire of Alexander the Great . In some sources , Philo of Byzantium ( Philo of Alexandria ) is considered as the author of the final list . At present , the following are included in the list of seven wonders : * Pyramid of Cheops , Great pyramid of Giza ( Egypt ) ; * Hanging gardens of Babylon ( Hanging Gardens of Semiramis ) ; * Temple of Artemis at Ephesus ; * Statue of Zeus at Olympia ; * Lighthouse of Alexandria ; * Colossus of Rhodes ; * Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus ; To date , only the Pyramid of Cheops is fully preserved and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus and the Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus are partially preserved . In subsequent times , numerous attempts were made to create various lists of places of interests on the basis of the previously available list . Roman poet Martial included the Colosseum , which was recently constructed , into the list . Later , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ark and Solomon 's Temple in the list . Philo of Alexandria , who lived in the IV century B.C could not have imaged that his name would be remembered in centuries to come for such an interesting reason . He , being a mathematician , mechanic and geodesist , contrived the idea of making the first list of Seven wonders . It is not known , why he stopped on seven objects . Explanation , which is popular today : seven was considered as magic number , which was mentioned even by ancient Egyptians in their studies . For example , seven colours of rainbow , seven heavenly bodies in Solar system ... In his work " Seven Wonders of the world " , Philo included : * Lighthouse of Alexandria ; * Hanging Gardens of Babylon ; * Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus ; * Pyramids of Giza ( Egypt ) ; * Colossus of Rhodes ; * Statue of Zeus at Olympia ; * Temple of Artemis at Ephesus . Unfortunately , except for the pyramids , these sublime structures could not be preserved . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a consequence , many scientists and historians enlisted their variants of the wonders . The modern list of new wonders was made on the basis of the results of a survey , done over the telephone and Internet . Popular film director Bernard Weber has come up with the idea of conducting the poll over telephone and internet . The list included 77 existing structures and any person could vote for the 7 most worthy by voting on site n7w.com or over the phone . Voting lines were closed on the magic date - on July 7 , 2007 : 7.07.07 . Approximately 100 million people participated in the voting process . The final list of seven wonders is as follows : * Great Wall of China ; * City Machu Picchu in Peru ; * City Petra in Jordan ; * City Chichen Itza on Yucatan Peninsula , Mexico ; * Roman Colosseum , Italy ; * Taj Mahal , India ; * Christ the Redeemer , Rio ( de ) Janeiro , Brazil .

The instinct to continue their clan authoritatively draws them to ocean shore . The Red crab is a tiny creature , just about the size of a palm . It is known that for most of the year , this creature , like most of other land crabs , spends time outside the water - in tropical rain forests , high plateaus , on stepped terraces bordering the coasts . As the scientists estimate , the population of these crustaceans on Christmas Island is around 120 million , i.e. 60,000 per person ! They dig holes in the forests , sometimes in gardens , where they hide in the dry season to avoid dehydration . The crab carefully covers the burrow entrance with leaves . But with the arrival of the rainy season , after the first downpour , red crabs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start their journey . They just flow ( you can not describe it otherwise ) like an endless stream to the sea , filling space all around . Any man who glimpses this spectacle for the first time would simply be amazed . On what food does this whole armada survive on ? It seems to be fallen leaves . That is why , the land is almost always bare in the tropical rain forests of the island . Everything is eaten . It 's true , the crabs " maintain cleanliness " , they fertilize the soil , loosen it by digging holes and thereby influence the life of the forest . The mass voyage of the crabs lasts from 9 to 12 days ( depending on the distance of the burrows ) and large male crabs lead the younger males and females . The males arrive first to the shore . Here , by cooling off in the ocean , the crabs dig burrows in the coastal strip . And , if they happen to be peace-loving during the year , then during the mating season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seems to be no serious fighting . Two days later , the females also arrive . The male crabs do not spend much time at sea and after taking a farewell dip in sea , they return back . But the females stay in the coastal burrows for quite some time . Each of them can lay more than one hundred thousand eggs . A large number of eggs are lost . After laying the eggs , females also return to the forest holes . Larvae spend 25 days in the water . They are so helpless and their lives literally hang on a thread : the sea can carry them or they can be eaten by predatory fish . But the larvae turn into real crabs and their first trip to the interiors of the island begins . At this time , it seems that the earth has been covered by a shaking red carpet . Crabs are everywhere . They cover the road and get into the houses . They can be found in every room and even in lamps and lampshades . It is understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many young crabs are killed under the wheels of vehicles , they also fall prey to bigger crabs of other species and to predatory birds . Those who are lucky enough to survive , reach the forest , hide under layer of leaves in the ground , where they spend two to three years . Now , they have a chance to survive . Birds do not attack the older crabs . People also are not interested in them .

Hinny - Hybrid of male horse and female donkey . It is quite opposite to mule , for which the gender of parents is vice versa . Outwardly , hinny is quite similar to donkey but only its voice is different . Hinnies are raised in Mediterranean countries and in Asia .

This is due to difference in the quantity of chromosomes present in horses ( 64 chromosomes ) and in donkeys ( 62 chromosomes ) . Nar is a result of cross breeding of Dromedary and Bactrian camels . These hybrid camels have two small and merged together humps . It has the characteristics of parents and is enduring ( sturdy ) and strong animal . Nar can have posterity but the descendants possess inferior qualities when compared to parent camels . Thus Nar is first generation crossbred F1 camel .

At present , tigons are not prevalent as the " vis-a-vis " ligers , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of XX century quite opposite situation prevailed . Tigons are never found in nature as tigers and lions have different habits , manners and habitat places . Tigons include the characteristics of both the parents : They can have spots from mother -genes of lions are responsible for spots - lion cubs are brown with spots - and stripes from father . Mane of tigons , if at all it appears , shall always be shorter than the mane of lions . Usually , tigons are smaller than lions and tigers and approximately weigh 150 kg ( 350 pounds ) . Male tigons are always sterile and at the same time female tigons can give birth . However , if you are interested in technology more than biology , hybrid cars contest gallery may be for you .

The occurrence process of mutation received the name " Mutagenesis " . The natural rate of the occurrence of mutation is often much less , because , usually mutation takes place in one cell and affects one gene . The majority of these mutations are absolutely safe , because they do not completely affect the phenotype . A relatively small fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then there is a chance of mutation affecting the functionality of cells . Mutations , which worsen the activity of cells in metazoan organism , often lead to cell destruction . If the inner and outer cell protective mechanisms did not distinguish the mutation , then the mutant gene is transmitted to all descendants of the cells and , more often , leads to the malfunctioning of cells . Mutations take place constantly during the processes , occurring in a live cell , but there exists factors , capable of significantly increasing the frequency of mutations . The most widespread of them is the influence of harmful substances , microorganisms or radiation including the natural radiating background on cells . Mutation in the somatic cell of the complex metazoan organism can lead to malignant or benign new formations . The mutation in sexual cells leads to changes in the characteristics of the entire descendant organism . Most cases of mutations , which appear at the phenotype level , have fatal consequences and the mutant organism perishes by itself or under the influence of the environment . However , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence of new useful features in the organism and then the consequences of mutation appear positive . Thus , mutations are engines of natural selection . Also it is known that the higher organisms use purposeful mutations in immunity mechanisms . Such mutations are called " somatic " . With their help , a variety of lymphocyte populations are created , among which , as a result , units are found always , which are capable of giving an immune response to a new , unknown illness of the organism . Suitable lymphocytes are subjected to positive selection and immunological memory appears as a result . If the mutation affects " silent " sections of DNA or leads to the replacement of one element of genetic code , then it is not shown in any way outwardly in the phenotype . However , such mutations can be detected through gene analysis methods . Since mutations occur more often as a result of natural reasons , then in assumption , that basic properties of external factors did not vary , turns out , that the frequency of mutations should be approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of origin of anything including the human being . Thus , mutations in silent genes give researchers unique " genetic clocks " . Spontaneous DNA damage is encountered very often and such events take place in each cell . Special reparation mechanism ( for example , the mistaken section of DNA is cut and the original section is restored at the same place ) is available for rectifying the consequences of similar damage . Mutations arise only when the reparation mechanism , for any reasons , does not work or does not cope with the rectification of damage . Research of mutations in mitochondrial DNA ( inherited from the maternal line ) and in Y-chromosomes ( inherited from paternal line ) is widely used in evolutionary biology for studying the origin of races and nationalities and the reconstruction of biological development of mankind .

In the Middle Ages , a notion was formed that a woman becomes a witch by entering into an agreement with the devil . It was attributed that witches took part in Sabbaths on mountains ( mainly Walpurgis Night ) , copulating with demons in the form of men ( Incubus ) and sacrificing babies in order to avoid the onset of Doomsday . Similar superstitions led to the rise in the mass prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the 15th to the middle of the 17th centuries . This period entered into the history as the Witch Hunt in Western Europe . The treatise " The Hammer of Witches " - The Malleus Maleficarum ( Latin ) or " Hexenhammer " in German ) - written by German inquisitors Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger in 1486 has served as the twist-type trigger for mass legal proceedings over so-called witches . " Wicca " is a religion for witches . The view of the Slavonic people towards witches was different ; Witchcraft ( secret " knowledge " and other abilities ) in itself was not considered a crime and legal action against witches were taken up only after accusing someone for inflicting concrete harm to a claimant . The injuriousness to witches was attributed to Christian preachers . Since olden times , witches ( knowledgeable ) lived separately from other people . Thus , it was easy to collect knowledge ( by observing their nature ) . And it is important to note that only those people approached witches who really needed help . For simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , the witches were not disturbed without a valid purpose ) . And for preachers , aspiring to spread Christianity by all means , witches were a real harm ( after all , witches could help people and what could preachers oppose ? Not only Christian missionaries but also apologists of " priestly " paganism competed with witches , not giving them time to consider themselves unique bearers of the will of the gods . The folk classification of witches : In folk tales , witches were divided into two categories " from birth " and " scientists " . Born , natural or " from birth " a witch appears , if someone successively gives birth to seven girls and without a baby boy in between or is the representative of a third generation of illegitimate girls or is simply the daughter of a witch ( depending on the region ) . A born witch could be born to a mother who , being pregnant , prepared festive evening dishes and accidentally swallowed a piece of coal or when the child was in the womb , the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wise " witch collects supernatural forces from other witches or from the devil , in general , from evil spirits . The major difference between the " Born " and " Wise " witches is that the " Born " witch can sometimes correct inflicted harm but the " Wise " witch will never do it : " the wise witch is worse than the born witch " . The initiation of witches : The witch studied with another witch or even with a devil . Folk narrations link the terrifying rituals such as , for example , trampling icons , reading the prayers the wrong way and throwing over a knife in the " initiation " process of witches . The senior witch can also wash the student with magical broth , immediately after which the student flies out through the furnace onto the streets and returns back as a witch . But , conclusive training comes to an end on Bald Mountain . Most frequent appearances of witches : In rural life , a witch can enter any situation and do harm : it can cause hail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields ; steal stars from the sky and cause solar and lunar eclipses . Witches often fly . Witches use brooms or besom for flying . Witches apply some liquid or use special cream on their wrist and fly through the furnace . In Ukrainian mythology , the aim of flying is to go up high to Bald Mountain near Kiev , in German mythology Broken , in Italian - Beneventsky oak . Here , they celebrate their Sabbaths , i.e. , wild banquets and report to higher evil spirit . Usually , the Sabbaths are organized in the first week of every month or on the eve of a holiday . Sometimes , it is considered that when the witch goes on such Sabbaths , only her soul departs and the body remains in place . If the body of a witch is overturned , then the soul can not enter the body anymore . After death , witches , like vampires , can also rise from tombs , especially if they experienced some injustice in their lives for which they wish to take revenge . Witches can command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recognition of witches : Water tests ( dunking ) were mentioned even in the ancient Hindu book " Manu " . Indistinct instructions were also given in Avast . The description about dunking is also found in ancient German traditional law and in legislation . The idea of this test was , probably , that water as a pure element shall refuse to accept people who serve an evil spirit . In Western Europe , witches were keenly chased and burnt - the first witch burning took place in Toulouse in 1275 . In the west , suspicions about relations with evil spirits , back-off from correct religion , i.e. the so-called apostasy was the main reason for the prosecution of witches .

Experts in the marketing field unanimously declared that Energizer Bunny is a unique example of how the marketing icon can emphasize and express the essence of marketing a product , in this case , " long-lasting " batteries , so interestingly , fresh , unobtrusive and unforgettable .

When the toy was switched on , nobody and nothing could stop it . The Energizer Bunny went towards the door and disappeared behind it . Since then , the Energizer Bunny , which disappeared from the laboratory , continues to walk from one advertisement into another , ensuring popularity and commercial success to the Energizer batteries . The Advertising Age included the Energizer Bunny in the hundreds of the most successful marketing campaigns and in five of the most outstanding icons of the 20th century .

The aim of the advertisement is to show that the Duracell Bunny always works longer than others and always comes out as the winner . It is no wonder that people frequently get confused with these two icons : the Energizer Bunny and Duracell Bunny . However , considerable differences exist between them . For example , the pink bunny always beats a drum in the advertisements of the Energizer batteries , whereas , the Bunnies in advertisements by Duracell batteries play football or take part in marathon races and naturally , the Duracell Bunny always wins over the contenders . Nevertheless , the activity areas of bunnies are clearly demarcated : the Duracell Bunny does not appear in advertisements in the USA and the Energizer Bunny is a rare visitor in Europe .

Bush . Senator Clinton said her primary concerns will be war in Iraq , health care for all Americans , energy and environment , and growing budget deficit . " This is going to be a tough campaign , " said Hillary , " and I am prepared to fight . "

And hence , they were called " wonders " , even though many original masterpieces of ancient architecture and art are missing from the list such as - Acropolis in the Athens with the statue of Athena Parthenos , statue of Aphrodite , works of famous Greek sculptors . The " selection " of wonders took place gradually and since then , one wonder replaced the others .

Lighthouse of Alexandria : Not faraway from the city , a tall tower , one the biggest in world , was built on the island of Pharos . The tower is a three-storied structure standing at a height of approximately 180 meters .

According to his own words , Wir Elmar Weisser prepared his beard for the competition from 7 o'clock in the morning with the help of his sister . This was not his first achievement in the " World Beard and Moustache " championship . In 2005 , he won here with a beard , cut and trimmed in the shape of Berlin 's Brandenburg Gate . Two years later , he once again won with a beard , depicting an identical copy of the London tower .

Organizers call it the " world 's main event in the beard and moustache category " . Surprisingly , serious passions boil , at times compared to football game , in this competition , which looks like a curious one at first glance . Thus Americans , who , for long period considered themselves inferior to Europeans , showed invincible national character and are able to significantly improve their performances in recent years . Commentators say that the USA is becoming a " great beard and moustache powerhouse " . Today , anyone hardly doubts that hair style ( or beard style ) can have symbolic significance . Beards not only grace a man . It can became an important political trump-card . It is Incredible , but the beard played its role in the achievements of conquistadors , who conquered the New World . American Indians considered Columbus and also other Europeans as messengers of God . Invaders successfully followed the notions of the American Indians of the legendary " divine messengers " - white , bearded , dressed in black clothes on huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conquered their territories . Cuba was conquered by Velzquez de CuTllar Diego , who was a Spanish . He was born in a very rich family in Cueller , Spain . He participated in the second expedition of Columbus in 1493 and commanded the troops from Haiti , which captured Cuba in 1511 . Here , he founded many cities , among which was Havana in 1515 . He died in Cuba from fever . Local American Indians from the Ciboney and Taino tribes were killed by arms and diseases , which were brought by Europeans . Slaves were brought from Africa to the island in order to compensate the shortage of the workforce , who later on contributed to a major part of Havana 's population . The mixture of Spanish and Africans gave birth to present day Cubans . Why did the Greeks sport beards while the Romans did not ? For a long time , the habit of sporting a beard was common in Ancient Greece as well as in Rome - not even one respected Greek on Roman could appear clean shaved before others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudely ridiculed a beardless man , asking him : " are n't you taking the nature to court as it created you to be a man and not a woman ? " . This trend was stopped by Alexander the Great . He was the first famous clean shaven Greek king . His trend was followed so that almost after 500 years of his governance , in the civilized world , the beard was perhaps sported only by philosophers and not by everybody . Truly , there exists a more practical explanation to this fact , as the beard did not grow at all due to a physiological feature of Alexander the Great . Though , maybe this phenomenon was just a pure utilitarian explanation . It is known that before the deciding battle with Persians in Gaugamela , Alexander ordered his soldiers to shave their beards so that the cunning barbarians could not grab them by the beard when they were engaged in close fighting . One way or another , all famous personalities of the ancient period did not sport a beard . The exception is Adrian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the barbarization of the Roman empire .

This was fun to make ( and a little bit more difficult than I expected .. ) Special thx to NewsMaster for the POTD - great pleasure . <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : Ancient wise men used to say that a bird flight is a great symbol of creation . Flapping bird flight is surprisingly energy effective . White hawk grabs and lifts the prey of up to 3 times heavier that itself . No aircraft of modern days can achieve such efficiency . Plovers have an average wing span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrations with an average speed of 60 miles per hour , when they travel from Auletian Islands to Hawaii . In order to evaluate this flight , we should compare it not to fligh of a jet aircraft but to those of propeller planes , which push down air . Propeller airplanes also fly about 2000 miles without refueling , but the physical size of such plane exceed the size of plover over 30 times . Which means that plover is 30 times more efficient than propeller plane . As much as humans would like to muster and use the technical principles of flapping bird flight , these principles are still not fully understood by modern science , which still treats bird flight as a miracle of nature . Hopelessly trying not only to imitate bird flight but also to understand how it can be possible within the laws of aerodynamics , modern science builds its greedy and capricious airplanes which use wings creating the lifting power , but not the thrust . Meanwhile , flapping wings of birds elegantly combine these two functions based on engineering concept , striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for perhaps the smallest ones , possess the technique of a gliding flight . Some of them have polished this technique down to perfection : sea birds demonstrate the miracles of flying , when they rely on energy of wind , at times seemingly freezing in one spot flying against the front wind . The simple fact is that spawned and fixed bird wings create a lifting power with sufficient streamline speed . However the flapping movements of wings are needed not for creation of lifting power , but for thrust .

Should we really believe Time has chosen Vladimir Putin or is it just a clever photoshop hoax ? If this cover is authentic , it will be the second time the magazine has honored Putin ( first time being 2007 ) .

Make the pictures postcards-like and write Ernesto 's impression of these places on the postcards .

But it happened as the 110th Congress convened , making the San Francisco Democrat next in the presidential line of succession after the vice president . By all means , we judge Pelosi on her abilities . Nonetheless , it is difficult to not acknowledge the importance of her achievement - not what it meant to her , or this new Congress , but what it also meant to young girls and women everywhere .

Simultaneously , the Democrats are pledging a bipartisan effort that bridges the political divide . Yes , Pelosi says , we 'll pursue Democratic-led initiatives , but we 'll do so by extending a reach across the aisle and working with Republican leaders , too . Voters sent a message in November to both parties : Eliminate the gridlock that stifles progress . Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic Congress need to deliver the change that voters demanded . 66 yr old Nancy Pelosi is the first woman-speaker of the House of Representative in the history of the USA .

Besides , they have an opportunity to form the legislative notices of Congress for the next two years . The loss of republicans in the House of Representatives can strongly complicate the life of Bush 's Administration in the remaining two years , mainly due to the passing of important legislative initiatives . On the eve of anticipating victory of her party , Nancy Pelosi issued a statement , in which she informed that after coming to office by the democrats in January , they will act on decisive political initiatives for correcting the course of the republicans and George Bush 's Administration during the first 100 days in the office .

Her father , Thomas D'Alesandro , Jr , was Mayor of Baltimore for a long time and then represented the State of Maryland in the House of Representatives for 10 years .

For the first time , Pelosi was elected to Congress in 1987 from the State of California and since then , she has been active in politics . Two years ago , she became the first woman in the history of the USA to be heading the political fraction in the main legislative body of the country . Nancy Pelosi married Paul Pelosi , a millionaire from San Francisco . The couple has five children and also are the grand-parents of five grandsons .

@@77659156 @6359156/ <h> Funny Gender Pictures <p> Love the characters . great work . It has some issues with contrast though . Transbat and miss eyeball 's body need more of it compared to the background . <p> That sounds a bit more like opinion , rather than a problem . Using uni-contrast is not the intended style of this one , Jere . First rule of poster art , there are no rules . The second rule is give your subjects the canvas . The background is secondary and but a minor supportive nature . Actually it does n't even have to exist in this chop . It is there for a little color and interest , so it is not going to have the same visual value as the subjects ... if you follow me. and that sir , is my opinion . Cheers <p> One of the most ambitious women in the UK politics , Member of European Parliament , Nikki Sinclaire shocked everyone by saying she actually grew up as a man , and had a gender change operation at the age of 23 . This revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex change parliamentarian " . She said she kept her " men 's past " a secret for 22 years because she did not want that fact to overshadow her career in politics . Nikki Sinclaire changed her mind in November as she became certain the world was ready for gender change politicians nowadays . A Sinclaire 's political opponent who chose to remain anonymous , upon hearing the news , said " Be careful who you trust , the devil was once an angel . " Show how any politician or celebrity may look if he/she chooses to have a gender change in the future . <p> Analysts say that one of the major reasons for Hillary leading the polls is ... her gender . Many women will give Hillary their votes just because she 's a woman and they associate with her . Some analysts say it would be easier to beat Hillary if she were a man . Great news . Would it be easier to beat Obama if he was a woman ? Photoshop any of the current U.S. presidential candidates to change their gender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters . To see a good example , let 's recall what we did the last election with John Kerry . <p> A number of studies of the recent years has shown that when it comes to love , the old rule " opposites attract " may not be so true . Close examination of faces of thousands of couples has shown many similarities and common facial traits among spouses or lovers . People tend to subconsciously choose a partner that looks similar to him / her one way or another . So " similarities attract " may be a better rule , at least in the recent years . Furthermore , when people start living together they develop similar face characteristics together by naturally copying each other 's facial emotions and expressions . Let us show which celebrities of opposite gender share enough facial characteristics to make a natural couple : You will need to choose two celebrities of the OPPOSITE GENDER , and transplant a VERTICAL half of a face from one celebrity to another . Here 's a good example . This contest is another spin-off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured in many magazines including People , Daily Mail , etc . In addition to celebrities , you can also use politicians , famous word figures , or characters from old paintings as one of the sources in a merged face . Note : the two faces you use as sources do not have to be a real couple in life , but they do have to be of OPPOSITE GENDER . <p> Cate Blanchett is playing a legendary singer Bob Dylan in a new movie " I 'm Not There " . This role is one of the most controversial , difficult , and at the same time interesting roles for Cate Blanchett where she had to change her gender on screen both in appearance and mentally . Another most recent " gender reassignment " was successfully done by John Travolta in the movie " Hairspray . " In real life , thousands of people undergo gender reassignment surgeries every year . Your today 's mission is to perform gender reassignment " surgeries " with the help of Photoshop rather than with a surgeon 's scalpel . Your patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - e.g. characters from paintings and you need to show them as the opposite gender . The voters will show how successful your operation was . <p> In this contest you are asked to take any image of any politician or celebrity and change their gender as in the theme post .

Being constantly bombarded by images of ideal beauty has disastrous implications for our self esteem . We are constantly worried about our weight - whether we are too fat or too skinny - and it is n't a surprise why 1 in 5 women have an eating disorder . But if we think of any little abnormality towards eating than 4 out of 5 women would have an eating disorder . This could be bulimia , anorexia nervosa , or even compulsory eating disorder . These are psychological disorders towards eating . Calling most people who are fat as being " lazy or greedy " completely overlooks genetics . Some people are genetically inclined towards heaviness . In addition , some people have eating disorders not just because of the media but because of other oppressive circumstances - a response towards different forms of oppression . I think we should focus on the psychological , emotional , and physical well-being of all individuals across various genders and quit trying to make a competition for women based on arbitrary terms of beauty when only a small percentage of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should have the media move more towards talent , mind , and intellectual contributions .

In an interview to newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine , he informed that many people become obese by using sweetener in food and non-fat products . He reiterated that our organism interprets it as threat to hunger . Calories supply energy to mind , make possible mobile activeness and " heat " the organism . If the food is insufficient , then the organism itself makes up for the shortage and accumulates thicker fat layer .

High rate of mortality is observed not in the case of fat people but in thin ( lean ) people . In recent times , opinion about the necessity of being well-built is constantly stressed-upon . On a beach , girl with ideal figure is always noticed and followed by eyesight . Close associates , noticing her take snacks , once again remind possible disfiguring problems .

As a matter of fact , obesity problem is not so much aesthetic as much as psychological . According to the opinions of psychologists , these are the qualities , inherent to persons , suffering from obesity : - It is easy for them to avoid seduction during association with opposite sex ( It is frequently noticed that , people put-on weight immediately after marriage ) ; - As a rule , they feel morally strong persons ( They constantly check their emotions and sometimes leading to nervous disorders ) ; - Often , they possess reputation of being intelligent obliging persons and it is very difficult for them to say " NO " to other persons ; they need more love and affection than anybody else and very painfully take critics in their own stride . Under the guidance of Gregory Simon , scientists destroyed the already prevalent stereotype that fat people are jolly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depressions and mood swings , informs journal Archives of General Psychiatry. 9125 adults took part in the survey , conducted by the members of Group Health Cooperative .

According to the inputs of volunteers , such as weight and height , scientists judged the presence of fat ( obesity ) . Survey results indicated that , people with obesity problems experience anxious and emotional disorders including depression 25 % more than the others . At the same time , fat people very rarely ( by 25% ) abused of alcohol and narcotics in comparison with other well-built brothers . Researchers are yet to come to a conclusion whether depression is a reason or consequence of obesity since both the variants are completely possible . It is known that , physical activity decreases in the persons , suffering from depression . Apart from this , drugs , used for the treatment of depression , can augment the weight .

The mouth , or oral cavity , is the front part of the digestive tract , and starts from the oral fissure and ends at the pharynx ( if it is absent is ends straight at the esophagus ) . The mouth in animals develops wholly or partially by invaginating ectoderm from the foregut . Oral cavities of invertebrates are often associated with special attachments : splitting and cutting formations in free-living nemathelminthes , jaws of gasteropodas and squids ( cephalopodas ) and oral parts in arthropoda . The mouth of vertebrates is paved with a multilayered , sometimes cornified epithelial tissue . Fish and terrestrial vertebrates have jaws ( teeth ) at the front and sides , a muscular bed from below where the hyoid arch is hidden in its depths , and plays the role of a tongue in many animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthened by bones of basis cranii which form the so called primary palate and postnaris which open immediately in the mouth . Amniotes have their mouth divided into upper ( breathing ) and lower ( secondary mouth ) parts by means of an extended hard palate . From its backend in mammals is the soft palate , which divides the oral cavity and pharynx . In the bird 's palate and also very often mammals have papilla , cross cushions or palatine scutes covered with keratinous coating and they help in grinding food . The keratinous layer of these cushions in edentate whales grows rapidly and later takes the shape of baleen . Mammals , because of the growth in the soft flexible labia between the jaws and teeth , have a cavity , the so called threshold of the oral cavity . The threshold of the mouth in several mammals forms the side projections which are the cheek pouches . Mammals and humans have a tongue , teeth and mouth glands located in their mouth .

The mouth at the front is connected with the outdoor environment by means of the oral opening ; the fauces at the back is connected with the pharynx . Located here are the lymphoepithelioma organs , the tonsils . In the depths of the mucous membrane there are many small salivary glands .

@@77659195 @6359195/ <p> Did you ever wonder why cops love donuts and how this tradition originated ? Years back , there were no 24 hour open stores , and no drive ins . All the shops and cafes closed before the midnight crew started their shift . Cars were not always available back then so many policemen walked the beat . Naturally tired after constant walking they needed a place to sit down and have a snack . Donut and coffee shops were the first places to open in the morning that would give exhausted cops a place to sit down , and give them much needed caffeine to stay awake and carbs from donuts to provide quick energy . Many officers would join , as there usually was only one donut shop in that area , and a tradition was born . These days there are many 24 hour shops available , but the ties between cops and donuts are as strong as ever . Why ?

The spill of oil and gas from the emergency well continues even now . The drilling of two relief wells is underway . According to the information from the company as of July 3 , the total leak would constitute 585,4 thousand barrels of hydrocarbons in petroleum equivalent . As earlier informed by Bloomberg , waves caused by the hurricane season in the gulf can suspend the oil-collection operations of the company . 44500 employees of the company , US Governmental representatives and volunteers are taking part in rectifying the leak with the use of 6,563 thousand vessels and 113 air vehicles . The incident in the Gulf of Mexico became the largest emergency oil spill in the US , which exceeded the consequences of the wreck of the tanker Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989 . Then , around 260 thousand oil barrels sank along with the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil spill were unsuccessful . By this time , the company lost one third of its market capitalization ( from the day of the accident it fell from $180 billion to $115 billion ) ; and the expenditure for the clean-up operations exceeded $760 million . By mid-June 2010 , unsuccessful attempts to cope with the consequences of the accident and the ever growing louder and louder demands for multi billion-dollar compensation for the damages caused , plummeted the ratings of BP : Agency Fitch Ratings reduced the long-term rating of the company by a whole six levels from AA ( highly reliable ) up to BBB ( only two places above the " junk " level ) . In July , it was announced that the CEO Tony Hayward will resign from his post in autumn , which is also associated with the catastrophe by the Deepwater Horizon .

All 14 contest pictures can be viewed here . <p> I agree with Mundo . The swimming fishes are a bit transparent somewhow , which makes them look less real . I like the concept though - Bush 's face expression with open fish mouth is what sells this picture . <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : During the dry season the depth of the Mekong river near the village of Hartke , in northern Thailand , is one or two meters only . However , particularly at this time dozens of chiseled boats briskly move over the shallow waters between the shore and island in the middle of the river . The fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then slowly pull them along the river . They all hope to catch an unusual giant catfish . Here it is called the " plaa tank . " Pick-up vans wait on the shore , packed with ice , ready to immediately deliver the fish to a restaurant in Thailand . Since long ago , the Mekong catfish has been considered as a symbol of male power . Its meat is considered to have stimulating qualities , and is sold in Bangkok at $16 per kilogram . What has raised the fish to this special status in Thailand ? Of course , the qualities attributed to it - the huge size , but in recent years only a small number of them are surviving . Adult fish can weigh up to 300 kilograms , which makes it one of the largest freshwater fish in the world . Their fishing has become a profitable business . As it is expressed by a local fisherman , it is equal to winning the national lottery . Not surprisingly , the Thai fishermen have a sense of awe for " plaa tank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rice , red clothes , comb and mirror in boat , to thank the spirit-woman who , according to legend , is present in the boat . In the 80 's , the catches began to decline sharply , and Thai scientists launched a program for the artificial breeding of " plaa baks . " Lacking any modern equipment , and undeterred by the lack of theoretical data on the subject , they have improvised in the work process . However , scientists have found strong allies as deep concern of King Bhumibol Adulyadej Rama IX , towards the condition of environment in the country as well as the fishermen , who better than anyone , understood the need to protect a major source of their existence . Along the Mekong River , boards and posters were placed , announcing that the Department of Fisheries pays the fishermen a good price for live catfish . A small expedition of scientists was sent to the river during the season of catching . Of course , the base of the expedition was the village Hartke , one of the few places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 300 families residing in the Hartke , generations of fishermen live , and they knew how to catch " plaa tank " with a net . During fishing , which lasts from May to June , the fishermen build temporary huts on the shore . They work around the clock , the channel between the village and the nearest island Hartke is partitioned off by the net for the entire fishing season . When a powerful big fish is caught , it surrenders to people without a fight . Despite having a big size , the local catfish are not aggressive . They are in fact mild toothless creatures , who feed on aquatic vegetation . The first experiments on artificial breeding of these catfish were unsuccessful . Fishermen caught and offered four " plaa tanks " to scientists , but all soon died . All needed to be started over again ... But as time passed - and ichthyologists , equipped with latest technology and using the latest data of science and practice , gained , at last , victory . Five million eggs were extracted from fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which 300,000 hatched and got baby fishes . Out of these , two hundred thousand have survived . After presenting the " plaa tanks " formally to the King of Thailand , 20 percent of the surviving young fishes were released into Mekong , and the rest - in other water bodies and rivers of the country . Many of the issues related to " plaa tank " , need to be resolved yet and therefore a type of " large fish club " was established , which does not give attention to studies on European catfish and sturgeon . Sanai Folprozit , who led the artificial breeding project of " plaa tank " , and is considered the greatest authority on catfish in Thailand , believes that the distribution area and mode of life of these fish are still not totally understood . He believes that " plaa tank " swim upstream in the tributaries of Mekong , and spawns in the river section between China and Laos . " Then the young fishes - he presumes - float down the river and reach one of the tributaries which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambodia , where this catfish is called the " royal fish " . It is well known , that Mekong River , which has a length of about 4,500 kilometers , and its tributaries flow through China , Laos , Thailand , Burma , Cambodia and Vietnam , so regional conflicts , unfortunately , hamper the research . But the Department of Fisheries of Thailand hopes , that due to " plaa tank " they will be able to achieve good relations with their neighbors . For a long time in Thailand , people talk about the need for a protection law for these fish . This would be the most promising solution .

The validity period of the new agreement was 10 years . In December 2010 , the agreement was ratified by the US Senate and in January 2011 both the houses of Russian parliament .

On the evening of May 1 , 2011 , according to Washington time , Obama in a television address informed about killing of Osama bin Laden , leader of " Al Qaeda " outfit , for whom special services of the USA hunted for almost 10 years after acts of terrorism on September 11 , 2001 .

Lake officials will give $100 to anyone else who reels in a similar fish . The evolutionary connection between humans and monkeys : Presently , it is known about the presence of absolutely identical blood groups in humans , chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans : The " Human " group O and A were observed in chimpanzees . A , B and AB - in orangutans , A and B - in gorillas . Conclusive evidence was obtained about the identity of these groups in humans and enlisted monkeys : the bold experiments of Troisier in the middle of the 20th century have proven safe blood transfusions ( including groups ) from chimpanzees to human beings . The possibility of such a procedure was proven earlier by Fridental . In this case , the similarities of anthropoids with humans is distinguished by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the similarities of anthropoid monkeys and inferior monkeys . Is the barrier unconquerable : It is often heard that there exists one main difference between chimpanzee and humans - speech , which is present in humans . No one , of course , can deny that : tens and hundreds of thousand of years of " colloquial practice " has given the humans a valuable gift such as articulate speech during the process of collective activity . Here , the gap between man and his nearest relative deepened further , which was proven by a series of experiments , carried out by two American researchers , the Gardner couple in mid 20th century and later by Penny Patterson , Jills and a number of other primatologists . The findings of this research can be considered as one of the greatest discoveries of the century . The Gardner couple achieved great success in experiments on training sign language to the chimpanzee Washoe . The chimpanzee quickly learnt 245 " word symbols " and later on started devising 10 new " words " per month on its own . Patterson conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 600 symbols and kept devising new symbols . One can communicate with apes just as we do with children of about 4 to 5 years of age . After learning a new language , the chimpanzees and gorillas communicated with each other and even taught this language to their younger ones . Allegedly , the position of the larynx seems to be the reason for the unconquerable barrier in the communication between man and ape : in monkeys , the larynx is located high , which obstructs in speech production during speech , but the brain is sufficiently developed in chimpanzees and gorillas for communicating with man , though , understandably , it has constraints - associated with several millions of years of independent evolution in various ecological niches in different directions . Who are the ancestors ? : Therefore , Darwin 's simian theory solved the question of the relationship between man and apes in the 20th century itself . Also , the results of the findings give evidence to the purely " terrestrial " nature of man , pointing out that the serious fundamental basis do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our planet . It is indisputable now , that the chimpanzee , gorilla and orang-utan are our closest relatives . But , another important question needs to be addressed for the Darwinian theory of anthropogenesis to be completely correct . If evolution gradually led from ancient ape to man , then there should be some " intermediate " - " apeman " . This was raised by E.

The pioneering technique will take an ovarian tissue with immature eggs from a woman , and freeze them until a woman decides to conceive and have a baby . At that time the immature eggs are cultivated with a special hormone to grow into mature eggs ready for fertilization . Such fertility treatment breakthrough is especially important for business women who are too busy to start a family , but want to make sure they will be able to have a baby later . In this contest let us show how life would be different if humans laid eggs and hatched from eggs ( e.g. like birds ) . Some examples are : a woman holding an egg with a hatching baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also show fully grown adult humans - politicians and celebrities , or anyone else - hatching from eggs or laying eggs . For the purposes of this contest we will allow both men and women to lay eggs . Please make sure your entries are safe for work . <p> Decent concept . I would experiment and see if a white egg with higher contrast would fit better . <p> Also , watch your light sources . The egg should be lighter towards the top left with the area next to her arm slightly darker and underneath her arm/hands the darkest . You will need to slightly darken her dress too below the egg as it is now blocking the light source from above which was shining through the gap between her arms . <p> Thank you for the suggestions ! There was no gap of light , as there is a violin in her lap , but I had forgotten the shadows her arms , as well as the egg mass itself , would make on the bottom , and on the skirt . I appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown " eggs would fit , and that a white egg would be too " glaring , " but I think this is a reasonable compromise . Again , thank you for the suggestion ! <p> This is a nice combination of colour schemes.There is some masking debris around the perimeter of the child and you will need just a slight shadow from the left cast by the egg on the monkey just to establish a bit of space between the shell and the baby . Perhaps just a slight darkening too of the shell to the back/right of the baby to coincide with the lighting on the baby . <p> I like this egg but agree that it needs to cast some shadow for realism . Unless the egg is levitating , of course ! <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : Pregnancy lasts for approximately 40 weeks ( The pregnancy period may vary from 38 to 42 weeks ) . For convenience , the term " obstetric month " is used in practice , which is the equivalent to 4 weeks . As a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between calendar and obstetric months : Pregnancy lasts for 9 calendar months or 10 obstetric months . Our calendar is maintained according to obstetric months . From conception up to the fourth week : 1 . Ovulation : Approximately on the 14th day of menstrual cycle , the ovum matures and is ready for fertilization . It comes out of the ovary and falls into the uterine fallopian tube , where it remains viable for up to 24 hours ; If fertilization does not occur , then ovum degenerates and comes out with the uterine discharges during next . 2 . Fertilization : The sperm contains a substance , which dissolves the membrane of the ovum that allows the spermatozoid to penetrate into it . After this , other sperm can not penetrate inside . The spermatozoid merges with the ovum and the single cell embryo is formed , the Zygote . A large quantity of sperm flow back and a portion of spermatozoids , which are already inside the female organism , can not reach the target but some of them through the cervix of uterus fall into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fallopian tubes . Here , spermatozoids can remain viable for 48 hrs. 3 . Division of fertilized cell : Moving down along the fallopian tube , the fertilized ovum starts dividing into multiple cells . 4 . Movement towards uterus : The Zygote reaches the cavity of uterus approximately on the 4th day after fertilization . By this time , it resembles a ball containing liquid . The ball is very small and undifferentiated but already contains around 100 cells . In subsequent days , the zygote moves inside the uterus. 5 . Implantation : By the end of the 3rd week , the zygote penetrates into the soft uterine wall . This is called implantation . As soon as the zygote gets securely implanted in the wall , the fertilization process is accomplished . The outer cells of the embryo penetrate into the epithelium of the uterus and join with the blood vessels of uterus to develop into the placenta in the later stages . Other cells develop into the umbilical cord and membranes , protecting the fetus . The inner cells divide into three layers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6 . Sex of the child : The sex of the child is determined by the chromosomal set of spermatozoids . The spermatozoid with the male set of chromosomes moves faster but is short-lived in comparison with the female set . Therefore , if the conception occurs in the ovulation period ( around 14 days before menstruation ) the chances of having a male child increases and the probability of having a girl child increase if the conception occurs 2-3 days before . 7 . Expected date of delivery : The period from the time of conception till the birth of a child should be approximately 266 days . In order to calculate the expected date of delivery ( EDD ) ( in a 28 day menstrual cycle , where ovulation occurs on the 14th day ) , count 280 days ( 266+14 ) from the 1st day of the last menstrual period ( LMP ) .

His efforts were crowned with the advent of the new vocabulary of realism , just as it was possible to be done in contemporary literature by the brothers Goncourt ( **26;0;TOOLONG and Alfred ) and Emile Zola . Critics complained of the arbitrariness of the strange points of view , the cut shapes and sloping floors in his paintings . These elements were part of the ideology of realism-naturalism .

While Renoir and Monet enjoyed the warmth of family , Degas lived alone in his bachelor apartment , cluttered with a chaotic conglomeration of luxury dusty canvases , objects and rare carpets . Death had claimed many of his closest buddies and his nasty nature deprived him of the society of the few surviving friends . Paul ValTry , who sometimes came to visit Degas in the studio , left a description of a joyless existence of an almost blind artist , who could not write , but drew only a little using charcoal . However , at the age of 80 , he was already a recognized artist , his paintings were sold at fabulous prices for that time . Edgar Degas died on September 27 , 1917 in Paris at the age of 83 years , being recognized as a master and popular painter , by rights considered as one of the brightest representatives of impressionism , the original creator .

A crater on Mercury was named in honor of Edgar Degas . Creative manner : Renoir once remarked that " if Degas had died at fifty , he would have been remembered as a great artist , and nothing more . However , after fifty years of age his creativity expanded so much that he actually became Degas . " Perhaps , here Renoir is not quite right . By the time when Degas turned 30 , he created paintings that are included in the treasury of world art .

Such expansion of the style coincided with the increased interest of Degas to pastels , which gradually became his main material for drawing . In his oil paintings , Degas never attempted to portray a broken texture , the favorite of Impressionists , preferring to paint in a quiet flat style . However , in the works , the artist 's approach to pastels becomes much bolder , and he uses color as freely as he used it while working with chalk or charcoal . Pastel , in fact , is on the borderline between drawing and painting , and Degas himself said that it allows him to become a " colorist to the line " .

In fact , this flag , for the first time , was documented in 1700 - it was seen from the British warship on the mast of a French pirate ship of Captain Emanuel Wynn in the waters between Haiti and Cuba . It quickly gained popularity - by 1725 , the flags were used by luminaries such as John Quelch , Christopher Condent , Edward Teach , Edward England , Thomas Coklin , Howell Davis , Bartholomew Roberts , John Taylor , Edward Low and La Buse .

The most unproven version attributes it to the Indian pirate named Ali Raja , which was transformed by the British into Olly Roger and then into Jolly Roger . But Ali was not a robber but commanded the fleet of the powerful prince Haidar Ali , who fought with the British . It is doubtful the French suggestion that the filibusters of the 17th century called their " blood-red flag , " Jolie Rouge " - " beautiful red " and British colleagues once again modified it in their own way .

The first category attack the small vessels in port or on the road to steal something that is bad or just rob a group , as the over-drunken visitors of a bar are robbed . As a rule , they are armed with clubs and knives and sometimes with pistols and approach the vessel on light boats . The second category - well equipped gangs with high-speed boats , guns , informants in ports , external tracking facilities and sophisticated mobile phones at their disposal . They intercept the ships , travelling at low speed or along the shores . Naturally , criminals know in advance what kind of vessel they want and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not make friends with the passengers on board : they either kill the passengers or throw them overboard . Only very recently , the robbers began to take the crew and passengers as hostages for ransom . Finally , the third and most dangerous type of pirates - is organized criminal syndicates with a complex structure of branched networks of marine brokers and freighters , links with corrupt bureaucrats and police officers at all levels . They , of course , have weapons and radar and satellite communication facilities .

The White House now estimates that an average of 40.5 million people , which more than an eighth of the population , will get food stamps each month .

( true , during the dot com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chances at getting hired for uber-yuppy jobs . <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , known as the program to issue food stamps / coupons is a federal program to help unemployed and low-income citizens in USA . The US Ministry for Agriculture monitors the program . Presently , the major portion is distributed with the help of plastic cards ; however , paper coupons with denominations of 1 , 5 and 10 US dollars were earlier used for this purpose . Specified food stamps could be used for buying any products in shops ( for example , it was possible to buy soft drinks or confectionery ) . In the late 1990s , paper coupons were replaced by debit plastic cards called special EBT systems and due to this , the mention of food stamps disappeared from the program name in 2008 . As of March 2009 , food stamp aid was received by 33.2 million citizens the highest number from the time of initiating the program . The average monthly grant per citizen constituted $113.87 USD . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conform to specific criteria , first of all , with respect to income . History : US Secretary for Agriculture Henry Agard Wallace and the first program administrator Milo Perkins were instrumental in chalking out the first Food Stamp Program . Here is what Mr. Perkins had to say about the necessity of upholding the program : " The country is divided by gorge . Farmers with surplus products are on one side of it and on the other side the underfed urban population with stretched out hands . We should construct a bridge over this chasm . " The following principle is the basis of the food stamp program : citizens , receiving welfare payments and buying edible products on it , received an additional 50 % subsidy from the state , which in turn , could be used for buying additional food products . Orange and blue colored paper food coupons were used for the program . Commencement of the program - May 16 , 1939 , total number of aid recipients - 20 million , maximum number of recipients who received subsidy - 4 million , total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was curtailed in the spring of 1943 when the situation in the country stabilized . After curtailing the food stamp program , discussions continued in the Senate for a long period about the necessity of its resumption and the program was recommenced in pilot mode on May 29 , 1961 . From 1964 , the food stamp program received constant status and from 1974 national status . Program conditions changed and most significant changes were incorporated in 1977 , 1993 , 1996 &amp; 2002 . Program criticism : The main objective of the food stamp program of the discounted purchase of products is to improve the nourishment quality amongst low-income citizens . However , as practice has shown , the families receiving food coupons did not buy food products - the majority of the households , which saved money due to the exchange of coupons , spent the saved money on other things . Corruption and cheating cases were unearthed as in any gratuitous money distribution system . The citizens , participating in the food stamp program , started hiding their additional income in order to receive state aid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cash , coupon recipients often entered into an arrangement with sellers and sold them the coupons at a discounted price , for example a $400 coupon was sold for $200 . It is aprofitable even for the recipients of coupons he gets ready cash instead of products and the seller receives full cost of the coupon as compensation from the budget . Every ninth American uses food coupons . In March , due to the recession , 591 000 more citizens were compelled to use the benefits within the frameworks of the federal program of additional food grants . The Food Stamp Program , worked-out in 1960s , aimed to improve nourishment and increase the purchasing capacity of low-income families with respect to groceries . Coupons can be used only for payment towards products , drinks , seeds and plants for food crops . Food Stamps can not be used for purchasing alcohol , tobacco products , pet food , soaps , tooth-paste , toilet paper , un-prescribed ( OTC ) medicines and other non-food items irrespective of necessity . In March , the total number of program participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average monthly grant is $113.87 per person . In comparison with July 2000 , when the number of participants on the program was at a minimum for the last decade ( 16.8 million ) , the figure was doubled . Since last autumn , the recession took place in the American economy and employment opportunities were reduced by 6 million from the beginning of 2008 . In 1999 , plastic cards were used instead of paper food coupons . Every month , transfer onto the card is done automatically . Calculation is done with the help of reader like in the case of bank cards . Issue of plastic cards is not only applicable to those who are living in extreme poverty . The program is also available for those whose incomes slightly exceed the bottom line of the official cost of living , defining the poverty level . For the 48 continental states and the Columbia district , the poverty level for households consisting of 4 members was $22050 income per annum in 2009 . Similar figures for Alaska - $27570 and Hawaii - $25360 . From April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress to boost the American economy . So a family consisting of 4 members can now receive $80 more . According the data from the Food Research and Action Center , every eighth citizen is a welfare recipient . To be eligible for the food card it is necessary to adhere to some conditions , including financial and non-financial parameters . Cumulative income of a household should be less than 130% from the bottom line of the cost of living , defining the poverty level , net income - below 100% except for households with elderly and disabled persons . The value of accounted property ( for example , cheque and savings accounts , cash , shares and bonds ) should not exceed $2000.

In the first half of 2003 , Budejovicky Budvar sold 5,832,490 deciliters of beer and occupied 4th place amongst the Czech beer manufacturers . Very quickly Budweiser achieved improbable success on export front . For example , 1991 export to 18 countries worldwide , 1995 24 countries , 2000 56 countries on all five continents .

The diving sport is recently becoming popular among older people , which increased the average diver age to 38 years , compared to 35 years in 2000 . In order to prove that diving has always been popular , photoshop divers in art by turning any characters in famous paintings , drawings , or statues into divers . Add diving suits and diving equipment to them , or at least add a snorkel and a mask . <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : Diving is underwater swimming with special equipment . In the English language , from where the word is taken , " diving " means simply " diving " and is used for describing underwater swimming with equipment ( scuba diving ) or without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjectives - simply to " dive " . Types : Diving - swimming under the water with equipment , which provide a self-contained reserve of oxygen ( or other gas mixture ) for breathing under water from several minutes to 12 or more hours depending on the depth and the type of respiratory apparatus and requirements of the gas mixture by the diver . Diving can be divided into four categories : Recreational diving , recreational submersion - underwater swimming , aimed at taking rest and entertainment . Safety and accessibility are given the utmost importance . Opposite side of recreational diving - professional ( commercial ) diving , when the divers carry out work while submerged . As a rule , professional divers are paid by the customer and on the contrary , the recreational divers pay for going under water . Recreational diving can be subdivided into sports and technical diving . Sports diving have the following limitations : The maximum depth depends on the qualification of the diver . For instance , if the Deep Diver certificate is available , then the depth is 42 meters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Compressed air or Nitrox is used as a breathing mixture ; Diving is done only on " open water " but not in penetration diving , when access to the water surface is absent . Training is given to sports divers in several stages - from primary level ( Open Water Diver ) to Diver Master in PADI , NDL or NAUI systems . Each level expands the submersion limits . The certificate is issued after the end of each course . The diver has the flexibility to stop training at any stage depending on the purposes of his training . Various specializations exist , for instance : underwater photography , underwater video shooting , submersion in dry suits and others . Technical diving relaxes the sport diving restrictions according to the extent of preparation received by the diver in technical courses . Technical diving - IANTD , TDI and others define this term as any diving in penetration diving beyond the daylight zone , any diving , which exceeds 40 meters and requires decompression stops . Cave diving and deep diving are varieties of technical diving . Technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : diving deeper than 40 meters ( in some countries , deeper than 30 meters ) ; diving which requires decompression stops - go beyond the non-decompression limit ; penetration diving by more than 10 meters from exit up to the returning point ( ice diving , cave diving etc ) ; diving with accelerated decompression ; use of more than one breathing gas during a single dive : ( air , naitrox , trimix , heliox ) . Besides the above mentioned factors , technical diving distinguishes from regular recreational diving by thoroughness of planning , much stringent requirements to health , knowledge , equipment and the psychological preparation of the diver . The duplex equipment system is used in technical diving for enhancing the survival chances in the event of failure . Cave diving a type of technical diving , which is carried out in caves , where the so called penetration diving exists . It is a very dangerous type of diving and has extremely serious requirements for the divers skills , reliability of equipment and outfit configuration . It is characterized by the impossibility of immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in visibility from transparent water to absolute turbid in the shortest time periods , the presence of narrow entrances and exits and low water temperature . Deep diving - underwater diving into submerged open casts and neglected water bodies . It belongs to the extreme diving category . Characteristic features - muddiness of the water body and limited visibility . Diving World Records : Open cycle ( light weight diving outfit ) : Presently , the world record ( according to Guinness Book of World Records ) in the deep diving category using SCUBA is 318.25 meters , which was set on June 10 , 2005 by Nuno Gomes in Dahab ( Red Sea , Egypt ) . The actual record holder is Pascal Bernabe , who dived 330m deep , set on July 9 , 2005 .

Could you find a few more ? Also the source image link does n't go to the source.The face looks like it is crooked or of a different perspective than the head of the wolf . <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : If you take a close look at dogs and their owners the old saying that they are alike is actually right in 3 out of 10 pairs . So says the statistics of the recent study conducted by professor Nicholas Christenfeld of the University of California . Christenfeld took a random sample of the dogs and their owners and took pictures of them to study the visual similarities and behavioral patterns . Strong facial feature similarities were found in three out of ten cases . In other words dogs do look like their owners almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why does this happen , and specifically how does this happen ? The process has to do with the psychology of picking up pets , especially dogs by the future owners . When a person looks at mutts , he is naturally drawn to those that resemble him in looks or behavior . When they live together these similarities tend to grow bigger as they pick up the behavioral patterns from each other . Dogs , like children begin to resemble their owners in their behavior . Visual trait similarities ( especially hair style ) often remain and even increase through the years . The research study at the University of California even conducted an experiment . The photos of dogs and their owners were separated and given to a panel of people who were asked to possibly match back pairs of the owners and their dogs . The results were amazing - in over sixty percent of cases the pairs were matched correctly . Such a high statistical figure shows that similar visual traits do play a vital role in pet choosing , and it 's especially true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other pets . Dogs are also shown to have a higher intelligence than any other household pets . Christenfeld suggest that psychology plays a vital role in the choice of a mutt . Humans are naturally drawn to animals that resemble them either with visual traits or in behavior . Agricultural animals : Not all animals are equally domesticated . Agricultural animals are the most domesticated ones . They have a highly developed ability for adapting ( with the help of man ) to various external conditions . For example , they can tolerate extremely cold and hot conditions and eat not only the forages , which are available in nature , but also the ones that are prepared artificially . Such properties are possessed by the cow , sheep , horse and pig , and consequently they merged in the household . But there are also ones like the buffalo , camel , reindeer , llama or alpaca , which live only in particular regions - in the very cold , or in hot regions of Asia and Africa or on the high mountains of Peru . Pets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of animals think that man must not kill animals for meat and skin . The most hard-line vegetarians abstain even from milk and eggs . Pets are the source of foodstuffs ( milk , oil , cheese and other dairy products , and also meat , fat ) . Others are reared for making clothes and shoes . Some carry loads and carry out agricultural work . Sometimes animals are kept for pleasure , for example , some birds . However many birds are reared for getting useful products ( meat , eggs , feathers , fur ) . House insects are reared for obtaining useful products . Bees produce honey , and silkworms are reared for silk . Selective Breeding The main feature of pets which is used by the selective breeders is the variety of their qualities . This is used for raising various breeds . Thanks to laborious selection work , in the last two centuries some original animals have been transformed beyond recognition . Examples are the brachycerous cow , the Leicester and Southdown sheep , the English racer and carthorse , and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the organism of animals and the fixation of desirable heredity became possible because of the very long work , carried out by many generations of breeders . If we take the original animal and put it near to the developed animal , then the results of breeding often seem just impossible . The English bull weighs up to 50 to 70 pounds . The Russian country sheep weighs 50 - 60 pounds , the sheep of the Southdown breed is fattened up to 400-600 pounds , and besides this it gives 10-15 pounds of fine long wool . English pigs in one year reach the weight of 10-12 pounds ( for comparison , the Russian pig has to be raised for 3-4 years so as to attain this weight ) . Nothing more can be said about English racers and carthorses . An interesting example of changes in the features of pets depending upon the requirement of man is the merino sheep . The breeding of its hair-coat covering was determined by the changes in demand for different types of wool . In the last decades , sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other characteristics of the merino wool . At present selective breeders want to develop such breeds which could be useful in different ways . For example , in large horned livestock , they are trying to combine milking with the ability of fattening , and in sheep the production of good wool with meat . The works of the Blackwell and Collins brothers have shown that by means of selective breeding , it is possible to get desirable changes in the attributes of pets , and it is just a guess , whether there is any limit to these changes . Darwin in his world famous composition " the Origin of Species " has repeatedly referred to achievements of cattlemen in deducing new breeds of livestock . All chapter 1 of the book is devoted towards changes , which animals and plants undergo during their breeding processes .

Different things , liabilities and the article liabilities system can act as money . Types of money : Based on the natural material , money is divided into two basic types : Natural and Symbolic . Natural money . ( Substantial , commodity , authentic and natural ) Money , in a role appearing as commodities , possesses self value and utility . They can be used not only as a means of money ( for example , a gold coin can be melted into a jewelry item ) . Particularly all types of articles are of such money , which acts as an equivalent in the primary stages of development of goods circulation ( cattle , grains , fur skin , shells and so on. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze , with silver and golden full-weight coins . Different articles even today carry a money role in specific conditions . For example , the cigarettes by imprisoned people and the prisoners of the war , vodka and sugar during the periods of economical crisis , arms and ammunition in the places of military conflicts . But slowly natural money is going away from circulation . They are not comfortable for frequent rotations , get wiped off and spoil during storage . But the most important thing is their manufacturing process is much costlier . The requirement of money increases with the rise in the economy . For the government to handle the money system it becomes too expensive . The cost of money in such an economy always balances with the GDP scale , which diverts too many resources . The economy stands as noncompetitive . Even in the international currency market from the year 1973 the usage of the gold equivalent was stopped . At present , natural money is sometimes used as a means of savings . Most often they represent only a collector value . Symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have an individual value or it is disproportionate with the face value . Generally these are credit money . The following relates to such money : The banknote , Coins made of cheap alloys , for example , on aluminum bases ( billion coins ) Electronic money , including in terms of records in the bank accounts ; Cheques ; Promissory notes ; Bonds ; Other valuable papers . Today the basic form of money is electronic ( cashless ) money and banknotes . With the distribution of plastic cards , banknotes are slowly being expulsed from conversion . Basic functions of money : Money develops one self through its functions . Usually , money emphasizes functions such as : Value measurement . Different articles are compared and exchanged among themselves on the basis of the exchange equivalent calculation of these goods for money . For the articles the rates will be appeared . Money is also used during the registration of the value terms of some economical parameter or liability records . Means of circulation .

For describing the light degree , with which any type of resources may be changed into a circulation means which is accepted in the economy , used in the concept of liquidity . Means of hoarding . The function of the means of hoarding is fulfilled by the money , directly not participating in the rotation . Money as a means of hoarding permits us to carry over the purchasing power from the present to the future . However , the purchasing power depends on inflation . These three alternative functions as per their point divides the monetary stock into integrated parts : money acts either as a means of hoarding ( saving ) , or as a means of circulation . Other functions of money Means of payment . The yielded ( the saved , the accrued ) debts and other liabilities are comfortable to consider and demand clearance in the form of money .

The value of money , as a means of saving , is defined as a rate of interest that is the price for the usage of the borrowed ( taken in credit ) money .

The tiger temperament-wise , is similar to a kingly lion , and it loves : admires and praises emphasizing its importance . It carries with itself strength and action , power and ambitions , defying the conservative rules and hierarchies developed in decades . If you are not an ordinary personality , who is not afraid of strength tests then this is your year . It portends highs and lows , grandiose fights and unattainable heights . House decoration : To be in the good books of the yellow metal tiger select a New Year dTcor of golden or silver shades . The privileges of the coming year are luxury and pathos . Your house should be decorated with various types of ornaments . Apart from standard symbols be innovative and imaginary " Decorate " the house with unusual items . For example , arrange metal vases with fruit or hang golden bells . Also , festive ornamentation could contain a horn with incrustation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a similar ornament shall by all means please the Tiger . The attire , in which it is good to invite a Tiger : The tiger loves bright shades but it does not want to dress-up in order to compete with a Christmas tree . It is better to have red shades ( once again the Bull 's heel ) , solar and of course , striped ensembles rather flattering for a the Tiger . Rich and natural materials should be selected : leather , silk , suede and others . It is possible to combine all these things and create a variety . The important thing is the gracefulness of the silhouette . Tight-fit knitted jackets and trousers , tight-fit jackets or narrow skirts with a high belt can be worn . By the way , it would be more appropriate to welcome the year with a zodiac sign of a noble animal by organizing a fancy-dress party , a hit of which would be striped vests and plush vests , embroidered with bugle beads and Lurex ! If your approach is serious and your wardrobe is restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be like magnificent costume jewellery as well as precious products . Big bright beads or massive bracelets , glittering brooches and huge earrings will , by all means , put the Tiger in high spirits . The coming year is marked with the sign of yellow metal and therefore , do not go on a shopping spree for accessories on New Years Eve . Let the beautiful ladies beautify their hair with hairpins with belts and decorative buckles . However , it is necessary to select these with taste the Tiger does not stand negligence . According to the recommendations of astrologers , it is necessary to welcome in the new year in new shoes , even if you are celebrating the festival at home in your family circle . The ladies shoes should be made of leather with a mat-finish or patent-leathered and with bright accessories - buckles or lacing . The tiger treats men 's footwear , probably , more indifferently and therefore specific recommendations do not exist . The festive table : Let 's begin with its decoration . This year , candles are one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be of two colors , preferably a gamma- band , golden , purple or pure white . Cover the table with cloth and place your best dinner set and do not forget about the zodiac sign of the coming year . Place a big figure of a Tiger in the centre of the table or place tiny Tiger figures between the bowls . It would turn out to be original if the paper napkins with the Tiger image can be procured . Regarding refreshments , the main component of the New Year 2010 snacks are all kinds of meat : assorted meat pieces and bar-be-cue , steaks and kebabs , meat salads and cold-baked pork . However , if you happen to be vegetarian , do not worry about loosing out on being in the good books of the whimsical Tiger . An abundance of vegetables ( beetroot , carrots , potatoes and greens ) , beans and even Soya products on the table are also welcomed . Now , we discuss drinks . This year , carafes and bottles should sparkle in amber , red or claret colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognac , stewed fruits from cherries or peaches , orange or carrot juices . Remember , alcohol-abuse is not recommended this year so as not to be like one more eternal enemy of the Tiger - the Monkey .

@@77659296 @6359296/ <p> The Scottish independence referendum is on September 18 . The voters will be asked one question " Should Scotland be an independent country ? " and can choose either " Yes " or " No " . There 's no third option for the undecided voters , who can either make up their mind , or make the ballot void by choosing both answers or choosing none . Up till September , polls showed a slight lead in " No " voters which was quite comforting for London , but the very recent polls show a slight lead in " Yes " voters , meaning that Scotland will likely split from the 300 year UK union . Analysts predict a series of consequences after such outcome - the pound will sink about 5-10% against other currencies , and what 's even worse this will give momentum to the growing movement for the UK to exit the European Union .

There 's also a big discussion whether it should be legalized . Current American laws vary from state to state , but most consider marijuana to be a drug , classified pretty much the same as other heavier drugs . Thus its possession and distribution is outlawed in most states - some will allow possession of small amounts for personal consumption only . Most people who use cannabis argue that this is no more of a drug than simple tobacco , and smoking it is no more of a crime that cigarettes which are legal and sold to everyone over legal age . The Netherlands has been the first country to make it legal for the above reasons and also for several for medical reasons . It 's been clinically proved that medical marijuana use helps patients get over pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research also proved that marijuana stagnates the growth of cancer in lab animals . People have been growing marijuana since ancient times . Its leaves and seeds were found in the old tombs of the Incas and Egyptian pharaohs . Many tribes in Africa and Australia still grow it and use it in their celebrations , weddings , and burials , claiming that smoking marijuana help them hear the spirits and talk to the dead . Some tribes still make massive bonfires burning the leaves of the " dragon grass " as they call it , for over 24 hours , thus exposing all members of the tribe including children to the smoke with hallucinogens in it . Such bonfires are usually accompanied by dancing and all night long celebrations of important holidays and events in the life of the tribe . Scientists claim that cannabis is native to central Asia , where travelers usually got marijuana seeds to bring to other countries . Many famous songs and paintings were created under the impression of this drug , which opens the boundaries of imagination and helps release the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short term : The effect appears almost immediately after smoking marijuana and reaches a peak within 30 minutes and continues from 2 to 4 hours .

They can be identified in the blood on the third day and in urine , on eighth day of abstention after a single dose . In case of long-term regular abuse , the metabolites of cannabinoids can be found in the urine for several weeks . Physiological effects : The following are the main physiological developments due to the effect of marijuana on the organism : * Conjunctivitis of eyeballs ( reddening ) ; * Tachycardia ( increase in the speed of heartbeats ) and as consequence , an increase in blood pressure ; * Mouth dryness . Psychological effects of cannabis ( the general term for designating the psychoactive products of hemp ) include euphoria , oneiroid condition , calmness and drowsiness ( or sleeplessness , which depends on the person ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases the sensitivity to external stimulus , allows remembering the details , which passed earlier unnoticed , makes colors brighter and rich and also increases the perception of music and art , and experience time as if it is slowed down and it seems that much is taking place every moment . Concerning the identification of new details , which were unnoticed earlier it is possible it takes place due to changes in the perception of the priority system . So , for example , it can appear that under the influence of marihuana , it is much more pleasant to contemplate natural phenomena rather than the activities of people . An increased sensitivity to sounds and to everything that takes place around the person taking hemp is also often observed . A set of fine details and particulars are given the same importance as in the case of other events . An inexplicable panic fear ( " treason " ) was sometimes observed . In this case , the effect of marijuana does not exclude the possibility of a sufficient assessment of ambient conditions , which is explained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public places . Some researchers consider that the last effect ( episodes of panic fear ) is the consequence of the stimulation of the brain sections responsible for imagination and creativity thus not leaving place for self-control .

Paranoid ideas may arise in them but at the same time , they laugh over these ideas . De-personalization and de-realization can occur . This ability to retain objectivity is explained by many cases , when smokers manage quietly to behave in public places even when they are under a strong intoxicated condition . Except for the aggravated attention to ambient details and episodes of fear or fun , intoxication by marijuana is usually characterized by an increased raised appetite : usually , the person under the influence of marijuana is capable of eating his usual daily ( or several ) portions of a meal in a single go ( " Swine " ) but experienced smokers usually control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flavor receptors increases and the meal seems to be several times tastier than usual .

It is silent , constrained and sluggish , exact and methodical and the original mind and intellect are concealed under these external features . The bull ( cow , ox ) is a rather conservative sign and it dislikes innovations which disturb its quiet spirit . Care towards family is the character of the bull and the family of the Bull prospers and the bull is the family 's powerful support . How to welcome the New Year of the Bull ?

It is quite logical that if it is a Bull a domesticated animal , then it is better to celebrate the New Year with family . It is necessary to select the menu thoroughly : the future symbol of 2009 - the Bull - does not like carelessness . Vegetarian food is welcomed on the table : green salad , vegetables and fruits . This year it is better to be cautious with meat especially with beef . The symbol of the year will not be delighted if you celebrate New Year with snacks , made from a similar kind of meat .

You , as an ox , may have to work on earth , even in a figurative sense . According to astrological estimations , the New Year of 2009 the Year of the Earth Bull will fall on the 29th of January . The Ox a workaholic and plebeian . Therefore , it may seem to us that the year develops with great difficulty and slowly .

Remember that all workers , though slowly , but confidently achieve the target and unexpectedly , the plebeian transforms into the patrician . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freeloaders . After all , an ox is a ploughman and a farmer . It always puts in a lot of work till it is put into his shed . And , the coming New Year 2009 , if you do not shirk and scratch the head as some others do thinking where and what to fell but instead work by the sweat of one 's brow as the ox , then you will be rewarded accordingly for the services and unexpectedly , a financial gift will come your way and you will prosper . While celebrating the Year of Bull , make sure that beef is not served on your table since the bull may get offended . But then , simply moo or pull a face at your magnificent neighbor . And while celebrating the New Year , do not be overzealous with New Year costumes . An ox is a workaholic and dislikes magnificent , bright and fanciful costumes .

Out-of-body experiences ( OoBE ) are considered paranormal . Though , these kinds of phenomena have been reported since the ancient times , they have never been proved scientifically . Not even a single satisfying explanation of the given phenomenon is available so far . Out-of-body experience is also known as an " astral projection " , " astral tour " , and " exteriorization " . Almost one-fourth of the western elder generation , according to them , has experienced this phenomenon , at least once in their life . OoBE could be caused by bilocation , appearance of dual personalities , crisis visions , and mutual sightings and near death experiences . Mystic people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hell , were capable of surviving OoBE in the alien spheres of existence . In some of the cases of OoBE , a physical or ghost-shaped form of that person , from which it got formed , has become visible to other people . In other cases , the person , from whom the projection was formed , could see others , being invisible to them . In those cases , when the person 's double was visible to other surrounding people , he looked just like a copy of the real person right up to the clothes . Some people , who survived OoBE , said that , during this experience , they have felt the flashes of light or energy flows . Others say that they touched up on some kind of silver thread , so-called astral thread , which was joining their projection with the physical body . They also said that they travelled with the speed of thoughts and all the material objects were seemed to them like ghosts . Researchers , studying OoBE , are unable to exactly identify what is this all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a real projection , having some kind of form , reminding an astral body ; this is a projection of consciousness , which is seemed to others as if having a physical form , it is a hallucinatory experience ; it is a mental projection , characterised by extra-sensory reception , - either it is a clairvoyance , or a telepathy , or it could be both at the same time . If there is a certain form , which is capable of separating itself from the body , and then again entering the same , then it is just impossible to scientifically explain and measure the same . Psychiatrist Karl Gustav Yung stated that , at least in some the cases of OoBE the projections are archetypes , hypothetic primordial collective unconscious constituents , which , according to Yung , are common for the whole human hood . In spite of the absence of any evidence , the belief that the consciousness is capable of separating itself from the body is common for all the nations . Ancient Egyptians had faith in " a wandering " ka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in soul ( " ba " ) . Plato also considered that the soul can leave a body and start travelling on its own . Other Greece and Roman philosophers , such as Socrates , Pliny , Plotinus and Plutarch , described the experiences , resembling OoBE . In Shamanism , the main activity of Shaman is leaving the body and starting a journey to another world . In majority of the cases , the OoBE takes place spontaneously . Often during the periods of grave injuries and stresses , as it was noticed in cases of crisis visions , a dying person projects himself away from his body and starts observing other living people . Some of the people are capable of causing their projection on their own ( see Bilocation ) . The research on OoBE is being conducted from the end of the 19th Century . One of the famous experiments was of Sylvan Muldoon , who was experiencing OoBE spontaneously since the age of 12 years . Muldoon , who was an American , has studied these experiences from 1915 to 1950 . He says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muldoon was a sick kid and as his health got deteriorated , his OoBE were occurring very often . He wrote a book about his experiences and research work " Projection of Astral Body " ( 1929 ) with the co-author and the scientist of psychic affairs , Hereward Carrington . Modern laboratory experiments with the people , who , according to them , were capable of projecting themselves out of the body on their own , gave controversial and contradictory results . People , who were projected at a far distance recurrently , gave unreliable description of the places , which perhaps they see . The ESP tests pertaining to the experiments on OoBE gave sporadic results . Tests on the behaviour of animals , which were supposedly influenced by the person experiencing OoBE , gave very interesting but extremely uncertain results . The tests , conducted during sleep , have shown that the OoBE are not connected with dreams , which take place during so-called rapid eye movement stage of sleep .

Lightens , hey , God bless ya that you have a smart enough head on your shoulders to express an opinion . But there-in is the catch . Often " Opinions " especially ones that do not fall in harmony with the subject or content of the chop are considered the kiss of death .

I have suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news/fair weather level and try to stick to technical pointers and critiques and save the opinions for the forums where yeah , if it gets to the level of stupid and disruptive , the mods will toss it out like a shark in the bath-water .

I propose that such can be veiled attempts to minimize another 's art in some cases and thus foul play . That is why I advise people to stick to technical critiques rather than risk the chance of being grouped in with those lacking sufficent confidence in their own stuff that they feel the need to minimize anothers work .

Each year we lose an hour of sleep as we " Spring Forward " and turn the hands ahead one hour . Daylight Saving Time was instituted in the United States during World War I in order to save energy for war production by taking advantage of the later hours of daylight between April and October . Daylight Savings Time ( DST ) begins each year at 2:00 a.m. on the second Sunday in March in most of the United States and its territories .

Many thanks to TheNutter for the themepost . <p> Nice idea and execution . You might consider replacing the wall paper with something more appropriate to an office setting ... a subtler design with a softer hue , or wood paneling . And , adding more evolutionary figures to the clock , 1 thru 12 , each pointing in a clockwise direction starting with the earliest life form and then progressing through time . <p> Best work ... possibly made by God like the Buddhist monks covering their mouth and ears and eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is really heart touching well done <p> I like the composition but not too sure about the choice of colors here . For Einstein and sience it 's be better to have less vivid colors . I would decrease the saturation and make the color pattern closer to black and white . Just because Einstein and his work dates back to the " vintage times " <p> Great composition . In my opinion his hat should be lowered a bit and with less gradient

In honor of the FN 's 10th anniversary this contest runs with triple jackpots ! <p> Seeing that the light is coming from the left , I believe you should have the bevel highlights reversed , hidden . And , do n't go with the default black and white ... go with shades of the FN color . <p> I think we could all use one of these <p> Perhaps pcrdds is right . But when I first glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to make the centerpiece appear raised . If that 's the case , the highlight/shadow should not be reversed.Either way , I 'd consider rotating the highlight arcs to ten and four , rather than three and nine . <p> I agree with pcr . I think this FN commemorative ring is a very appropriate and clever idea , but the image appears to be fairly low-res and fuzzy . There are many better hi-res source images of similar rings to choose from . Maybe replace the outer circular ring with a sharper overlay and darken the background for more contrast . JMO . <p> Hmmm , well , I am still a relative beginner , please be gentle . I did a pic grab , I did not alter the dimensions of the image at all , so that is the correct ratio , even if it looks a little weird . It could be the dyslexic effect .

Hidden 's ratio is 437:539 ( or 0.811:1 ) . <p> Simply put , this means two things:1 ) : Hidden 's image is thinner than PSMandrake 's , in relation to height.2 ) : I 've got too much time on my hands . <p> It is possible that those who think the ratio is off are looking at their browsers at regular view . ( Where you can see the address bar and all the buttons and so on . ) I expanded the screen to full screen where you can not see the buttons and did the screen grab . <p> Please also note that the aspect ratio looks different in each type of browser , such as Oprah , Firefox , and Internet Explorer , and can depend on how many buttons you 've got . <p> Personally , I find this fascinating , as I ca n't see the off aspect ratio . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am using Gimp ( it 's free and comes with my Linux distro ) to photoshop , which is quite different than Photoshop or even Corel Draw or Corel Photopaint .

Rats harm the human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers of helminthic and other lot of infection diseases . At present there are so many rat lovers ( rat-farmers ) , which hold domestic cats at their houses . Domestic rats are generally descendants of domesticated gray ( stepsons ) or rarely black rats . The average life is 2-4 years ; the maximum-recorded life is 7 years 4 months . Male rats generally weigh on average 400 to 800 grams and female rats , 250 to 450 grams . Female rats are generally calm and affectionate , female rats are more active and sportive . Domestic rats are classified to several types , sections and grades . Part of the names of the wool covering and coloring of rats is borrowed from cats and dogs . Houses of rats Special beautiful cages or multi level cages are very much suitable for polecats or chinchillas . Generally , cages for polecats are very small and wheels with small dimensions are very dangerous for rats and may damage their tails . Such may be the cage for rats . It is necessary to fence the rats from droughts and direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use cellulose , corn or cellulose-mineral fillers . Hay badly absorbs the smell , and saw dust may serve as a tick source . Feeders from coniferous wood have a negative effect on rats , as their resins are extremely harmful for their respiratory system . Rats are social and it is better to keep them as single gender pairs . In this case , rats generally interact with human beings and go for walk . The mating of rats : The basic rule during the introduction of old and new rats is that it should take place in neutral territory . Before keeping the animals in a single cage , it is necessary to clean thoroughly to remove the existing smell . The mating of adult male rats takes time and is a difficult process . The adult male rats are generally loyal to the young generation , where they do not anticipate competitors . The co-existence of rats and other domestic animals * Dogs and cats may co-exist with rats under the condition of observance due to precautionary conditions , and in the absence of clearly expressed hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not compatible . Big birds are harmful for rats and serve as food for them . And also , it is not recommended to allow joint strolls of tortoises and rats . * Rabbits and sea pigs - there are examples of the successful handling of rats with these animals , but for preventing any unfortunate cases , better to keep them in different cages , and allow joint strolls under supervision . * Mice , hamsters and other small rodents - the keeping of rats with mice and hamsters is dangerous for the latter ones . Dangers lie in wait for rats during a walk in living areas . Many rats like the wires very much , especially in a soft shell . That 's why , it is extremely not recommended to keep them in freely accessible places . Boxes and crimps generally help with this problem . Rats also may bite any objects of furniture and household items . The specific weaknesses entirely depend on the individuality of the rat and may vary from being completely harmless to total destruction . For a rat , always there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being , that 's why while stepping or sitting , it is necessary to take care to avoid the injury of rats . Some individuals may be very curious and may try to go out of the quarter , into walls or underground . The behavior of rats in darkness is almost the same as in illuminated conditions as the sight plays a secondary role for rats . Rats not trained for being in cages may find other housing within the quarter . Trained ones generally come back to their cages on their own any time . You can cheat the rat by offering a delicacy . If the shelter is known , then you can try to spray non-toxic spray or water from a spray gun . Jumps and climbing : Rats may jump to enough height and enough length . It is necessary to consider , that rats may climb on curtains , jump to one-meter length and down . Generally rats like to climb on human beings and to avoid scratches , it is better to carry them with full hands while handling them . Diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables and fruits , boiled meat and eggs . Though rats may consume less water in a balanced diet , it is necessary to keep water in the cage desirably in nipple bottles . The following products give side effects to the rats : gaseous drinks , bean stuff , chocolate , raw potato , raw red and Brussels cabbage , raw artichoke , green banana and spinach . Breeding On average , one female rat may give birth up to 20 rats every 1.5 months . In connection with this , it is not desirable to hold the rats of different sex in one place . Sterilization is possible , but it may result in different consequences and that 's why it is used predominately as per medical check up results and for controlling the aggressiveness of male rats . The duration of pregnancy for rats is 20 to 25 days . After giving birth , small rats should be with their mother for 4 to 5 weeks , as during this period , immunity will be formed and training takes place . After this , it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid unplanned descendants . In zoo-shops , very frequently this is not considered , which results in the purchasing of already pregnant rats . Mating of domestic rats with wild rats : The mating of domestic rats , with wild gray color rats and getting descendants is possible . Mating with black rats is not possible . In case of artificial fertilization , the pregnancy ends with abortion . The character and habits of descendants of domestic and wild rats are less predictable . There is a requirement of high alertness and aggressiveness in relation to human beings . And also , equally take care to improve the health and heredity . Diseases and old age " The average duration of life of a decorative rat is about 2 years . Some rats in rare cases live up to 3.5 years . So many factors effect the life duration , including heredity , care , balanced diet and preventive health care . Among rat-farmers , there is an opinion that a decorative rat may live up to 5-7 years under respective care . But experience accumulated in many years by rat-farmers shows that this is incorrect .

The result can be quite surprising - some people look almost the same while others are hardly recognizable - it also depends a great deal on the facial expression of the person on the original image . See an example we quickly created and compare with the original - Hillary Duff .

For this purpose , they invented an entire science , which they used to call " physiognomy " ( off course in the old Chinese language , the name was different ) . In two words this is the skill of face reading . To express that in a more simple language , the reading of character and fortune as per the lines in the face .

FOREHEAD If the round , high , ratable head with a forehead having temples that forms convexity , not covered with hair this is the sign of intellectual superiority , and a tendency to ceremonial pride . Such people also have generosity . A high and smooth forehead means a feature gifted nature . Example : Sandra Bullock .

But double vision can be also achieved with the effects of Photoshop - example 1 and example 2 . I do n't know about you , but I feel a virtual hangover just by looking at any of those pictures and my brain starts going nuts . To show the effects of double vision , take any celebrities or politicians and double their eyes and mouth at the same time , similar to how it 's done in the example 1 and example 2 .

Usually , diplopia is connected with constraints on movements of one eye ; hence two eyes simultaneously can not see the same object . This may be related to defects in the nerves or muscles which control the movements of the eye or a mechanical restriction on movements of the eyeball in fovea . Double vision , not ceasing when an eye is closed may be linked with the beginning of a cataract . More often diplopia happens when a weakness ( paresis ) paralysis of one of the oculomotor muscles occurs , or when the concurrent actions of the eyeballs fail due to which a projected picture falls on non-corresponding ( aligned at different distances from the yellow spot ) points of the retina of both eyes . Features of diplopia : Binocular vision always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . Rarely ( for instance , after trauma , when divulsion of the iris root occurs and as if two pupils take shape , or in subluxation of the crystalline lens ) it is monocular vision one and the same object gives two pictures in one eye . When the other eye is closed double vision does not cease . Diplopia studies mean a lot for determining the paralysis of the oculomotor muscles occurring often in several common diseases ( cephalitis , brain hemorrhage etc . ) . Diplopia may occur due to failures in the central parts of the visual tract and failures in muscle balance due to weakness functions of the affected eye muscles , which causes deviations and absence of mobility of the eye to the one or other side . The deviation of the eye causes a projection of an object 's picture , examined by both eyes , into non-identical ( disparate ) parts of the retina . The causes of double vision are paralysis , or the paresis of the oculomotor muscles ( often Oculomotorius muscles is the result of injuries to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) . Diplopia-symptoms : The patient complains of the doubling of things . The feature of doubling depends upon the distribution of the process : when straight muscles are affected parallel doubling is observed , when loxotic muscles are affected , things when doubled may be " aligned " one on the other , when in paralytic strabismus doubling appears towards the direction of the gaze to the affected muscle 's side . Deviation of the eyeball to the one or other side is objectively defined : when in paralytic strabismus , the movement of the eyeball to the side of the affected muscle is absent or limited . In inflectional diseases , meningitis , brain vascular diseases , allantiasis - symptoms of the respected diseases are observed . Diplopia emergency hospital care is defined by the nature of the main disease . Trauma of the skull urgent hospitalization in a neurosurgery or traumatology department . Phlogotic infectional diseases and allantiasis - contagious isolation ward . In emergency cases hospitalization is recommended in accordance with the course of the main disease and the general condition of the patient .

Today 's category is the " best animal picture " . All the entries were nominated by the Freaking News staff , so this contest is for voting only . Authors , please feel free to edit your authors comments , but please do n't change the titles or otherwise edit the entries . <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : Mammals ( Latin : Mammalia ) is a class of vertebrate animals , the basic distinctive features of which they are viviparous ( with an exception of cloaca class ) and feed their babies with milk . Birds , fish , reptiles and amphibians belong to the class of mammals amongst the vertebrates . In some classifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are studied as identical and in other classifications , wild animals were associated to a subclass in the class of mammals ( the overwhelming majority of modern kinds belong to this class ) , referred to as the sub class Prototheria . Anatomy : Respiratory system : Mammals breathe with the help of lungs , which differ with the huge branching of the branchi . Very thin bronchi , bronchioles , have thin-walled micro sacks that are located at the ends of bronchioles ( alveoli ) , which are densely braided with capillaries . Circulatory system : Mammals have a four chambered heart . It consists of the right and left ventricles and also the right and left atria . The chambers of the heart communicate between themselves and with the great vessels with the help of valves . The heart supplies oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of the body and also frees them from disintegration products . Excretory system : In mammals , the kidneys possess a bean-shape look and are located in the lumbar region on each side of the backbone ( vertebra ) . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidneys and then , urine flows down along the ureters into the urinary bladder . From the urinary bladder , the urine comes out through the urethra . Nervous system : The forebrain and its cortex are especially developed in mammals . The cortex is formed by several layers of bodies of nervous cells and covers the entire forebrain . It forms folds and convulsions with deep furrows in the majority of mammals . The more folds and convulsions , the more complex and the variety would be of the behavior of an animal . The peripheral nervous system is also very well developed in mammals , which provides the mammals with high-speed reflexes . Digestive system : After food is taken into the mouth , the food is chewed by the teeth . Then , the food is wetted with saliva , released along the ducts from salivary glands . It facilitates in swallowing and the movement of food along the esophagus . Under the influence of saliva , the complex carbohydrates ( starch , sugar ) , contained in food , turn into less complex carbohydrates . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , releases 60 liters of saliva in a day . In the majority of animals , saliva possesses pronounced antiseptic properties . A single chambered stomach is found in the majority of mammals . Glands are present on the walls of the stomach which release digestive juice . But , the stomach is multi chambered in herbivore mammals , such as the deer , cow , goat , sheep etc . The intestines are divided into small and large . The duodenal , jejunum and ileum belong to the small intestines . The blind gut , colon and rectum belong to the large intestines . Food is digested in the small intestines under the influence of juices . Juices are released by glands , present on the walls of the gut and also the liver and pancreas , opening in the initial section of the small intestines - duodenum . In small intestines , all the food nutrients are sucked into the blood and the rest of the undigested food enters into the large intestines . The ileocecal valve is present at the joint of the small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fecal substances into the small intestines . Changes in hard-to-digest food substances take place in the blind gut under the influence of bacteria . Also , in the majority of mammals , a considerable quantity of lymphatic tissue is present on the walls of the blind gut which makes the blind gut an important body of the immune system . In many animals ( for example , rabbits , beavers ) , the blind gut possesses huge dimensions . In some animals , the blind gut is found with an appendix . Origin : Mammals , apparently , originated from cynodonts at the end of the Triassic period . The first mammals were single-pass , retaining some resemblance to reptiles ( some kinds exist till now ) and multitubercular ( they became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period ) and triconodonts ( also become completely extinct in the Cretaceous period ) appeared a little later . Pantotheria appeared in the Jurassic period ( also become extinct at the end of Cretaceous period ) , from which the present animals evolved , i.e. viviparous mammals . Interesting is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was marked with the mass ( but not completely ) extinction of terapcyds , the highest form according to its organization were very similar to single-pass mammals and according to some assumptions , probably had mammary glands and wool . Inhabitation : Mammals are prevalent worldwide and are met on all continents , in all oceans and on the majority of existing islands . The natural habitat of the koala is limited to Australia and New Guinea , marsupials space of Australia , Oceania and both American continents . The wide prevalence of placentary mammals , which as of today are present on all the continents , notably bats and mice , inhabited Australia before the arrival of Europeans . Only limited fauna was found on the remote islands before the inhabitation of human beings and only bats were found in many of the islands including New Zealand . Mammals are found in almost all biospheres of the Earth and are found both in deserts and tropical forests and also in high mountains and in polar regions .

However , before the magazine 's pick is announced , Time ran a poll among its readers and found that the majority ( over 5 million voters ) chose Kim Jong Un as " Person of the Year " . While the readers ' choice is not an official magazine 's pick , it does speak volumes when they pick a dictator who did not make a public appearance till 2010 , and hardly has any accomplishments under his belt except " inheriting " the country from his father , and trying hard to rule like him .

The news story is about Kim Jong Un distributing photos of a missile launch that were obviously Photoshopped . Hence the obvious drop shadows <p> They were caught with bad photoshop before , they did it again . Great chop , Luna . <p> This Saturday we continue our freaking experiment with provided source images . Rocket science may not be for everybody but some geeks do manage to build their own rockets . It takes quite a bit of technical knowledge , effort , and money to build a real rocket that will fly as high as 3 miles into the atmosphere . Last but not least , strict safety measures must be taken upon each rocket launch . Photoshop this rocket launch photo any way you wish . Some examples are - re-design the rocket , show where it may be headed to , feature some new " rocket scientists " next to it . ( Image credit : Steve Jurvetson ) <p> North Korea 's keenly watched rocket launch has failed , Pyongyang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch was to put a satellite into orbit - a move marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of national founder Kim Il-sung . But the US and other nations say the launch constituted a disguised test of long-range missile technology banned under UN resolutions . The failure of this launch is embarrassing for the North Korean regime . It had been billed as a sign of the North 's technical achievement . The 100ft ( 30m ) rocket named " Unha-3 " exploded into some 20 pieces and fell into the sea , after flying for just over a minute . Since the design of " Unha-3 " is a top secret , we can only guess what caused the rocket failure - from bad engineering design to clumsy assembling , to bad fuel or poor choice of materials . Today you are going be a Korean rocket scientist , and suggest the alternative designs of " Unha-3 " that may be rejected by North Korea for any reasons ( e.g. think of some alternative materials or obvious engineering flaws ) . <p> North Korea will be launching satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the official version . Intelligence sources say that this may be a cover-up for launching of a long-range missile capable of reaching Alaska . Long range missiles and satellite rockets use a very similar technology , so there 's a high chance that even a true satellite rocket launch by North Korea will serve as a test for a long range missile . The country is barred from ballistic activity as per resolution of a U.N . Security Council . Hillary Clinton warned North Korea not to launch " anything " . For this contest you need to become a rocket scientist and construct rockets from other objects ( fruits , vegetables , household items , etc . ) . You can also include existing rockets or missiles into your chops one way or another . E.g. find civil uses for rockets ( mini versions are OK too ) , give rocket theme to movies and paintings , etc.

Subsequently , it was confirmed that Bin Laden was hiding in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area . An award of 50 million USD was declared on his head . For about ten years , Americans and its allies could not locate bin Laden . From time to time , Osama bin Laden 's messages were circulated to his colleagues . So , for example , in an audio message , which was telecasted by Qatar TV channel " Al-Jazeera " on April 23 , 2006 , Osama bin Laden once again expressed his determination to fight against non-believers , " crusaders and Zionists , waging war against Muslims " .

Shortly before her death , former Pakistan Prime minister Benazir Bhutto stated in an interview to " Al-Jazeera " on November 2 , 2007 that Osama bin Laden was dead and was killed by Omar Sheikh . On February 9 , 2008 , on the basis of information from Washington , a report appeared in the media that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan 's Quetta , along with Mullah Omar , leader of the " Taliban " movement .

According to AFP reports referring to unidentified officials , Osama 's son , two couriers and a woman , who was used as a suicide bomber , were also killed along with Osama bin Laden . Bin Laden 's two wives , four sons and four close associates were arrested . According to a statement by the US President , the American special troops did not suffer any losses in the operation .

Thanks to Stock Exchange for providing the source image . <p> This contest is fueled by the following news : Stilts are straight poles with steps , arranged at a certain height ( 1-2 meters from the ground ) , meant for walking . The poles are either long , whereas the poles are held by the hands of the walker behind his arms or short poles , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lengthy sticks . Walking on stilts is known from ancient times . Stilts got widespread growth in France : In the Gascony Lands , where rain water does not dry quickly and forms swamps , making it difficult for pedestrians . Stilts served as a main means of information exchange in rural areas . In the middle of the century , stilt fighting contests were organized in Numor between two camps , consisting of the citizens ; the fight was organized in a large area in front of the city hall . The stilt fighters have to hit the opponents with the legs . The origin of the clown : The history of the clown should be begun with the festivals of Ancient Greece , then there were rural merry fellows " komos " which went between villages , amused the people , parodied , cried out jokes to passers by , playfully argued that what was called then " agonom " - and exchanged caustic insulting words at times . Later the most bright and resourceful people have received the name " bomoloh " Together with the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . " Bomoloh " always was the leader , always won and at times offended " bohval " and if " bomoloh " had not enough words he started to bang " bohval " . As the jokers were rural " kolonus " , bomoloh 's jokes have accepted the given image and removed from the Ancient Greece to Italy and the meaning of this word was the " witty person " instead of " rural " . As the caustic jokes of the mischievous persons had a critical character , made fun of various bad streaks in the person , the Athens ' authority having a democratic way , saw in such jokes a positive use of influence on the moral level of the people , and decided to make bomolohs ' jokes the traditional method of influence on people and started to invite them in theater to speak with witty reproaches . Together with the bomolohs aesthetic concepts of style , expressiveness , carnival language and techniques they came to the theater . Comic receptions of a carnival became a basis of circus clownery language ; - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of national performance . But a refusal of the standard norms , a liberty , the negation of the universal norms and conventions led to the development of the circus character which developed in parallel with dramatics . The representations were called " imitation " at that time . The mimicking and copying of people were some of the main scenic receptions . The actors " phlyax " worked actively and used acrobatics and showed comic falling . There were buffoon-comical types which had grotesque character faces , make-up , used asymmetric forms , made big mouths or huge noses and there was a bald head too . Garments were motley with multi-colored stains , triangles and rhombuses . These figures became characteristic for the Italian comedy of masks . Before a circus art basis there were actors " histrio " - jugglers , they juggled with the fire sticks , belched fire from the mouth , invented magic devices for focuses and trained pigeons . Later they had a division into genres : acrobats , trainers , storytellers , troubadours . In the 14th century there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class - where there were musicians and dancers , and the lowest class - acrobats , trainers , rope-walkers , clowns , illusionists - all genres which became the circus art basis . In the 16th century , for the first time in 1563 there was a character which had the name " clown " . Acting in the same mask , the clown looked ridiculous , clumsy and naive . Each entrance on the arena was independent , not connected with a storyline of a play . Playwrights specially left emptiness for the comic tricks of the clown . During the same time in England and France there were the first circuses.
