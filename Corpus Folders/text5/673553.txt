Supported by Ben Brandzel ( former MoveOn head of Advocacy and now founding Executive Director of OPEN ) , this small group planned Uplift 's formation . In November 2013 the first Board meeting was held . Siobhan O ' Donoghue became Uplift 's Founding Director in the summer of 2014 . Uplift is inspired by the impact of advocacy groups like MoveOn in the United States , 38 Degrees in the UK , GetUp ! in Australia and Leadnow in Canada who have successfully used innovative- digital campaigning tools with- people powered action to great effect .

People have also generously provided their professional services for free or at a greatly reduced cost . A Founder Supporters Fund has also been formed to help Uplift become established .

The emphasis is on people taking action together on issues we have collectively decided are important to campaign on . Digital technology is a powerful resource to support people powered action but it is only a tool and will never replace or substitute for the direct participation of people. - Actions and campaign tactics will include everything from petition delivery events , public meetings , vigils , rallies , radio show call-ins , company boycotts , letter/email writing , social media targeting , leafleting , street and image theatre , house meetings , distributed actions , legal action and much more . <p> How is Uplift different from other civil society organisations ? <p> We are a non-profit campaign organisation set up as a company limited by guarantee .

We can use technology and campaign strategies to help mobilise many people in a short period of time to amplify people 's voices . This will help sustain attention on key issues until they are resolved and channel energy from moments of crisis into a long-term movement for positive change. - Uplift can form effective partnerships to make progress on key issues and challenges . We believe that it is important for organisations to work together to make a positive impact and support each other in manifesting our common visions . <p> How are campaigns selected ? <p> Uplift campaigns are first and foremost decided on by assessing the interest and desire of members to take action on any particular issue . Campaigns may emerge very quickly in response to events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide on what we campaign on through a variety of means including direct contact , social media discussion , polling , surveys , call outs , meetings.Factors considered in choosing a campaign include : <p> Time frame : what is the level of urgency and the time frame to make a difference ? Impact : is there a clear solution or target and what is the difference the Uplift community can make by campaigning on this issue ? Values : how does this issue and potential solution align with our core values and does it contribute to longer term change or co-create the conditions to address more challenging issues ? Added value : is there something we can bring to this issue and is anyone else already working in this area ? <p> How does Uplift work ? <p> Uplift 's power comes from its ability to mobilise people to take coordinated , strategic action to achieve agreed outcomes . Uplift 's small central team will be responsible for campaign coordination and strategic planning on a day to day basis . This includes making judgements about what campaigns to prioritise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timing and potential impact . Often , we will actively engage member 's views and experiences when planning strategies and tactics. - The actions taken in any campaign will be varied as so much depends on the particulars of the campaign and the most appropriate strategy required to get us where we want to be.Every campaign will have a clear plan of action that will be under constant review . Broadly though actions are likely to fall into the following areas : Organising building teams of supporters i.e. through house parties , events , online hangouts , teach-ins , film nights , and campaign sign-up drives.Speaking Out influencing the general public to build support i.e. letters to the editor , radio call-ins , protests , rallies , press conferences , door-to-door , leafleting at festivals , petitions , sign-ons , bill boards , etc.Speaking Up direct contact with decision makers and campaign targets i.e. calls , office visits , petition deliveries , asking questions at events , targeted meetings , legal challenges , etc .

The deregulation of milk production risks destabilising the market . Farmers will find it harder to secure a fair price for milk as corporate businesses become more powerful and control the market . Smaller farming families will find it more difficult to stay in business and out of debt because of inevitable fluctuations in milk prices . <p> 1 in 10 of the worlds babies will be fed on Irish produced milk formula , raising huge concerns about public health and ethical food production , particularly in the Global South . Ireland represents less that 1% of the world 's dairy cows , and yet is responsible for more than 15% of the global infant milk formula production . <p> The Agri-Food Strategy 2025 is being prepared by the Dept of Agriculture .

The government 's Food Harvest 2020 Strategy predicts that milk production will increase by 50% with the removal of milk quotas . <p> By 2020 , emissions from the agriculture sector will have increased by 12% , according to projections by the Environmental Protection Agency . Thus far , there has been a disappointing level of detail outlined by the Department of Agriculture on the potential measures to reduce GHG emissions in their Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Plan .

@@49703527 @3203527/ <h> Social Media : Tips and Tricks <p> Let 's face it , today almost all of us are a part of some form of social media network , if not many at the same time . Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , YouTube , LinkedIn the list goes on . And why not ? Facebook and other forms of social media provide you with the opportunity to connect with the millions of users worldwide and are an excellent platform through which you can spread your campaign . <p> If you 're not on Facebook or other social media sites already , we would urge you to get involved as the benefits for your campaign are unparalleled . 1 in 7 people on the planet are now on Facebook and because Facebook is both semi-public and semi-private in nature , not only can you interact with your own friends and family but you can also target directly those with the power to make change in relation to your issue , be it a lobby group , other organisation or a TD . <p> Here are some tips and tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . <h> Optimise your campaign for social media <p> It 's extremely important to consider how to design a campaign in such a way that social media can best be utilised in conjunction with it . Start with the title . Draft it once , draft it twice , draft it 10 times . Have other people take a look at it and get them to tell you what they think of it . <p> Is it snappy ? Is it too wordy for Facebook and Twitter ? Try to keep it less than 100 characters and be sure to include keywords which are both searchable on google and relevant to your issue . <h> Your Campaign Image <p> Think about the image you 've chosen to use on your petition page . Having a great image can make all the difference on social media sites and it is often the thing that convinces people to click through to your campaign . The golden rule is to look further than a simple google images ' search , in which the results are often generic and bland . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of free creative and everyday images . Be on the lookout as you walk around for a photo you can snap yourself on your phone or get somebody you know to help you out , that way it will be far more personal . Many phones have free software that can add free effects or filters to make the picture look really catchy . <p> Make it something intriguing and make it unique . Also , having a person in the picture . This is often more effective in connecting people with the issue at hand . <h> How to share a Petition <p> When deciding on how to share your petition via social media the question often becomes whether to do so through your existing personal Facebook page , or by creating a separate public page specifically for your campaign . While both methods have their own pros and cons , you may want to consider creating a public page as this way others can like ' and share it , as opposed to supporters having to add you as a friend . It 's also nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have me time ' . <h> Growing your supporters list <p> We go by the motto of Ask and you shall receive ' - meaning once you are ready to start spreading your campaign , it 's time to start actively asking people to share it via their own networks . Do n't be shy ! Ask your friends and family to do three things : sign the petition , like the Facebook page ( if using one ) and share it with their friends . Growing the number of supporters for your campaign becomes a lot easier when using social media sites . However , gaining support whether on or off-line still takes time and you still have to be prepared to work at it . Do n't underestimate the time it will take to get a campaign off the ground and it 's important for you to be prepared to set aside enough time at the beginning to really get things going . <p> What to post As a starting point ? Well , why not write a ( very ) short story explaining your campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this first post will be to persuade people to sign your petition and come along with you on the journey that is your campaign . After this , consider how you will write your Facebook posts . Make sure they are interactive " ask questions and be open to feedback from those within the community . Try to be creative and show your personality ; the aim is to excite your supporters , not bore them . Consider using a mix of text , images , videos and links to other relevant web pages in your posts . <h> When to post <p> Using social media often its all about timing . Be strategic with your posts by considering when they will be seen by the greatest number of people . The time of day can have a huge impact ; late afternoons and evenings tend to work best when people have the time to dedicate to reading your posts and taking any action required . Try to avoid early mornings however , as people are usually preoccupied with other things . Also , whilst keeping your followers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spam ' your supporters with countless updates as sometimes less really is more . Hitting Your Target Communicating directly with your target using social media can be highly effective . It is important to carefully plan your moves on Facebook . Firstly , find your target or other decision-makers on your issue and consider what you can do to best get them to take notice of your campaign . Could you write on their wall or post a picture to their wall ? Could you comment on the threads of their posts ? How about tagging them in a post of yours ? Any one of these , or a combination of several , could be used . <p> Next , you can use social media to organise a time when all of your supporters can contact your target in a coordinated effort at the same time . Perhaps you could urge all of your followers to write the target a personal message , or write on their wall " It 's all up to you . <p> Lastly , and perhaps most importantly <h> Celebrate your wins along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a win , and be excited to tell people about it .

@@49703553 @3203553/ <h> Medical Cannabis : My Dads Story <p> 23.03.17 <p> Roderick Campbell <p> My name is Roderick. - Ive seen a lot of misinformation and shennanigans around the medical cannabis issue recently , and I just wanted to share my own story to help balance the subject . The first part of this will be about my personal experience with medical cannabis , or rather , my Dads when he was dying . The second part will be aimed at clearing up some of the misinformation . <p> My Dads story . Last year my Dad passed away due to a condition called pulmonary fibrosis . He was in the US Navy during World War II and exposed to a large amount of asbestos ; it was amazing that he lived as long as he did ( 89 years ! ) considering how much toxic material he inhaled over many years of hard work . <p> The last year of his life was difficult . He was a tough man who never complained or allowed his pain to show , but my family could tell he was suffering almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from complications . He eventually began to have a series of small strokes and was admitted to hospital , where doctors did n't  think hed make it another week . <p> That 's when we tried cannabis . He had nothing left to lose and we wanted to do anything we could to alleviate his suffering . <p> Fortunately , we were living in Washington State where cannabis is entirely legal , so all we needed to do was go to the local retail store to buy a CBD salve and a few edible candies . My Dad had never used that sort of thing before , but he was willing to give it a shot , so my younger brothers and I brought- him some cannabis medication while he was in hospital ; the results were astonishing . <p> For the first time in months , he was able to relax , sleep through the night , laugh , and breathe a bit easier . I do n't  think it was curing his pulmonary fibrosis , but I do think it allowed him to overcome the pain long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A few days later he was released from hospital and came home again with us . Despite what the doctors said about being on deaths door , my Dad went on to live for almost a year after leaving hospital . He was able to say goodbye to his friends and family , he was able to laugh , and he was able to take some refuge from unnecessary suffering . For that , I 'm grateful to medical cannabis , and this is why I feel very strongly that it should be readily available to those who need it . <p> Most of us will- end up in a situation where either ourselves or our loved ones will need relief from suffering , and its important that we have access to the medical tools we need to make life worth living all the way up to the end . <p> With my Dad when he was released from hospital . <p> Why are Irelands politicians dragging their feet ? This is the question that bothers me most , especially after watching the plight of Vera Twomey and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alleviate Avas severe suffering . Its awful to see Minister for Health Simon Harris dragging his feet and punting the issue into endless committee meetings when thousands , if not tens of thousands , of people are actively suffering . <p> One of the excuses Ive seen is that the issue needs more research , but that 's ridiculous . There are already many examples of medical cannabis being successfully and painlessly ( no pun intended ) implemented in communities much larger than Ireland . The sky did n't  fall down , people did n't  turn into zombies , and the only downsides were that some governments did n't  know what to do with all the new tax revenue 1 . Its especially absurd to hear this from Irish politicians when I myself have lived in states where its perfectly legal , and entirely beneficial both in terms of pain alleviation and sheer economics . <p> Simon Harris , Minister for Health <p> This leads me to speculate about what forces are at work holding us back ? - The benefits are obvious and a huge majority of Irelands population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My personal hypothesis is that the pharmaceutical industry is actively opposing the legalisation of medical cannabis because they 're afraid of losing profits . <p> There 's very strong evidence that prescription , and particularly opioid , drug abuse drops significantly when cannabis is available as a natural alernative 3 . That may sound great from a public health perspective , and it is , but a reduction in demand for opioid pills would cost pharmaceutical companies big money . Considering they 're one of the largest industries in Ireland I can imagine they 're capable of exerting strong opposition with politicians . <p> What can we do to make medical cannabis legal ? - The first step is adding greater pressure to our political representatives , like Minister for Health Simon Harris , by doing the following : <p> Call Simon Harris and tell him you expect legalisation by the end of this year : - 012 813 727 <p> Help create and share educational content about the issue with friends , family , and colleagues . <p> Roderick Campbell is a dual Irish-American national who has spent the last 7 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding CEO of CommitChange , a Silicon Valley technology company dedicated to powering not-for-profit fundraising and organising efforts throughout the United States .

@@49703566 @3203566/ <h> Threats to our democracy <p> 10.11.14 <p> Uplift <p> As this is the week that European representatives welcome USA negotiators back to Brussels , it 's time to question some of the implications of these secret , supranational negotiations . Particularly for our little green island and specifically on the question of secret arbitration courts that are hidden within the confines of the proposed treaty . <p> The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) is virtually unknown but TTIP will be the largest trade deal in history , if ratified . However , scratch the surface of this mutually beneficial ' trade agreement and alarms bells start to ring . <p> This question is key for a variety of reasons but the most relevant is that Ireland has the absolute most to lose we are the only country in TTIP negotiations that has no current ISDS agreements . None , zilch , nada . But , Richard Bruton , Minister for Enterprise and Jobs , signed a letter last year specifically calling for the inclusion of arbitration courts in TTIP negotiations . <p> Not only does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production/regulation , it introduces the possibility of Investor State Dispute Settlement , or ISDS , on a huge scale . These arbitration courts are instruments of international public law designed to resolve disputes that may arise between a state and a multinational investor . Originally intended to protect investments , although one may question why this is necessary with insurance so readily available , ISDS have spiralled out of control . <p> The format of these courts is a panel of three business lawyers with supranational powers to rule against states . Crucially only the investor ' , the multinational business , can take a case to an ISDS court , begging the question of why states would be keen to sign up . Not least because the costs for these arbitration lawyers ' can run up to $1,000 per hour . <p> Why national governments are supporting ISDS is unclear . To date ISDS have allowed the Egyptian government to be sued for attempting to raise it 's minimum wage by Veolia , a case that loses none of it 's shocking poignancy for being dropped . There have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for moving away from nuclear energy , Canada for not allowing fracking , Hawaii for saying no to GMO 's , Costa Rica for protecting rainforests . <p> That means that governments are pushing for trade policy that could override social policy . Many politicians or lobbyists would call this conjecture , but just ask what government or legislator will introduce new policies , regulations , laws knowing that they will be sued ? <p> The very existence of arbitration courts ( ISDS ) questions the legitimacy of our democratic system , not to mention making a mockery of justice systems everywhere . Multinationals are actively fundraising to support the huge law firms that get paid very well to arbitrate on ISDS . The self perpetuating nature of ISDS and how essentially they seem to find in favour of multinationals tells its own story . Unfortunately much of this important debate is based on small tidbits of leaked information . <p> The real reason for an open discussion on TTIP is simply explained by the following question ; why is the Irish government actively supporting a clause that will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of profits ? So again , why did Richard Bruton , Minister for Enterprise and Jobs put his name to a letter calling for their inclusion ?
