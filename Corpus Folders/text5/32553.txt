The Air Jordan- 13 " Playoff " was his preferred colorway during his final NBA Championship run to complete another three-peat series of wins . <h> Air Jordan 13 Retro- " Ray Allen " <p> Walter Ray Allen was an original- member of Team Jordan ( signed as a rookie in 1997 ) , an affiliation that granted him all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 20- year career . <p> Here we highlight an Air Jordan 13 Retro created with Ray Ray in mind and released in 2008 , one of the few PEs to ever hit retailers . The Boston Celtics-inspired sneaker , though less popular and rare than Allen 's similarly themed Air Jordan 8 , holds greater historical significance , as it was the model he wore when he broke the NBA all-time three-point record . Initially advertised as a release exclusive to House of Hoops in Boston and Miami 's Sole Fly , this AJ 13 would be available at list of other shops , including CNCPTS and a few stores overseas . <p> The sneaker is simple in construction , featuring tumbled white leather with green suede covering the mudguard , heel , and midsole . Allen 's signature can be seen on tongue . <h> Air Jordan 13 Retro " Bred " <p> As we all know , no Chicago Bulls era Air Jordan is complete without a proper " Bred " colorway .

Ballistic mesh covers the dimpled side panels , while the toe features a clean tumbled leather in black . Where the aforementioned details keep the design grounded , the Varsity Red on the midsole , mudguard and heel provide a needed pop of color . The jewel on the ankle features Jumpman branding in a vibrant green . <h> Air Jordan 13 Retro " Squadron Blue " <p> For the most part , Air Jordan 13 Retro sneakers released during- the late aughts/early 2010s were colorways that we 've seen before . However , Jordan Brand opted to switch up the flow with the " Squadron Blue " look in 2013 . <p> Here , the iconic silhouette is comprised of ballistic mesh , tumbled leather , and suede on the side panels , toe , and mudguard/midsole combo respectively . Each of the aforementioned parts are- colored in Squadron Blue , offset by Electric Yellow- accents on the tongue and outsole- to complete the eclectic look . <h> Air Jordan 13 Retro- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by Denzel Washington in Spike Lee 's 1998 film He Got Game ) was given a cash stipend to survive during a one-week work release program from prison , where he was tasked with the mission of convincing- his estranged son , top high school hoops prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth , to commit to the warden 's alma mater Big State University . But this is less about the intricate plot ( if that was a spoiler , shame on you ; you 're nearly 20 years late ) , and more about how the elder Shuttlesworth opted to spend the few coins he had . His grandest purchase : the brand new Air Jordan 13 for $139 " $150 with tax . <p> Jordan Brand re-released the model in the- iconic white , black and red colorway in 2013 , and for the first time ever the sneaker was named after flick , despite being an OG colorway .

Black accents- appear on the mudguard and midsole/heel combo. - Infrared 23 on the outsole , " Jordan " label on the lace tag , and Jumpman branding on the tongue completes the design , earning this Air Jordan 13 Retro a nickname in the process . <h> Air Jordan 13 Retro " Baron " <p> Better late than never right ? Jordan Brand first introduced the " Baron " collection , inspired by Michael Jordan 's time playing Double-A- baseball as a Birmingham Baron , summer 2014 ; the collection featured an Air Jordan 1 and Air Jordan 9 . <p> Months later , the white , black , and grey color scheme- would return via this Air Jordan 13 Retro , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The iridescent strip on the heel and mudguard replaces the tradition suede seen on the paneling .

Focusing on the latter , created with- considerable differences from its predecessor , this shoe is an improvement for a myriad of reasons . <p> At the top of the list is the amended suede midsole , which features a similar True Red hue , but does n't bleed onto the white outsole like the ' 05 version .

It features an all-white leather upper with hints of Orion Blue and Purple on the midsole/mudguard/heel unit , as well as the tongue and outsole .

A white midsole breaks the monotony . <h> Air Jordan 13 Retro " Black Cat " <p> Given the Air Jordan 13 's distinct connection with- MJ 's childhood nickname " Black Cat " and its design inspiration , it 's surprising- that it took this long for the silhouette to receive a namesake makeover . The AJ 13 Retro " Black Cat " is first version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered-out all black colorway , cemented by premium suede throughout the greater part of the upper. - The dimpled side paneling and laces are covered in reflective 3M material for a shiny gloss. - The jewel Jumpman logo on the heel provides- the lone pop of color , as it represents the eye of the panther . <h> Air Jordan 13 Retro- OG <p> Jordan Brand brought back this classic original colorway of the Air Jordan 13 just in time for the NBA 's 2017 All-Star Weekend .
