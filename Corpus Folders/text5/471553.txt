Pros Close to interstate Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed Pool area is in bad shape Not a shining endorsement for a Red Roof hotel chain that I love . <p> My boyfriend and I decided to get this hotel for Megacon , which was happening right across the street . Upon check-in , the exterior looked well enough . However we saw the pool had been unkempt , with leaves and a full palm frond floating around in the current , and the only difference with the hot tub water is that it looked like a sick green . Oh well , no matter to us . We were n't planning on using the swimming pool anyway . Good thing , too , since the pool did n't look like it was cleaned in the four days we were there . When we walked into the room , it looked alright . A little smaller than the title " Superior King " might impose on someone . But then we started noticing things , like a big indentation in the bathroom floor , complete with cracked linoleum . We were careful not to cut our feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the bathroom floor to borderline flood no matter what we did , since the shower head was unadjustable . The A/C felt like it barely worked , and we discovered half the vents were n't operating and it was rusted . We also found a spider and some ants crawling around in the bathroom and on the bath towels . The desk chair for the work desk had some questionable white stains on it , and there was a burn indentation in the desk from a spoon , like a druggie had shot up in there on a previous visit . Not to mention the cleaning crew is n't very thorough ; there was paper stuffed into the peephole as well as any other hole in the room as if the previous occupant was paranoid about being watched . But the topping on the cake was that there looked like a murder happened in our hotel room . There were miscellaneous red spots/stains/spatters in various locations throughout the room . One on the curtain , several in the carpet , on the side of the tv stand ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and hide it ) , as well as on the walls . We debated calling , however it was a busy weekend . There was a massive convention happening across the street , and its Memorial Day weekend right in the middle of the theme park capitol of the world . I did n't think there would be much options for us , and all surrounding hotels were already booked . The first morning after check in , we had a letter addressing any cosplayers about not using hair colors in their hotel rooms to avoid damage and charges , as well as to make sure occupant vehicles have parking permits displayed in their cars to avoid getting towed . I went to the hotel lobby and kindly asked the front desk attendant , Amanda , for a permit for my car . She had an attitude like she was tired and did n't want to help anybody who walked through that door . She insisted twice that she gave me a parking permit , saying I 'd signed for one . I informed her I had indeed signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit . She took out a piece of paper and held it to my face and said , " You never got one of these ? " I again told her no , and was beginning to wonder how many ways I 'd have to explain that I never got one before she begrudgingly filled one out and gave it to me . And then when we checked out , I asked if they were able to honor a AAA discount . The front desk attendant that morning , Nicole , told me that I " would have had to have given them the code when I booked the room online , " speaking with a manner like we had been causing them problems the entire morning/stay . I told her that there was n't an option for that when I booked the room , and then she tells me , " Well then they probably were n't offering the discount anyway , because for holiday weekends , or big events , they do n't allow for the AAA discounts . " So my boyfriend tells her that we needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , and begins telling her about all of our problems with the room , and then she says , " You 've been staying in the room for 3 days and you 're just now telling us ? Was the hole in the bathroom floor there when you got here ? " We were so done . She began insinuating that we did the damage to the room ourselves . We wo n't ever return , especially for future conventions . The Clarion next door looked much nicer and for only a little more per night . The Days Inn further down was probably better than the Red Roof Inn . And you can guarantee that we will be in touch with their corporate offices to talk about the state of this hotel . <p> We booked two nights at the end of our stay in Florida to be perfectly honest due to cost we booked red roof inn . It was terrible . Firstly Booking.com managed to book us two rooms ( due to the fact I have two e-mail addresses registered with them and they sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the hotel would not waive the cancellation charge and booking.com would also not reimburse the second room which means I could have had a much better hotel and paid less . The rooms are dark with stained carpets and walls and when we went out I dread to think what was happening in some of the rooms . There was a strong smell of weed both mornings when we exited our room . The location may be good for the conference centre but is at least 20 to 30 minutes walk from anything but Denny 's and McDonalds . To top it all there were many coaches in the car park and most of them decided to keep their engines running well in to the night and at one point after midnight I had to go out and ask the driver to stop revving his engine . If you want to enjoy your stay do not entertain this hotel . If conference goers want to stay there all I can say is good luck ! ! Never again . <p> Work booked this place for us . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leaving Australia . When we checked in , asked to pay for the rooms even though we had a receipt showing payment . Rooms are dreadful old and dirty .

Two different areas that have pools , water slides , and even an outdoor bar - for the bigger kids !

The rooms are super small and we had four adults crammed in there and it was crowded and uncomfortable . If you are traveling with children , it 's fine , but just know that if you had a baby , it would be nearly impossible to fit a pack and play and would be very uncomfortable with active children . The free continental breakfast though was amazing ! Definitely exceeded my expectations on many levels . Lots of variety , Mickey Mouse waffles , decent coffee and really tasty sausage . I wish they had sausage for more days than just the one during our stay . They are also super strict about who eats - you have to have a wrist band and they check off the list of people who are staying in your room . I 've never seen any hotel be as strict as this when it comes to free breakfast . They are doing renovations to become a Holiday Inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's understandable and forgivable . The hotel is also super close to a Wawa , which was a real treat . Not too far from Disney but definitely a hike in traffic to Universal . Would I stay there again ? Maybe . <p> We were here for a quick family vacation/work trip . The hotel had some shortcomings ( elevator worked occasionally , the arcade was nonexistent , and they were undergoing renovations-all would have been nice to know in advance ) BUT CASTAWAY COVE helped redeem them . My son had a wonderful time rock climbing , zip lining , sliding , and extreme airbouncing . The staff was friendly and made sure the rides were safe , despite the rain .

This was a bad decision . The hotel management may state that " I should have contacted them " during my stay . Well I did . They refused to cancel my booking . Priceline terms are they would not cancel my booking . I was stuck . I will take this up with my credit card when returning . These are the complaints the Inn at Calypso did not address : 1 ) The room came with a thin orange quilt + sheet.No duvet , no blanket even after request . Beds were hard- A very uncomfortable sleep . 2 ) Pillows seemed clean but we awoke with itchy heads 3 ) Sink was blocked , 1 phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffees and fresh varied food &amp; fruits- Calypso did not . I did not eat breakfast here and I am not picky . I am uploding photos of the day old sausages that they put out the next day . 5 ) Cleaning did not change the sheets during my stay . I was even in the room and they refused . 6 ) There are safety issues which I will likely report to the state because the elevator stops on floors where they are doing construction . My young child stepped off on a floor which was covered in debri and dust and would have ran down the hall if I did not stop him . Additionally , the chemical paint smell coming from these floors is so strong &amp; toxic smelling , it should be a health &amp; safety issue . The grounds are beautiful and pool fun , but you can have all of the same amenities when booking at Springhill Suites which faces the same pool etc .

There were plenty of places for us seniors to keep cool while enjoying the park .

We 've taken all of our children , and hope to take our grandchildren some day . One thing I like about Busch Gardens is that it has plenty of shade for you to take a break , or rest in the hot Florida sun . Most theme parks have very little shade . The only thing we did n't like about Busch Gardens , was the location . It 's smack in the middle of town . Would have been better if they would have built this park in an area that was more wooded .

After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm glad we did ! My two 13 year olds loved it . What a unique concept . It was an full amusement parks and a zoo . With the package deal parking was included ( normally $25 a day ) . But since this was the first park we went to I had to pay for parking and then presented my pay stub at the ticket booth and they refunded my money without any hassle . The girls rode EVERY ride- multiple times . The lines were n't too long . The tram that takes you over the park was very cool . The train takes you through the Savannah where we saw many animals up close . A highlight was the kangaroos- they kept jumping right up to us ! The decorations/themes of different cultures were an added bonus . I especially liked Morocco . If you purchase Discovery Cove tickets- add Busch Gardens- you wo n't regret it ! ! ! !

@@47461442 @961442/ <h> Overview <p> Featuring 230 condo-style guest rooms , a variety of premium amenities and a convenient location , Regal Palms Resort &amp; Spa offers a home-away-from-home experience in a tropical Florida setting . Guests can enjoy a full-service restaurant , two bars , an on-site spa , an outdoor pool with a slide , a health club , an arcade room , indoor and outdoor play areas for children , and much more . 98388 @qwx508388 <p> Overall we had a nice experience . The rooms were in nice shape and the children enjoyed the water park . The water park can be crowded at certain times and can have a storage of chairs . This property is in a nice area and within walking distance of a grocery store if need be . Disney properties are further away then most resorts . We would consider returning with children . <p> We just stayed at the Regal palms resort from 26th June until 10th July 2017 . I think the recent negative reviews are a bit deceiving and unfair and should not be generalised to everyone 's experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by an independent person and not by Regal palms itself and this seems to be the better option . We stayed at 2112 Calabria and it was spotless clean and had lovely interior decor , could not fault it . Calabria is a bit far from the pool but took me exactly 9 minutes to walk it but we took the car every day to the pool as had young kids . We never had a problem getting parked or getting loungers at the pool . The lazy river was brilliant , we bought our own rubber rings from the pound shop back home in the UK and also purchased more from the dollar store whilst there so no issues . My kids aged 3 and 4 loves it and the water would push them round by themselves albeit us 2 adults were always alongside , again this was never an issue that there is no lifeguard on duty as adults should be responsible for their own children . The pool areas and grounds were frequently being cleaned and we experienced no issues . The actual resort itself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass and also staff were continuously checking who 's car was entering and also who was attempting to access the pool areas . I would definitely recommend regal palms for anyone with children as it was perfect the pool area . There was quite a lot of kids though so people without them may not have enjoyed this . Other negative reviews have claimed the pool area was dirty and had rats , I disagree with that ! Also that a child drowned whilst there , I do n't believe there is any truth in that as I 'm sure we would have heard . Also that the resort was noisy and rowdy and unsecure , that is completely untrue . Also that staff were rude , we did not experience that at all and all staff were pleasant ! We got the resort as a last minute deal and had a great experience . <p> This resort was just ok . Here are the things you need to know . The condos have bug issues and are not cleaned well . We went and bought our on bug spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to wait on the management company . The pool was run down and the pool was nasty and not kept clean . There were rats running around the hot run area . Yes there is a lazy river but you have to buy the floats $5 each . Need towel $10 each per day . It is 20mins from Disney and 35mins from Universal if you do not hit traffic that adds 20mins to your drive . Everything looked good online but everything as dated looking when we got there . Stayed July 2017 <p> Our secon stay here , last time 4 years ago . The apartment we stayed in was nice and big , 4 bedroom , 3,5 bathrooms . 2959 Calabria avenue found on homeaway . Houses are nice but some a bit worn . The resort area is in of a make-over or renovation . Pool is not very clean , the deep pool is to small for all the people there and it feels dated . When we stayed here a kid presumably drowned in the pool , but even how tragic it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To crowded and difficult to keep oversight if you have more than one kid in the pool . Maybe they should build another pool area on the premises ? Some of the Staff also needs to be more friendly and remember that service is their prime job . If you are not to picky and want a cheap and nice place near Disney , this is for you . Travel times to Florida mall or mall at millennia are 40+ minutes so if those places are important you should look for somewhere closer . <p> We stayed in 107 Miramar ave , House was AWESOME ! ! 4 bed 3.5 bath for CHEAP ! ! We originally booked a crappy 2 bedroom hotel somewhere near orlando and there was 5 of us so it would have been very cramped ! Then we found this resort and its WELL WORTH the little bit longer drive to Disney ! ! about 25 min drive , not bad traffic . The on site restaurant " Banana Jacks " was AMAZING . We ate dinner at Banana Jacks vs other restaurants 3 nights during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool area was very nice and clean , there was music playing and they have a nice little lazy river , 2 jacuzzis , and a work out room !

When we arrived we were very disappointed . There was a horrible smell in the hallways and the elevator , the carpet was really worn an when we entered the room it also had a smell . This hotel badly needs renovating . The cupboards were peeling and the pull down couch had big stains on the mattress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night so decided to stay . I just went down for the continental breakfast , it was a miserable selection and the breakfast upgrade for $5.95 per person in the Pizza Hut adjoining the hotel was terrible so we went out and bought breakfast elsewhere . A really bad experience . We will never come back here . If you are on a very tight budget it is liveable . <p> Stayed in June for 11 nights , I paid 550 per adult for bed , cooked breakfast , flights &amp; transfers ! You ca n't expect 5* luxury at Travel Lodge prices . I wanted an apartment as could then prep pack lunches and eat in a couple of times to keep costs down . There are n't many apartments on Idrive so this was perfect . With only 2 of us we could n't justify a villa . The looked fast was great , different every day , could n't physically eat it daily so had cerials in our room a few times . Location was fab , lots of stuff in walking distance , pools were good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got upgraded to a room with a terrace instead of balcony for free on arrival without asking , only complaint would be hair dryer did n't work , one hob ring was broken , unit draws all stick &amp; you could n't pay me to sleep on the sofa bed , they would cause anyone some long term problems so if there are more than 2 of you book a 2bedroom , also was lucky to get patio doors to lock . but staff were helpful with any concerns . 2 lifts in each block , but the whole stay only 1 worked which left us waiting a long time in sweaty corridors to get down stairs , we were on 6th floor so walking stairs was n't ideal when 1 of us is n't very mobile . This is the only reason I ca n't give full stars , it should n't take so long to get lifts working , on our last day we saw the repair guy going in , but it was too late for us .

It was myself male and 2 boy children . first room they gave was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to step dog pop all on it . We arrived after 12 am so stayed in room due to being late .

To be honest not a real big difference from older rooms in the B building to the room we had in A building 310 . This room was ok . Overall I will and can not recommend this hotel to anyone as you will not know what kind of room you would be getting either A building are B building .

When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollite for a good are ok bad room and it is suppose to be a 3 star are more hotel . <p> Stayed at the kids suite Cramped musty room , with old sheets and bedding , everyone complained of itching and there was a bug crawling in the main bed , horrible place , maybe worth 30 bucks if you 're just in desperate need <p> first room they gave me has a very strong humidity smell , they change it for another that the smell was n't that strong . The bathroom was awful they paint the tile on the wall and look very poorly clean . The housekeeping the last 2 nights of my stay did n't  provide of soap and shampoo . I I call front desk for laundry bag and they gave me a trash bag , that 's how cheap they are . I will not recommend this hotel to anyone , its not worth it .

I called Perry the manager I was livid . I said do n't you inspect rooms before offer it to a guest ? Who wants to go thru this on vacation ? The manager just shifts blame on others . He does n't take responsibility , just does n't care . Unsanitary . Can u say board of health needed asap . When checking out I asked for money back he said but you decided to stay in 513 .

Orlando is so busy , after a day at the parks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The service is what makes this place so elegant , more than anything , above all , the staff at Gaylord are well-trained , genuine , and knows when to anticipate what you may need . Consider it done before you finish your sentence . This for me is the most important element in the world of travel and lifestyle . I highly recommend . 10 stars ! Best , Lucas Raven <p> Beautiful hotel . I love the aroma of fresh flowers when you enter the check-in area . Upon entering my first room I noticed a huge hole in the bathroom door . Not sure how the cleaning supervisor did not see this . I notified the front desk they moved me to a new room . The second room had roaches in the bathroom . Huge Conference Center however the layout can be a little bit tricky . And if you have multiple meetings in different conference rooms you will get lost . <p> From a hotel perspective , the rooms hit the right marks - clean , spacious , comfortable , quiet . So no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did not take advantage of all of the things the hotel offers for families . From a conference attendance perspective , the food was fantastic at the lunches and happy hours , and everything that you would expect from a hotel/convention center of this caliber delivered . There seemed to be a better variety of restaurants and bars than the other Gaylord I 've stayed at . But the prices were kind of - wow . Of course you expect to pay more at a place like this but everything seemed just a bit too high . Worth it ? Not sure . Highly recommended if travelling for business and someone else is paying , or if you 're on a splurge vacation with some expendable income . <p> I recently attended the NSTA STEM conference held at Gaylord . I chose to stay at the resort as I did not want to rent a car and pay the $22/day parking fee . I know from perusing Google maps ahead of time that walking anywhere would not be an option . The resort is huge and beautiful . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . While I never swam , the pools and waterpark area looked inviting . My room was clean , quiet and provided the necessary comforts . All staff were polite , friendly and helpful , until I mentioned a problem when I checked out . Without a car , I was trapped for food options . While my meal at Moor was delicious , the price was high . With high numbers attending the conference , I used room service for lunch . I ordered a kids meal burger and fries , plus a club sandwich with homemade chips to put away for supper . Both were of decent quality and enjoyed . Those two items plus a $6 - 6 oz glass of milk totaled about $36.00 . Add in the in room delivery cost , gratuity service charge and tax and it was a $52.00 bill . Luckily , the sandwich was big enough I could get two meals out of it ! And , with a small wrap costing $9.50 at the Marketplace and a salad ( similar to McDonalds ) costing $10.00 , I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save some money by buying some food at the Market when the lines were shorter . Hmmm .... the milk was a better deal - $2.60 for 12 ( maybe 16 ) oz . My $10.00 salad was placed in the in-room refrigerator for the next day 's lunch . But , BE WARNED - the refrigerator freezes your food . My club sandwich did fine but my salad was ruined . Who wants to eat a hard-boiled egg encased in ice or lettuce that is frozen stiff ? My salad actually rattled when I shook it ! There is no way to adjust the temperature . I did mention it when I checked out and other than a " sorry about that " there was no other remedy . So , while all were friendly when taking my money at check out and in the stores , a complaint was not met with a feeling of true apology . Would I return ? Perhaps . It is a gorgeous facility . However , I would plan much differently for food choices - but only if the refrigerator issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined . <p> A lovely place to stay with winding paths through well-groomed tropical gardens . Beware the cash hungry denizens of this jungle . $60 for buffet breakfast for two people or $8 for a soda and a water . Such beauty does not come cheap , but be warned , this wonderful place is close to Disney , but not for the faint of wallet . I also came for the STEM conference . I am a teacher . I paid for this out of my own pocket . I will not be attending any more conferences at venues like this . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

Additionally , after 4 days at Disney/Universal , they provided destination sites that allowed my teenage daughter and pal to enjoy the beautiful beach , while my son and I were able to stare at the massive shuttles and rockets at Kennedy space center .

We were very excited about the lazy river as well as water slides and play area for the kids . Upon arrival , we were told we would be getting an updated room . The updated room was a JOKE . Microwave was missing the handle , there was mold in the showers , and the ceiling was filthy around the air vents , rust in the freezer . There were stains on the chairs , terrible mattresses , the ceiling had a leak where it seems they attempted to patch it but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool and lazy river were beyond disgusting .

Not to mention , the " security car " in the parking lot had a smashed out window covered with a plastic bag which did not put me at ease as to the safety of the resort . This seems like a lot but I could go on . We immediately went back to the front desk and checked out . Do n't waste your time and money on this place . Much better options in the area for similar price . <p> My family enjoyed staying at the Fantasy World Villas . The town homes were spacious .

Only downfall would be that it was closed a couple of times due to possible storms ( it did n't actually storm ) . The bar was good . They had happy hour everyday 4-7pm . Beer and regular mixed drinks were only $3 and $4 dollars . We only had a couple of drinks . Both times the drinks were well made . The beds were fine for the kids , however , a bit uncomfortable for us adults . We were able to sleep regardless . You are also very close to Disney .

While our town home condo was certainly showing some wear and tear ( i.e. worn and torn screens on the lanai ) , it was clean and comfortable ( except for the tiny shower in the 2nd bath ) . The resort has very nice amenities--multiple heated pools and hot tubs , water slides , great lazy river , children 's splash area , nice gym , game room , tons of outdoor sport courts , and pool side bar .

They were really excited . Make sure you book the final twirl up the tower . Definitely worth the additional $10 . My 6 year old was a natural and went right up the tower with the instructor . The highlight of the day was when my daughter 's shoes flew off her feet &amp; they had to stop the wind tunnel ...

Its better to book for flight with video package or have a person standing outside in the lounge to take photos and videos . <p> This was worth the money . I was not sure what to expect and was a little nervous since half my family is scared of heights . Needless to say once you dive in ( literally ) lol it was great . All my children had fun ( youngest was 9 ) my 4 year old did not want to go in ; the flight instructor Gator was great and accommodated us since we had paid online .

You want a fun sit-down family or friends meal , there 's no better place for comfort foods &amp; entertaining staff than Whispering Canyon Cafe . Pool bars are there of course &amp; one even has some salon services at the pool . Looking for a relaxing lounge with high quality bar food check out the Territory Lounge . The food comes from the kitchen at the upscale dining restaurant . You will not be disappointed with the upscale Artist Point 's flavorful cuisine &amp; wine selection . You are in Walt Disney World , so you are obviously there for the parks . Our favorite way to get to Magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxing that that scenic boat ride . If you want to save money &amp; not spend as many days in the parks . You will find plenty to do at Wilderness Lodge , Boulder Ridge Villas , &amp; Copper Creek Villas . Take a non park day &amp; truly soak in all amenities . You can not go wrong with the wide variety of room choices with these three resorts together : traditional hotel rooms , ones w/ bunk beds , studio/1 or 2 bedroom villa w/ kitchen , laundry facilities , and spacious accomodations . They even have cabins on the water now that are part of the Copper Creek Villas . We enjoy a 1 bedroom for my family of 4 w/ tall big teenage boys . I love being able to have breakfast in the room &amp; other fixings for when the bottomless pit teenage boys need more food at all hours . We enjoy being able to throw in a small load of laundry when needed . We take less in our suitcases &amp; leave room for souvenirs . Everyone can find a style of room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it 's new amenities . It is a beautiful escape . I hope you will enjoy it too . <p> Spent a week at the Boulder villas with 3 adult children , my husband and 5 kids age 2-8 . This is a great location if you are a Magic Kingdom buff . Boat transport to MK and other MK hotels was the best . Not too crowded , easy to go through security ( less crowded ) and strollers do n't need to be folded on the larger boats . Rides were quick , about 10 minutes and frequent , about 15-25 minutes . The two pools that were open were lots of fun for the kids . Restaurants had very good food and there was plenty of space in the Lodge and Villa common areas . Even made me think about ta vacation club package . We have stayed at the ART of Animation , Yacht Club , Saratoga Springs , and Disney 's Animation studios ( a long time ago ) . Could see the fireworks over the magic kingdom from the beach and some from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . <p> Our family of four ( kids ages 14 and 11 ) enjoyed our time at the Boulder Ridge Villas . We spent six nights there . I wish we would have built in more time to enjoy all the beautiful amenities . We loved the pool and bikes . We used the boat to Magic Kingdom twice and also took the boat to Magic Kingdom to get to the monorail for Epcot , which I recommend . The Cast Members were all delightful , especially Kirk , the private Boulder Ridge concierge . If you can meet him , he can give you advice that will greatly enhance your visit . The construction bothered us minimally . The worst part was having to go the long way around for the pool . The room was a decent size . The rooms at Boulder Ridge are in the perfect location for all the buses . We are National Park fanatics- so this Disney hotel was the perfect place for us .

I 'd never been to a Madame Tussauds so was n't too sure what to expect . I was n't disappointed - the waxwork models were current and did n't  look dated - you were allowed ( indeed encouraged ) to take photos - with props provided to help you look the part - and I was surprised you were allowed to ' touch ' the exhibits while posing alongside them . I 'm sure I 'm not the only one to have posed faking a punch at an orange Donald lol A great way to while away an hour or two . <p> I 've done the Madam Tussauds in New York .

We went on a Monday night and we got parked fine ( we arrived about 6.30 ) . Got in and my kids ( 17 &amp; 14 ) loved it . We had visited two years ago and this was a definite on the girls list of things to do . Most of the models were really good ( although Donald Trump did not look right ! I think it was his hair ) .

Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to it . I would say it was well worth the money ( $110 ) for 4 adults and 2 wax hand models ! We were there for about 3 hours ( 1hour waiting for the wax hands ) .

We checked in at midnight and had to walk next door to Walgreens to get air freshener and disinfectant . The blankets on the bed were DISGUSTING ! ! There was hair on everything . There was a clothing sticker on the turned down side of the comforter that looked like it 's been there for months . There is no way it would of stuck on there if it had been washed . The sheets and blankets and towels were worse than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go steal 3 sets of sheets to completely encase the bed so we could sleep on it . We had to steel more towels from the maid cart . The gym is a joke . The pool had 1 towel . The other random dirty towels were scattered everyone for days . There is no shade and a couple nasty chairs to sit on . It was so bad we left after 2 nights and had to go pay to stay at the Marriott . Getting a refund is impossible . The front desk refused to help and now that I am home no one will call me back or help me . Being at this hotel was just uninviting and miserable . If you want to feel like you are on vacation do not stay here . The staff was friendly but unable to help ! 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

The staff provided for all needs and this was a very family friendly pool . The main restaurant on the mezzanine level was exceptional . The room was comfortable had a lot of electrical plugs for all of our technology . The conference my husband attended was also on the mezzanine level and therefore , very easy to find . <p> With the addition of pedestrian bridges to the Disney shopping district , the proximity of this hotel to the district and shuttle service make this a nice place to stay .

The hitel is nice and well maintained . The only thing not kept up with is customer service . First we booked a king bed and when we get there they tell us that they are sold out of the king bed for the night . Now mind you I booked this almost a month in advance . So instead of an upgrade we get what I consider to be a downgrade to a two double bed room . They were able to put us in one there next night . That was Strike One . Strike two was after we were in our new room it took an hour and a half and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up . We had left it in storage while we went to explore Orlando ! Strike theater came the next morning when we had put in a wake up call for 9:00 am to take in Animal Kingdom . Guess what ? ! ? NO CALL ! ! It was after 11 when I woke up and woke up my husband . I was utterly done with this hotel . The only thing it truly had going for it customer service wise was its bellmen . Even after the snafu with the luggage they were so endearing . And nice as possible whereas the rest of the staff had an attitude of not really giving a care about what was going on . I will NEVER stay at this hotel again , NO MATTER the price .

I will be the first to admit that I do not stay just anywhere , but I was definitely not pleased and not comfortable here . Upon arriving , we waited at least an hour in line to check in . Like many others said , stay away from the guest services desk . We agreed to listen to a 90 min timeshare presentation for discounted park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience ! It ended up being 3-4 hours of pushy sales people who would not let us leave ! We requested a crib in the room which we did not receive until multiple requests were made . Although the room had been recently " renovated , " it was not done thoroughly and like putting lip stick in a pig . Half of the outlets did n't work in the room and the shower did not drain . We were literally standing in a bath of water when we took a shower . The room also had a musty smell and smelled of smoke . When we called to report these issues , we were told we would get a call back about getting a new room . Guess what- we never received a call . Our room never even got cleaned one of the days . The pool is way too overcrowded for the size of the hotel . I refused to even go in the pool because you could n't move . Overall , it just did not meet my expectations . For the price , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect a hotel to be clean and courteous and this was not the case . Stay elsewhere ! <p> Wonderful dinner . Chef Chris went above and beyond and made our friends birthday very special ! We also had a wonderful server , she made it a fun experience . We were all impressed with the buffet dinner and our special requested dinners were above our expectations ! <p> I booked my reservation in January to stay at this property the week of July 16 . Arrived at about 4PM hotel had a special line for IHG reward memebers being a platinum member i got in this line took twice as long to get to the desk just to find out my room was not ready . Check in time starts at 3pm and out going guest check out was 10am .. I was told 30 minutes and my room would be ready . I was told that i could use the pool while i wait . Which would have been fine if my vehicle was not loaded down and i would have had to unpack everything to get swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i had an 11 month old baby who needed to eat and nap . Waited in the car for 45 minutes went back in to inquire if my room was ready i was told not yet but the manager would go check .. Waited a nother 20 minutes nothing . Finally went back to the front desk and told them to cancel my reservation . In the time i waited i found a different hotel . 10 miles up the road . Had already checked in and located my room at the new hotel as this property called me to tell me my room was ready .. At 6:15 pm .. I stay in lot of hotels and this was the first time i had to wait for a room . Management needs to hire more house keeping or get it together . I recommend holiday inn remove there name from this property as it sets a bad name for their resort properties which i have never had an issue with the 4 others i have stayed at .. Will be calling IHG on this one not the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties 50 plus times a year . <p> We had a great time all the way around a lot of fun great place to stay .... lot of things that are very convenient very family-friendly ... from the arcade to the pool to the water park .... just a fun time ... with great staff . Thanks ! ! <p> We took a family trip here from 7/9-7/12 .. Experienced problems from checkin till checkout . There were 2 adults and 4 children in our party . We booked a 2 bedroom room . It included a bedroom with a king bed that was average size , a living area with sofa bed that was kinda small , 1 bathroom , and an alcove area with a twin over full bunk- but had NO door .. There was also no kitchen , rather a mini fridge ( that did not stay cold enough ) , a tiny microwave , a tiny keirig coffee machine and a lil sink . Checkin toik 2 hours and was very unorganized .. There was no one directing people and the line was out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk where they try to lure you into visiting their " 90 minute " timeshare presentation , which we did , as they offered some free gift cards . Once in the room , it did have an update , but there was still some structural issues and we had to call 3 times for someone to come replace weather stripping on our door as you could see outside through the side and bottom of our door . Also they promised a portable crib , but never received it . Housekeeping was very slow but did offer daily service . Also , they offer bath and body works Coconut Lime Verbena shampoo and conditioner , but some off brand smelly bar soap .. Vending machines only take credit/debit , so be prepared for that . Ok , now for the food .... They claim to offer " kids eat free " , however it only applies to breakfast and dinner amd only in the Lakeside Cafe restaurant .. Breakfast is a buffet and is like $16 per person .. ( up to 4 kids can eat free off tiny limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price you pay .. As for dinner in the restaurant they really need improvement there too .. Ordered a hamburger that was like paper-thin and was soooo dry and inedible . Onion rings were cold and greasy . The club sandwich was also cheaply made and bread so hard it would break your teeth . Kids did n't  like their food either . They did like the 1 scoop of icecream with dinner though . " Casey- was an amazing server if you get so lucky to have her " and if you do a review while in restaurant you can get 10% off your bill .. They havw a tiny food court with a lil Deli that we did n't try as it was overpriced . They have a lil starbucks with drinks and lil things . The donuts and bagels were nasty but the muffins were pretty good . Everything overpriced though . They also have a pizza restaurant ; we had 1 slice of cheese pizza and it was practically dripping in grease ! It was nasty and the other pizza they were serving looked just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift shop too . All over priced . There are 2 pools and a little splash pad . As for their " waterpark " it is suited for the younger crowd ... to get to the bigger slides you have to go up rope ladders and they are falling apart and do n't  look safe . Also the non skid strips on the steps is worn off so it is slick . The lifeguards seemed to be on point at the regular pool but lacking at the slides as people were running into each other down the slides . They have cabanas but very expensive . And there are a couple bars , and offer alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages , but no whipped cream , booo ... also drinks very expensive tooo ..... They charge $12 a nt for parking , and like $30 a nt for waterpark/resort fee ... The hours of the waterpark suck too .. only 11-7pm ... so after waiting so long to checkin first day , there is like no time to go to waterpark , no can you on last day as checkout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the little slides for 1 day .... There is also a 4D theater with lil 15 min movies , and some lazer maze , but we did n't  do that as they too overpriced . They said they had some family shows but did n't start till 9:45pm , too late for our kiddos .. As for the timeshare presentation it was about 15 min off site , and you have to drive yourself . They do have supervised play room for the kids so that 's nice . They give snacks and sodas/juice . The 90 minute presentation was actually 3 HOURS , and you cant get your gift till the very end .... Soooo not worth it unless you are really bored or actually want to buy a time share . They are very very pushy in the sales and will have like 4 or 5 people try to sell you on one . So for 3 nights for 6 of us it was over $450 just for the room , a total waste of $$$ , and we do not recommended it to anyone .. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holiday Inn brand is soooooo much better than this ... 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

Pop Century is one of Disney 's value resorts . The 3 biggest differences of a Value resort versus moderate is : Exterior Hallways , smaller room usually two double beds ( now two queens , more on that later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort is huge . 5,000 rooms broken up into 5 different sections . Each section is themed by a decade 50s , 60s , 70s , 80s , 90s . We stayed in a new refurbished room in the 90 's building . With the resort being so big you need to do a little homework to try to get an idea ahead of time of where in the resort you want to stay . We have stayed in the 90 's building before the refurbish because we found the location to have the right balance between distance to : parking , bus stop , food court , and pool . We booked our hotel as part of a Disney Vacation . This allowed us to check-in ahead of time . We got an email alerting us for when our room was ready . Then we just walked up to our room waved our magicband and the room was open and ready . The 90 's building has in my opinion the easiest parking lot to access on the resort . The lot is 3rd driveway after you enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms down from cell phone staircase . We were able to park during July 4th week at the bottom of that staircase everyday . Our car was easily accessible all week . Now if we wanted to take the bus or go the food court here is a little secretwe just walked across the parking lot ! The signs direct you through winding walkways between the buildings which took twice as long . Our room was standard due to the distance from Classic Hall but we had some of the closest access when we just walked across the parking lot . The laptop pool was adjacent to the 90 's building and included the laundry building . We also prefer this pool because it is much more quiet than the other two pools . A nice touch was the basketball hoop they installed in the pool . The resort also provided pool basket balls . The two 12 year olds we brought loved it . Pop Century is also connected to Art of Animation Resort by a footbridge over the lake . Well worth the walk to check out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little ones . The Cars section is amazing . Like I mentioned we got a refurbished room which is a huge upgrade from the previous room . Refurbished rooms have a queen size bed raised high enough off the floor to fit a suitcase and other items under it . There is a queen murphy bed when in the wall creates a table , and when down the table folds itself underneath the bed . The hotel provides about 8 pillows so each person has 2 . There is a coffee maker with a drawer stocked with sugar and creamers . A small frig with a little modification of shelves can fit about 10-12 drinks . The dresser is a little short on drawers . Only 3 drawers . But the 50 inch HD SamsungTV really makes up for it . Probably the nicest TV I have seen in any hotel room . The home channel flashes all of the hours of the parks for the day plus weather and other useful info . There are hooks to hang up hats , backpacks , towels , etc . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom . There are at least 8 cubby holes in the bathroom to put toiletries , towels , shoes , just about anything you want to keep your room organized . The bathroom is set up a little unusual than your standard room , but again it is designed to manage space and keep everyone moving . The sink/vanity is open to the rest of the hotel room , but you can use the sliding door to create privacy for changing . The toilet and shower also has its own door . So in theory , you can have 3 sections of the hotel room closed for privacy . You can have one person taking a shower , another brushing their teeth and the other changing in the main hotel room . Very efficient for families . The dTcor is subdued Mickey Mouse meets tiny home . The floor is wood laminate which makes the room feel so much cleaner . The shower has a duel head and also uses a glass door . Disney did a fantastic job of taking a small room and make it functional and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus than a resort . So do n't expect resort amenities . Pizza is the form of room service . The food court is exactly what you expect when I say food court . There are 4 stations offering different types of food , plus a self-serve refrigerator section . Kids meals are around $5 . Adults can go up to $15 . There was plenty of seating in the food court this trip . Currently the 80 's building is closed for refurbishment so that might have affected the crowds in the food court and pools . There is a pool bar and the main pool with fruity drinks . Typical vacation prices there . There is an arcade and gift shop . They also posted a schedule of activities but we did not participate in any of them so I ca n't comment on them . I do know they offer movies under the stars nightly , tie-dye shirt making . Water balloon toss . We were there over the Fourth of July and the resort had a window decorating contest . For transportation options we drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time 50/50 between our car and the buses . If you plan to use the buses especially in the evening expect to stand and to be crowded . Especially when returning from the park you might have to wait for a couple of buses to pick up before your turn . If you do drive parking is free at all the parks because you are staying on property . Also Pop Century has its own bus . Depending on crowd levels the other Value Resorts might share buses extending the time it takes to get around . This was our first time in many years we used the bus and it was n't bad . But again we had 12 year olds . When my son was 3 it was n't even a discussion we rented a car and skipped the bus . But if you are looking to cut costs buses are the way to go . WDW will also pick you up for free from the airport not matter which Disney resort you are staying at . You will run into foreign youth groups and you sports teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This past trip we saw them but did not hear them . I have been on other Disney trips where I had to get my room moved . This year there was a big international baseball tournament so I know the coaches had their players on a curfew . They were up as early as us in uniform getting breakfast . They were all business lol . We have traveled during cheerleader competitions and they would practice their routines in the pool until all hours . It just depends on the groups you get . Do n't let it spoil your vacation . Just pack some earplugs just in case . I did not interact with many cast members because we did check-in and checkout remotely . The cast members doing the housekeeping were very friendly and did a great job of keeping our room clean . In summary keep in mind you are staying at a Disney value resort . There will be lots of people , lots of lines , lots of noise . But the access this resort will give you to the theme parks can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or International Drive . I have done both and it is not the same experience . Especially when you consider the time it takes to get from your hotel to the parks . In the summer you might want to take that afternoon break from the heat and crowds . We looked into staying off property to have a bigger room , but once we weighed in the cost to park , resort fees ( Disney does n't have a resort fee ) time , and the layout of the resort it was an easy choice . <p> This resort was more than I ever thought it could be . It was clean and smells wonderful . All aspects of the resort was updated and welcoming . The entire staff from front desk to housekeeping to pool staff to the restaurant was amazing ! ! ! Will be returning ! ! <p> I stayed 5 nights in mid-July . I chose to stay on-site for transportation purposes and to hopefully get more of a " Disney " experience . I chose Pop Century mainly due to price and the dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amtrak station . There were already a dozen or so people/groups queued to check-in . After waiting about 15 minutes it was my turn . The desk clerk was all smiles and friendly . She walked me through the basics quickly . I was given a room in the 60 's , second floor , poolside . If you want quiet then be sure to specify when making your reservation to be non-pool side . Really , a big deal . The pool is open until 11pm , and three nights I was woken by inconsiderate guests hanging around the pool deck after midnight . Pop Century is definitely a moderately-low level hotel . Sound also comes through the walls pretty well between rooms whether it is voices or plumbing . The bed was very soft , but comfortable . The AC worked perfectly and quietly . There are plenty of outlets to charge multiple devices . The shower is fine . Strong stream with plenty of hot water . The toilet has a very strong flush . Great lighting in shower and over the sink . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining plan before showing up . You can not buy one once you are here . Prices are crazy high , though the food was filling . Since transportation is a key benefit to staying here I will include what I experienced- quick , efficient service . I visited all four parks ( one twice ) . I never had a long wait for a bus and all rides took between 10-25 minutes . The distance from the bus gate to the park entrance varied from park to park , but ultimately I was quite pleased with the transportation . The free WiFi is decent . I was able to do simple email and use the all important Disney app . If I ever decide to return then I would consider staying at Pop Century again but I will definitely be more cautious about which building/room . <p> We have stayed at Pop Century several times in the past , but had not been there for at least 5 years . They have online check-in now which let 's you check in ahead of time , then you receive a text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your key . No wait in line in the lobby to check in . The buildings and decor are in desperate need of renovation . They are badly faded from the Florida sun . Pop Century has become a home base for the many youth sports teams Disney brings in for competitions . We found the hotel to be much louder late into the night because of all the teens . Have fun kids , but keep it down at 1 in the morning please . The thin walls do not keep out your noise . We were able to get a room for $120 , so it was a value in Disney resort terms . <p> This was my first experience at a value hotel at Disney World . I have only stayed at Moderates and Deluxes . I was not sure what to expect , and frankly feared that it would be a let down . I was pleasantly surprised . First let 's get the bad out of the way . Cons : Super slow check in , even after doing online check in . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even after we had filled out our online check in . That would n't have been such a big deal , but the line moved so slow . We did arrive around 8pm , so this may be a busy time to check in . Once we got to the counter everything went fast , it was getting there that took so long . Packed buses . While this was n't an issue during the day , it was a nightly occurrence . I think I ended up being able to sit on a bus at night once out of 6 nights . I know this can be an issue for a few different hotels at Disney World . However , it may be a concern if you rely on Disney transport . Far Away Bus Stops . Most parks had Pop Century bus stops far at the end . Just a minor annoyance at the end of a long day at the parks . Now onto the good . Pros : The rooms were comfy . I really liked the rooms . Now they are n't anything special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfy for crashing after a long day at the parks . I did n't find sound to be an issue ( we were on the 4th floor ) in the rooms . The bathrooms were spacious enough . I did find them a bit dingy , but Pop Century is in the midst of a remodel so that should n't be a problem for much longer . I even found myself missing the fan and hooks when we transferred to Port Orleans . The food court had a lot of options . I found lots of choices when I had to rely on the food court . The lines moved quite quickly , even though it would get packed . The pools are great . I used two of the pools at Pop Century . The first one was the main pool , the Hippy Dippy Pool , was fun and had plenty of places to set down our towels . The Computer Pool was a more quiet pool and was just as enjoyable . Two of the buildings by the pool were being worked on so that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really impressed with Pop Century as another option when visiting Disney World . If your budget will only allow a value Pop Century is a good option . <h> Frequently Asked Questions about Disney 's Pop Century Resort <p> Are smoking rooms available ? No .

The next day the dishwasher had some problem ; the soap exploded everywhere ! Lastly my daughter went to shut the bathroom door and the handle pulled right out . We were not offered to change rooms , nor given any sort of refund not even a complimentary breakfast , I paid a lot of money to stay for a week on vacation not a week of fixing things around the apartment . <p> Tip : The resort is huge and full of things to do , the rooms themselves are nothing special . <p> Our stay at this resort was awesome .

Our last night of course the night we need to sleep so we could be up at 4:30 a.m . To catch a flight we had someone above us that was not loud verbally but we could hear heavy foot steps , doors slamming , slider door to patio slamming shut etc ... I am guessing the people had no idea it was bothering us . My wife did call the front desk and they advised they would call security but we never heard back from anyone and the noise kept going past midnight ! SO get a 4th floor room and maybe you will not have to deal with the noise . Pool areas were nice and pretty clean . We stayed in a 2 room with two bathrooms and it was nice since we had the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parks during lunch and ran out for food and ate it in the room at night . The rooms have everything you need and they were clean . We had one small visitor in the bathroom , we scooped him up and let him go outside ? ?

Wow .. after a long days travel in contending with the heat and humidity Orlando we checked in and got to our villa turn the key and we were amazed , it was very clean very well kept and like home away from home .

The rooms were huge with Jacuzzi in the master bathroom . There is parking facility available . I had booked the apartment for two weeks through RCI from 12th May and 19th May , so as per the hotels policy , they provide house keeping facility once a week . But I checked in on 17th May and checked out on 25th May , so i stayed there for 9 days . Instead of giving me a house keeping facility somewhere in middle of my stay , it was provided after a week on 24th May just before a day of my departure which does not make sense . So would suggest the hotel to look into this and provide flexibility to guest . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

Truth be told , it did terrify , but the two guides used just the right kind of confidence-inspiring pep talks and truly funny jokes -- to make sure we not only survived the order , but actually enjoyed it . <p> Full disclosure here : Forever Florida is a place that celebrates the forests and plains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll see lots of wildlife as you tool along 60 or 70 feet above the ground . Well , it is possible you 'll see animals and birds , but mostly what you 'll enjoy is scenery , and the ability to take in the ' big picture ' of what the unspoiled Florida interior is really like . <p> The Forever Florida folks also offer tours in vehicles in which guests sit on the second level of buses , with a nice view of the surrounding area . The trips are led by naturalists who help make sure you get to see everything there is to see . I know this because a mini-version of the trip is how guests get to the zipline location . Even in that brief journey , it was clear that the bus tour is a really nice way to see the area and all that it offers . Next time we visit , we 'll take the full tour . <p> We felt really good about the fact that our visit to Forever Florida supports a nature conservancy set up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend it enough . <p> Tip : Bring insect repellent , especially if you are one of the people on whom the bugs love to gnaw .

I purchased 4 tix on Reserve Orlando for a full day of ziplining and for the Adventure pack . Our group included people that had never ziplined before , to an experienced army parachuter with hundreds of jumps . The staff ( Tony and Eli ) was wonderful with everyone and assured everyone had a fantastic time ! ! We will be back for horse riding and maybe even an overnight stay ! <p> The Forever Florida Zip-line adventure was an excellent family excursion !

Day or night , we are prepared to offer an experience you will never forget . 98388 @qwx508388 <p> We really enjoyed our time in Florida . The airboat ride at Wild Florida was exceptional . Our boat Captain ( John ) was very knowledgeable of the area where he took us . We seen many gators and other animals that are indigenous to the area . There were three groups in our family and we all made reservations at separate times . Wild Florida was very accommodating in getting our groups together so we could ride in one boat . After the airboat ride we walked through the animal park . We had the pleasure to see feeding 10+ foot alligators and many of the different animals they have on display . Would do it again in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More gators and animals moving about . Do n't be in a hurry . Take your time , relax and have fun . Just as it should be when vacationing . <p> We went to Wild Florida purely for the Sloth Encounter but it has so much more . The Sloth Encounter is around $30 each for 1/2 a hour interaction . The numbers are limited so you do get a decent time to feed the Sloth and get as many photos taken as you want . The keeper was full of knowledge and very friendly . The park itself has loads to do and well worth a visit . It was a new place for us to visit but we will certainly go back next trip to Orlando . <p> I booked the airboat trip from the UK with our Disney/Universal Tickets and phoned ahead to reserve a time as suggested . The weather turned bad as we arrived and Lee ( Very friendly and Helpful ) offered us the choice of waiting to see if the storm cleared or changing our time &amp; coming back another day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booking for us . We went off to explore the gator park/zoo . Its not big but we really enjoyed it . My 16 year old daughter handled a lemur ( requires booking ) and she really had a great time with that . When we went back for the airboat ride a couple of days later , the park was expecting us and it all went efficiently . It is important to note though that this is mid Florida , and not to expect the everglades , which is different terrain &amp; further south . Also like horse riding , flying , &amp; certain theme park rides , the airboat tours are at the mercy of the weather . Anyone who has been in an aircraft struck by lightning ( I have ) will understand that . It was a highlight of our time in Orlando and a welcome change from the huge theme parks . <p> I would definitely recommend that you do the 1 hour tour . The boat Captain is very knowledgeable about Alligators facts that it will fascinate you the whole ride through when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inhabitants . <p> We had read plenty of reviews for Wild Florida and with so many good ones we decided to book nice and early in advance . We booked a combi ticket so we had an airboat ride ( 1hr ) followed by a meet and greet with a Sloth . Wild Florida is a little off the beaten track , we booked our time slot and set off nice and early and even with a TomTom we still got lost , thanks to some lovely staff in a local petrol station who gave us pin point directions and informed us do n't worry we direct folks there every day . We actually arrived as the staff were calling out our names for the boat ride , that day was busy and 2 or 3 air boats set off in different directions . We had Capt . Jeff and he was great , he put people at ease who were nervous and made jokes about the different places people were from . The actual ride was very smooth and your are provided with ear defenders and also small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for photos of wildlife and Jeff was extremely knowledgeable about the local area and all the animals that live there . We even got to see a pair of the famous american bald eagles and a alligator nest , complete with mother and babies ! ! The boat is very fast so I would advise wearing sunglasses so you actually see where your going it also helps keep critters out of your eyes . Once the airboat ride is over your free to look around the wild life park , like a small zoo they have lots of animals to look at . They do timed talks where you can finad out about and touch some animals you would not get the chance to see , let alone stroke . You also get the chance to hold and have your picture taken with a baby gator , the staff took loads of pictures of my kids and us so we knew a hard sell was coming , one of my daughters was alittle afraid so did n't have her picture taken but the nice guy behind the photo desk said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photos to the previous ones all in all i think they took about 60 pics , we also got a set of professionally taken shots ( stock photos ) from around Wild Florida all on a USB stick . It came to about $100 but I thought this was n't too bad for once in a lifetime pictures . The Sloth meet &amp; greet was good but not what we expected , when we booked they were told of the ages of our kids and they said that 's fine but on the day the handler said my 5 year old was too young and could not enter the enclosure , after a compromise she said my hubby could come in after a while and i would sit with our daughter . Once inside she got the Sloth down from a branch and she basically held it and let everyone stroke its back once , barely time to get any pictures of this special moment as my older daughter is sloth obsessed , I do n't  event think it was 5 mins and she put the sloth away saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke . The wild florida park and airboat ride more than warrant a five star review , if you are visiting Florida you really must see it from the front of an air boat ... spectacular There is also food available which was served hot and tasted all ok , typical american fair , burgers , hot dogs etc . There is also a good gift shop .

Less then desirable is the best way i can put it . Staff speaks little to no English , and after requesting no service it was done so anyways . Now the positives , Your close to cheaper restaurants , your close tourist area for the price of being outside the area . <p> Hello everyone I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend in March . We were on vacation and I was trying to save some money so I thought I 'd give this place a try . First let 's start off with the room itself , they were pretty nice for what you pay . I loved the fact that it had a washer and dryer because we just ended up washing our clothes towrds the end of our stay . Also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by buying our own food and making it their or microwaving left overs . The futon was however very old and uncomfortable . The sheets on the bed were very thin and smelled a little old . When we arrived to this hotel it was way before the check in time so I asked the front desk girl if I could leave my bags there . She said yes that I could leave it in a storage room because there was no bell service . I left my stuff and we went off to universal island of adventure . We returned a few hours later to check in and we asked the guy that was now at the front desk if we can retrieve our stuff he said yes . So we grabbed our stuff checked in and we went to our room . When I was looking over my belongings I realized that I had a pair of shoes missing . I go to the front desk and report the incident and was told that the owner would get back to me once he checked the surveillance tape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he could n't see anybody coming out the room with my shoes because to many people go in and out . Than God I locked my other luggage and the only one I did n't lock was my backpack that had the shoes . It 's no big deal since it was only $40 shoes but it could have been something else . We ended up checking out early since it made us feel uncomfortable . As far as the location it 's pretty dark at night but the general area seemed pretty chill . It is behind an abandoned hotel so that can be a bit of a sore eye . The Disney parks are much closer than universal from here . I hope this helps you guys make a decision . <p> It was by a creepy abandoned hotel and the surroundings are very suspicious . The office was n't even really an office either it was just a hotel room with a counter . Barely anyone was there except for like two staff members and there were only 3 cars in the parking lot . Ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of luggage you 'll have to carry it upstairs . But there are A LOT OF LEECHES . Yes my brother even took a picture of how many there are . They are so many leeches especially by the stairs I was scared to walk but them . So the hotel was ok ish . It had a really bad smell and beds were terrible , also very poor lighting . Do n't come here if u r alone and there are much better hotels . Oh ya e pools looked disgusting so no need to pack a swim suit . <p> Had a reservation and went to the hotel . Only one car in the whole parking lot . Door to office was locked . We call numerous times , knocked on the office door and walked around the building . Nothing . We call the company who we booked with and they called the hotel as well . Have still never answered the phone . Luckily we got our money refunded and was able to find another hotel right up the road . When we got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Crazy stuff . Only 1 car and no ones at the hotel . It is also behind an abandoned hotel . Nothing like what it seems . <p> The staff are friendly . That is the only positive about this place . Do not stay here if you do n't have a car for sure . Do not recommend for women traveling alone at any price . This was once an awesome all suite hotel . Now parts of it , that have not been condemned , are old , worn , dirty and unsafe .

And to make matters worse a couple of scooters lined up and so even when the bus did eventually arrive we had to wait another ten minutes in the heat for them to board first !

The Sanaa restaurant has quick breakfast and it 's the regular expansive cafeteria food , nothing special . We did go to a buffet at Jiko 's which is alright . There is a small van that takes you to and from the main Animal Kingdom Villas and the Kidani Village . Most of the children and cultural activities are there so you 'll need to go back and forth on your off day at the hotel . At night , they show movies in the family where you are get packaged popcorn free . The craft kits you have to buy . I might come back next time when we have more free time to actually enjoy the hotel . But to enjoy the park to the fullest you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So my favorite is still Grand Floridian . <p> This is my home resort and it does n't disappoint . It 's away from the hustle and bustle of most Disney Attractions but it 's very close to Animal Kingdom Park . The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable . You can control the temperature of your room too . Nice sized kitchen to cook if you choose to eat in . Casual China is clean and ready for you to use . You have the convenience of a washer and dryer for laundry while you are playing in the parks . You do n't have to have a Savannah View room because there 's plenty of opportunities to see the animals outside of your room . The parking garage is underneath the resort which is a blessing during hot summers . Definitely worth staying at while at Disney . <p> " Coffee in the morning with the animals was a great start to the day ! " <p> Reviewed July 10 , 2017 NEW <p> Loved , loved , loved the theming ! Thoroughly enjoyed seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run and play each day . The LONG walk to our room was a little much each day so I would recommend asking to be close the lobby . Room was very nice but dark . It goes with the theming but made getting ready in the bathroom a little difficult ! Would absolutely recommend to families with children . Pools were very nice and the outside bar was great for a quick bite or drink . Make time to have the bread service at Saana . You wo n't be disappointed ! <p> Animal Kingdom 's Kidani Village is beautiful with great amenities . There is an arcade and activities center for both adults and kids . The 3 bedroom Villa sleeps 12 , and has kitchen has dishes , pots , pans , silverware etc .... . There is a pool with a water slide and jacuzzi . There is also a bar that you can order food and drinks . The only issue I had during my stay is the lack of animals roaming . We had a Savannah view and there were very few animals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and have seen plenty of animals roaming the property . This time we mostly saw grass and trees . <p> We have been to Disney and the cruise more than a couple of times , so are familiar with Disney courtesy and quality ! We came to explore the new Pandora Park and Avatar attractions , so thought that Animal Kingdom for our stay made sense . The service was so awful and we were treated by everyone so poorly we called to book other accommodations less than a few hours into our stay . The very next morning , when we called the front desk to ask where we could find coffee the girl who answered literally said she was n't sure because she did not drink coffee ... no offers to find an answer or connect to someone else ... nothing ! ! ! When the bellman did not show up for our bags after 30 minutes I called back . When he returned , he had our " privacy " door tag in his hand and said because that was on the door he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that he had to walk all the way back to the bell stand and was making his second trip to our room . He was rude &amp; I was furious . This is the very first review I have written and I am writing it in hopes that it will keep someone from spending their hard earned money and precious vacation time at the Animal Kingdom Resort . We left and checked into Grand Floridian and it was night and day . Even if another resort is a little more money it is well worth it . Please avoid this resort . BTW ... Pandora at Animal Kingdom Park is absolutely amazing ! ! ! 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

We 'll likely be staying here every time . Short driving distance to Disney , restaurants within walking distance if necessary . Our room was bigger than we thought it 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The hotel itself needs some updating , particularly the first floor . The staff was very courteous and accommodating , even when we were late to breakfast - which was rather a nice feast considering the price of the hotel . <p> Tip : The hotel sits back off the road and has a very little round sign which is easy to miss ! <p> I give the hotel 3 stars . The beds were comfortable and the room was moderately clean . I think the bathroom could have been better cleaned and one of our comforters smelled like body odor . Beds were made and towels were refreshed daily . The breakfast bar was disappointing - mainly frozen waffles and cereal were the options - no fruit or yogurt - I was disappointed in that and had to spend money on breakfasts which I did not budget . Overall it 's a good hotel for the money - you get what you pay for . <p> The staff is friendly . American owner on site . Clean rooms . Affordable . Quiet . Great location to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel for you and your family . One of the best budget priced hotels I 've ever had the pleasure to stay at.You wo n't be disappointed . <p> The hotel is great . The staff are so friendly and helpful , really ca n't fault them over the past 2 weeks we 've been here . They 've helped us from suggesting things to do to lending us a bottle opener for our daily bottle of wine . The rooms are comfortable and spacious ( the king size bed is a super king if you 're from the UK ie loads of room ) . It 's been handy having a fridge and microwave especially if you 've brought home food and a bottle of wine after a long day at the parks . As for location I was so pleasantly surprised . There 's a great selection of restaurants and supermarkets on route 192 and the disney is literally a 10 minute drive . All in all its a decent hotel , decent pool , decent location and great staff . I would happily recommend it to family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' very good ' reviews on tripadvisor . Our check-in was uneventful . ( I was expecting a gushing welcome from welcoming reception staff ) The room was smaller than other hotel rooms , but it was well equipped . ( Where do you put two large suitcases ? ) Breakfast was good , though the room could get crowded . We enjoyed our time at the pool . It was clean and towels were plentiful . Why have I given a 4 star rating ? This is mainly down to the efforts of the manager who literally lives and breathes the job . His sole quest is to look after his guests to the best of his ability . I would like him to know that a couple from England , appreciated everything he did for them <p> Let me start off by saying this , apparently , the owner has just acquired this property , and is in the process of fixing it up .

My mother requested a room close to ours and she was 3 doors down . The rooms are very quaint but in talking to the owner I think he has some great plans for that place . I am excited to go back and see what he dose ! beware not a lot of storage space as of June 2017 . <p> I stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights and was pleasantly surprised .

Housekeeping is available you and the property . 98388 @qwx508388 <p> This was my second time staying at Disney 's Boardwalk Inn and Villas . Last year we stayed on the Inn side , and this year the villas . For this review I will talk mainly of my experience at the villas . Stayed 8 nights in a Studio . We were in room 5054 which is perfectly located . The view from the balcony was of the feature pool , with the Tower of Terror at Hollywood Studios visible to the left and the Swan resort to the right . We could see part of the Star Wars Fireworks from the balcony too which was a lovely surprise . Along with the lovely views , our room was accessible very quickly from the lobby . Just hop on the elevator to the 5th floor and a small walk down a hallway to our room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one of the biggest selling points is its location . I visit WDW 3-4 times a year and love many of the resorts , but if I had to choose one overall favorite , it would be the Boardwalk and a big reason is that location simply ca n't be beat . Short 5-10 minute walk ( or you can boat if you like ) to what is called the International Gateway entrance to Epcot , and a 20 min walk ( or boat ride ) to Hollywood Studios . Additionally , the many restaurants and bars on the Boardwalk itself just outside the lobby doors adds a whole other level of convenience . You will find nightly entertainment on the Boardwalk as well in the way of magicians , mimes , etc . If you are considering a stay at the Boardwalk - do yourself a favor and just book it . you wo n't be sorry ! <p> I stayed here for 4 nights and spent the extra points to make sure I had a Boardwalk view - and it did not disappoint ! The room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet paper roll in the toilet , the sliding glass door was full of hand prints ( clearly not cleaned from the last guest ) and I found a stain on my sheets that was down by my calves on my last morning which was a little unfortunate . They also did n't have a traditional set of dresser drawers in the room . They had a white cabinet next to the tv which had additional linen and I suppose you could have moved some of that around to put your clothes in there but I kept some of my stuff in my suitcase and the rest I hung up in the closet . The room itself was a decent size and the view was great ! For my particular room though there was no balcony divider between my room and the room next door which was a little odd . The boats to and from EPCOT and Studios were convenient although I only took it to EPCOT but the parking lot feels like it 's a mile from the entrance ! ( exaggeration but it is a far walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had plenty of lounge chairs available . I would absolutely consider staying on site again ! <p> Boardwalk is our favorite resort ! We can walk to Epcot and to Hollywood Studios or enjoy a leisurely boat ride to either park . The rooms are newly remodeled and comfortable . This trip we had a one bedroom standard view villa which has a full , but small , kitchen . We brought a friend who had never been to Disney World before and she said she could live in the villa : ) The sofa bed is comfortable with no middle bar , just a nice thick mattress . Our guest said she slept well every night . The standard view was nicer than we expected with a view of the pond near the main entrance and an easy exit to the bus stop . Halls are really long at BW but everything is a walk at Disney so it does n't bother us . The Boardwalk at night is fun , with magicians and other performers . There is no counter service restaurant but there is a pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream at Ample Hills Creamery is amazing ! ! ! <p> We stayed in a 2 bedroom lock off . It was immaculate . The hotel is central to Epcot and Hollywood studios . The pool was so much fun for my granddaughter . The recreation staff made the trip . The games at the pool and community hall were great . <p> For me , the Epcot area resorts are a hands-down favorite to the monorail resorts . We visited the Boardwalk last year and HAD to stay there this for this year 's Disney trip . First , the negative , but there is so much more positive ! The cons : bell service was horrific . Rude and we never got our entire off-site grocery order , even after 3 phone calls and stops at the desk . Made sure to be prepared ahead of time with fresh fruit and bottled water , and we never got it . I ca n't help but think this was Disney 's way of messing with us and making us buy their water ! The other con was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first floor . Of course , we requested a high floor ( Disney MUST ignore room requests ) . The only problem was the hospital-like bathroom and shower . No tub to relax in or dunk the kid in ! I do n't feel like I am at a resort if there is no bath tub . Also , tiny amount of storage . Do not select these villas if you require lots of storage . Tough to get a chair by the pool unless you are out there early . Pros : location , location , location ! Gorgeous views , endless dining options and free entertainment at the Boardwalk . Never waited long for a bus to the parks . You can walk to the World Showcase in 10 minutes or dine at the Swan and Dolphin , Beach Club or Yacht Club . Grab breakfast at the Boardwalk Bakery and wine at the Screen Door General Store . All so convenient . Fun for the whole family .

Located at the entrance of the Walt Disney World- Theme Parks , with convenient access to the Walt Disney World- Resort , Universal Studios and all major area attractions , the Orlando Vista is the ideal choice for families and business travelers looking for Disney area hotels . Our unique Orlando accommodations set the value standard for hotels near the Walt Disney World- Theme Parks , starting with a highly desirable location . <p> We are located near the entrance to Downtown Disney- Resort area and offer a FREE shuttle to all four Walt Disney World- Theme Parks . 98388 @qwx508388 <p> This was our 1st time staying at the Delta hotel in Lake Buena Vista . My husband upon arrival upgraded us to a pool view balcony room #412 . This is a stand up balcony , but was great way to relax outside and watch the kids swimming in the pool and watched the summer storms roll in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok room , bathroom was very small .... over all was a fairly clean room . Everyone at the hotel was very pleasant , breakfast is offered for $12.99 each morning , there is a small bar at the hotel . Walking distance to several restaurants . <p> We were scheduled for a 3 night stay . Everything seemed wonderful initially . The Hotel Receptionist were polite , courteous and professional . However , by the 2nd day I was trying to make plans to depart earlier . Consequentially , upon my return back to the hotel room there were no towels in the room , the floor was n't vacuumed and the room was partially serviced . I was shocked because prior to my arrival I did read a post that stated rooms were n't being properly serviced ! <p> A couple things kept this stay from being 5 stars for us , one minor and one major but will mention it later on in the review . The hotel is perfect if you 're going to the theme parks because you do n't pay the premium price like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Disney World , 15-20 minutes from Universal Studios and 20 minutes walking to Disney Springs . ( Sorry , did n't have time to go to the other theme parks ... ) . The hotel is clean , they have a Peet 's coffee in the lobby which was perfect for a caffeine addict like me , and everyone at the front desk provided great customer service , always . I 've attached the shuttle service schedule to Disney that I received when I was there ( July 2017 ) because it seems many people were asking about that . I will note , we utilized ride sharing ( lyft , uber ) almost everyday to and from because of the convenience of picking your own times and being dropped off at the front gate of Epcot and Animal Kingdom ( Magic Kingdom drop offs require a monorail ride to the front gate but that 's the same whether you take a bus or shuttle ) . The one time we took the shuttle at night it took an hour to get back to the hotel because they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Delta . So for convenience and time we chose other modes of transportation but it was $11-12 one way due to the proximity of the hotel , which in our opinion costs less than car rental and parking ( $15 at the hotel and $20 at Disney ) . They do not have laundry service like someone mentioned , do n't know where they got that info , nor are there washing machines on site . You can walk to Courtyard by Marriott about 10 minutes away to utilize their washing facilities , which the reps at the front desk suggested . Worked fine for us . But do take quarters as it 's $2 for a load to wash and $2 to dry . Now for the two not so greats .... 1 . The room was clean when we got there but the two times housekeeping came during our stay they did a very average job at best . The second time we wondered if they even came in at all and only found out they did when the towels in the bathroom was restocked ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I accidentally smudged the mirror in the room the second day and the two times housekeeping came the smudge remained till the day we left . And it was just me and my husband , no big mess or anything . Not major but something to note . 2 . The minus one star is really for room service and if you do n't use it or want it that 's good . We were just so tired one night , the night before we left , we did n't want to go out to eat so we decided to order food from room service . Big mistake . Took over an hour to get a pizza , salad and a bottle of wine . And they were out of the wine we wanted and gave us other options but did n't know how much it cost . How can I order a bottle without knowing the price ? The attendant flustered and fumbled and said she 'd called me back with the prices . So tired of waiting I marched downstairs to get my food myself and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Sigh . Longest wait ever for a very simple meal . And when we started to eat we realized they forgot a bottle opener and silverware . Icing on the cake . Waited another 10 minutes for that but how can you not bring a bottle opener for wine ? And silverware for a salad ? ? Maybe they were busy maybe they were understaffed but I brought it up with the attendant working for room service so let 's hope it gets passed on and things improve . Like I said if you do n't utilize the room service and keep a pretty clean room you 'll love this place . <p> This place was very cute , clean and staff was friendly . 5 mins from the outlet , lots of restaurant around . Close to Disney and universal . It is about 20 min from the airport . 10 mins from orange convention . <p> Currently at the Delta hotel . Rooms are clean , spacious and modern . Lobby very nice .

We had originally booked a camping site then after the Fl wildfires , upgraded to the Cars Suite at the AoA . When I spoke to the cast member on the phone , I requested a room close to transportation . When we checked in , our room was all the way in the back of the farthest building from the bus line . They did however , change our room . I asked if we would still get the nice view and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service entrance where we watched trucks unload supplies all day on our break days . The new room was disgusting . There was someone 's dirty sock made up in our bed . There was a used bandaid in the fold down bed . The carpet was filthy and stained . There were tears in the couch . The furniture was knicked up and black marks on the walls . The tv had a greasy film on it and it consistently lost signal . When I called the front desk and spoke with " Margee " I think ( her English was n't very good ) , she was very rude and asked me what else I wanted , I had already changed rooms twice ! I explained to her that we upgraded from the campsite , on our own and paid the difference and the AOA room was not close to transportation as requested . She said , " and you 're still not satisfied ? ? " . She said she 'd get me a room the next day sometime after checkout if I wanted it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in this hotel again . Thank goodness this lady was the only rude cast member we encountered but the whole situation put a black cloud over our vacation . I stayed mad the whole trip .

Previously stayed at modern and deluxe Disney properties . Short 3 night 4 day impromtu visit with my 8 y/o granddaughter . Stayed in a Mermaid room . From the time we walked into the resort , my granddaughter was mesmerized . This property is amazingly laid as only Disney can do . As most say , Mermaid rooms are far from Dining and main pool but certainly walkable . Rooms are smaller personally would n't want to stay with more than 2 people in a room . Room was clean and comfortable . Air conditioning was not a problem and it was HOT while we were there . Main pool was fantastic . Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did meal plan . Enough options and portions are beyond plentiful . Cast members are phenomenal . Bus service to parks decent . This is a huge resort . Lots of people to accommodate . I would most certainly stay here again . <p> 4 of us - Aiden ( 5yrs old ) Maria ( his mom ) Amale ( his grandma ) and Wendy ( his grandma ) booked to stay at the Art of Animation - Nemo Suites in May 2017 . Though seemly expensive , it is so totally worth every single penny . The resort is amazing - great pool and so much to see - everywhere ! The resort is split into 4 sections - Nemo , Lion King , Cars and Little Mermaid . You are able to walk around and enjoy all sections of the resort . The kids and adults will have a blast . There is one buffet restaurant to service all the sections but it is very ( Disney ) organized and all runs smoothly . Our room had a fridge and microwave - along with a sink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate bedroom , a Murphy bed and a love seat that can be pulled out for an extra sleeping spot . The lobby is just stunning . Large and Disney artwork everywhere . We had a great time and will encourage anyone who is thinking about this resort - do it ! ! We did not have a car and the Disney bus transportation worked perfectly well . Never waited long for the next bus . Just want to add that everything here is bigger than life and every square inch is themed in fun characters and colours . Bravo Disney - thanks for the memories ! <p> We arrived at MCO and made our way to Disney 's Magical Express , the whole process went smoothly and we soon were arriving at Art of Animation to start our amazing holiday . The check in process was smooth and quick , we got our magic bands and directions to our room in the Little Mermaid building . I had read many reviews on trip advisor before travelling so anticipated a very long walk to our room from the main reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check how long it took . We got to our building within 7 minutes of leaving the reception and this included a play in the caves in the Lion King elephant graveyard on the way ! So do n't let other reviews put you off . We left our things and went back out to get something to eat and drink . Before making our way to landscape of flavours , we went to the front desk to ask if we could have bed rails attached to a bed for our two year old . When we got back to our room later , the bed rails were already fitted and we were delighted with this . The hotel cast members could not have been more willing to help with anything we ever spoke to them about . The food at landscape of flavours was very tasty , especially the pizza . We also enjoyed the breakfast sandwiches . Lots of fruit on offer for the little ones , too . We bought the fast serve cups for $18 which gave us unlimited drinks from the hotel fountains throughout our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our growing family and vastly increasing cost for the suites , we probably wo n't be able to stay there on our next visit in 2019 .

Checked again at 1130am before heading to Disney , again declined , no rooms are ready yet . The clerk allowed us to lock our bags in a utility closet , we asked if she needed our name or reservation but the clerk said no , we will just check you in when you get back . We were given the wrong time for the return shuttle , so we took a cab back from Disney . When we tried to check in at 1100pm , 12 hours after our last request we were told there were no rooms available . ( Our room was prepaid so how does this happen ) ? We were notified that all hotels were full being Valentine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel next door was offered for the night , we were walked over to the other hotel , when we tried to get into the room at midnight it was occupied ! We walked back to the Allure hotel where after another 30 minutes we were given another room . This room was filthy , the towel bar hanging off the wall , the toilet did n't flush , large white stains on the carpet and walls , it looked like the beds had been slept in and just re-made and of there were small bugs crawling around the sink . Obviously we will never stay at this property again ! <p> I was at the Allure Resort at 8444 International Drive in Orlando Florida for 5 nights , checking in on 7/11 and checking out on 7/16 . When I checked in I specifically asked the clerk to give me a room with no problems . She must have thought I said WITH problems because that 's exactly what I got . The problems were : 1 . Toilet running continuously , 2 . Water dripping continuously from shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front desk on 2 occasions , but the problem was never corrected . When I checked out water was all , over the bathroom floor from the dripping shower head . 3 . Roaches in dresser drawer . I unpacked my clothes and placed them in dresser drawer . The next morning when I opened the drawer a roach was crawling on my clothes . I snatched them out of the drawer and threw on the floor . Unfortunately the " critter " got away . I was traumatized and reported the incident to the gentleman at the front desk . He acted like this was no big deal and stated that he would report it . 4 . The remote control to the v was antiquated , had rubber numbers that were hard to push . Also did not have a menu to see the line up if shows , etc . Only on &amp; off and numbers to change the channels . There was a channel guide in the room , but most of the channels were not connected . Also I was given the instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect to my IPAD. 5 . Additionally the room was also dirty and stale smelling and the toilet paper was rough . The actual room looked nothing like the pictures on the website . I have been traveling for more than 40 years and even the people with the slogan , " we 'll leave the light on " was far better than this . <p> I went through booking.com for my reservation . Online , it was stated that they would not take payment until I got there . They took it five seconds after I reserved . That was strike one . Strike two was when I get there ... was not at all pleased . The only thing that was okay was the restaurant downstairs . Outside of that , naah . Had I not been there to see my son and the lack of funds , I would have found another place . I was not so fond of the rooms , although I did like the bathroom . The maid service was awesome . Overall , however , I ... naah ... <p> I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast " = just bread + coffee &amp; juice . Nothing to put on your bread except butter . No place to sit , super long lines because there are only 2 slow doubletoasters and half of them literally broken , so you can toast only 4 breads per time and it takes 3-4 minutes . Sounds great in a big hotel like this ? No wonder you have to stay in line so long that you just want to go somewhere else . <p> This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at . We called for 6 days straight trying to get ahold of the manager ( Thomas ) which never called us back . The last stay we had here had no ac , used toilet paper , opened soap , and COCKROACHES . So we called &amp; they told us we 'd get a free night which we never received until 2 months later of calling . So when we called the front desk about the roaches the lady at the front ( stephanie ) was so rude . She sighed on the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word to us . Then when we switched rooms the AC again was not working . If I could write this hotel below a one star , I definitely would . Worst hotel ever do n't stay here <p> Checked in on Saturday night July 1st , 2017 . First thing a couple we 're at the check in desk complaining about the room they were assigned was dirty and had not been cleaned yet . My first thought was oh no here we go again , bad choice of a foreign owned hotel . Second impression which also was not good is the lobby was old out dated and needed an update such as dirty ceiling tiles , mirror behind check in desk looked as if someone sprayed windex on it , let it dry and never came back to finish cleaning it . Next problem was they had no A/C in the lobby and as I walked around the corner I noticed a large 4 " to 5 " round black hose coming from a large conference room with a blower on the other end blowing air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the elevator in the building outside and across the way entered the door and while waiting on the elevator I noticed no A/C in the hallways as well . Got on the elevator hit the sixth floor , got off the elevator and no A/C on sixth floor either . Did I mention the elevator was like a sauna , you got it no A/C it in there either . Finally got to the room and opened the door expecting a great room and first cam the smell , not the worst but also not the best but the A/C worked . It was clean but old and musky mildew in the old carpet smell . Checked the shower and found only three towels , two wash rags and one hand towel for four people for a two night stay . So , if you see this hotel on any of the booking sights , be aware . The pictures are from long long ago when it was a nice new resort and in it 's haydays and not the way it looks today . If you look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapped up like a gift basket on the sink vanity , people sitting around a nice clean pool , beds made with golden bed spread across the foot of the beds , a lobby with pool tables and so on , well all this looks great on the internet on there site but that is not what you get . This place is run down and needs a serious facelift if not torn down and rebuild new . To me personally , it appears as one of those hotels owned by foreigners who are finishing the old " run it in the ground " without putting money back into the business for future upgrades to what us to be a beautiful and wonderful Orlando resort . Oh did I mention my refrigerator in the room did not work and they would not give me another room , they said they did n't have another room . Beware unless you just do n't care . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

First of all- there was no parking so it cost $6 for the parking garage . It was so crowded you could n't get to anything . They should have closed it due to being over capacity . There were lines for everything . After standing in line for 30 minutes my girls got up to the ropes course and they told hem they could n't go on because they had sandals on and one wore glasses and they did n't have a strap .

Lines were incredibly long for everything and some of the high demand rides were closed . I wish we would 've spent our time and money elsewhere . I will note that we have been to the Panama City location multiple times and always have a blast .

We drove 9 hours to get there and they wanted to charge me extra if we checked in before 4:00 . My email confirmation stated one price and when we got there they wanted to charge me almost $140.00 more . Spoke with the supervisor and she stated she would handle it at check in time . Well at 4:00 we went back to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . She still argued with me about the amount and I even showed her the email again . We had 4 tired adults , 2 aggravated kids , and one irritated dog , so I paid what they asked for , which was more than my confirmation email . I enjoyed the stay , but staff was awful ! ! Doubt I will stay there again and I let them know it at check in ! ! ! <p> Me and my family of five stayed in this average hotel a few weeks ago . When we arrived ( after waiting in a line for 15 minutes to be served ) we were asked for our car registration , passport and credit card . After showing the passport and credit card we told them we did n't hire a car ( at that point . ) We were then informed that might be a problem as we were put in a block far away from reception . We then had to wait for around 15 more minutes until someone came with a golf cart that was too small to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in one piece . Our apartment was on the second floor and was very basic with a microwave that spoke Spanish . We had no kettle and knives but did say that you could ask for them but surely they should be in the room when you arrive All of the rooms were spacious . the beds were massive and clean - when we arrived . The bedrooms were alright with one super king sized bed in one room that could sleep four and the other being a two double beds also able to sleep four- two in each . In total we would say this apartment could sleep up to eight if needed too . The air conditioning in these rooms was old and very noisy . The living room matched the theme of the hotel , basic . The chairs looked tired and the television had very few channels around 10 to 15 in total they had two Spanish channels and the rest were in English . The air conditioning was old and very noisy much like the bedrooms . the bathroom looked like it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so dirty there was grime when the shampoo bottles were moved . The bath being very small it was difficult to actually take a bath . The shower was old and worked but has seen much better days The kitchen as previously mentioned had a microwave that spoke Spanish that we could not figure out how to work and lacked some basic appliances . The fridge freezer was good as it was very big . Did n't really look the part but worked great . The coffee maker made basic coffees - yet again following the theme of the hotel . We used the dishwasher every day and it was quite loud but it worked and did its job okay . The stove had two rings , slightly disappointing but the few times we used them they worked okay The balcony view was lovely , a car park with a skip in it . Not exactly the pool view we requested . It had three chairs and a table . They were hard metal and not very comfortable Getting on to the hotel in general most people staying were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The area the hotel was in was also bilingual which might provide to be a problem assuming you do not have a car to go places . The pavements feel very unsafe with confusing crossings . The hotel buildings were very old , and need of the upgrading which was going on . They have a car park at every block of rooms where you can park if you have a car . The pool always had a group of people in it , me and my children could only get in it two times in the two weeks we stayed there . There were people in it even at 1am which made it very hard to sleep as they were making a lot of noise . The hotel should limit when you can go in to the pool to a more reasonable time . In conclusion this is a basic hotel , if that 's all you want then this hotel is for you . Despite lacking in a lot of departments it has all you need , and that 's all . On another note please if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make your experience so much better . <p> It was fine stay We had 2 suites each sleep 6 . The rooms were clean and neat Kitchen was simple arrangement for basic needs Housekeepers were helpful The kids like the swimming pool They have game room and laundry room I like the location . The nightmare was upon check in . For the first time I experienced the receptionist was chewing gum while serving the guests with no shame . I felt disrespectful . Also , we took 25 minutes waiting to be served . We were there at 4 pm on a Thursday and guests started to arrive for their check in . It was only 2 receptionists while other 2 were just watching at the side . I expect a manager or a supervisor at least to help out and manage the crowd . Also , we and other families had to wait ( we waited 15 muinets and other families were already there before us 15 munites ) after calling the front office to open the swimming pool . Well , you do n't expect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are on a tight budget with big family members or friends and you want to enjoy Orlando activities , therefore , I think this will suit your plan . <p> I stood in the celebration suites from June 27-July4th3017 . I booked this hotel two months in advance I told them I need early check in and a room with an old town view . When I got there my room was n't ready and I had to wait into regular check in time . I did not get my request of my old town view . My room was dirty and the kitchen had been stained . The toilet seat was stained as well . The tub had hair in the drain and even after it was cleaned it was still rusted and so was the toilet paper holder . The little stove they give you was horrible as well . The stairs and walk way to the rooms was dirty . I told pictures of the room . It was so disgusting . I would never stay there again not even for free . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your looking for a great hotel . It 's also great location . <p> I chose this place because it was close to Old Town which is a really neat place to visit . We had a great time visiting Old Town however the hotel was disgusting . Not only could we absolutely not walk to Old Town from our hotel room the location of the room was very shady . I did not feel safe to walk out to the car by myself without my boyfriend by my side . Not only that the room was not very clean and had roaches ! Next time I would prefer to stay in a hotel that I have to over to or drive to to go to Old Town rather than stay at this hotel . I would not recommend staying here to anyone unless you are on a very strict budget and do n't mind Shady hotels that are not very clean and have roaches. 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

I was so excited when I found out where we were going . When we pulled in everything was beautiful and unreal . It felt like we pulled up to a movie scene . We absolutely love that there is an airport on the ranch so we can fly in next time . The swamp buggy tour is a blast , especially when you go through the water ( I recommend sunscreen ) . If you are great with horses I recommend the 2-hour horse back ride . The rodeos are very exciting . They had trick riders , bull riders , and horse competitions . The rooms in the lodges are super adorable . However , the Grill was small , somewhat clean , and the service was horrible . Our food came out the same time as the appetizers . The food was plain and boring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort could provide more amenities for the guest staying at the resort . It was very open , you pay to stay at the resort but also have to pay for every single activity , meal , golf cart , etc . Should include a package for those staying there for vacation . Lastly , the pool was nothing exciting , standard and small . <p> It is a good place to come with children , lots of activities out doors although expensive when you have several children , because you have to pay for every one . Little to nothing to do when raining , no inside game rooms . You have to lock yourself with the children in the room . You have to pay daily to have Internet ! Now a days every hotel offers free internet . Only has one restaurant , food is very bad so is the service . We were 2 parties together , 4 adults and 6 Children , we ate there , the first day it was bad , slow , waitress was confused brought the wrong dish to few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to wait for it after everybody else had eaten .

We planned to have our diners in the resort and lunch in the room , light sandwiches or so , but since the food was not good had to go to nearest store 22 miles away to buy food to cook in the room . Suggest you change your chef or cooks and offer good food . <p> My husband and I and my two children ages 9 and 13 just got back from the most incredible glamping weekend ! The staff there is so friendly and helpful especially Brooke ! We rented a golf cart for the weekend but it is n't needed , you can drive your car all around if you 'd like . When we checked in we received the cutest s'more kit for the campfire ! When we got to our tent with someone from their staff to make sure everything was up to par we walked into our tent and the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the coolest way to camp and everything was so clean ! The staff showed us how to operate everything and where the restroom was , which was also very clean and then left us to get situated . There is so much to do here ! Airboats , pontoons to rent , ziplines , archery , swamp buggies , a petting zoo , my husband and son went skeet shooting twice because they loved it so much and the guys were so nice ! Saturday night was the rodeo . It was so fun to watch and the kids were able to chase calves and try to get ribbons off of them . I highly recommend this activity for the whole family ! ! Overall , everywhere we went everyone was so friendly and the facility 's were so clean , and I am pretty picky about that . The staff checked on us frequently and was always there when we needed them . I highly recommend this place if you are looking for something different with lots to do . Oh I forgot to mention , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't want to leave ! This is definitely a trip we will never forget . We are already planning our next trip with my extended family in December . I know they will love it ! <p> It all started with rude reservation people who refused to let us know if we could check in early although we called at 6pm the night before . When arrived at the room ( #163 at the lodge ) it smelled like mold and the wifi did n't work . A maintenance person came by and told me that there was a flood in the room due to excess rain and that they had the smell tested and it was not toxic . NOT TOXIC ! ! ! I had 2 children under 3 years old with me and was certainly not comfortable with them telling me not to worry about the smell of mold . Rooms were filled with old furnishings and bedding . The whole place needs major upgrading . Activities were really limited to Saturday and Saturday night . Given we had to check out by 10am we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when you have a check out time of 10am and ca n't check in before 4pm you have issues in managing room clean up .

Total rip off . <p> This place provide a fun-filled family adventure in the great outdoors ! We loved taking our 14 and 11year olds here to " glamp , " rode horses , trap shoot , fish , enjoy a rodeo and the adventure park ) .

So , we all met in Kissimmee and rented what we thought was a 4 bedroom townhouse . Much to our surprise , we ended up with a 5 bedroom instead . It was exactly what we needed .

We did encounter a major screwup with our reservation with Magical Memories . We had originally booked a different complex , but we called to upgrade later . When we got there to check in , our reservation was somehow missing and so they were going to put us into a private home instead . We were really happy about that until after 5 minutes in the car , they called us back and said the house was n't available after all .

It was my first time there and the setting was very nice and clean , not like your typical bowling alley that smells like wet shoes ! This facility was very nice , the shoes we rented were in tact , and our server John , was very friendly and attentive to our needs . He set up the games , offered us water , then took our order . The food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was an awesome experience ! <p> We went there on a Saturday while on a weekend getaway to Orlando . We had three people and wanted to Bowl . We were told it was $15 per game per person which seemed super expensive . They offered us a deal for $50 we would get 2 games and shoes included . Since we were on vacation we accepted . The place was nice and the alleys were well kept . We had lunch which moderately priced and the food and service was good . They bring the food right to your alley where there are couches and tables . After bowling we were going to play pool . They told us we could not as we did not have reservations to play . If you plan to go there I would recommend you call first . We tried to go back later that night and were stopped at the door . I guess it turns into a club at night and they would not admit my daughter who was under 18 . If you plan to go at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there during the week they advertised bowling specials that were much more reasonable then weekend rates . It looks like they do party packages too that may be fun . The lobby is cute and has pictures of famous people all over the wall that have been there . I would look for a coupon or Groupon before going , but it was fun . <p> Used a Groupon voucher for $60 value which got a game of bowling for four and some fun on the foosball table . We were given a lane in the Royal Room which was amazing ! The atmosphere was great and our server Justine was fab - nothing was too much trouble . We had pizza and dessert to share and some sodas and the prices were very reasonable . Definitely would recommend for a quiet afternoon out of the heat or rain ! <p> Our sales team was in town for the annual GNC convention and in need of a venue to host a team building event . Not only did Kailee help me plan everything , but she was also around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as requested . Caio and Andrew took fantastic care of us while we were bowling , making sure we never ran out of food or drinks . The customer service we experienced during our team building event went above and beyond our expectations .

Great last minute trip to Disney and Animal Kingdom just to see Pandora which is AWESOME ! ! ! <p> My husband and I stayed here for one night to take advantage of the extra magic hours offered at Animal Kingdom earlier this summer during our trip . We came in for the day , and the hotel held and delivered our bags to our room so we could go to the parks without keeping them in our car . We stayed in a first floor king bed room . Got back late , left just before checkout and slept well . Pros : comfy bed , cheaper room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit dated . Cons : Bill was n't delivered to the room as it was supposed to so I ended up in another line at the front desk to confirm our charges ( despite having a credit card number attached to the room at check in and being assured I 'd get one delivered ) . Disney also does n't do duvet comforters , which a personal grief of mine . I always need to order extra blankets . I also forgot they do n't have coffee makers in room , which is definitely irritating . You get what you pay for . This is a bare bones room , for a lower price , but with Disney perks . The lacking of a coffee maker and the annoyance with the bill is what dropped it from a 5 to 4 star . It is still a great place to stay on Disney property on a budget ! ! <p> I 'm very happy with the hotel , facilities and the service . I want to thank Marfa and Sabrina from the food court .

We stayed two nights in the Grand Floridian as well just to see if it was worth the hype and it is not ! ! Beautiful grounds and landscaping is what you 'll get , plus the close park proximity - but I still do n't feel it was worth $650/night .... and that was one of the less expensive rooms ! ! !

The Coronado is a moderate priced resort under construction . What does that mean ? You 're room will be clean , there is a very nice pool , and there are amenities such as a food court , sit down restaurant and a pool bar . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest wait was 20-30 minute coming back from Hollywood studios mid day . We were not in a renovated room so have the benefit of reviewing that as those are the majority for the time being . They are definitely dated and in need of renovation ( this is currently under way ) . They are , however , very clean so we did not find this to be an issue . The best part of the resort is the ambiance around the lake and the pool . The main pool is very big , has activities and a water slide which were perfect for our 4 year old . There were plenty of shaded seating for our 9 month old who did not like the water but preferred to lounge around the chairs like a Disney princess ; ) Some complain about the length of the property and there is some truth to that . ( Property is about a mile long ) . But I suspect the impact of this to be dependent upon what you use the property for . With our family we were not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead we used the food court and the pool bar ( which has a breakfast and lunch/dinner menu ) extensively . This cut down on the walking tremendously as we often at by the pool instead of trying to brave sit down restaurants with our children all the time . Further , there are 4 bus stops and we were right next to the cabanas stop ( maybe 20 foot walk ) . So the length did not bother us at all . We stayed in may and since that time i see the construction has picked up significantly . Here are the main points : every room is in the process of being refurbished . The newly renovated rooms look nice from the pictures ( they are ditching the carpets which is good ) . Further , they are building a tower in the cabanas area and will eventually build a bar /Tapas in the middle of the lake which will connect to the three resort areas . If construction bothers u - stay somewhere else . However , when we went they did a good job of hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look to be as extensive . So long as they do n't close down the amenities ( pool , food court ) it should be ok . Do pay attention , however , as to where they are in the construction to see if it will impact your stay negatively . All in all we found this to be of good value . We did not pay Deluxe prices . Given that - this hotel exceeded our expectations relative to what we were expecting with our budget . <p> Stayed here for the 1st time for a business conference . For the price point , I was disappointed to discover this run down resort that needed updates . There was no real " resort " feel . The kiddie pool is located across the lake from the " preferred " rooms so it 's a bit of a walk for younger children . I was placed in a " preferred room " in the Casita Bldg. 3 . It was horribly run down and in need of updating . It felt very motel like . It was covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . The electrial outlet for charging your cell phone at the bedside was located behind the one night stand that divides both beds . It means you have to physically move the night stand to plug in . The a/c was warm and the bed was lumpy . Several of us had the same experience and had our rooms changed after one day . Tip : We were moved to the Rancho blgs 7 &amp; 8 ( non-preferred rooms ) . They were newly renovated rooms with faux wood floor , ceramic floors in the bathroom , and met our expectations . It was a bit of a walk to the convention center , but worth the change . Charging stations were located appropriately at bedsides and desk areas , bathrooms were modern with a closet ( olders blgs do not have closets and only a rod located in the sink area ) , etc . One issue , during thunderstorms , water reached ankle levels in the corridors including next to ice/soda machines . Ask for a 2nd floor or above to prevent all the standing water outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to ask for pool towels from housekeeping in advance ... at busy times it 's hard to get hold of the dept . <p> just spent a week at a convention at this hotel . reception staff need a little help in customer service . room was very clean and room staff more than accommodating resort dated can see why they are doing some updating if your not in the rooms in main black be prepared to do a lot of walking . every confusing finding room for they are all the same color and numbering of rooms is n't easy to understand . The main dinning room wait staff nearly need a course on customer service . the cafe area is a kid heaven but the food is below par if it was n't that at a convention would n't stay there . it must have been the first resort disney ever did <p> Here for a conference , family member traveled with me .

The room appeared to have had no renovation in this century . The location is what it is so no complaint there .

Currently travelling around the USA and have stayed in my fair share of budget hotels . We 've had some good ones , however this one is the worst I have ever experienced in both room condition , facility and service . Here 's the list I took during my stay : Firstly , maintenance work being done all over the hotel , banging and hammering in the walls until 10:30pm on the first night , we let it slide but 11:00pm on the second night we 'd had enough . We were one of many groups downstairs complaining about the noise and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do anything , we asked for him to call his manager and he also refused , stating that the manager does n't work 24 hours . He suggested we call the police instead ! The manager must be bad if he 'd prefer the police ! We went directly to the maintenance crew and interrupted their use of power tools to ask them if they would stop , and they said they would work until they were told not to . But who was going to tell them not to ? In the end the maintenance guy called the hotel manager ( who reception were seemingly unable to do ) and work stopped by 11:30pm . Absolutely atrocious service at attempting to find a resolution with reception . Other issues we encountered : Iron not working in room , tried in multiple power sockets . TV not working , not tuned , unable to be fixed , reception did n't care , we went without . Breakfast stale and awful , served in polystyrene which is very wasteful and the dining area is extremely dirty , animals running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work , only one in the room was working . Not enough towels in bathroom on arrival . No details in the room on how to call reception , but the phone did n't work anyway . Shuttle to airport offered on paperwork we received on check in but was then revoked when we requested the service . Bad service at reception desk ( woman was extremely sour , clearly hates her job , very unhelpful ) . Bad service at the tours desk ( woman could n't tell us the best way to get to NASA , surely one of the most popular tourist destinations in Orlando , but she also did n't want to help or speak to us , going so far as trying to blatantly fake a phone call in the middle of the conversation and telling us to ask someone else tomorrow , if we were n't so annoyed we would have found this one funny ) .

AND we were n't allowed to board a later shuttle ( they run twice an hour ) because they wo n't take you to the airport unless you 're 4 hours early . After arguing , we gave up and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spend on . <p> I suppose you can get away with this stuff just cause you 're Disney . <p> Some people seem to have had good experiences here . Good on them . I 'm not coming back . <p> If you are visiting Orlando with family than this is the Resort for you . Good staff very friendly , Food Court good , Nice swimming pool with Disney Characters in centre of pool and life guards on the watch for small children 's , Free shuttle service to all disney theme parks , free wifi across the resorts including rooms , One wrist band for access to all parks and your room ( which actually works ) . No complaints highly recommend and i am definitely staying with them next next time too . <p> The rooms were good sized for two adults and two kids , esp since we were n't really in them much being at the parks most the time . The cleaning staffs attention to detail with using towel/kids blankets to create mickey and other things really was a nice touch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microwave . We had leftovers we would have liked to have reheated . Next time we know to get a suite , little bit bigger and has a mini kitchen area . The little food court/cafe area had many choices . We loved the mashed potatoes and gravy . Made a meal out of just those one night . Having the bus transportation to all parks was amazing . Not having to drive or pay for parking SO nice . Overall the hotel was enjoyable , made the first visit for my kids and father a good one . Would definitely stay again at this hotel on another visit <p> Tip : the walk from the buses/cars to the rooms is a little long might want to have packages bought at parks sent to your rooms to keep from having to carry them : - ) <p> I thought that by staying on Disney property in a Disney hotel we 'd be getting some Disney magic . The only " magic " we got was making our money disappear . To start , the " standard " room we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway . I 'd spend $50 in a pinch if I was on a road trip and needed to sleep . But to spend a week in this room with my family was cramped and unpleasant . We were in the Country building , in on of the last rooms towards the back . We had to walk more than a quarter mile to get to any of the amenities this " resort " offers . Not that this place should be allowed to refer to itself as a resort . Even using " hotel " would be generous . Do you ever miss eating in your old school cafeteria with the Lines and lines and mass-made food ? Well , never fear . The Intermission " food court " will provide you with all the standing in lines and mediocre food you could want ! Not to mention INCREDIBLY overpriced . Powdered scrambled eggs are dirt cheap , why are you charging $11 a plate for some junk eggs , wobbly bacon , potatoes , and sausage ? It would be a $6 at any other diner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pasta , burgers or chicken . MMMM . Finally , one of the big benefits of staying at a Walt Disney World Resort hotel is that you get free transportation to and from the parks ! My family chose to spend the extra money to save ourselves some hassle and fully immerse ourselves in the Disney Magic ! Unfortunately , what this means is that you get to line up at bus stops for anywhere from 0 minutes ( when you luckily walk up right when the bus is getting there. ) to 45 minutes ( when the bus dispatcher conveniently FORGETS to send a bus to pick you up ) . These bus stops are inconveniently long walks away from the entrances to the parks , so on top of all the walking and line standing you 're doing in the parks , for the fun stuff , you get to do more , just to be able to get back to your hotel room . Overall , I will NEVER recommend for a person to stay on property at Disney . It 's a sham . Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hire taxis to take you to and from the parks and you 'll be saving time standing in lines waiting when you could be either IN the parks enjoying yourself or back at your hotel room resting . There was absolutely NOTHING magical about staying at Disney . It only made our vacation MORE stressful than it needed to be . Save yourself the trouble , choose somewhere else . <p> We made it to the hotel at 1:30 am . The front desk person ( Annette ) was very uncooperative and rude . Made us feel very unwelcome which was a big shock for us that have been to Disney 14 times the last 10 years . Very disappointed that I even talked to the manager ( Lamar ) and he had the exact same negative and unfriendly attitude . <p> Purchasing a meal plan with your reservation allows you to enjoy the very good quick dinning options . Foods while I was there included , Salmon , Steak , Broiled Chicken , Barbecue Ribs , Pizza , Burgers , Sandwiches refillable drink cups that are souvenirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome with great ice cream options , baked items including cheesecake , and are included as part of the package . Rooms are good not luxurious , no coffee pot provided in lower end rooms . But the fact is your at the Parks and the only time you use your room is to shower and sleep . A number of swimming pools are available . Be prepared to walk a lot at the hotel and especially at the parks ! Staff was friendly and attentive . Bus service to and from was efficient &amp; friendly ! <p> I do n't know what it normally sells for , but we had $124 per night convention-overflow hotel rate for 2 guests , another $10 per night each for Guests #3 and 4 . PLUS state and county taxes . This is what hotels go for in cities generally , but at least we had free parking here , very close to our building , and technically it was Fourth of July weekend . Stayed Thursday night thru Tuesday morning ( July 4th checkout ) . We also enjoyed the free bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning for that park , and the extra two hours in Pandora that night . My daughter 's convention was using the free bus to Disney 's Hollywood Studios and walked to the Swan &amp; Dolphin convention center from there , which is not technically a Disney property . If you 've got small kids , you 'll probably want to stay in the Calypso buildings , because they 're right at the guitar-shaped pool and food court . We were placed all the way in the back , in the Country building #6 , in almost the furthest room possible , ha ha . So yes , we had to walk some distance to the food court , but have you ever tried to get anywhere in your casino hotel in Las Vegas ? It was n't that bad . There ARE snack machines in the buildings and ice machines . The food court is expensive ( examples : $1.99 for a banana ; $3.29 for a large blueberry muffin ; $2.99 for a croissant ; the salmon caesar salad special $11.49 ) , BUT we had the convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Disney like a watch or a Fitbit , so my teens could just go to the cash registers themselves ; they could let themselves into the hotel room themselves . They even wore them in the swimming pool . We could charge our food at Animal Kingdom fast-food restaurants and food carts also with the magic bands ; and in gift shops . When we decided on a day for Animal Kingdom , we bought the tickets at the concierge for $126.74 per person , which came with 3 express rides at certain times and 1 more express that we could choose during the day and ended up not using--probably could have selected a show . Small gift shop in this concierge area sells Disney t-shirts and other Disney souvenirs but also sells toiletries , meds , and bread , cereal , milk , peanut butter and jelly , Poptarts and the like . There 's a mini-fridge in the room ; no coffee maker or microwave , but we 're not coffee drinkers . Iron &amp; board ; hair dryer . Soaps , all-in-one shampoo/conditioner . A safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bathroom has the shower/tub with toilet and exhaust fan . The sink area with mirror has a curtain . So we found this helpful ; one person in the bathroom showering with the door closed ; another person dressing behind the curtain ; the other people on their beds or at the little table that comes with two chairs . We managed to have enough shelving and drawers , only if the kids lived out of their suitcases . Towels provided at pool but we had brought our own . Maid service late in the day . We used the piano-shaped pool nearer our building . It was basic but there 's a bathroom right there ( it was cold ! ) . They could use more umbrellas for shade at that pool . <p> Rooms are pretty basic and the food options at the restaurant are somewhat limited . However since you are going to this resort to be at all the parks you wo n't be spending much time in your room anyway . So good enough . Magic band access is awesome though . <h> Frequently Asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options are available onsite ?

It was nice to be up 400 feet and see alot of cool stuff . <p> I have done this before but my daughter has n't . So we did this , paid on-line and combined it with the wax museum .

So all in all plenty of space both for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clean and roomservice came by approx every 4 days to clean and refill , soap , coffee etc in the kithen . The staff in the reception was very helpfull and even though we did not come by a lot they learned our names . The location of the resort is fantastic . only 30 mins drive to the big parks , 5 min to wallmart , 5 min to a lot of good restaurants etc . We can only say : What a great expierience . We shall be comming back . ! ! ! <p> My family and I stayed at the Polynesian Isles this past week and I looked forward to writing this review the whole week ! I was so impressed with the Polynesian . We decided on it because it had the best price and the best reviews . It is conveniently located and close to everything that Orlando boasts . We checked in on a Sunday and were impressed from the beginning . I am writing this because we had purchased some stuff that ended up being in our room . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . It looks exactly like the picture on the inside . There is really everything there you need : cooking utensils , pans , skillets , colander , dish liquid , dish washer tablets , a scrubber sponge , a laundry basket , and 2 complimentary bottles of water . ( The tap water there is terrible . We purchased a case of water post-haste . ) The pools are nice but seemed a little smaller than the pictures . There is also a really nice hot tub . There is a business center with 2 computers , a printer ( free ) , activities , and a book swap library . There is a washer and dryer for every 2 units to share . Free for your use . Imagine ! ! Cons : we noticed tiny tiny ants around our sink one of the days and we called down to the front desk pretty late in the evening . We were told someone would be there at 8 am the next morning to take care of them , but no one showed . I ended up cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them again . Tap water- easy fix . Buy bottles or gallons . There is a Walmart , Sam 's club , Big Lots , and Aldi all very close . The lines at Wal-Mart were out of this world , so I wish I would 've gone elsewhere . I did n't think the beds were comfortable , but people have lots of bed preferences , so you 're not going to be able to please everybody . The concierge ( read-people who try to get you to go to a timeshare presentation ) got to my husband first when I was n't around . The front desk staff tells you that the concierge has a gift for you , which turns out to be coupons and the chance for the concierge to talk about the timeshare thing . My husband told them I was not going to be into going , but I heard one lady haranguing another family who clearly was n't interested . They do not have discount park tickets if you do not go to the presentation . I ended up buying mine online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no negatives , only positives ! It was a great place with great staff , especially Ricardo . <p> Stayed for five nights in a one bedroom . Large well stocked kitchen , large living room , dining room , and a large bedroom with en-suite bath . Another full bath off the kitchen . Huge patio with furniture . New shared gas grills with tools , and a convenient pool . Great rate at $83/night . Free wifi worked well . Convenient to area restaurants and golf . <p> I like the location , close to everything you need but is not crowded with visitors . Grocery and outlet shopping is just minutes ' drive . Going to Parks is convenient . Beaches visit are easy as it is close to Highways ....... Stop mentioning it or I will move down there . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

Everything about this hotel is awesome . I really like to thank ms . Vicky for making the booking of our room possible . If it was n't for her , my family would probably been searching all night for a room . This hotel always goes above and beyond . The staff is very friendly , clean rooms and I just love the roof top . Of course , we will be back again and again <p> We chose this hotel as a starting point for our visits to Disneyland , Universal Studios and Cape Canaveral . For Disneyland and Universal was a bus available that picked you up at the hotel . The room was ok and the breakfast nothing special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kids ages 9 and 5 , my sister brother in law 2 nephews and my dad , they were being placed in suites . Hotel reception was really helpful directed us to our room . We were placed on 12th floor of North tower , room seemed clean and tidy on arrival . However later that night I noticed little beasties crawling over the dresser , tv unit and table so I called reception who sent two janitors to room , who sprayed the furniture with fly spray and advised us they were sugar ants which are common in Florida at this time of year and to contact hotel manager in morning . To which my husband did , the next morning reception staff assured us when we got back from parks that day we would be moved to different room and would have feedback from management . We were moved to 8th floor , gorgeous views of the lake . However in process of us moving my husband left a pair of shorts in old room and advised reception of this . They asked him to fill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . My husband asked on 3 or 4 occasions for managers feedback however nothing . The rooms are clean but are dated and in need of a face lift , maybe take a leaf out of suites books , this is where my sister was with her family and my dad . It 's like night and day ! My second gripe is with one night reception manager , named Cary . A very very rude lady . I forgot my key one night and she advised me that unless my sister who was lead name and in a separate room answered her phone and gave go ahead for me to have another key then I would not be getting into my room , even although my party 's details should 've been registered to my room ! which upset my 5 year old son who was inconsolable in the reception area . I was fuming . She managed to call my sister at 12:30am who agreed I should have another key . Disgrace . Upon check out my husband brought the above to receptionist and explained he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reception had no idea of our complaint and said herself communication was poor in the hotel , however within 15 minutes she had compensated us for shorts and also waived fees on safety deposit box . She done more in 15 mins than what others done in the full two weeks . I enjoyed my holiday and my stay , the rooms are clean , towels changed every day and linen changed every two days . However silly things like the above have an impact on whether you go back or not . I see the hotel replies to reviews are generic and I find this unprofessional , I really hope these reviews are taken into consideration and certain staff members are given extra training on how to treat people respectfully . <p> Just returned from staying at the Ramada plaza for 14nights.Room was spotless clean towels every day.beds changed.couldnt fault it at all.if i was to be picky the AC was a tad noisy.Breakfast was adequate to start your day.Check in and out was easy and the girls very pleasant.The hotel offers free shuttles to parks which if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return from Disney its madness as other people seem to forget how to queue and forget their manners.I can highly recommend a stay here and remember its just a room . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

One cooking hob was n't working , and the other one did n't get hot enough to cook pasta because ( according to reception ) of ' health and safety ' reasons , which means they were unusable .

Had a few minor issues with the room and the hotel staff moved us to a new room swiftly . Really friendly hotel with a lovely lady on ticket sales for the parks and I ride trolley tickets etc etc . Free shuttle bus daily to Disney and universal . Short walk 3-4 minutes to international drive where all the restaurants are on hand . Breakfast very basic but you get what you pay for at 6.99 . Nice pool area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really handy . Was first time in Orlando and loved every minute . Would recommend this hotel to rest your weary head at the end of a long day . Really comfy beds ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> The Clarion Inn and Suites offers numerous locations throughout the Orlando area , including the Clarion Inn and Suites at International Drive . Located a short drive from most attractions , When we first started visiting , this Clarion was top of the line . Now the hotel offers among the best pricing in Orlando , but is significantly dated as described in the other reviews . Although our rooms were clean , the now amount of cleaning can eliminate the age and normal wear and tear . For us , the staff is always super friendly and helpful , helping us make arrangements for special events .

" <p> Reviewed July 18 , 2017 NEW <p> We stayed here during a 13 night trip to Florida visiting the parks . There are many positives - price being one of them - the room itself was spascious and more than adequate for the myself , my wife and our 11 year old son . The double bed was comfortable , the sofa bed was good too although the state of the mattress when we unfolded it was not pleasant - we ended up covering it in a couple of sheets and a blanket before allowing our son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is right next to the bed and is very noisy - making it impossible to have on during the night unfortunately . The room comes with a kitchen which is handy - although the room does n't  come with anything to use in it ( cutlery/crockery etc ) which you need to request from reception - we had to wait a couple of days before we got anything - it was delivered whilst we were out at the parks and were more than concerned when we returned to find the room 's door had been left ajar - thankfully nothing had gone missing . Free wifi is a bonus ! The breakfasts are n't great - a grab and go affair with very limited options and the same thing every day ( again this is reflected in the price and we ended up getting cereal/milk etc from the supermarket to bulk this out - there are only so many bagles you can face ) . There is a bus stop for the I-ride directly outside the hotel which is great ( a $5 day pass allows you travel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they run appox every 20mins and are great for getting to shops and attractions away from the Parks ) . Assuming you do want to go Disney and/or Universal the hotel does include a free daily shuttle bus which was excellent for us . There is n't a great deal around the hotel itself ( though the Village Inn does good food ) but it 's easy and cheap enough to get around . All in all it 's a great budget hotel and I feel a little harsh giving it just 3 stars but I 'm doing so when comparing to all the other hotels we 've holidayed at . In terms of value for money I 'd give it a 4 . <p> The hotel is close to Universal studios and attractions , and it offers an excellent alternative to their visit . The bedroom was very comfortable and the bed both big and cousy .

The mattress on the sofa bed may need to be replaced but the room had the perfect amount of beds for my whole family . <p> My family stayed at this hotel for 5 days and we enjoyed the pool . It was clean and the staff at the front desk was very friendly . It 's in close proximty to attractions and eatery . We enjoyed ourselves . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

The rooms are really comfortable ( incl washer and dryer ! ) , the Kitchen is very well equipped . The resort is a great base for enjoying all the fun parks in the area and it ' s conveniently located close to supermarkets . The only weak point is the absence of a restaurant . <p> My Group visit was wonderful , thanks for the Westgate Leisure . The rooms were clean , and the layout was perfect for families .

The location is great to get around Orlando . There 's I-4 ( sometimes very congested ) , Central Fla. and John Young Parkways , as well as International Drive . The Resort is kept clean from the parking deck to the elevators ( a little slow ) , and the walkways . Our accommodations although dated were nice . Big screen T.V. in both bedrooms and the living area . Fully functioning kitchen . We were there for a Women 's conference and had no problems getting to the venue ( Rosen Shingle Creek ) on time .

I was promised a phone call by the manager to address these issues but that call never came . I was also unable to reach an Armed Forces Vacation Club/RCI ( which IMO is more responsible than the property itself ) representative that was willing to assist so I loaded up the car and drove to Cabana Bay at Universal ( pricey and small , but clean and safe ) . I would still like to discuss this problem with a Westgate manager and someone at RCI as I feel someone should be held accountable or ( at least reimburse the week of time or your money ) when even the most basic standards of safety , cleanliness , and customer service go unmet .

The mattress was so worn that the springs were almost sticking out . The rooms just felt dirty . We will NEVER stay at this property again and I would not recommend this property to anyone , not even someone I did n't like . If you are looking for a clean resort this is not the right place for you . We are now moving to a different resort and will be losing out on quite a bit of money , but it will be well worth it to stay somewhere that feels clean ! 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

Super convenient to get on the Monorail to take to the theme parks but be aware it does get busy and there can be backups to get through security to get on it or can be hard for large parties to find seats all together at times . I thought since this was a " resort " that there would be more of a resort experience to it . As a few examples there was n't any towel animals on the beds after cleaning service ( but there was chocolates on the pillows ) .

The shops in the main building were sufficient and we ended up eating mostly at the Grill , which is the only budget friendly place at the resort ( even though it was a little pricey for quick service food ) . The resort does n't have a strong theme for kids , but Cinderella and Prince Charming did make a grand entrance ( perhaps daily ? ) in the lobby .

When we arrived on the first day , I felt that the temperature in the room was a little warm for my liking .

The hallways were quiet and noise was never an issue . The food at the resort was exceptional . The resort offers a variety of dining options , which range from casual to upscale .

We were awarded cash for the Princess Ariel dress and despite efforts by the Magic Kingdom to try to make the rest of the day a positive one for my family , we were ready to head back to the resort . When we returned to the resort , we had a message from Marissa Byrns , the Guest Experience/Operations manager at the resort .

But , it was a bit hard to follow . I wish I had read up on the story beforehand . I knew it was about a dream ... but I still felt lost quite a bit . The acts and stunts were amazing . Definitely a must see if you are a fan of daredevil stunts and comedy . Husband got us front row seats for my birthday . I was awesome ! I am happy we were able to see it before it closes in December . <p> That was my first time to attend a cirque du soleil show , and it was one of the best experience ever . The show is about 2 hours but you feel like they are 2 mins . The show includes so many serious and dangerous moves , also so many comic shows in between . If you are intending to go to this show , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will end December 2017 . IT 'S A MUST SEE SHOW . <p> Overall the level of technical expertise these artists have attained is excellent . The different sort of circus acts are well represented ( even clowns ... which get a bit boring in the end ) , but what I found really lacking compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows is a story . La Nouba is a contraction of disparate acts with nothing in common . The show lacks a soul , but do n't let that stop you from going . As long as you know what to expect ... <p> My Wife and I always wanted to see this show and we was n't disappointed . These performers are the best of the best . Every minute of the show was totally Awesome ! There is so much going on at one time , it 's hard to keep up . The only complaint we had was people coming in late trying to find their seats .

Beautiful beach and pool . Lots of activities for the children and family . Its a nice quiet place to come with the family . I recommend the inn rooms better than the villas . Love the renovations ! <p> We loved Disney 's Vero Beach Resort ! It was beautiful and clean . The staff were wonderful and friendly . The pool area is outstanding with an adorable slide and at night the pool lights are an orange in color , due to the nesting sea turtles that come up on the beach . This hotel loves the environment and they do a great job . <p> This property is , compared to others that I 've stayed at along Florida 's coasts , pretty run of the mill , only much more expensive . The beach is nothing unusual , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Disney , $15-$20'ed at every turn . Want a beach umbrella ? Crack out the wallet . Want a beach chair ? Cough up the dough . I do n't think having a place to sit on the beach , should require a rental fee ... especially for what the rooms cost . Which reminds me : If you can remember , stop at Publix on the way in and pick up any liquor you may want . A glass of cheap Pinot Grigio is $10 at the resort . You can save a lot , and get better quality wine by bringing your own . I did find the rooms nicely appointed and the beds are comfortable . The staff is also impeccable . The pool area was most disappointing to me . I 've been in pools throughout the state of Florida and this one is , far and away the hottest bowl of soup I 've ever been in . It was actually warmer than the air temperature ... at 2:00 pm in mid-July . You got ta work to accomplish that . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't found a way to erect a screen or shade of some sort over at least part of the pool . It certainly would help keep the water a little cooler . During the summer months , even if you get one of the tables with an umbrella , it 's still ungodly hot . The surrounding foliage serves as a windbreak from the ocean , so there 's no breeze whatsoever . Believe me ... the beach is MUCH cooler . Also , the DJ at the pool is supremely annoying and makes the DJ in the movie Love Actually look world class . His incessant droning during a game called " Majority Rules " drove us to the beach . The fitness center is nicely appointed and above average for most hotels They have plenty of cardio and weight machines as well as a selection , up to 50 lbs . of dumb bells . However , for those who want to stay and play after checking out , the locker-room is awful . There are no chairs or benches to use if you need to change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure why they do n't have a bench or two in the drying area , but it 's most definitely sub par for what a Disney resort should be . Then there is the smell . Usually , one must go to an elementary school or YMCA to find a bathroom smell like this one . Bottom line : I ca n't recommend this place and given the cost and what you get compared to other places , such as many found up the road in Cocoa Beach , I do n't plan to return . <p> I completely understand conservation and I want to conserve energy . I also want to be able to sleep and we were not able to in our room . It was just too hot , the air turns off at night and seems to be motion activated . It was very uncomfortable and stuffy in our room . We ended up checking out a day early . The pool water was very hot as well , again , we understand conservation , but this is supposed to be a resort ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have never experienced pools with such hot water . Also , magic bands would have been nice here because you have to use your room key to get onto the beach and then back onto the walkway to the resort . You also need your key to get into the pool area . A magic band would have been so much for convenient than pulling out the room card each time . The room was very nice , microwave and fridge . There was a luggage cart as well , which was very convenient . The parking underneath the building was limited but very nice as well . I wish I had known about the beach , not many shells and TONS of seaweed and sea sponges in the water . The sand was burning hot . It did seem like there were some nice activities for kids at this resort . This was just not for us . <p> We are DVC members and we just returned from our first stay at Vero . We had a one bedroom villa for 5 nights . The resort was recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great for two adults and two teens . The market food was some of the best I have had for quick service at Disney and the staff , as usual was great . It never felt crowded despite being full and we always found a table by the pool . Tons of activities and the spa was great . Only minor issue was a very messy lobby after a storm one afternoon . Everyone came in to avoid the rain and It was not cleaned up for awhile ..... there was lots to trip over and trash around . Other than that ... it was an awesome stay and we will be back . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

Upon arrival the front desk said they would not honor the original reservation rate of about $90 ( as of this writing we do not know what the reason was ) . But they offered the AAA rate of about $116 , so as AAA members for over 25 years we reluctantly accepted it .

As a Hilton Honors member I found a great rate at a nice HGI . At check-in the front counter was very pleasant and even had me verify my Sunday night special reduced rate .

This time we had to be relocated due to ant ( what they looked like ) issue . They were in the bathroom , on counters , and a few in the bed . The staff relocated us to another HGI . Nice lady helped best she could as we had a late arrival so no more rooms to move us into . We were on the 7th floor so the critters traveled pretty far to get in that room . View was great for the short duration . Could see the Epcot Planet Earth ball . Pick a high even numbered room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Drive which was great . In summary : exterminator and caulk . <p> I would stay in this hotel again ; however , I will not purchase the breakfast package again . Not worth the price at all ! The staff was unaccommodating and the food quality and selection was subpar . Your best bet is to eat out . The actual room itself was decent . <p> Bed linens needs to be clean and at least provide newer pillows . Both bed had a hair on the sheets ...

While another hotel can provide a view of fireworks from 3 parks , on the top floors this was as close to eye level with the display as one can get ! That said , beds could be more comfy , they were boards ; floors/carpeting in our room were uneven .... very odd . The staff was great , attentive and professional . The little pool by the water side was just lovely even though it was not an adult pool , kids were primarily interested in the pool with the slide . Food was readily available and fast downstairs though on the salty side ; lately , I have found that consistent across the various park eating venues and have mentioned to the concierge . Florida in July is just darn hot hot hot and humid humid humid . <p> We have been to many Disney Resorts ... The Caribbean Beach , Port Orleans Riverside , Pop , All Star Music ... to name a few .... The Contemporary is in a league of it 's own . We stayed in the main tower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so helpful and pleasant ! I ca n't say enough . They found us a room that was ready on the 8th floor for early check in ... 9:30 am ! ! We were so excited ! When they found out we were there to celebrate our 24th anniversary , they sent up a bottle of champagne ! ! We were spoiled rotten ! <p> This resort has been around since the beginning and even though I have been to Disney at least 25 times in the last 40 years this is my first time staying here . I was pleasantly surprised how well kept up this place is for it being so old . It is actually conveniently located especially for the Magic Kingdom . The convention facilities are great too . The cast members are very friendly and knowledgeable and love that the team runs trough the hotel and you can get on and off quickly and to your room . Since this is a higher priced resort I would wish all the rooms had balconies . <p> We were there for the 4th of July and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was fantastic but still only a 20 min show . But what a show it was ! The cast members were super to us and helped us out when my kid had a skin reaction that was really painful . they went so far as to call the next evening to ask if there was anything we could do . So why not 5 stars ? The beds. by the 5th night I could not sleep on them . Also , the flooring of our tower room was a hack job . they needed to level and take the bumps out of them before they covered them with carpeting . Alas that will never happen but a decent mattress for the 600 bucks a night is not asking too much . <p> This hotel was the best . We saw fireworks every night , from our room . My son loves trains so having the monorail going through our hotel was awesome for him .. It was very convenient for going to the parks . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

The hotel features an outdoor heated pool , children 's pool , modular playground , kids ' theater and a video arcade . Breakfast , lunch , and dinner is served in the Trattoria food court , and light snacks and beverages are available at Chianti 's Lounge , located poolside . <p> I stayed at this hotel for a family reunion . The hotel had enough rooms to accommodate my family . The check in process was slow , due to training new employees , but that was the only negative . The staff was friendly and answered all questions . The hotel itself was well maintained , but the decor was dated . The pool area was spacious and well maintained . This hotel was located near most of the main attractions like Disney , Flea Markets , etc . Would recommend . <p> My daughter &amp; I stayed here for 1 night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort . The hotel is in a great location , in the center of many activities , stores , and restaurants . There was a line for check-in , and after reading other reviews it appears that waiting in line for check-in is a regular thing here . The front desk staff was very friendly though and helpful . Our room was much bigger than we anticipated . There was a queen size bed ( not very comfy ) and a bunk bed ( very comfy ) . There was a big flat screen tv in front of the queen bed , and a smaller tv in front of the bunk bed . My daughter thought that was really cool . There was a mini fridge and single-cup coffeemaker too . The room was very clean , bathroom was well stocked with fluffy towels and toiletries . We had a " fake " balcony ( the doors were bolted shut ; it is n't big enough to even stand on anyway ) and a very nice view of the amusement park across the street . The pool is huge ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free towel service next to the pool . The large hot tub felt great after a day of traveling . It was nice that there were a few tables on one end of the pool that had ashtrays , so the smokers had a corner to enjoy as well ( next to the lounge ) . The on-site restaurant was great . We went in to order some dinner after checking in , and the place looked empty . But a couple of ladies saw us and gave us a menu and explained how to order . We ordered a couple of cheeseburgers w/fries to go , and ate outside by the pool . The food was very good , and very large portions . We also had the breakfast buffet the next morning , which was very impressive . There were so many selections we could n't possibly have tried everything . But we did our best , and the price could n't be beat . I wish we could have eaten the breakfast buffet there every day ! Sure beat Disney prices . The only complaint I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed fine at first , but I woke up sometime in the middle of the night and felt like I was lying on a concrete slab . The mattress on the bunk bed was much more comfortable . I would definitely stay here if we visit Orlando again , but would hope that they could either replace the mattresses or add some kind of mattress topper to make it more comfortable . Even if I stayed elsewhere , I 'd like to stop by again sometime just for the breakfast buffet ! <p> I had the pleasure of staying at the Holiday inn at celebration from July 5-9 2017 . Upon arrival I was greeted by the most sweetest , kindest , man name Carlos . He was very professional and helpful to my needs . I was even accommodated when I asked to see the room first due to a horrible experience I had with Celebration suites . Mr Carlos is a very caring , kind and understanding person . I also had the pleasure of meeting Jay and Nashsli who was absolutely wonderful to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made me feel like family . The hotel was clean and neat . I always had clean towels , plenty of soap , shampoo and coffee etc . It 's because of these three workers Carlos , Jay , and Nashsli that I give this hotel a BIG 10 stars . I would absolutely recommend this hotel to everyone . I had the greatest time there . Thanks guys . I am truly grateful to all three of you . <p> Room not clean , food splattered on wall that looked like dried in sauce and another chocolate milk . Found long black hairs in bathroom ( we 're both blonde ) and hair and crumbs around skirting in room . Could not walk bare foot on carpet . Had white socks on , the bottoms of our feet would become black with dirt and others people 's hair just moving around the room to get to the bathroom and in and out of bed . Air conditioning broke after first night , balcony door broken and unable to open . Bugs in room , found a red one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black bugs in shower curtain at different times . Returned home to UK and have broken out in bed bug bites . Kept suitcases on the bunk beds within the room , and we slept on the double , now have to disinfect everything in case bought bed bugs back in the cases and clothes . Front of Hotel noisy at night from people and cars on busy road . Room was near lifts , we stayed on 5th floor , very noisy at night squeaking , going up and down . Had a safe , fridge and coffee machine in room although did n't use this . Safe worked fine , Fridge makes loud noises so it turned off . Big Tv although no TV guide feature on remote so had to guess what was on . Provided wifi although did not work when more that one device connected and even then , very temperamental , only occasionally loading up the likes of Facebook . To give the Hotel their dues , I 'm sure if we had complained about the room , aircon , bugs etc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother as had the attitude of we were just sleeping there at night , getting washed and out early again the next day , so were n't in the room for long . By the time we got back to the room each night to sleep we were just too tired to complain and then possibly move rooms . The bugs we found , we just put down to being in a foreign country at the time , the same as we would get annoying flies in our house at home . Although now we 're back and have broken out in bites , I 've read that it could take up to 4 days for welts to show up from bedbug bites and now I 'm sure the red bug I removed from the bed was a bed bugs . I never actually pulled the covers back to inspect the sheets and mattress , we just climbed in ! Do n't suffer like we did in a stuffy room and are now from itchy bites . Check the room and if you do n't like the look of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own advice , in the end we paid a lot of money for our stay and we 're not happy with it at all . Loved the holiday , planning to come back , just wo n't be staying here next time though . <p> I have stayed in hundreds of Holiday Inns around the world . This is the only one that had very uncomfortable beds . The " Queen " was not a queen , and it was way too soft . The top bunk , my grandson noted , had springs coming through the mattress . The room was tiny . The carpet was stained and dirty as was the carpet in the hallway . I felt cramped , icky , and wanting OUT OF THERE . I would never stay again even if they offered me a free room . 98381 @qwx508381 98381 @qwx508381 98402 @qwx508402

There is also a grocery store and other restaurants located in a plaza near the hotel . Overall , this is a budget friendly hotel , with friendly staff located in Disney Springs . If you stay here keeping this in mind you will have a great stay . If you stay here expecting Champaign facilities on a beer budget you will be dissatisfied . Will I stay here again ? Yes , if the price is right . There are also many comparable ( and higher rated ) hotels nearby so the hotel should keep this in mind when setting their prices .

It has a nice feel to it , relaxing , and it is on the monorail , which makes getting to the park extremely easy ( I hate the buses ) . Good pools ( nice but not great ) . Beautiful grounds , one of their strongest points . Decent parking . Rooms are quiet with good firm beds . Air conditioning is good , but they had just finished removing ceiling fans from all of the rooms ( according to the front desk ) ... no reason given , and I think that it was a bad decision to remove them . Room amenities are n't anything special ( older coffee maker , small fridge ) . Some rooms have small balconies , some do n't . All in all a good , peaceful hotel , not too crowded and it really feels like a " vacation " .

It 's relaxing and in a great location to get to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot . With that said , it is not a cheap hotel , and the value is marginal compared to other Disney properties . I am a DVC ( Disney Vacation Club ) member which reduces my cost to about half that of the normal room rates . With DVC , I stay here often and love it . At normal rates , I would likely pick another hotel , given the amount of time spent in the parks versus the hotel ( the Polynesian is expensive just to spend a night in ) .

The ambiance is not exciting or welcoming ( after having enjoyed the Animal Kingdom Lodge ) and activities are limited . The pool and jacuzzi are not inviting . The food offerings are expensive , the bed was terrible ( and was replaced after an hour of waiting ) and you have to walk outside to get to your room . The only things to recommend it are the$2500 a night overwater bungalows ( if you can afford it ) and the fact that it 's a Disney Park transportation hub ( the monorail is in the building and there is ferry and boat access ) . <p> We stayed in the Polynesian for a week in October .

I was there on business for a job interview , i brought my mother in law along because i had to bring my son and she was helping me out with him ! The room was great size . The breakfast was great , and the pool was open late . They had a great business center the only thing i wish they had in the business center was a copy machine . Other than that everything was absolutely great . And I got the job ! ! ! ! I should be down in the Winter Haven area in a few weeks for training !

Nice 42 inch flat screen TV , mini-fridge , 1 cup in-room coffee maker , no microwave , good sized bathroom with plenty of counter space . The bed , per the norm for Hampton , was very comfortable .

The wifi was ok -- not outstanding ( I opted for the FREE version , not the enhanced upsell ) but not as horrendous as I have experienced at other properties .

But no sundries shop at all , not for snacks , or anything , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some construction going on inside , which the website also mentioned . <p> Great place to ray if going to Legoland without the huge price tags of the legoland hotel .
