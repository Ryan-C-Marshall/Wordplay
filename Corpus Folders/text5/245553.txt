@@43647559 @3647559/ <h> What is the Excel IQ score ? <p> Your Excel IQ measures your ability at Excel relative to everyone who has taken our test . A score of 100 means you are of exactly average ability . We interpret your score in terms of the following classes of Excel proficiency ( using Dreyfus and Dreyfus ' ( 1986 ) ' Five Stages of Skill Acquisition ' model ) . See the diagram below . <h> Scoring methodology <h> What do the scores by category mean ? <p> In addition to your Excel IQ score , the results of our test include scores for five important sub-categories of overall Excel ability . These scores are calculated in the same way as the Excel IQ , but rely only on those test questions that assess that particular expertise . <p> Spreadsheet administration : your ability to manage and protect an Excel file and its contents . <p> Orientation and efficiency : your knowledge of the basics of Excel , and the efficiency with which you interact with it . <p> Data handling : how well you can manipulate different forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Data analysis : how well you can analyse and interpret data in Excel to produce useful results . <p> Presentation : your ability to format spreadsheets and present results within them to communicate those results powerfully . <h> What does Percentile refer to ? <p> This is a statistical measure of a particular value of a variable below which a certain percent of observations fall . For example , a percentile of 76.54 means that your score was higher than 76.54% of all scores . It helps give some context for your Excel IQ score . <p> Our Excel IQ score is calculated in the same way as an Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) score is calculated . The average score of test-takers is 100 , and the spread of scores is adjusted so that 95% of candidates score between 70 and 130 . The scores of people taking our test are approximately normally distributed . That means the number of people with any given score follows the pattern of this graph : <p> One important advantage of this type of adjusted score called a T-score is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because variations in the difficulty of questions are factored out . Crucially this means our tests reliably measure improvement in Excel , even though users answer a different set of questions before and after any training . <p> Besides an overall Excel IQ score , our test will rate your performance in five sub-categories : orientation &amp; efficiency , data handling , data analysis and presentation . Each sub-score is calculated in the same way as the overall score . <p> In more detail ... <p> The Excel IQ score is calculated from your raw score ( the number of questions you answer correctly ) in two steps : <p> First , each question is weighted according to how good it is at indicating the aptitude it is testing this is something we can measure by checking how well questions correlate with ability . <p> Second , we transform your weighted score so that the average of all candidates weighted scores is 100 , and the standard deviation is 15 , according to the equation : <p> Where w is your weighted score , w is the average weighted score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighted scores of test-takers . <p> IQ scores are used by psychologists to define categories of intelligence eg an IQ of between 130 and 144 is categorised as moderately gifted . We have categorised Excel IQ similarly , eg an Excel IQ of between 115 and 129 means we think you are proficient at Excel .

What records do I need to keep ? What are my tax obligations ? <p> These are common questions for someone deciding to start a business of their own . And if you 're self-employed or considering taking the leap , you 're not alone . <p> Levels of self-employment are higher than at any point over the past 40 years . In 2014 , 4.6 million people were self-employed , with 15% of these people classifying self-employment as their main source of income . <p> Given these huge numbers , the government commissioned an independent review of self-employment by entrepreneur Julie Dean and published the results in February 2016 . It revealed that one of the most common areas where people require support was for record-keeping , so well look at in greater detail in this blog . <p> Three main questions of self-employment in the UK well consider here are : <p> 1 . What is self-employment ? <p> 2 . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> 3 . How do I keep records ? <p> 1 ) What is self-employment ? <p> Sole traders and partners are classed as self-employed by HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) . You 'll most likely be considered self-employed if you : <p> Operate your own business <p> Can have several customers at the same time e.g. a self-employed cleaner who works at several homes , a lawyer who has several clients , etc <p> Can decide the way your business is to be run ( e.g. the hours , place of work , pricing and profit elements ) <p> You can be employed and self-employed at the same time . For instance , if you work in the morning for an employer and for a freelance business in the evenings or weekends . <p> 2 . Maintaining appropriate records of your business turnover and expenses <p> 3 . Paying the necessary taxes and National insurance contributions <p> Ideally you should register with HMRC immediately after starting your business . The deadline is by 5th October of the second tax year of your business . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let HMRC know by 5th October 2016 . <p> The registration process for those starting a new business involves informing HMRC of both taxes and National Insurance contributions through an online form . The form to use depends on whether you have filed Self Assessment tax returns in the past or not . <p> Registration takes about 10 days for the registration to be completed . Once complete , the business can report income at the end of each tax year using Self Assessment returns , and pay taxes and National Insurance on time . <p> 3 ) How do I keep records ? <p> Record-keeping is one of the most important areas of running a new business . <p> " It may seem like a challenge , particularly when you 're starting out , but keeping good records will bring real advantages to your business . Get a proper system in place and you 'll not only be confident that you are paying the right tax , but you 'll keep up-to-date with how much you owe suppliers and how much you are owed " --- Brian Redford , Spokesperson for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it can straightforward if appropriate systems are established when a new business is started , and regularly updated . <p> Your business needs to keep track of all money coming in and going out . This includes : <p> Sales and income ( sales invoices , bank slips , receipts from customers ) <p> *VAT registration threshold for 2015-16 is set at 82,000 . The threshold is based on the business turnover during the 12 months , and may vary each year based on the budget announcements . <p> The exact records to be kept by the business depend on its size , nature and the accounting method used . This accounting method could be : <p> Cash basis - this works well for small businesses with income of less than 82,000 , as businesses only need to declare what cash came in and went out of the business . This information is readily available from the business bank statements . <p> In this method the income and expenses are recorded when actual cash is received or paid by the business . <p> Traditional ( accrual ) basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the income and expenses are based on the date invoices are raised or when expenses are billed . <p> In order for tax returns to be reflected appropriately , the business needs records for : <p> Details of stock and cash/bank balances at the end of the accounting period <p> Money invoiced but not yet received ( called Accounts receivable <p> Money committed to be paid , but not yet paid ( called Accounts payable ) <p> The owner 's capital invested into the business <p> The owner 's drawings ( amount taken out of the business ) <p> Simplified expenses - From the 2013-2014 tax year onwards , there 's also the option for a sole trader or partnership business to use simplified expenses with the above methods . <p> Simplified expenses can be claimed for : <p> a ) Business costs for vehicles <p> b ) Business use of a home <p> c ) Private use of business premises as a home <p> Under this method , businesses can record the business miles for vehicles , hours worked from home and the number of people living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat rate to the above calculations and derive the business cost that they can claim as expenditure , instead of recording the actuals . <p> Irrespective of the accounting method chosen , its important to choose a suitable accounting reference date . Accounting reference date is the financial year-end date for the business , and the financial year normally runs for 12 months . For example , the businesses could choose the anniversary date of the business start as the accounting reference date . Most businesses choose 5th April to make tax calculations simple ( 5th April is the end of the UK tax year ) . <p> Why is record-keeping essential ? <p> Businesses need to keep records to calculate the profit or loss made during the tax year , to report annual tax returns to HMRC . Depending on the profits , taxes and National Insurance ( NI ) payments need to be made . <p> A ready reckoner ( a tool to budget for self-employment tax and the NI bill ) is available hereon the HMRC website . Simply enter your estimated weekly or monthly profit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid for the tax year . <p> Records must be kept for at least 5 years after the 31 January submission deadline of the relevant tax year . HMRC may check records to ensure the right amount of tax is paid , so maintaining accurate records for this length of time is essential . HMRC may charge interest and penalties if sufficient taxes havent been paid or if records are n't  correct , complete and readable . <p> More resources <p> HMRC now provides a range of digital customer support products tailored for different self-employed businesses , such as guides on record-keeping . <p> Following consultations with HMRC , many software suppliers have also produced simple record-keeping apps to help small businesses maintain their records correctly . Most of these apps are freely available . <p> The above technological developments , combined with support tools from HMRC , mean that there are plenty of resources available to self-employed businesses to manage their records in a timely and efficient manner . <p> To summarise , we have looked at the meaning of self-employment , the obligations of self-employed people towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects .

@@43647660 @3647660/ <h> Five Handy Features In Adobe Dreamweaver <p> By Alan Gurney <p> 14 Oct at 15:19 <p> <p> As part of my role at Excel with Business , I regularly create emails for our marketing campaigns . To do this I use a web design programme called Adobe Dreamweaver . It is a programme that , on the outset , looks extremely daunting especially if you have never written in code before . As Dreamweaver features in our Web Design course I thought it would be helpful to share a few features of the programme that I find really handy and allow me , a veritable coding novice , to produce some pretty powerful email campaigns . <p> 1 . Code view and design view <p> This is probably my favourite feature of Dreamweaver as it makes learning how to code very easy . You can choose whether to build you webpage in code view , design view or in a split screen between the two views . This is the majority of Dreamweaver users ' preference , including myself , since it allows you to relate the code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I started using Dreamweaver , I had never used code in my life and the prospect of having to use it daily was intimidating to say the least . But having used the split view it has allowed me to create and learn code structure at the same time . <p> 2 . Pre-emptive code suggestions <p> When typing code into your prospective web page as soon as you type in a tag Dreamweaver will then list all of the possible tags that could follow this , meaning that you can simply scroll down the list and select the tag you 're looking . For example , when you are typing in the code for a hyperlink &lt;a href= " **36;31;TOOLONG " target= " blank " &gt; as soon as you type the &lt;a then a list will populate with the next option , in this case **33;69;TOOLONG ( see above ) . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a a= " " = " " case= " " data-cke-saved-href= " " in= " " list= " " next= " " p= " " populate= " " see= " " the= " " then= " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt;3 .

Imagine having to go about your day knowing 90% of the possible interactions you 'll have are with somebody who has a crush on you . Well , its not exactly like that ( although our current level of customer service satisfaction averages around 90% ) , but I like the comparison ! <p> After 7 years in the customer service world , across different countries and industries , I have been put at pretty much every major point of the spectrum in terms of company 's satisfaction and how this affects your day-to-day activities and stress levels . <p> Yes , you might not know this , but customer service can be a very stressful departement to be in .

This can result in an agent answering 100 unpleasant calls a day , and trust me that is not a nice experience . Even worse , this just builds up to a stressed reputation turning already angry customers into killer bees . <p> On the other hand , working in companies such as ours , where calls and emails constantly end up in Kudos to someone in the team , or even Facebook reviews , really makes staff members feel good with what they do . Since for some of us work takes up slightly more than one third of our lives ( another third is taken by sleep for those who enjoy extra naps and sleep long enough ) , I 'd say this is pretty major .

Sounds like an exaggeration ? Think again or at least have a read first ! <p> 1 . Preserve your source data <p> When you 're about to spend your weekend crunching through a data dump , do yourself a favour and make sure you can back out , or at least understand , any changes you have made . <p> To gain insight from data you will often need to clean it ( for typos or inconsistent categorisations for instance ) . Keep a separate , unedited worksheet containing the original data , and make any cleaning edits to a copy . Make sure you highlight and document any changes made so you can do it again . Better still , do n't change the data at all but do it with formulae " for example , if you 're correcting a common misspelling , use an INDEX/MATCH combination to replace the misspelling the raw data with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save calculation time <p> If you 're dealing with a massive database and asking Excel to perform many calculations , then you can hard-paste formulae once they 're calculated . This will significantly speed up a workbook that is slow to calculate . <p> Make sure you keep one row of the formula " so you can copy down to update the calculation when you add to or change your source data . And make sure you shade that row differently and clearly label what you have done . <p> 3 . Format consistently <p> Do n't save good formatting ONLY for the results of your analysis . Instead , focus on your spreadsheet " and your work " as a whole . Deciding on a few rules for formatting will make your analysis more comprehensible , not least to yourself . For example , shade raw input data cells one colour , calculations another , parameters a third use consistent formatting for headings , and for units , and for annotations . You can do this with Excel 's built-in themes , but it 's not necessary and arguably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight in your head . <p> 4 .

For example in the data below , a unique list exposes that some entries for Algeria record the country name in French : <p> 5 .
