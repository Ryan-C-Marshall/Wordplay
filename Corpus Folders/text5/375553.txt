This is where you can access online information , to see a more in-depth view of how your child is doing on the specific curriculum outcomes .

( Cocktails 5:00- Dinner 6:00 p.m . ) Project HOPE is hosting a lovely Hawaiian Luau fundraising event here in Strathmore at the Civic Centre . This will be the first time we have changed the setup of the gala as we move to evening of tropical fun and excitementcomplete with live entertainment from Calysto Steel Drum band and local band " The Pulse " . There will be an authentic Hawaiian feast , live and silent auction , door prizes , and most importantly , an opportunity to connect with colleagues and friends for a fun night out . <p> Project HOPE is a non-profit organization that has been operational for over 20 years here in the Wheatland County . Its mission is to support children with severe developmental delays and disabilities in our area schools with specialised therapies such as Music , Art and Adapted Physical Education . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calgary who come out weekly to provide service to our children during school hours . All money raised for Project HOPE goes to supporting children in the continuation of these therapies .

It is truly an honor to be a part of such a great team . <p> If you are interested in attending , tickets are $40.00 each- come see me- it is guaranteed to be a fund evening . <p> Have a great rest of the week ! ! <p> Linda Tucker <p> Photo : Sharon McLeay Times Contributor <p> .....

I got the information on Project Hope from him and I thought it would be a good fit for what we wanted to do here , " said Dean Pawulski , Encanas Production Manager in Strathmore . <p> Encana is active all year in sponsoring the rodeo and sports in Strathmore , plus promoting a yearlong volunteer time-to-cash employee match program ; but their Encana Cares program gives each sub-business unit a small amount money once a year to host an event , to support a charity group in the area and the company matches the funds . <p> " It is important that we support the organizations in areas that we work in . People in and around Strathmore grant us licenses to do business here , so it is important for us to give back .

" Dean contacted us , which we are very thankful for . We werent looking for this , so it is really a bonus for us and very helpful .

They are clear and specific learning goals from the program of studies that underline the critical , lifelong , essential learnings . <p> Where are the prioritized outcomes ? <p> You can find all of the prioritized outcomes on the GHSD portal in the Prioritized Curriculum folder and then into the grade level folder . There is a word document that lists all prioritized outcomes for the four core subjects . <p> Why is the report card changing ? <p> The report card is changing for the following reasons : 1 . to help students understand where their learning is at based on specific learner outcomes 2. to better communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the specific learner outcomes 3. to align it with our best practices in assessment 4. to inform instruction 5. to improve student learning 6. to have a uniform reporting system in GHSD . <p> What does " outcome-based " reporting mean ? <p> Outcome-based reporting is a way of reporting student achievement according to specific learner goals in each subject area . <p> Are the prioritized outcomes " written in stone " ? <p> No , the current prioritized outcomes are not written in stone . Teacher feedback is being collected by Jeff . Consistent feedback that is received can be modified for the Fall . <p> Should we just be assessing using the prioritized outcomes ? <p> Yes , the majority of student assessment should be based on the prioritized outcomes . The 2s and 3s can also be assessed . <p> What are student " marks " based on ? <p> Student marks are based on a collection of evidence that shows what a student knows and can do . This evidence is gathered through student observation , conversations and various products . <p> How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can we edit assignments ? <p> Yes , assignments can be edited . To delete parts of an assignment go to assignment -&gt; edit -&gt; parts -&gt; delete . <p> How do we record information when students are all working on various operations ( adding , subtracting , multiplying , dividing ) ? Sometimes this is even beyond grade level outcomes . <p> Assessments will have to be broken apart and recorded by specific learner outcome . Right now , if students are working on outcomes that go beyond their current grade level , that information will have to be recorded as a comment . <p> How do we record marks for " Math Assessments " that cover the entire curriculum in one assessment but has only one question/concept ? ( i.e. Math for Success ) . <p> Assessments will have to be broken apart and recorded by specific learner outcome . <p> Are formative assessments part of the final mark ? Are they weighted differently ? <p> No , they are not used to come up with the mark . Only the summative assessments are used . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Are we just reporting the 4 core subjects for the June report card ? <p> Only the 4 core subjects are being assessed by learner outcomes . All other subjects are being broken down into : skill development &amp; effort and participation . <p> How do we report for students on IPPs ? They are often working on outcomes from varying grade levels . <p> There are various ways to report this . See the attached flow chart that describes reporting for students on modified and adaptive programs . <p> Where do spelling marks belong ? What if there is n't an outcome that specifically speaks about spelling skills ? <p> All evidence of learning must match a specific learner outcome to be reported . <p> How can we report achievement for students who are pulled out of the regular classroom for extra support in LA and/or math ? <p> This varies depending on the grade level of instruction . Please contact Jeff/Norma to walk you through this process . <p> How do you hide the last two columns in assignments ( effort and completion ) ? <p> *see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly will the parents see in the parent portal ? Will they see the outcomes ? Will they see all of the assessments ? Will they see a mode for each outcome or the specific marks for each assignment ? <p> The parent portal will be functional in September . Right now it is set up so the parents can see their childs achievement in each #1 outcome . At this time parents can not view specific assignments . Teachers can share this information with parents through meetings and conversations . <p> What does NA , IE , and Mod mean in the column with E P B and L. <p> NA- not addressed ( if the outcome has not been assessed in this reporting period ) IE- incomplete evidence ( if the student is absent or an assignment has not been handed in ) Mod- modified <p> What do you put when a student is absent ? <p> IE-incomplete evidence OR ABS in the completion column OR you can deselect the checkmark by their name . <p> Can we get step by step instructions to change class list alphabetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column heading " First Name " . <p> How do you report marks if the reporting period covers the end of one unit and the beginning of another ( in science or social for example ) ? <p> How do you report marks if the reporting period covers the end of one unit and the beginning of another ( in science or social for example ) ? You would report on the outcomes covered in each reporting period so an academic indicator would appear for each reporting period . <p> How do you delete a student that has moved or add a new student ? <p> This is done through School Logic . Your secretary can do this for you . It does take 24 hours for it change after that information has been entered . <p> How do you weight assignments ? <p> We are no longer assessing by the assignment . We are assessing according the outcome so they are all equal .
