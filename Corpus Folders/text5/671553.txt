To get the Proxyaddresses from the get-aduser cmdlet we can use the name and expression ( or n= and - e= ) pieces of Powershell .

The members of any command can be viewed by using the following : <p> get-aduser get-member <p> Where get-aduser is replaced by your CmdLet .

If you 've ever taken Arch Linux ( the distro Manjaro is based on ) for a spin you will probably wonder " How the hell can anything based on Arch be easy ? " Even as a seasoned IT Pro and Developer , Arch tested my patience on my first install . This is the main reason Ive always kind of shied away from Manjaro , as I 've grown quite accustom to Debian and Debian based distros . Like any good Tinkerer though , I eventually wanted to try a new window manager , and had a peticular interest in trying a Tiling Window Manager . I settled on taking I3WM for a spin . <p> I first tried I3WM in Ubuntu , while I thought the idea of a " window snapping on steroids " was pretty cool . There were some pretty basic pieces of the puzzle missing ( such as sound controls not working without additional setup/ more packages being installed . ) Therefore , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time with a distro that supported the tiling window manager out of the box . Enter Manjaro . With a ton of community supported versions , Manjaro seemed on the surface to be Arch , without a mountain of setup . I downloaded , installed , and immediately felt the difference . <p> Manjaro I3WM <p> Clearly , the creators of Manjaro I3WM gave a nice amount of effort to make this a much sexier version of I3WM ( As I 've toyed around with different versions of Manjaro , I 've noticed a very good job being done with design . ) Sound works out of the box , and I3s info bar ( dock ) has been reworked to not only be prettier , - but to also display more useful information . Many useful command line and GUI pakages are installed ; ranger ( file manager ) , yaourt , pacman ( package managers ) , and htop ( system monitor ) are amongst the MVPs . The makers of this version of Manjaro had an eye for UI/UX , as there- is even a quick tip section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As good as this version of Linux looks , it runs just as fast . Using less than 235MB of memory on a liveCD boot , you will be damned pleased with performance on most any machine . <p> There really are not many drawbacks to most versions of Manjaro from what I can see . Its sleek , sexy , and fast . However , while I love I3WM , it is certainly not for people who do n't  like learning curves . It took me a while to understand how to properly snap windows the way I wanted , and to understand some other caveats of using such a unique window manager . However , with that learning curve comes great reward . - After some fiddling and reading , My tiles pretty much auto populate with programs that I have set to run at start , and my workflow has never been faster . <p> While I think most people with the patience to learn Manjaro I3WM will love it , it takes a certain desire to appreciate the system . If you want something really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want something super powerful and simple by comparison , Give Manjaro I3WM a whirl . As a developer , I 'd give it an 88/100 . <h> Like this : <h> Related <h> Comments <p> I am currently running i3 on 2 different laptops .

I really like the quickness of using the keyboard , and the monitor independent workspaces is a huge advantage for me . <p> looking to try out i3 and have been on the search for a " good " distro as i felt Ubuntu ( which i first saw it being used on ) would be rather heavy and wanted something even more lightweight so i can get as speed as possible . <p> Having played around with various tiling managers recently ( Awesome , xMonad , and i3 ) , and really enjoying them overall , I fully agree with a review I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reviewer mentions that ( something like ) : " Manjaro i3wm will spoil you and make it difficult , if not nigh on impossible , to contemplate anything else ; it has all of the benefits of a tiling wm , with none of the headaches .

My second knock against the Pi is I think in order for it to be a good media center , one needs to have a PC running the PlayOn Software which will cost you an additional $50 bucks for a lifetime subscription .

As you may know , the Lync Client is included with Office 2013 , and when manually installing from the Office 2013 ( with sp1 ) ISO things work as expected i.e. Lync gets installed . However , when I was trying to do a silent install with SCCM ( by using the Office Customization tool ) Lync would not get installed . I spent far too many hours trying to fix this , then I tried with the old Office 2013 ( without sp1 ) ISO and things worked as expected when installing manually , AND- when customizing a silent install . I 've concluded that this is either a bug , or a very poorly documented feature in the sp1 installer . So , if you find yourself wasting way too much time on this , go back to the volume licensing site and download the Office 2013 ( without sp1 ) ISO and deploy with that . BTW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Uninstalling Lync there are already some good links for that . I 've included them below .

The OS is still in " beta " though it has been for several years , and is the 11th most popular Linux distro according to distrowatch . I recently gave it a go for a while as my primary OS , and had some thoughts to share with others that are considering installing Elementary OS . <p> Appearance : - <p> When powering on for the first time , after a pretty generic Ubuntu install one will immediately be impressed with the appearance of ElementaryOS . Its Pretty . The OS definitely draws inspiration from Mac OSX . Using a Gnome based backend called Pantheon , Elementary has a nice menu , and a simple dock ( Planky ) for quick app access . The appearance of Elementary is second to none . <p> Usability : <p> Elementary Advertises itself as UI/UX centric , and while its definitely pretty , the UX leaves a bit to be desired for a power user . While I admit things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power user . The thing I was most irritated by was the lack of seemingly any hotkeys working . <p> Portability : <p> Elementary is a pretty lightweight system , landing somewhere between Xubuntu and Ubuntu Gnome in terms of performance Which for your non-linux person is pretty darn good . My one complaint here is getting guest tools to work right in Virtualbox was a bear and the system still did not run all that great on VBox . <p> Stability : <p> Nope . While most Linux based systems are very stable this is where Elementary earns its " beta " tag . I would n't say it froze frequently , but I had to deal with lockups a couple times a week which is no fun at all . <p> Overall : <p> Elementary is the prettiest Linux distro you 'll find . Its pretty lightweight , and will run well on older hardware . Unfortunately , I found the usability and stability left something to be desired . This is a great OS to check out , or use on non-production older hardware , but I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may just be related to my hardware , but I 've been running Ubuntu Gnome ( 15.04 ) on the same hardware for sometime now without issue though the updated Linux kernel differential may actually be what is making the difference here . <p> Side note , one other thing I found a little annoying with elementary was the lack of hot keys that seemed to be setup . Sure , that 's customizable , but with many distros it works out of the box . I suppose if I were more into keeping elementary as my primary OS I 'd script the setup of hotkeys.

The device sports some very mediocre ( and mostly not applicable ) specs , and contains an HDMI video output , and a usb input for power . The reason the specs are mostly not applicable is because the device ( by default ) can only play videos , pictures , and audio that is streamed to it by a phone , computer , or tablet . here 's a quick tutorial : <p> - The Chromecast design is nothing ground shattering , its essentially a 2 inch dongle , that is intended to hide behind a TV when plugged into an HDMI port . The upside of this design of course is that it would be silly simple to throw in your travel bag should you want to plug it in to a hotel TV for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Chromecast is an extremely simple device , and- for the geekier of us , it maybe simple to a fault .

I find this a bit cumbersome in the living room when compared to a Roku , or AppleTV which all have their own operating system and apps , and can be controlled via a decent universal remote , a remote of their own , or a cell phone . Where I do see a place for the chromecast is in a travel bag so you can watch your tablet on a hotel screen , or possibly in the bedroom , where you can throw some music or movie on to fall asleep to . <p> Overall , I 'd give the Chromecast- a 65% awesome rating and say while it may not work for everyone in all situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one .
