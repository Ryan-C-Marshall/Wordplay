@@44623285 @4623285/ <h> Essential Components : How to Write a Speech That Rocks <p> Giving a wedding speech is a great honor , but most of us immediately get writer 's block or freak out at the thought of coming up with what to say . Where do you start ? <p> Before you begin your wedding speech or toast preparation , write down some thoughts about the couples relationship , how they met , how you know them , their personalities , or general thoughts about marriage . Once you have some of these ideas down on paper you have a framework to work from . <h> Make Your Speech Personal <p> How do you know the bride and groom ? How do you feel about them ? Were you involved when the bride and groom met ? Do you know details of the proposal ? Do they have cute nicknames for each other ? It makes sense for anybody giving a speech to make it personal . Guests are going to appreciate the love and connection that comes from doing that . <h> Add A Touch of Humor ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with humor . It is great if you can add a few one-liners and make a joke or two . In saying that , the best speech balances funny with heartfelt . If it 's too sentimental , you 'll have guests falling asleep .

It is about balance . <h> Thank Everyone Who Deserves a Thank You <p> Thank the relevant people and make sure you 're specific where you can be . This takes some preparation , make sure you ask around to see who helped out with the wedding . And do n't forget the families of the bride and groom too , as well as members of the bridal party . <h> Write a Strong Speech Opener &amp; Closer <p> You need to get peoples attention immediately . That means having a strong opener and a strong closer . Use a short Irish wedding toast , a cute saying or a funny quote . The idea is to give your best wishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toast . <h> The Ideal Speech Length <p> There are going to be a bunch of wedding speeches . Do n't  bore people with a long speech . Save the long or potentially embarrassing stories for the bachelor or bachelorette party . Be brief and memorable . <h> Practice Your Speech Before The Big Day ! <p> Practice and preparation makes perfect . Make eye contact and speak to all the guests . You cant do that while looking down at a piece of paper or just going off the cuff . That means you need to prepare and have something written down and rehearsed . Practice , practice , practice .

Practice until you look good , until you can watch yourself in the mirror and ultimately look at the audience while speaking . <h> A Few Things Not To Include in Your Speech <p> The rules here are quite simple . First things first , it 's never funny to make racist jokes or comments about any of the families ' cultures or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the obscene or offensive lines . <p> Poke fun at the groom but do n't cross the line and hurt anyone 's feelings . Leave out stories of drunken nights or ex 's . Steer away from any sexual innuendos as well . Use your common sense . <p> You want to walk away with the bride and groom feeling good , not humiliated . <h> The Groom 's Speech <p> The groom 's wedding speech is a big deal .

Add a bit of humor if that 's within your wheelhouse but also know that it 's a great time to boost the bride with lots of amazing words as well as share any sentimental stories you have of the newlyweds . <p> Just like the best man is to the groom , the maid of honor is the bride 's closest counterpart so a bit of warmth and love is definitely expected to show in the wedding speech .

When Alyson asked me to be her matron of honor , I ca n't tell you how excited I was . I knew that the job would let me share this day with my sister to be a part of all those special moments that come at such a massive wedding .

Its only natural that you would want to get her the perfect engagement ring . She deserves it but how do you choose a ring that will knock her socks off and show how much you love her at the same time ? Its easy . All you have to do is follow the five Cs. <h> 1 . Cut <p> The cut of the diamond is a term used by jewelers that describes how well the diamond reflects light ; it has nothing to do with the shape of the diamond . Diamonds that are more valuable reflect light better , and so have better cuts . The cut refers to how the diamond was cut after it was mined . Angles from cutting , as well as polishing afterward , all determine how the diamond reflects light . If it reflects light well , it will have an extremely bright appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your intended bride . <h> 2 . Color <p> The most clear , colorless diamonds are the most prized and valuable . Many diamonds of lesser quality are opaque or cloudy when you look at them up close . Other diamonds are actually colored , such as pink or yellow . You can even find black diamonds . The coloring is natural and comes from how they were made and where they were found in the earth . However , to get a truly special diamond , you must find one that is virtually clear . These are rarer than you might imagine , so expect to do some looking to find the perfect colorless diamond . <h> 3 . Clarity <p> Clarity has nothing to do with color . The opaque or cloudy nature of some diamonds is all part of their color . Clarity is a measure of how flawless the diamond is . If it has any imperfections on its surface , like cracks , scratches , chips or traces of other minerals mixed into it , then its clarity level goes down . You want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as possible . Diamonds with low clarity look shoddy and it will be clear to everyone that you did n't  care enough to get your loved one the very best . Examine each diamond closely and only choose ones with impeccable clarity to make sure your prospective bride is impressed . <h> 4 . Carat <p> Carat refers to the weight of the diamond . This is different from karat , which is the term used to measure the purity of gold , so do n't  confuse the two . Large diamonds have large carat measures . Tiny diamond chips , on the other hand , may not even make up a full carat . The higher the carat , the more visible , and more expensive , the diamond will be . However , you should n't buy a diamond on carat alone . You need to make sure the cut , color and clarity also are as perfect as they can be . The ideal engagement ring for your prospective bride will have excellent results in all four of the Cs of diamond selection . <h> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond engagement ring that has nothing to do with the physical attributes of the diamond : Communication . Buying an engagement ring is n't something you should go at alone .

The jewelers at Macys are an excellent resource to make sure you 're choosing a high quality diamond and can help guide you to select the best engagement ring for your beloved . 46875 @qwx456875 <p> Choosing the perfect diamond ring can be a totally overwhelming experience , especially when we know nothing about jewelry .

@@44623346 @4623346/ <h> The Basics of Wedding Invitation Etiquette <p> The etiquette of weddings has changed over the years , but the invitations still come with some hard and fast rules . Why ? Probably because they offer pertinent information that guests must attend to . It is too easy to focus on the niceties of the invitation like the quote or the design qualities , and forget to put in an essential detail . <p> The goal is to convey to family and friends the joy of the occasion while still providing them with specifics like the date and R.S.V.P. options . As you and your partner begin this journey that will lead you down the aisle , consider some tips on getting the invitation just right . <h> Picking a Tone <p> It starts with deciding what type of wedding you want . This one decision serves as the core for many other choices you make about the special day . <p> Formal <p> Causal <p> Small <p> Low-key <p> These are all descriptive phrases that define the tone of the wedding , and subsequently , the invitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wedding format . An invitation printed on linen stock and served up in satin envelopes says traditional and formal . A single sheet with " We are finally getting married " in big bold letters provides an air of informality and fun . <h> Design Absolutes <p> Once you work out the tone , the next thing to decide is the invitation layout . There are some absolute necessities to consider . <p> Keep the language clear at all times . Unless you are quoting Shakespeare , you want the guest to know exactly what each line means in the invitation . <p> Location : The corner church at 13 th and N <p> That may seem like an obvious address to you , but are you sure there is only one church at that intersection ? Is that N street , avenue or boulevard ? Make each line count for something . <p> Avoid a design that is too busy : Simple equals elegant . If you opt for an abundance of graphics , stay on point . If you are having a destination or themed wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> Use an easy-to-read font : Script and fancy type look nice , but are sometimes hard to decipher . It is possible to pick a typeface that is both clear and rich looking . When selecting an ink color , pick something that matches the design , is one of the wedding colors or goes with black . If opting for a wedding color , consider making the envelope lining the other color to create a set . If your colors are pink and silver , the ink could be a dark pink and the envelope lining matching silver or vice versa . <p> Spell out dates on formal invitations : Saturday , the seventh of January , two-thousand and fourteen at four oclock in the afternoon . If the tone is causal , Saturday , January 7 , 2014 at 4:00 p.m. is fine . <h> Wedding Invitation Q&amp;A <p> When do the wedding invitations go out ? <p> Ideally , the invitations are in the mail six to eight weeks before the ceremony . For destination weddings , it is standard to send a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to allow traveling guests time to plan ahead . <p> Does the invitation contain gift information ? <p> This is a major etiquette faux pas . It is better to let your wedding party and family spread the word about the gift registry . If putting up a wedding website , provide that information there , as well . <p> Is it necessary to offer a " plus-one " option ? <p> No , it is appropriate to invite single guests without offering to host a plus-one . A few may misunderstand this subtle hint , though . In that case , they will most likely note a guest or date on their R.S.V.P. You have the option to accept that additional person or give them a call and explain . <p> Can you invite people to the ceremony only ? <p> Are there rules for addressing the envelopes ? No , the opposite is proper , however . If you prefer an intimate wedding and a more open reception , it is okay to send " reception only " invites . <p> Yes , first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope . The return is from the hosting party , so if the invite designates the brides parents as hosts , their address goes on the envelope . Never use stick on labels for the return address . <p> The front is for the addressee . Use formal language with Mr. , Mrs. , Ms. , or titles such as Dr. or Capt . List children on the envelope , as well , if they are invited . Repeat the title and last name of each guest on the face of the inner envelope . <h> How to Handle Those Tricky Situations <p> Not every wedding scenario is perfect , but most have a solution . Consider some common problems that might cause confusion when putting together the wedding invitation . <p> Divorced Parents : If the parents are divorced but still hosting the wedding together , list the names on separate lines with the mother first . Exclude any connector between the two names such as " and . " <p> Remarried Parents : The rules are similar for children who want to include stepparents on the invitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . <p> Deceased Parents : Do not list the names of deceased parents on invitations .

Mark and I very much favour the latter , and it 's a good job too because we do n't want to wed in the UK , we 're dreaming of getting married in Asia . <p> Before settling on Asia , we had to weigh up the pros and cons of marrying abroad .

That one is black and could be used for business after the wedding . <p> I love the idea of the planner and would recommend it as a must have to any bride or wedding planner . It is also a great keepsake to have after the wedding is long over . Maybe it could be used for couples planing to buy their first home or , dare I say it out loud , having a baby ! Calm down MIL !

Patience is not included in the list , but patience is key as you discover how these eight principles will play out in your marriage . <p> Communication <p> For any marriage to be a place of happiness and rest , both partners must be committed to learning and practicing healthy communication . Communication is the greatest tool for understanding and being understood , yet you might be surprised at the number of couples who simply do not communicate their needs or feelings . Broken communication may be a result of broken trust or failed attempts in the past , and if that 's the case , those issues need to be addressed first .

Here are 10 things that every bride and groom needs to know ( but no one remembers to tell them ) before the wedding . <h> 1 . Schedule Time for Photos <p> Photos of your special day are so important . In fact , outside of the dress , photography can be one of the biggest expenses of the wedding day . Make sure you have enough time to get the most out of your photographer . <p> As you are scheduling the time for photos , consider scheduling the posed shots before the ceremony . This will give you the chance to get all of the images you want , without having to make your guests wait at the reception while you rush through photos . <h> 2 . Do n't  Forget to Have Fun ! <p> Your wedding needs to be fun for the bride and groom . Its easy to get lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy yourself . Schedule the day so that you have the time you need to really relax and enjoy your guests and your special day . <h> 3 . Pack an Emergency Kit <p> Have your maid of honor pack an emergency kit for the unexpected problems that will occur . This kit should have a small first aid kit , complete with bandages and medication for aches , pains and headaches , as well as a small sewing kit , double-sided tape , bobby pins and emergency snacks . Throw in one of those stain removal pens to ensure you can get a spill out of your dress or tux . Consider other emergency items you might need and add them to the stash . Remember , accidents will happen , and you will feel much less stress if you are prepared . <h> 4 . Follow Up with Vendors <p> You booked the reception , caterer and photographer , right ? So the morning of your wedding everything will be ready to go ! Unfortunately , people make mistakes , and the last thing you want is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your wedding . Follow up with all of your vendors and locations a couple of weeks before the wedding to confirm the day , time and cost , so you do n't  have unexpected surprises on your big day . <h> 5 . Keep a Guest and Gift List <p> No matter how small your ceremony may be , you are going to forget who came and what they brought . Assign someone in your family with the task of keeping a running list of people who came and the gifts you received . Also , start this list early , because some gifts will come in before the wedding . Consider keeping the list with your list of invited guests , so you can have the addresses close at hand for the thank-you notes . <h> 6 . Schedule Alone Time with Your Soon-to-Be Spouse <p> Weddings are a time when guests want to express their well-wishes to the bride and groom . Unfortunately , many forget that the day is about the bride and groom . Make sure you schedule some alone time as a couple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the bride in her dress for the first time . For others , who wish to have that reveal moment be when she walks down the aisle , it is some time right after the ceremony . This alone time is crucial to helping you seal your memories of the day as a couple . <h> 7 . You Need Extra Thank-You Gifts <p> No matter how carefully you think through everything , chances are you will forget someone that requires a thank-you gift . Avoid embarrassment by simply buying a few extras and wrapping them ahead of time . Then you can pull out the extra gift and hand it to the individual and never even let on that you forgot . <h> 8 . Choose Who Gives the Toast <p> Be careful who you choose to give the toast at your reception . When the wine and other drinks start to flow , peoples mouths start to get a little looser . Make sure the person who is toasting to you as a couple is not going to divulge any secrets that you wish were kept private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be toasting , let your DJ or MC know ahead of time that the mic is off-limits for those individuals . <h> 9 . Give Someone Phone Duty <p> You do n't  want to be answering phone calls or texts the day of your wedding , but you need your phone to be available if someone needs something last minute . Give your phone to someone you trust and ask them to be the designated " texter " for the day . This will ensure important messages are not lost while protecting you from a constant bombardment of well-wishes. <h> 10 . Do n't  Forget to Eat <p> The day gets so busy and it can be easy to forget to eat . Make sure you have breakfast and try to have at least one other meal or substantial snack .

You can also thank anyone in your life who had a large role in supporting your relationship before your engagement . Is there someone who introduced the two of you ? A married couple that mentored you during your relationship ? A community that you both belong to that supported your relationship ? These people helped make your wedding happen , so take a moment to thank them publicly . <h> ADDRESS YOUR WEDDING PARTY <p> Take a brief moment to thank and acknowledge each groomsman and bridesmaid .
