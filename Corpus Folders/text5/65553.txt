It is the highest qualification available in business and management . It is specifically designed for senior professionals who wish to advance their careers by developing their research , analytical and critical thinking skills . The Northampton DBA is a part-time programme that typically runs over four years . The first two years are structured around facilitated modules that provide the foundations for the research project , the main element of the DBA . This research project needs to make a significant contribution to professional practice by developing existing theories and knowledge . <h> Why complete the Northampton DBA ? <p> The DBA provides the opportunity for you to cultivate the skills needed to find better solutions for intractable problems and develop new paradigms for the increasingly complex , turbulent and interconnected business environment .

We will also be running a three day workshop every three months , the details of upcoming workshops are available to download . All workshops are from 9am 5pm unless otherwise stated . <h> GRA8016 Principles of Research <p> This module aims to provide students with an opportunity to explore the principles of research which underpin investigations in a variety of applied settings . Students will critically examine the various ontological and epistemological approaches to knowledge within their discipline and develop a critical awareness of the ethical dilemmas . <h> GRA8004 Advanced Quantitative Data Analysis <p> This module aims to develop skills in quantitative data analysis to an advanced level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of data management and analytic techniques which are commonly in use in professionalresearch .

By the end- of the module students will be conversant with a broad range of tools which may be considered for use in the doctoral thesis . <h> GRA8010 Advanced Qualitative Data Analysis <p> In recent years , the application of qualitative approaches to both research and evaluation within the professional arena has been steadily- gathering momentum . Some would argue that such techniques can help bridge the gap between scientific evidence and professional- work-based practice by enabling researchers to gather richer descriptive data which provides valuable insights into the attitudes , beliefs , - perceptions , and experiences of a range of stakeholders . By the end of the module , students may be conversant with a broad range of tools- and techniques associated with qualitative methodological approaches , and their philosophical underpinnings , which will then be- considered for use in the doctoral thesis . <h> GRA8001 Developing Leadership in Business Research <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into practice through the review of research culture , research opportunities , and- investigation of issues associated with the leadership and management of research and research teams .

Students will then explore mechanisms for overcoming such hurdles and develop innovative research leadership strategies- appropriate for their own working environments across blended interests of public , private , third or community sectors within a corporate- citizenship paradigm . <h> GRA8002 Part one and Part two Reflecting on Business Practice- <p> This module aims to provide students with the opportunity to acquire appropriate evidence and to critically reflect upon existing practice- and their own experiences within a professional context .

This may include examination of an issue related to business management or organisational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings and make evidence-based recommendations for the- improvement of practice environments across blended areas of public , private , third and community sectors within a corporate citizenship paradigm . <h> GRA8015 The Research Proposal- <p> This module aims to draw together the knowledge and skills provided in the preceding modules so that students can define an original work-based research project with clear aims and research philosophical underpinning . Students will be expected to translate this into a research proposal and plan that covers methodology and methods and ethical considerations . and knowledge and skills to an opportunity to explore the principles of research which underpin investigations in a variety of applied settings . <h> GRA8006 Professional Research Project <p> The thesis element of a professional doctorate programme provides the student with the opportunity to demonstrate high-level research skills in a written thesis and defend those at an oral examination . <p> Module information is quoted for 16/17 currently .
