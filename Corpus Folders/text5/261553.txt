Leaded Four Star and Lead Replacement Petrol ( LRP : ) Leaded fuel was removed from sale in 2000 and replaced by LRP . This fuel is basically 97 RON unleaded petrol with an additive to give the valve seat protection , which some older models need . A valve seat is a surface inside a vehicles engine , which rests against the air intake or exhaust valve when the valve is closed . The LRP stops it from moving out of place and possibly reducing the engines efficiency . LRP is generally only used for vintage vehicles and so is less common . <p> 4 .

Fantastic ! Now you need to know where to buy it . Check out the options below . <h> Buying a vehicle from a private seller <p> Many people choose to buy a vehicle from a private seller . The major benefit when choosing this route is that prices are generally cheaper . <p> If you choose to buy privately , you need to be aware that you have fewer legal comebacks than you do through a dealer , and the checks and guarantees that a dealer is compelled to make by law are n't a benefit in a private sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As private sellers are under no obligation to reveal a vehicle 's history , or offer proof of any checks , the onus is very much on the buyer to determine a vehicle 's past . <p> Buying privately can appear daunting for some , but as long as you make the right checks , buying a vehicle this way can be both satisfying and rewarding ; it just takes a little more work . <p> The first stage of this process is conducted over the phone , and , if you get it right , it can save a lot of hassle and wasted time . <p> ALWAYS ask if " the vehicle " is still for sale . If the vendor asks " which one ? " its likely this is a dealer trying to disguise that they are in the trade . Some unscrupulous traders sell dodgy vehicles to avoid <h> Questions you MUST ask the seller : <p> How long have they owned the vehicle ? <p> Have they owned it from new ? <p> If not how many previous owners ? <p> Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What features does the vehicle have ? <p> In their opinion , what sort of condition is the vehicle in ? <p> Does it have a service history ? <p> Is there any outstanding finance or hire purchase agreement ? <p> Does it have any tax or NCT ? <p> Has it been involved in any accident , and if so , which parts were damaged ? <p> Where was it repaired ? <p> Have they replaced anything on it recently ? <p> Has it been modified in any way ? <p> Are the repairs guaranteed ? <p> The price should be negotiable - are they open to reasonable and fair offers ? <h> Viewing the vehicle <p> If you are meeting the seller at an agreed location , make sure it is one that is familiar to you always bring someone with you . Take the original advert with you , plus the notes you made during your phone conversation will the seller . This will enable you to check details like mileage and tax are the same as you were told during the call . <h> Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend with you . <p> NEVER carry large amounts of cash . <p> NEVER view a vehicle at night , as it makes the vehicle harder to examine . <h> Checking the vehicle <p> Its imperative you check the vehicle thoroughly for any faults or damages . <p> Follow these steps to ensure everything is checked and covered : <p> Never check a vehicle in the dark or in the rain . It will make it very difficult to spot dents , scratches , rust , and a multitude of other defects . <p> If you can , take a look at the vehicle before you ring the doorbell . This will give you a chance to look at it without being distracted by the seller . <p> Always start the vehicle with a cold engine . This will make it easier to spot starting problems or excessive smoke . <p> Crouch down in front of each front wheel and look along the length of the vehicle . Both front wheels should be directly in front of the rear if they 're not , it could mean the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is known as crabbing . <p> Check the gaps between the body panels are equal if they 're not , the vehicle could have been refitted badly , or may have been in a crash . <p> Take a look at the tyres . Are they in good condition ? <p> Check under the vehicle , beneath the bonnet and the carpet for rust , and , signs which may suggest the vehicle has been in a crash , such as welding marks . <p> When you 're inside the vehicle , make sure the seatbelts work correctly and the steering wheel and dashboard are bolted on correctly . Also , make sure the front seats move about properly and all switches work . <p> Under the bonnet , look for signs of oil leaks on top of the engine , and underneath . Use the dipstick to check the amount of oil . If the level is low , the owner has n't  been looking after the vehicle properly . <p> Look around the oil filler cap for a white mayonnaise-like substance - this is an indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put right . <h> Outside <p> Firstly , take a walk around the vehicle and take it all in . Unless you 've been told otherwise , the vehicle should be in a driveable state . <p> You should always start the vehicle with a cold engine , as this is when it 's easiest to spot starting problems or excessive smoke . Place a hand on the bonnet - if it 's warm , it 's been run recently , so let it cool for a few hours . If need be , come back later . <p> Let the seller show you the vehicle , but do n't let them distract you from carrying out your own checks . <p> Crouch down in front of each front wheel and look along the length of the vehicle . Both front wheels should be directly in front of the rear if they 're not , it could mean the vehicle has been in a crash with a slightly twisted chassis . This is known as crabbing . <p> The wheels should sit neatly in the wheel arches , equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels are equal . Run your finger along each to feel if the gap is bigger at one end than the other . Uneven panel gaps occur if a vehicle has been in a crash , or if panels have been refitted badly . <p> Look carefully at each panel for ripples or overspray where excess paint has flecked onto other trim , such as window seals or bumpers . <p> Look closely at each tyre including the spare . Watch for uneven wear , which could mean suspension damage , nicks and gouges . Tyres are expensive , so if they need replacing , use this as a bargaining tool . <p> The minimum tread depth is 1.6mm for the whole way around the tyre . Use a tread depth gauge to see how much is left the more , the better . <p> Check under the vehicle , particularly at the front and back , under the bonnet and under the carpet in the boot for signs of crash damage . Panels should be flat , and free from signs of welding or patching up if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most shunts are minor , low-speed crashes , but you should take extra steps to be sure there are n't any more serious problems . <p> Obviously rust is a bad sign , so keep an eye out all the time , especially around the wheel arches where moisture , grime and winter road salt can increase the speed of deterioration . Test the lights . Get the vendor to run through a check while you make sure all the lights work on the outside . <h> Inside <p> There are plenty of things to check inside , as well , most of which can be a good indication of mileage and the amount of care and attention it 's had lavished on it . <p> Look around the cabin a 50,000 mile vehicle should n't have a worn or sagging seat , or a steering wheel , gear knob or pedal covers , which have been worn by lots of use . <p> Make sure all the seatbelts work they could indicate a previous crash or general neglect . They 're a legal requirement too if the vehicle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm bells should be ringing as these should have been checked . <p> Look closely at the dashboard binnacle ( the bit which houses the speedometer and other dials ) . If the vehicle has an older , mechanical-style milometer which turns as you drive , make sure all the barrels are aligned correctly turning these back is the oldest trick in the book . If there are fingerprints in there , ask why there could be an honest explanation . <p> This is harder to check on more modern models which have electronic milometers the miles can be turned back simply by connecting a laptop and entering a new mileage . <p> Either way , make sure the mileage tallies with old NCT or MOT certificates and service history . <p> Make sure all the dashboard and steering column panels are bolted on correctly they could point to a clocked vehicle , or one which has been stolen , particularly if there are glass fragments on the floor . <p> Do n't  be too quick to reject a vehicle it can be tricky to bolt a dash back together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Make sure all the switches work including the heater or air-con - and check the front seats move about properly . <p> Locate the Vehicle Identification Number ( VIN ) . You 'll find this riveted in the engine bay . There are few reasons why this should have been removed , so be suspicious if there are signs of tampering , you could be looking at a clone a stolen vehicle given the identity of a write-off . <p> The VIN number will also be stamped in the floor beside the driver or passenger seat . A clone will have another number welded on , and are usually quite easy to swap . <p> Most modern vehicles also have the VIN recorded at the base of the windscreen . <p> Check all the numbers match the logbook and your vehicle history check documents if they do n't , walk away . <h> Under the bonnet <p> Next check under the bonnet any problems you miss here could cost you a packet , so be thorough . <p> Check for signs of oil leaks around the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will be where it 's most obvious . Road grime can stick to oil , making it even more noticeable . <p> Check the oil when the vehicle is parked on a level surface and the engine is cold . Remove the dipstick , wipe it with a cloth and replace for a couple of seconds . Pull it out again and look at the amount of oil it should be near the top ; if not , the owner has n't  been looking after it . <p> The oil should be a golden colour sludgy black oil is a sign the engine could be damaged . <p> Look around the oil filler cap for a white mayonnaise-like substance - this is an indication of a damaged head gasket which can be very expensive to put right . <p> We 'd recommend you carry out a vehicle history check to find out whether its stolen , an insurance write-off or subject to outstanding finance . <h> Test Drive <p> You should never buy a vehicle without driving it first . <p> Ireland 's Auto Trader lists the do 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle , make sure you 're fully insured , and take proof with you - most sellers will want to know you 're covered in the event of an accident . <p> Start the vehicle - preferably when the engine is cold . It should start straight away - if it takes too long , it could mean trouble . <p> After you 've started the vehicle , check the exhaust for excessive noise . If there are holes in it , there will be lots of noise - this is known as a ' blow ' . <p> Have a look at the exhaust smoke - white , steam-like smoke is OK , unless there 's a lot . Blue smoke can indicate an internal oil leak , which can be expensive to rectify . <p> Once the engine has been running for a while , the temperature gauge should sit around the halfway mark . <p> Before you set off , turn the steering wheel from one lock to the other . There should be no screeching , banging or knocking . It should also be smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to drive off gently . If it fails to hold the vehicle back , it will need attention - although most handbrakes will still loose the battle with an engine . <p> On your test drive , you should drive on as many different kinds of roads and surfaces as possible . Use all the gears , and do n't forget reverse . <p> On manual vehicles , the gear change should be slick and smooth , and the clutch pedal should ' bite ' between the top and middle of the pedal 's travel . If the clutch does n't disengage until the pedal is on or near the floor , it needs adjusting or replacing - expensive . <p> If you 're driving an automatic , there should n't be any slurring , whining or banging . <p> Accelerate hard , and watch for smoke from the exhaust , and after checking no one is behind , brake sharply . If you feel the vehicle pulling to one side or hear noises , the brakes will need examining . <p> Throughout your test drive , listen out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by talking or turning up the radio . <p> The seller will usually suggest a route , but if it 's not long enough tell them . But remember , do n't  start abusing the vehicle - you have n't bought it yet . <h> Haggling <p> Take a moment to remind yourself of any vehicle faults or work you think might need doing to the vehicle . Use this to negotiate the price with the seller . <p> Ask the seller what they realistically expect to get . Make a lower offer for the vehicle , then stay silent . This gives them two options accept your offer , or make a counter offer . <p> When it looks like they 're about to accept your offer , move to shake their hand and confirm the deal . <h> The Paperwork <p> ALWAYS ensure you see all of the following : 1 . The Vehicle Registration Certificate 2 . The vehicles service history 3 . NCT or MOT details 4 . A valid tax disc ( if the seller said tax is included ) <p> Everything must be present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make sure all the documents are original do n't accept photocopies . <p> Examine the logbook ( Vehicle Registration Certificate ) carefully . Check the seller is the recorded keeper in the Vehicle Registration Certificate . If not , they 're not legally entitled to sell you the vehicle . <p> Lots of dealer stamps in the logbook means it 's likely the vehicle is well maintained . It 's always worth calling the garage to check they did carry out the work . <p> Before handing over the cash , a vehicle history check is highly recommended ! If you only do one piece of research , we recommend you do this . A vehicle history check is the smartest investment you 'll make when buying a vehicle . <p> The check will reveal if the vehicle has been reported stolen , has outstanding finance on it ( if so , it 's technically still the property of the finance house ) , has been written-off or scrapped , and , what the full spec of the vehicle should be . <p> It will also tell you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll be able to see what the vehicle 's identification number should be , so you can match it up to the numbers on the vehicle itself ( commonly found on the chassis , on the windscreen or on the floor by the driver 's seat ) . <h> A vehicle history check - 10 reasons why <p> A vehicle data check is the smartest investment you 'll make when buying a vehicle . For the price of a tank of fuel you can find out if the vehicle you 're about to buy is recorded as stolen , has outstanding finance , or , a dodgy past . <h> 1 . Is the vehicle reported stolen ? <p> Vehicles taken without the owner 's consent are listed on the Garda National database . Getting a vehicle history check will find out if the vehicle has been listed as stolen - and potentially could save you thousands . <h> 2 . Outstanding finance <p> If a vehicle has outstanding finance it 's legally still owned by the finance company . But it 's not necessarily bad news - you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and end up owning the vehicle . <h> 3 . Write-off <p> There are five different categories as to how badly a vehicle has been written off . A vehicle check will tell you if the vehicle has been written off , and into which category it falls . <h> 4 . Scrapped <p> A history check should unearth any potentially dodgy goings on with vehicles which have been sent for scrap , but have somehow returned to market . Another money saver ! <h> 5 . Mileage anomalies <p> If the vehicle has had its mileage altered , a vehicle check will show up the discrepancy immediately . If the information is available , a vehicle check will reveal if the mileage has been wound back or if the vehicle is older than advertised . <h> 6 . Valuation <p> Every make and model of vehicle has a market value . The vehicle check will provide you with this , and show you if you 're getting a good deal or are about to be ripped off . <h> 7 . Check the vehicle identification number <p> The vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chassis number should match the one on the vehicle registration certificate and the markings elsewhere on the vehicle ( commonly on the windscreen or on the floor by the driver 's seat ) . A data check will tell you what the vehicle 's correct VIN should be . <h> 8 . See the full spec <p> Getting a history check will allow you to see the full spec ( make , model , date of first registration , engine number , transmission etc. ) of the vehicle you 're about to buy . If there are any major differences between the spec and what has been advertised walk away from the deal . <h> 9 . Check the number of previous owners <p> The history check will also tell you how many previous owners the vehicle has had . If the seller is advertising ' one previous owner ' and the data check tells you there have been more , it should set the alarm bells ringing . <h> 10 . Get insured <p> Some services offer the prospective buyer free insurance if any of the data in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payment <p> Make sure you ask for a receipt when making any payment , especially if its cash . Get two copies signed - one for you and one for the seller . Make sure the seller 's address and vehicle details are on both . <h> Buying from a Trade Dealer <p> Buying from a trade dealer has advantages for many : Ideally , any vehicle bought from a dealer should include a warranty . You may be able to part exchange your old vehicle . You will have ample opportunity to inspect and drive the vehicle prior to making your decision . <p> Reasons to buy from a dealer : <p> This is the safest option as you receive maximum protection from the law . <p> Signs of Trade Association may mean that the dealer follows a regulated code of practice . <p> The vehicle must be free of defects , except those pointed out to you at the point of sale . <p> The vehicle must be as described in any advertising material . The vehicle must be fit for purpose . <p> REMEMBER : When buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of satisfactory quality ! <h> Buying a Used Approved Vehicle <p> If you 're looking for one of the safest options to buy a second hand vehicle , then choosing a used approved vehicle may be the right choice for you . <h> What is a Used Approved vehicle ? <p> This means the vehicle has been used by a previous owner and then returned or sold to the original dealer , before being repaired , checked and approved by the same dealer . <p> Used approved vehicles are moved into a showroom , where they are made available to buyers again . This makes it easier for you to purchase a specific model with many of the assurances of buying new but without the cost . <p> The benefits of this option include peace of mind . Apart from good sales service and vehicle reliability , you can expect these strong points from a used approved vehicle : <p> No mechanical defects <p> Fully accredited history <p> Usually nearly new and well maintained <p> Good payment options ; sometimes you can drive off before your money has gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover <p> Manufacturer guarantees and code of practice <p> You may even be able to part exchange your old vehicle <h> Where to buy a used approved vehicle ? <p> Most vehicle manufacturers have their own used and approved schemes . These differ in price and service , but essentially remain the same in terms of what they offer : quality used vehicles . Its not only vehicle manufacturers which offer these schemes either many motorcycle dealers offer them and you may find vans in some of the schemes too . To look for a particular make or model , decide on what you 're looking for and then use our website to look for a model . Alternatively , search online for your preferred vehicle manufacturer and contact them directly . <h> Used approved checks and procedures <p> To qualify for used approved status , all vehicles must first go through a detailed pre-sales inspection , where any faults found are fixed . This makes the purchase a safe one . <p> The vehicle will also have its service history checked , as well as regular mechanical checks before being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what tests are exactly made . <h> Details of what is checked and fixed : <h> Levels <p> All liquid-oriented components are checked this includes the brake fluid , front and rear screen washers , shock absorbers , power steering , clutch fluid and coolants . <h> Safety features <h> Technical tests <p> Various detailed movement tests are carried out , to ensure everything still works correctly . Some of these checks include the simple task of opening and closing doors , adjusting the seats , winding down the windows and opening the sunroof , gear changes and the temperature gauge . <h> Object movement <p> Door hinges to be greased . Fuel tests are completed , spark plugs examined , the timing of the ignition is recorded and the front axle is greased too . <h> Visuals <p> The windscreen is analysed , as are various in-vehicle tools and the first aid kit . The interior is inspected and the vehicle specifications are measured and checked to make sure everything is the right size . <h> Road testing <p> The vehicle is extensively tested on-road , to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good run through its paces , as is the heating system , traction control , cruise control , brakes , steering , clutch and more . <h> After road <p> After the test drives comes even more series of tests this time the paintwork is examined ; service history is looked into and compared with the recent service test . <h> Tyres <p> Finally , the tyre condition is checked , from tread depth to make and type . Air pressure and other factors are taken into account , including the temperature of the tyres and more . <p> This full service including both interior and exterior checks is standard with most used and approved schemes showing their reliability . Check with the individual dealer what their schemes cover before deciding on a model too rashly . <h> How to buy a new vehicle <p> Buying a new vehicle is easy .

Never view a vehicle in the dark or the rain - they can hide defects in the bodywork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle before buying it as this will give you a feel for it and raise any concerns . For example , the vehicle might not be big enough for your needs , or the engine noise could be unbearable . <p> Make sure you 're fully insured to drive the vehicle , and take proof of this with you . Most dealers will let you drive with trade number plates , which should provide you with cover - but check this is the case . <p> Sit in the car and make sure there is enough room for you and that you can reach all the tools . Use all the gears . Drive on as many road surfaces as possible ( e.g. tarmac , concrete ) to make sure the ride is comfortable . Get a feel for the vehicle &amp; figure out its pros and cons , and how it will suit you . Avoid being distracted by the dealer if he talks a lot , or turns up the radio . <h> Haggling <p> There 's still plenty of room for negotiation on the price of a new vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to ! Why not try and get these extras thrown in ? <p> Metallic paint <p> Protective coating for the paintwork and upholstery <p> A good deal on finance ( dealers often work on commission ) <p> A full tank of fuel since new vehicle are often sold with very little fuel <p> Floor mats and mud flaps <p> You may be able to get a better deal towards the end of the month when salespeople are chasing their targets . <h> The paperwork <p> Make sure the registration on the vehicle tallies with the one in the logbook ( Vehicle Registration Certificate ) , as well as the vehicle identification number . Do n't forget to make sure you receive the correct manuals and the codes for the radio and keys , if applicable . <p> Where the tax is not included in the price , you MAY have to purchase a tax disc before you drive off the forecourt . <h> The payment <p> Get a receipt for any payment you make , especially if you 're paying cash . Make sure both your copy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of service packs , warranties , etc . <h> What if it goes wrong ? <p> If things go wrong with the deal like the vehicle not turning up or not being the exact model you wanted - protest at the earliest opportunity . <h> Other vehicle buying options <p> There are many options when buying a vehicle ; dealers and private advertisers are just two of them . Here are a few other choices worth considering . <h> Auctions <p> Vehicle auctions used to be the preserve of traders . Bulk selling of anything from nearly new stock to rental fleets and unwanted trade-ins , can offer some serious bargains for private buyers who do their homework . <p> With little or no opportunity to test-drive the vehicle , or contact previous owners , it 's a risky route , and there 's little legal protection . Vehicles are sold as seen and the vehicle is yours as soon as the hammer goes down . <p> If you 're new to auctions , it 's always best to take along an experienced buyer or someone who knows about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the balance too , plus the auction fee on the night . Not for the faint-hearted . <p> Always speak to your insurer before buying from a vehicle auction . When you buy from an auction you may not be insured to drive home . Most motor traders have trade insurance which allows them to drive any vehicle but private buyers are subject to different laws . <p> Auction fees will vary from auction house to auction house but you may be required to pay as much as 15% of the hammer price . <h> Imports <p> New and used Japanese imports allow Irish buyers access to models not available on these shores . They may offer better specifications , but many models differ depending on where they are sold . <p> It is now much easier to buy from abroad and can be cheaper too . But remember , when you sell the vehicle , it will be worth less than an official model . Specifications on vehicle purchased abroad may vary slightly compared to Irish models . <p> Importing can be carried out in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the import yourself ; or <p> Use an import broker . <p> When importing a vehicle into Ireland , vehicles MAY be subject to VRT or Vehicle Registration Tax . ALWAYS check with the importer that the price includes the VRT BEFORE you purchase the vehicle . <p> Buying from abroad can be cheaper but when you go to sell the vehicle on , it will have a lower residual value . <h> Buying a caravan <p> Whether you 're a first time buyer or a mobile home veteran , we can help you with your purchase Are you buying privately or from a trader ? New or used ? Whether you 're after a caravan , mobile home or something completely different , we can help you through the buying process . <h> Matching your vehicle to your caravan <h> Trailer weight <p> The Camping and Caravanning Club recommend that the loaded weight of your caravan should not exceed 85% of the kerb-weight of your vehicle . However , you should never exceed the kerb-weight given in the vehicles handbook . <h> Nose weight <p> Nose weight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your vehicle and is typically between 50 and 100kg . For stability , the nose weight should not exceed this limit . <h> Payload <p> Payload is the weight of the items that you are allowed to carry in your caravan ; you will find this in the handbook . Check the loading of your caravan periodically to make sure you are n't exceeding the total weight allowed . Manufacturers call this the gross weight <h> Safe on the Road <p> Before taking to the road , you should ensure that your vehicle and trailer combination is correctly matched and equipped . In order to continue safely , regular servicing is essential - some checks need carrying out every trip and a caravan certainly needs a main service once a year . Some checks are simple enough , but others may require a bit of mechanical knowledge . If in doubt , leave it to the experts . <h> Tow Bar <p> A correctly fitted and maintained tow bar is vital for safety , as it is the only connection between vehicle and trailer . Make sure that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no cracking or rusting around the mounting points . <h> Brakes <p> Brake maintenance is best left to properly trained engineers , but its worth keeping an eye on your brake mechanism and cables . If you have any doubts get them checked straight away . Make sure the metal breakaway cable is in good condition . This cable is designed to pull on the caravans brakes , snap and allow the vehicle to run free of the braking caravan in the event that the caravan comes off the tow bar . Always connect this to a separate mounting point and not the tow ball . <h> Suspension <p> Check the condition of the suspension for both the vehicle and trailer , as it is important for safety , as well as comfort . When your caravan is attached to your vehicle , it should tow level or slightly nose down but NEVER nose up . If you find that the vehicle rear sags you may need some form of suspension aid . Get specialist advice on the type required for your vehicle from your vehicle dealer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same axle . Make sure you check the pressure and condition of the tyres before every trip - you will find correct pressures detailed in your handbook . Before setting out , check that the caravan wheel nuts are tight , ensure wheel trims are replaced securely and ALWAYS carry a spare wheel . <h> Electrics <p> The road lights on your trailer are operated from the tow vehicle through a 12N-type socket and plug . Check the caravans indicators and lights are working in unison with the vehicle each time you set off . A dashboard display or warning bleeper MUST be fitted inside the tow vehicle to show that the trailers lights are working . <h> Mirrors <p> It is vital to have a good view of the road behind you and along the sides of your caravan . This will usually mean attaching additional towing mirrors to your vehicles wing mirrors - make sure these are securely fixed and adjusted correctly <h> Caravan safety and security advice <p> There are hundreds of security devices on the market and some are better than others . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make most thieves think twice about stealing your caravan . <p> Buy the best security you can afford and make sure the thief knows the device is fitted . Stickers are usually supplied with security items so use them ! <h> Hitch locks <p> Hitch locks provide a reasonable degree of protection from the opportunist thief . Get one that is manufactured from heavy steel to cover the tow socket fixing bolts and has a good lock . Some hitch locks can lock the caravan to the vehicle but make sure it is unlocked when you are actually towing - use them ONLY on site or if you leave the caravan unattended . They do n't  generally offer sufficient security for when the caravan is in storage , but they will make things much harder for a thief . <h> Wheel Clamps <p> There are many different kinds of wheel clamps on the market , but remember , generally speaking , the easier they are to put on , the easier they are for a thief to take off . Buy a good clamp and check that it correctly fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thief can remove the wheel and the clamp with it . <h> Wheel Stands <p> If you think that wheel stands are the only way to keep hold of your caravan , think again - a determined thief will come prepared with a set of wheels . But wheel stands can be a deterrent ; if you make sure they are locked in place . Check your handbook as some chassis manufacturers recommend axle stands for winter storage . Make sure you check with your insurers that they are happy to let you keep your caravan on wheel stands , as some insurance policies call for the caravan to be fitted with a wheel clamp at all times . <h> Security Posts <p> These are particularly useful for those who keep their caravan on the drive at home . They are cemented into the drive and physically block movement of the caravan . Some can be fitted with a tow bar on top of the post so that the caravan can be fixed with a hitch lock . Others are detachable or can fold down so that the caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you have any information concerning caravan theft or disposal of stolen caravans , contact the confidential free phone Crimestoppers Line on 1 800 250 025 . You can stay anonymous and you may be entitled to a reward . <h> Leaving your caravan <p> Storage sites are particularly popular with thieves - there are lots of caravans to choose from and often plenty of undisturbed time in which to work . Thieves do n't care if you are on holiday theyll steal caravans from lay-bys , motorway service stations and picnic sites . Even if you 're just stopping for a cup of tea or to stretch your legs , make sure your caravan is secured . <p> Parking in your driveway or garden is no guarantee against theft either , so stay alert . <h> Towing your caravan <h> Vehicle Length <p> Towing a caravan is no more difficult than driving solo - providing that you are aware of the additional length . There is no reason why your trailer should not dutifully follow your vehicle but you will need to allow more time and space to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When turning , you will need to turn later and harder than you usually would as the trailer will not follow the exact path of your vehicle . <h> Braking <p> Braking distances , whilst towing a caravan , may increase by 20% , depending on the road conditions . Remember NEVER to slam on your brakes , as this can cause the trailer to jack-knife , so keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front . <h> Instability <p> Snaking is the most common form of instability and is often due to bad loading or excessive speed . However , even well matched units can snake due to air from passing lorries or coaches . Vertical instability is called pitching and can occur if you hit a pothole . In either case DO NT apply your brakes hard - slow down gradually by easing off the accelerator . A stabiliser will help to avoid snaking and pitching , but it must not be a replacement for a good vehicle and caravan combination or weight distribution . <h> Marking your caravan <p> If your caravan is stolen the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action now . <h> Photographs <p> Take photographs of your caravan , particularly any distinctive features . This can help identification should your caravan be stolen and subsequently recovered . <h> Roof Marking <p> Gardaf recommend that you put some distinctive mark on the roof of your caravan which can be seen by Gardaf helicopters . Vehicle kits are available , or you can paint your own . <h> Tracking <p> If you have a desirable caravan , it may be worth investing in a tracking system . These use global positioning satellite technology to pinpoint your caravan to a few metres , in the event that it is stolen . They are not cheap to buy , and there is usually a monthly line rental , but this can be outweighed by possible insurance discounts . <h> Etching <p> Etch your caravan chassis number on all windows and in several hidden places inside the vehicle . You can use an ultra violet pen for this but a simple spirit based felt tipped pen mark inside a cupboard , or under beds , is almost impossible to remove . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microchip into your caravan structure , making it harder for thieves to dispose of stolen ' vans and increasing the likelihood of stolen caravans being returned to their rightful owners <p> All caravans built since 1997 have a Radio Frequency Tagging chip ( RFID ) fitted at manufacture . <h> Records <p> Keep a note of your caravan chassis number and other important information . Keep these records safe and away from the caravan . <h> Selling <p> If you 're selling a caravan , never part with your caravan until the cheque has cleared . This includes building society cheques and bank drafts they could be stolen or forged , leaving you without a caravan or money . <h> Buying <p> If you are buying a caravan , always meet at the sellers house . If they insist they meet you in another location , such as a vehicle park or your house , be suspicious . Make sure that the house they claim to live in is actually theirs - sellers have been known to use the driveway of an empty house . <p> Check the caravans chassis number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or altered , contact the Gardaf . <p> If the seller asks you to ring only at certain times , be wary .

Heres what you need to know about Irelands first match against Sweden and how to get there . <p> At a glance <p> Eiffel Tower , The Louvre , Arc de Triomphe there is n't enough room here to detail all the sights and attractions that make Paris one of the most visited cities in the world . Usually a city for lovers , on Monday June 13th it will turn into a sea of green ( ok , and maybe a bit of yellow ) . <p> Getting there <p> Irish Ferries sail from Rosslare to Cherbourg and Roscoff twice a week and from Dublin to Cherbourg once a week . <p> From Cherbourg to Paris its a 356km drive via A13 and N13 . It should take around three hours and 46 minutes . <p> From Roscoff to Paris its a 561km drive via N13 and A11 . It should take around five hours and 46 minutes . <p> Hiring a car ? <p> Baffling rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car in Europe is n't always straightforward . So if you 've decided to fly to France and hire a car , here 's a useful guide to hiring a car in Europe , from Liberty Insurance . <p> Getting around <p> The 81,000-seater Stade de France is in the rather unglamorous northern suburb of Saint-Denis but getting to it from the city centre is easy . As parking is limited , its best to use public transport to get to the stadium . The suburban rail network in Paris ( known as the RER ) has two lines serving the Stade de France Saint-Denis station : RER B and RER D , and is the quickest way to get to the grounds . Both lines depart from the Gare du Nord ( 5 minutes journey time ) , ChGtelet-Les Halles ( 10 minutes ) and Gare de Lyon ( 15 minutes ) in the city centre , and run regularly before and after matches . <p> The Saint-Denis branch of Line 13 on the Paris Metro also serves the Saint-Denis-Porte de Paris station close to the stadium and runs to Gare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Gare Montparnasse ( 25 minutes ) . You can see a map of both the RER and Metro network here . <p> Note : When the stadium is busy , you may have to queue for up to an hour to get a train back into the city centre . Your best bet is to make a run for it as soon as the match ends or hang back a while and enjoy a drink while you wait for the crowds to die down . <p> Saint-Denis is n't the most exciting part of Paris , so it is probably best to eat in the city centre before and after the game . Paris is full of bars , restaurants and street vendors and food is relatively cheap in comparison to alcohol . The area around ChGtelet-les-Halles station has plenty of options . <p> Drinks do n't  come cheap in Paris but here are a few suggestions to budget for . Kitty O'Sheas , near MTtro station OpTra is centrally located and has a good atmosphere on match weekends . As does the Eden Park Pub on Rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Sulpice and St Germain des pres MTtro stations . <p> Where to stay <p> Paris provides every kind of accommodation you could imagine , from Airbnb and hostels to luxury hotels . If you want to stay near to the stadium here are some options : <p> The Ibis <p> The Novotel ( right opposite the stadium ) <p> The Adagio Access Saint-Denis Playel <p> Check Kuoni , the official accommodation agency for the tournament . <p> Fun fact to impress the lads with <p> Because the traffic system in Paris is mainly based on giving way to those coming from the right , there is only one stop sign in the whole of Paris ; in the wealthy 16th arrondissement . <p> Car Insurance <p> If you 're taking your own car , before you go check with your insurance provider to make sure you have the minimum cover you need to drive in France .

Consider how much you can afford to pay each month and this will help you decide the term of the deal . <h> Question : <p> What other charges should I look out for ? <h> Answer : <p> Ask about the following : <p> The size of any final payment <p> Are there any extra charges at the end of the agreement ? <p> Early settlement charges <p> Added extras like Gap insurance or payment protection insurance <p> Remember to make sure the rate you 're being quoted is the APR , not a flat rate <h> Question : <p> How do I get a competitive finance deal ? <h> Answer : <p> Although most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance , shopping around for a number of quotes for other finance providers can save you money .

The vehicle will have a guaranteed future value . This is the calculated value of the vehicle at the end of the agreement and it is taken into account when calculating monthly payments . <p> However , PCPs do n't suit everyone 's needs . The vehicle belongs to the finance company until the deal is completed and there are penalties for early settlement . The vehicle must be kept in good condition during the agreement - any damage or excess mileage will be taken from the final value of the vehicle . <h> Personal Contract Hire <p> Contract hire has always been popular with companies , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract hire schemes . <p> Contract hire is very much like hiring a vehicle over a fixed term . You simply pay a fixed monthly amount over the period of the agreement . When the agreement has ended , you simply hand the vehicle back , leaving you open to start another contract or walk away . <p> The benefits of contract hire are that there is minimal initial outlay and a fixed monthly payment that is very easy to budget for ( this is why contract hire is so popular with companies ) . There are also no depreciation or disposal issues to deal with , so the only additional costs are consumables such as fuel and insurance . <p> As with PCP schemes , there are penalty fees payable if the vehicle had covered more than the agreed mileage , or , if there is any damage to the vehicle .

You agree to pay in instalments , but you only own the vehicle once the final instalment has been paid . Until then the company you bought it off technically owns it . <p> You can of course take on the debt yourself with a secured or unsecured loan . If you are going to buy an expensive vehicle , in excess of 35,000 or so , a secured loan may be your only option as few lenders will take the risk of offering you an unsecured loan . <h> How much can I borrow ? <p> Only borrow what you can afford . Consider whether your current income is sufficient to cover any debt you might take on - you have to ask yourself how the debt is going to affect your disposable income , and whether you will have enough cash to live on every month . Remember to take into account your current debts , and also any savings schemes you are currently paying into when making these decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? <p> The answer to this is not immediately obvious ; its a question of getting the best value for money . Shop around and think about the terms of the loan . If you take on the loan for a long period then in most cases your monthly repayments will be small but you will ultimately end up paying more as the debt wont shrink rapidly . If you take on a short term loan then you 'll probably pay a high monthly rate of repayment but will clear the debt quickly . You need to find a happy medium for yourself . <h> What happens if I 'm i 'll and cant work or if Im made redundant ? <p> Payment Protection Insurance is a form of insurance which protects your commitments to debts should you have a sudden loss of income due to illness or disability . If you find yourself unable to work then the insurer will commit to pay your debts . Most policies differ so it is important to read the terms and conditions carefully . The terms of the policy will usually specify how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they will not commit to paying 100 per cent of the debt , then what percentage they will commit to paying . <h> What is credit scoring ? <p> When you apply for a loan , the lender will look to build a credit score around your application to decide whether or not you are a reliable borrower . They will examine your current and past credit commitments and how well you have met them before deciding whether to give you the money . <h> What is a credit pass mark ? <p> Before a lender gives you any money they will examine your credit score and from this score they will derive a number which represents an acceptable risk for them to take on . If your score meets or exceeds this number then you should get the money . <h> Ive been turned down for a loan - what should I do ? <p> If you have been turned down for a loan the most important thing to do is to resist the temptation to go out straight away and apply for half a dozen extra loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could make you look desperate to potential lenders . Instead , take time to find out why you 've been rejected . It could be that your credit report contains errors which you are entitled to amend . Alternatively , wait until you are promoted or take a better job before re-applying . <h> How can I see my credit report ? <p> In order to get hold of a copy of your credit report you need to contact one of the credit agencies who compile them . Agencies include the Irish Credit Bureau , Experian , and , Equilend . You can normally get one copy for free . <h> What can I do if the information on my credit report is n't accurate ? <p> Check that all the information is accurate and , if you spot mistakes , be sure to report them to the agency . Maintaining the accuracy of your report can be particularly important if you have had serious financial difficulties in the past , such as voluntary agreements or a bankruptcy . As soon as you meet the terms of these agreements , ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the credit agency . <h> Are there any charges not included in APR ? <p> The APR is the average interest rate built up over the whole term of the loan , so borrowers can compare loans . It takes into account the interest , any insurance , and fees . You may be hit with a fee if you choose to repay your loan early . This wont be included in the APR but you 'll be made aware of what this is ( usually one months repayment ) in the terms and conditions . <h> What are the loan conditions ? <p> Loan terms and conditions will vary , so be sure to read them all carefully . The most important thing to check is the cost of the deal . If the interest rate is high you could consider alternative ways to finance the deal , so do n't  jump in . If you 've signed up to a personal contract hire , you 'll agree a monthly rental cost with various terms and conditions , such as total miles travelled , vehicle maintenance and servicing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minimum Guaranteed Final Value - this is what your vehicle is worth when a PCP contract ends , as long you have n't exceeded any set mileage limits . If alls well , that 's how much you 'll pay to buy the vehicle at the end of the contract . <h> What should I check when signing a credit agreement ? <p> See above <h> I 'm having trouble keeping up with my repayment . What should I do ? <p> You should take stock and try and work out why you cant afford them . Are you spending extravagantly elsewhere ? Could you budget better ? If you 're really struggling the best thing to do is tell your creditors . Burying your head in the sand is likely to make matters worse . If you default on a payment you 'll have to pay a fee and things can easily spiral out of control . If you are still struggling , consult the Citizens Information Board . <h> Do I have to buy PPI ? <p> The short answer is no ! PPI can be expensive and there is some criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the concept . You do n't  have to buy PPI through your loan provider , so if you shop around you could find a better value deal . If you 're keen to protect yourself , do n't  be put off by the scaremongering just be careful . <p> If my vehicles purchased by PCP , HP or PCH and the vehicle is faulty , what should I do ? Report the fault to the dealer , and get them to rectify the fault . Meanwhile , keep paying the instalments , otherwise you 'll default on the credit agreement , and the vehicle may be repossessed . <h> How can I cancel a credit agreement ? <p> Most credit agreements can be cancelled provided you act quickly . There will normally be a cooling off period of a couple of weeks , in which you will have the opportunity to think about the conditions of the loan . You lose this right if you sign the documents on the dealers premises , however . The agreement can be legally terminated at any time , if you are not the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is the case with Conditional Sale and Hire Purchase agreements ) . Provided you have paid half the credit price of the vehicle , you can simply hand it back . However , you will lose all the payments you have made to date , and will be liable for further charges if the condition of the vehicle is poor . If you have n't paid half of the credit price of the vehicle , you will lose the vehicle and still be liable for any outstanding payments . Generally , this is the worst case scenario of a credit agreement . <h> Is there a cooling off period with credit agreements ? <p> There will normally be a cooling off period of a couple of weeks in which you will have the opportunity to think about the conditions of the loan . You lose this right if you sign the documents on the dealers premises however . <h> If I settle early will there be any consequences ? <p> One of the most important hidden charges with any loan is the early redemption penalty . It sounds scary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fee if you decide to pay off a loan or mortgage early , or to move your borrowing to a different product or provider . If you can find a provider that wo n't charge then great , but the majority will , so you 'll need to be flexible . <h> Vehicle Loans A-Z <p> It 's important to understand what the finance firms are talking about so you can make the most of your money . <h> AER <p> Annual Equivalent Rate - the recommended way to compare savings products and current accounts . AER is how they calculate the interest paid to you . It shows how much interest you are earning on your cash if it was paid once a year and built up annually . <h> APR <p> Annual Percentage Rate - yearly rate of interest you pay on debt that often includes fees and costs . Lenders are required by law to disclose the APR . The rate is calculated in a standard way , taking the average interest rate built up over the whole term of the loan , so borrowers can compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest rate of a mortgage when taking into account the interest , mortgage insurance , and certain closing costs including points paid at closing . <h> Authorised overdraft <p> This is the agreed limit to which a person can exceed the balance of their account . <h> Credit Borrowing money and promising <p> To return it at an unspecified later date , usually with some form of extra charge ( interest ) on top of the initial sum . <h> Creditor <p> The person or organisation you owe money to . <h> Credit cards <p> There are more credit cards in the Ireland than people , so youve probably got one ! See credit . By paying for things by credit card , you are borrowing money and promising to pay it back , with interest . The sooner you repay it , the less interest you 'll incur .

Usually your credit score will take into account whether you pay your bills on time , the number and type of accounts you have , county court judgments and any outstanding debt . <h> Conditional sale agreement <p> Another name for a Hire Purchase Agreement . <h> Debtor <p> You - if you 've got a credit card , loan or mortgage . In short , it means you owe money to someone . <h> Default <p> If you default on a loan or debt , you are unable to pay your debt repayments as agreed .

Most commonly used with mortgages , homeowners can get peace of mind knowing what their repayments will be . Bear in mind , when the deal expires , you 'll often default to a higher variable rate . <h> GFV <p> Guaranteed Final Value also called " balloon payment " . Its the final lump sum you 'll pay for your vehicle based on its predicted depreciation if you 're buying through a PCP . <h> HP <p> Hire Purchase another way to buy a vehicle ; often used to buy white goods like fridges and freezers . You agree to pay in instalments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final instalment has been paid . Until then , technically , the company you bought it from owns it . <h> Hire agreement <p> A written record of hire terms . Under the Consumer Credit Act all regulated hire agreements must be in writing and they must give specific information , in a specific way . Do n't  settle for anything less than a formal hire agreement when you 're hiring a vehicle . <h> In-store finance <p> These deals can help you to pay for expensive purchases like furniture or large electrical goods over a set period of time . The store will often offer zero per cent interest for a fixed period and in some cases you can defer beginning to pay back the money for up to a year . <h> Interest <p> There are two broad meanings of interest in finance : 1 . A charge on the repayment of borrowed money ( credit , a loan , etc. ) , often expressed as a percentage of the total amount you borrow . 2 . A return on an investment , for example , banks pay you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , normally with pre-arranged terms of repayment , for a limited time . <h> Loan Sharks <p> One to avoid ! Loan sharks offer to lend you money at your door , but charge excessive rates of interest . They 're completely unregulated , and there 's the potential for things to get nasty if you do n't  pay your debt . <h> MGFV <p> Minimum Guaranteed Final Value The MGFV is what your vehicle is worth when a PCP contract ends , as long you have n't exceeded any set mileage limits . If alls well , that 's how much you 'll pay to buy the vehicle at the end of the contract . <h> PCH <p> Personal Contract Hire a way to hire a vehicle for a lengthy period of time at a fixed cost . The personal bit just means private individuals can sign up , as well as companies .

Can be expensive and there is some criticism of it . <h> Secured loan <p> Borrowing money and guaranteeing to repay it all with interest by offering an asset ( usually your home ) against the loan . If you do n't  repay the money , you could have your home repossessed . You can normally borrow much more with a secured loan , than with an unsecured loan . <h> Standing order <p> Another way to meet regular payments . You arrange for your bank to send a fixed amount from your bank account to another bank account by electronic transfer . Commonly used for paying rent or repaying a loan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usable in certain shops . They often come with a discount or incentive to shoppers to use them in-store . But beware - they often come with very high interest rates . <h> Sub-prime lending <p> People who do n't  fall into normal categories for a lender to calculate the cost of a loan are often called ' sub prime ' . You might be unemployed , self-employed or have a low credit rating , after having failed to pay bills , or , repay debt in the past . <h> Unauthorised overdraft <p> A negative balance , without the permission of your bank . If you exceed your balance by too much , you 'll be charged a fee . <h> Unsecured loan <p> Borrowing money - but without any form of guarantee against repaying it .

@@43825377 @3825377/ <h> Why buy insurance ? <p> You buy insurance for two reasons ; to insure you against liability you have to others and to insure against damage that others might do to you or your vehicle . <h> Which insurance to buy <p> Only you can decide what is suitable . Consider the information on the three types of motor insurance below before you start getting quotes . Three types of insurance cover <p> Fully comprehensive insurance cover is the most comprehensive of the three covers available for motor insurance and is usually the most expensive too . <p> Third party insurance cover is the lowest cost insurance available , and covers others against damage caused by you to their property , vehicle or themselves . <p> Third Party , Fire and Theft insurance is the same as Third Party insurance , but also covers you for the theft of your vehicle , or damage by fire . Naturally , it will cost less than fully comprehensive insurance , and more than Third Party Insurance . <p> However , always check with your insurance company what you policy covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting a Quote <p> Getting a quote will cost you the price of a phone call at most , although many insurance companies use Lo-call or Freephone numbers . <p> Quotes themselves are free , and you shouldnt be afraid to shop around or try price comparison websites to get the best deal . You should hope to get a better quote from your current insurer for your loyalty . <p> Or , let a broker do the work for you . They will shop around to get you the best deal , but be conscious that they may only have access to a limited number of insurers . Larger concerns have more buying power and can often get better deals . <p> The process is simple . Have to hand the vehicle registration , make , model and variant/derivative , your driver and named drivers details including their driving history , detail of any existing no claims bonus , information about where the vehicle will be kept at night and whether you will use it for business or just personal use . <p> Note that where you are leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance , many insurers will take into account any accident free or no fault accident years you had under the company insurance policy . You may need proof from your company of your driving history . <p> Upgrading an existing policy to include business use can sometimes carry a small administration charge . <h> Insurance Policy excess <p> The excess is the amount you have to pay if you make a claim on your insurance . There are two types , compulsory and voluntary . Be sure that when you buy a policy you understand how much excess you may have to pay in the event of an accident . <h> Cover notes <p> Before you buy any vehicle , you need to ensure that you are insured to drive it home . If you contact your insurer , they can provide you with a cover note which is a temporary certificate of insurance . When a cover note is issued by an insurance broker , you can drive on the road straightaway . The insurance company will then provide you with a copy of your full policy document and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document ' ? <p> The policy document is the contract between you and the insurance company . This is the small print ! Always read this document to ensure that the policy you have purchased covers all your needs . It outlines benefits , policy conditions and policy exceptions . It will even give details on how to cancel a policy , complain if you are dissatisfied , and , who to complain to . <h> Accidents <p> Having an accident is everyones worst nightmare . Read our guide below to find out how to get the right information should it every happen to you . <h> What to do at the scene of an accident <p> Your priority at the scene of an accident is to make sure that there are no further risks to you , other drivers etc . Get the emergency services out if there is spilled fuel and people have been seriously injured . <p> If you 're involved in an accident , it is important to get as much information as possible . Even if you are injured or in a state of shock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene of the accident as soon as possible and jotting down a few pointers . <p> This will assist your claim by helping both your insurance company and solicitor obtain the best possible outcome at a later date . It is advisable to carry a pen and paper in your car to help you to accurately record the accident details . Use your mobile phone to capture site and accident information which you may submit to your insurer as evidence of the accident . <p> Useful information to note : <p> Contact details including name , address and telephone numbers of drivers , pedestrians and passengers involved . If a party is driving within the course of their employment , take both the driver and the employer 's details . It may be worth noting a description of the driver , location and any distinguishing features . If there are witnesses to the accident get their details too . <p> The time and date of the accident ; <p> As many vehicle details including vehicle make , model , registration number , colour , any modifications and if relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether the parties were using headlights and/or indicator lights ; <p> The weather , visibility and lighting conditions , including street lighting ; <p> Name and number , and contact details of any police officer attending and other emergency services details if appropriate ; <p> Incident number if the police attended the scene of the accident ; <p> The damage to each vehicle involved ; <p> Injuries , where possible , to persons involved .

Note that the Gardaf will not always attend the scene of a minor accident . <p> Accidents must be reported to the Gardaf within 24 hours . <p> Inform your insurance company of the accident as quickly as possible . The company may refuse to insure you if you have not notified them of the accident within the time period set out in their policy . See our advice on Making a Claim <h> Making a Claim <p> Solicitors Costs Using a Claims Management Company <p> Although you can make a claim yourself , in most circumstances , you should get specialist help . <p> In cases involving an injury , there is a ' protocol ' which must be followed by both your solicitor and your opponent to ensure the case is dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible . <p> Your solicitor would first write to your opponent holding them responsible for your injuries , stating why they hold your opponent responsible , and summarising your injuries and expenses . Your opponent or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . <p> If your opponent is insured , then the insurance company will normally take over the claim . Within three months they must confirm whether or not they will settle the claim . Straightforward cases are normally settled quicker . <p> Your solicitor and your opponent 's insurer will usually attempt to agree upon a choice of medical experts to examine you and prepare a report detailing your injuries , the treatment that you have received and your prognosis . <p> Upon receipt of that report , it is often possible for your solicitor to advise you as to the value of your claim , and proceed to negotiate settlement with your opponent 's insurers . <p> If it is n't possible to reach an agreement as to who was responsible for the accident , or to the value of your claim , then the issues could be decided at a court hearing . <h> How much will it cost ? <p> The main concern for many people considering an insurance claim following an accident is the cost . The cost will depend on how you decide to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm of solicitors are likely to be instructed at some stage , whether directly , or via your insurance company or a claims management company . Only a solicitor can represent you if your case goes to court . <h> 1 . Solicitors Costs <p> Many solicitors now agree to pursue cases on a no win , no fee basis . Under the agreement the solicitor will agree not to charge you if the case is unsuccessful . If the case is successful , the bill will be passed onto your opponents insurer . Your opponent will only have to pay your ' reasonable costs ' , and it is worth asking your solicitor to guarantee any costs not paid by your opponent will not be deducted from your compensation . <p> Some solicitors will also suggest you take out an insurance policy when you sign the conditional fee agreement . You would make a claim on the insurance policy if you lost your case , and it would cover your opponent 's costs and often your own expenses . <p> ALWAYS ask your solicitor : ' Will there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deducted from my compensation if I win ? ' <p> You can apply for legal aid in cases involving exceptional circumstances or injuries . In these cases , you need to approach a solicitor with a ' Personal Injury Franchise ' . You can get a list of firms with a franchise from the Law Society of Ireland , or the local Citizens Information Board . <p> Finally , you can pay your solicitor on a private basis . This is the traditional way of paying for a solicitor , and you would be responsible for the solicitor 's fees and expenses whether you win or lose your claim . <h> 2 . Using a Claims Management Company <p> If you do n't  wish to approach a solicitor directly , you can contact a claims management company . They will approach a firm of solicitors on your behalf ensuring they have the proper experience to deal with the claim . <p> Varying levels of on-going service and accountability may be offered as you pursue your claim . Some companies will raise an additional charge to the solicitor . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay if I lose the case , and will I have anything deducted out of my compensation if I win ? ' <h> 3 . Legal Expense Insurance <p> Many household and motor insurance policies now include ' legal expenses insurance ' as an option . It should be clear from your policy documentation whether or not the cover is available , or you could telephone the insurance company or your broker directly . <p> The insurance company will often nominate a firm of solicitors to act on your behalf , although it may be possible to request a firm of your choosing . The policy will normally cover your opponent 's costs if you were to lose the claim so there would be no need for a conditional fee agreement . There is a limit under the policy as to the amount of your opponent 's costs which will be covered . ALWAYS check the limit . <h> 4 . Acting for yourself <p> If you 're injured in the accident , or wish to claim for expenses in excess of 5,000 , it is not recommended that you act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and your expenses are relatively low , you may bring a claim in your local County Court under the ' small claims procedure ' . <p> Information leaflets and the necessary forms are available from your local County Court upon request . The Citizens Information Board may also be able to offer some advice regarding this type of claim . <h> Bike Insurance <p> Our guide below illustrates some of the things to be conscious of when buying bike insurance . Many will save you money . <h> Types of insurance available <p> Only you can decide what is suitable . Consider the information on the three types of bike insurance below before you start getting quotes . <h> Three types of insurance cover <p> Fully comprehensive insurance cover is the most comprehensive of the three covers available for motor insurance and is usually the most expensive too . <p> Third party insurance cover is the lowest cost insurance available , and covers others against damage caused by you to their property , vehicle or themselves . <p> Third Party , Fire and Theft insurance is the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft of your vehicle , or damage by fire . Naturally , it will cost less than fully comprehensive insurance , and more than Third Party Insurance . <p> However , always check with your insurance company what you policy covers and make sure it includes everything you need . <h> Cancellation charges <p> Watch out for expensive cancellation charges from brokers . Because your risk is calculated over an annual period , if you try and cancel a policy mid-term , i.e. halfway through you will find that you get only a small amount of the premium back . In most cases , after 8 or 9 months you will not get anything back . <h> Interest charges <p> Always check this because often the APR charged on insurance instalments is much higher than your bank will charge you to use a credit card . Sometimes a broker will appear cheap but by the time you have paid the interest charges , it works out more expensive . <h> Riding other bikes <p> Some policies allow this extension and some do n't  . If you plan on riding your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are covered . <h> Modifications <p> Even if your bike has the smallest modification , that you do n't  think makes any difference , always tell your insurer just to be sure that its noted on your policy . <h> Recorded calls <p> All calls you make to brokers have to be recorded now by law . So make sure you always tell the truth about your circumstances as otherwise you will be found out . <h> Monthly policies <p> Some companies offer a monthly insurance policy . However , be careful as often the premiums are pro rata and a lot more expensive than an annual policy , so you may end up paying a lot more for a lot less . <h> Insurance renewal <p> Most brokers will work very hard to keep your business when it comes to renewing your policy . However , always check a few more brokers , just to make sure you are getting the best deal . <h> Excess <p> Always check that the excess on your insurance is right for you . You can often opt to take a voluntary excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what suits you best . <h> Shop around <p> Rarely is the first price you get the best price . <h> Bike security <p> Consider investing in a good quality alarm as this can reduce premiums . Also consider where you will store the bike as this too can help reduce premiums . <h> How to save money on bike insurance <p> Nobody wants to pay more than they have to for motorbike insurance . Regardless of your age , bike or level of No Claims Bonus , everyone wants to save money on their motorbike insurance . <p> Unfortunately though , your motorbike insurance is important . Not only is it law to have insurance , but the quality of it is crucial in the event of any accident or theft . <p> However , there are ways to save money on your insurance without compromising on your cover . Take a look at our hints and tips below to help you save money on your insurance premiums . <h> Research sad but true ! <p> It really is worth looking into what cover is right for you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much different policies are in terms of cost . <p> There are so many different companies out there on the market now so comparing them is a great idea . Not only should you be comparing their premiums , you should also compare what you are getting for your money . The best way to do this is to use a price comparison website as you can literally save hundreds of pounds . <h> Add a voluntary Excess <p> Your bike insurance will usually come with an excess . An excess is the first amount you have to pay in the event that you make a claim on your insurance policy . By adding a voluntary excess , you can sometimes save a lot of money . So , try getting a quote with and without a voluntary excess . <h> Extras <p> There are loads of extras that insurers either include for a fee on your bike insurance or that they try and sell you . Two examples of this are Legal Expenses Insurance and Breakdown cover . Do n't  forget that if your bike is less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . <h> Payment terms <p> Most brokers will offer you instalment facilities . Be warned though , the interest rate is very high and usually much more than if you had made payment by credit card . Check out how much extra it will cost you by accepting the brokers instalment terms and compare this to a credit card or overdraft . <h> Do n't  claim ! ! <p> The fact is , the longer you go without making a claim , then the cheaper your insurance becomes . Before making a claim , remember that you will be penalised for between 3 and 5 years for a claim . So its worth getting a quote from a broker to see how much your insurance will be for next year with a claim versus not claiming . If you 're going to pay a lot more over the next few years in insurance costs than the amount of your actual claim then think again . <h> Bike accident ?

If you or any party has any injuries , no matter how small they seem at the time , you should ensure that you or the other party get medical treatment . <p> If you are involved in an accident due to a bad road surface or an object in the road , it is especially important to try to get some evidence or details from any witnesses . Do n't  forget to take their contact details .

@@43825382 @3825382/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> What 's the news ? Ireland 's learner drivers are being ripped off to the tune of 200,000 a year by unscrupulous websites . That 's according to the Road Safety Authority ( RSA ) , which is calling on all learner drivers and those looking to book driving or theory tests to only do so through the official sites . <p> Around 11,000 people have been affected by this , with bogus websites charging an extra , and wholly unnecessary , extra charge of up to 23 for a theory test booking and 18 for a licence test booking . The sites are UK-based , so there 's nothing the Irish authorities can do other than monitor the issue and publicise the danger , but not only are these people being taken for a financial ride , they are also entering sensitive details such as their address and PPS number in order to book the tests . <p> Mr Declan Naughton , Director of Driver Testing and Licensing with the Road Safety Authority said : " We are really concerned that customers in Ireland are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 23 extra to book their theory or driving test for them . These so-called services are making a huge profit at the expense of unsuspecting customers who may not realise that they are paying a totally unnecessary extra cost to book their test .

In addition , their data will be stored in accordance with Irish Data Protection Laws . " <p> Explaining how customers may end up on one of these websites instead of on the official test booking websites , Mr Naughton said : " These unofficial websites advertise to book theory and driving tests online and customers are fooled into thinking that they are the official booking websites . These bogus websites lure customers in by appearing official , using words associated with the driving and theory test and even using our name . The RSA has tried to beat these sites at their own game by advertising the official sites online . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tests on the unofficial sites . The only winners are the bogus sites in the UK who are targeting unsuspecting learner drivers , and companies like Google , who profit from all the advertising . " <p> Denise McCarthy , Deputy President &amp; VP Welfare , Union of Students of Ireland commented : " It is unacceptable that these websites try to trick learner drivers into paying an extra fee to book their test . Students are already under pressure with mounting college fees and expenses and we would urge all students to only book their tests through the RSA 's official channels . For many students , the additional booking charge of 20 can make a significant difference when relying on a grant or waiting for their next pay cheque . " <p> Anything else ? If you 're looking to book your test , then there are only two websites you should do it through . www.rsa.ie for a driving test or www.theorytest.ie for the theory test .

You do n't  want to set it too high and put potential buyers off , and , you do n't  want to set it too low and feel like you gave it away . A little bit of research will allow you to gauge the current market value . <p> Price guides There are plenty of price guides available and many can be bought in newsagents . However , the most comprehensive source of used prices is the Auto Trader web site - and it 's completely free of charge , too ! But remember they are only a guide . You 'll be offered several prices for differing conditions of vehicle , with registration letters and model years being listed . A suggested mileage is also given . However , there are many more variables over and above those covered by price guides , meaning ' exact book price ' sales are rare . Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , or one in particular demand ? Is the colour is a desirable one ? Are there any other factors that could affect your price e.g. low mileage , a sought-after special edition or a particularly generous specification . <p> Classified advertisements Browsing Auto Trader will usually help you set the price of your vehicle . Look for models similar to yours , and see what the ' going rate ' is ; you can then price your vehicle accordingly . This works especially well for popular models , because there 's so much choice . It 's also a good trick for limited edition , rare or older models , as they may not actually be listed in price guides . <p> Owners clubs Some owners clubs offer valuation services . Bear in mind you may have to pay - or join the club - but this will probably be more accurate than other methods , because of the breadth of knowledge available . Enthusiasts often know your vehicle better than you do , and can account for any extras , as well as the overall condition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your vehicle 's trade-in value ; anything you get over and above that will be a profit . Do n't , however , look at dealer forecourt stock and expect to get similar prices for your vehicle ; you 're not offering a warranty or any guarantees , and therefore should charge a lot less . Some manufacturer web-sites also offer on-line trade price valuations , and can be another source of guidance for trade-in values . <h> Call in the professionals <h> Selling advice <p> Selling a vehicle is easy , but unless you do it for a living then the more you prepare , the better . This is where we help you prepare for buyers and show you how to steer clear of the most common vehicle crime dangers . <h> Canvassers <p> Occasionally , advertisers have contacted the Customer Care team at Auto Trader expressing concern about canvas telephone calls received from companies offering to put them in contact with potential buyers for a fixed fee . Auto Trader is not affiliated with such companies and does not pass on your details to these companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they generally contact vehicle sellers by telephone after seeing their adverts online . These companies try to persuade the vehicle seller to part with a fixed fee in exchange for a list of prospective buyers for their specific vehicle . Some offer refunds if the vehicle does not sell . <p> Auto Trader would recommend you should NEVER hand over card payment information to canvassers over the phone unless you have verified they are from a reputable source . <p> These companies employ a number of tactics including calling vendors repeatedly in a bid to wear down the seller into purchasing the promised buyers list . Unfortunately , in most cases the promised buyers do not materialise . When sellers have attempted to get refunds they discover that refunds will not be given under any circumstances . Some companies have been found to have numerous addresses and have proved very difficult to track down when trying to complain or seek recompense . <p> If you feel you have been treated unfairly by one of these companies you can contact your local Trading Standards office and lodge a complaint .

Thieves may try to engineer such situations , so you should be especially aware . <p> ALWAYS separate your car keys from your house keys . <p> Let the buyers follow their own route , as many are suspicious if you dictate which roads to take .

A deposit from the buyer will prove their interest , as should the fact they 're spending money on checking your vehicle . <h> Haggling <p> Buyers inevitably haggle about the price ; it 's all part of buying a vehicle . You need to be firm , without being unreasonable . Set a price beforehand and keep it in your head during negotiations . Do n't refuse to take offers - this will see buyers walking away . And do n't decline a sale for the matter of 50 or so . It 'll cost you far more in re-advertising fees , time and hassle . <h> Handling the money <p> Cash In an ideal world , you 'll be paid cash during normal office hours and be able to pay it in immediately ( checking for forgeries , of course ) , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive cash , try to get it handed over to you in a bank , so you can pay it in straight away and the cashier can check for fake notes .

@@43825539 @3825539/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> Many years ago , my car-mad grandmother ( we used to call her Granny Mansell - seriously ) averred to me that one should simply never buy an automatic gearbox , because to do so was to deny oneself the sheer pleasure of changing gear . Of interactive driving . Of being in total control of one 's vehicle . <p> Back then she was probably right . Automatics were , by and large , the preserve of larger , more luxurious cars and were perceived as slower and thirstier than manuals . <p> Today , though ? Different story , really . The fact is that automatics have caught up in so many ways that it might actually be better to go for one now than a manual , certainly in newer cars . <p> Of course the first thing to consider is price . A manual gearbox is standard fit for most new cars and adding an auto will always cost you extra . Volkswagen 's DSG transmission is in the region of 1,200 extra for most of its models while BMW will charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ( ok , ' something else ' ) do your gear changing . Worth it ? On the BMW , or a similarly priced premium model , absolutely : second hand buyers expect their luxury cars to have self-shifters , so the extra outlay in buying will be recouped at resale time . In cars like a Volkswagen , or a similar Ford , Toyota , Opel etc. it 's a less certain choice . An increasing cohort of buyers prefer automatics , but most will be just as happy with a manual and wo n't be keen to pay the extra premium . <p> Of course , it does n't help that there is now more than one breed of automatic . The old-style torque converter auto is probably best represented by German firm ZF 's near-ubiquitous eight-speed unit as found in many BMWs , Audis , Jaguars and others . It 's exceptionally smooth , so much so that you 'll often struggle to tell when it has changed up or down , and is so efficient now that it can actually improve both the emissions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice about autos being thirstier . <p> The other primary type of automatic is the dual-clutch gearbox , as popularised by Volkswagen and its DSG system , but now common to almost all car makers . These use computer controlled clutches and two gear ratio shafts to change gear with lightning speed , improving both acceleration and often economy . Not all dual-clutch gearboxes are equal however . The best will save you fuel and reduce emissions , but some will make it worse ; some are far less smooth and refined than the best traditional automatic ; and some require a great deal of extra maintenance to ensure reliability . <p> Finally , there 's the CVT , or Constant Velocity Transmission . Instead of gears and cogs , these use belts and pulleys to , theoretically , hold an engine at its most efficient speed while altering the transmission ratio to suit acceleration or cruising . They 're most often used in hybrids ( all Toyota and Lexus hybrids use a CVT ) and are great around town , but can be tiresome on the open road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask for meaningful acceleration . <p> ( Incidentally , for those wondering , pure electric cars do n't generally need a gearbox - they drive the wheels directly from the spinning of the electric motor , and simply use a single reduction gear to bring the high rpm speed of that motor down to sane levels for wheel speed . ) <p> So , as we asked at first , which is better ? No easy answer unfortunately . The gaps in performance between automatic and manual have become blurred , so if you 're especially concerned about fuel consumption , check the spec sheet of any car you 're looking at carefully to see which gearbox option is the better performer . Remember the rule of expensive cars - the higher the price the more it will need an auto to do well at resale time , and beyond that go with your own preference . Do you like to sit back and let the car do the work ? Or , like my dear departed grandmother , do you prefer to come over all Fangio and take full control yourself ? 
@@43825541 @3825541/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> This is a more practical , larger version of the VolkswagenTiguan midsized SUV , called the Tiguan Allspace . It 's designed to bridge the gap between the standard machine and the larger Touareg in Volkswagen 's SUV line-up , and it had its European debut in Geneva this week . <p> If you stare at the pictures of the Tiguan Allspace for long enough , you 'll notice that , although it has the familiar front- and rear-end design of the regular Tiguan ( mildly adapted around the bonnet compared to the existing car ) , it 's also ' slightly less compact ' than it was before . That 's because the Allspace is 215mm longer overall , with a wheelbase that has grown by 109mm - so not all of its physical gains are in the midriff . Volkswagen also says the Tiguan Allspace has larger rear doors than the ' normal wheelbase ' Tiguan . <p> Obviously , here we now have the option of seven seats ( more of a 5+2 configuration , but we 'll go with seven ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet there 's the rub , seven seats are optional , not standard-fit . If you decide to go with an Allspace and you only regularly occupy five seats , you get the bonus of a boot bigger to the tune of 145 litres , meaning 760 litres of cargo capacity with the second-row seats in place . And this stretched Volkswagen can swallow up to 1,920 litres ( +245 litres on the regular Tiguan 's ultimate figure ) of stuff if there are just two people on-board . Opt to have that third row of chairs and the outright capacities diminish slightly : you 're looking at 700 litres and 1,775 litres , respectively . Additionally , with all seven seats in situ , there 's 230 litres of stowage still available out back . <p> Six four-cylinder engines are offered in the Tiguan Allspace , these being a selection of TSI petrol and TDI diesel units . Power ranges from 150- up to 240hp on the BiTurbo 2.0-litre TDI range-topper , with both a seven-speed DSG auto and 4Motion all-wheel drive offered either optionally or as standard-fit across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1.4-litre TSI with Active Cylinder Technology and 150hp for the petrol opener , climbing through 180- and 220hp variants of the 2.0-litre TSI , while the 2.0-litre TDI with one turbocharger has either 150- or 190hp . Volkswagen quotes 6.0 litres/100km ( 47.1mpg ) and 135g/km CO2 for the 1.4 TSI manual , and 6.9 litres/100km ( 40.9mpg ) with 157g/km CO2 for the Tiguan Allspace TDI 4Motion 150hp , to give an idea on how frugal the range is . <p> Volkswagen has also introduced Discover Pro infotainment with Gesture Control , this latter tech a first for the Tiguan , and additional standard equipment on various trim lines - this does n't just apply to the Allspace , but to the regular Tiguan as well , though we 've not yet got a full picture of the Irish specifications .

The simple rule of thumb is that if you 're not doing mega-miles , then you are foolish to buy a diesel . You really need to be doing at least 20,000km a year to be able to make back , in savings on fuel , the price difference between a petrol and a diesel car . Let 's put it another way while it varies from model to model , the price gap between a new petrol car and a new diesel car is roughly in the order of 1,500 to 2,500 . That means that , for the price of a diesel car , you can have the same model with a slightly thirstier petrol engine and as much as two-and-a-half-grand to spend on fuel . That buys a lot of petrol . <p> The only way to bridge that gap is to be doing so much mileage every year that the extra frugality of a diesel engine , especially in long-haul , motorway driving , starts to claw back the difference . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 50km , though , that means most of us really shouldnt be buying a diesel engine . <p> Technology throws another spanner in the works with diesel particulate filters . These fine sieves , mounted in the exhaust pipe , are there to collect the fine particles of soot and carbon that diesel engines expel , and which are seriously hazardous to human health because they are carcinogenic . The filters gather the soot , stop it getting out to the atmosphere and then burn it off when the filter fills up . To do that , though , it needs heat , heat from the exhaust , heat which can only be generated by driving for a long time at main-road speeds . Those who only do short mileages , mostly around town , are n't  generating that kind of heat , and are eventually going to end up with a clogged exhaust filter . That can , sometimes , be cleared by taking the car for a long run down the motorway , but often it means replacing a damaged filter and that 's a big expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . In fact , if you 're buying a larger car , its really the only viable option as petrol engines and hybrids have n't yet caught up to the point where they can offer reasonable fuel economy in , say , a large executive saloon or a big SUV . <p> Smaller cars and modern petrol engines make a great combo though , and for instance Peugeot has just launched the new 5008 , a mid-size SUV , which has seven seats and uses a 1.2-litre 130hp petrol engine that provides adequate performance , decent fuel economy and low emissions . Its one of a growing band of practical family cars , using downsized petrol engines , which can provide diesel-style economy and emissions without the expense or the low-mileage penalty . <p> Hybrids offer another good route , and are especially well suited to those who do most of their driving in town . The latest version of the Toyota Prius , the new Kia Niro and Hyundai Ioniq all offer excellent low-speed refinement and actually usually use less fuel pottering around town than they do on the motorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even considering the fact that , in response to fears over urban pollution and public health , the government is likely to start cracking down on diesel in the next few years . The price of the fuel itself is likely to rise , and its possible that cities such as Dublin , Cork , and Galway may follow the examples of Paris , Madrid , Stuttgart , and Athens and begin banning older diesel engines from the city centres . The Department of Environment has just put out a consultation paper , inviting submissions from interested parties , on this very subject . <p> So , do n't  go for diesel by default . It still has its uses , and there are many fine diesel engines out there for those that need them . But make sure you 've sat down and done your sums before you go out to buy .

However , the car itself wo n't be completely unexpected . This is , in fact , the replacement for the Skoda Yeti crossover and it will be built on the same platform - and share a lot of its components with - the likes of the SEAT Ateca and Volkswagen Tiguan . It 's a five-seat SUV or crossover , basically , tasked with retaining loyal Yeti buyers without alienating the general population . <p> What will its rivals be ? <p> The Karoq will compete in the hottest segment in the market , that of compact SUVs - or crossovers . Underlining their popularity , three competitors to the new Skoda are in the top 10 for new car sales this year - the Hyundai Tucson , Nissan Qashqai and Kia Sportage . Those are undoubtedly the Karoq 's biggest rivals , though it also has to battle its cousins from within the Volkswagen Group , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention other notable alternatives such as the cool Toyota C-HR , the Renault Kadjar and Opel 's promising looking Grandland X model . <p> Any tech info ? <p> The Skoda Karoq will come with four driving modes by default - Eco , Normal , Sport and Individual ( customisable by the driver , as the name suggests ) - plus an Off-Road setting for versions fitted with four-wheel drive . These alter the power assisted steering , throttle response and , if fitted , the characteristics of the automatic transmission . The Off-Road mode also changes the stability control set-up to suit looser surfaces . Dynamic Chassis Control with adaptive dampers will be offered as an option at a later stage . <p> Inside , the Karoq can have the latest generation of Volkswagen Group infotainment systems fitted , including its 9.2-inch glass-fronted touchscreen system with satnav and even a wireless hotspot facility . On top of that , it will also be possible to replace the standard analogue instruments in front of the driver with a high-tech all-digital display . <p> What will the range be like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed , Skoda has developed five engines for the Karoq - two petrol and three diesel . The TSI petrol units are 1.0- and 1.5-litre in capacity , while the diesels are 1.6- and 2.0-litre TDI engines . Power outputs vary from 115hp to 190hp , the latter from a 2.0-litre diesel engine that is mated with four-wheel drive and Skoda 's seven-speed DSG automatic transmission as standard . Trim levels are likely to be called Ambition , Style and Active to start with . <p> Expectations ? <p> The Skoda Karoq is larger than the Yeti it replaces and comes with the latest infotainment and engine technology from the Volkswagen Group , so it 's sure to be a winner . Especially as this area of the market is very popular right now . Our only reservation is with the appearance . Hopefully the character of the Yeti has n't been totally lost .

Though it clearly takes its big bold expressive front-end design from Renault 's SUVs , such as the Kadjar and forthcoming Koleos , the Alaskan shares a lot of what 's underneath with the Nissan NP300 Navara pick-up , as part of the Renault-Nissan Alliance partnership . <p> What will its rivals be ? <p> The most obvious rival will be the Alaskan 's sister truck , the Nissan Navara , but there is no shortage of competition in the pick-up market now that sales of light commercial vehicles are buoyant once more . Other obvious alternatives to consider include the Ford Ranger , Mitsubishi 's L200 , the Toyota Hilux and Volkswagen 's Amarok , while buyers should also be aware of the new Fiat Fullback .

@@43825557 @3825557/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> Alfa Romeo 's first ever SUV . A decade ago that might have been radical and opinion-dividing , but now it probably elicits the response " what took so long ? " The Stelvio is named after the highest mountain pass in Italy and the name of the road that traverses it , complete with its over 75 hairpin turns . That hints at how Alfa Romeo would like its SUV to be seen . At the time of writing , Alfa has only released details of two high-performance petrol versions of the Stelvio , but diesel powered variants will make up the majority of sales . <p> What will its rivals be ? <p> Although pricing for the Stelvio has yet to be announced , it 's expected to compete with the premium mid-size SUVs on the market . That means the Audi Q5 , BMW X3 and X4 , Jaguar 's F-Pace , the Mercedes-Benz GLC and even Porsche 's Macan . The Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport should also be considered to be alternative options . <p> Any tech info @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stelvio , called the Quadrifoglio , it released details of its new Chassis Domain Control ( CDC ) system , labelling it the ' brain ' of the car that coordinates all the car 's electronic sub-systems , such as the new DNA Pro selector , the Q4 all-wheel drive , the torque vectoring system , the active suspension and the ESC stability control . Basically it centralises control for the chassis , powertrain , suspension system , braking system , steering , power steering and differential to help with cornering and safety . Not all of those sub-systems are expected on all versions of the Stelvio . <p> What will the range be like ? <p> We 're going to have to do a small bit of guesswork here as Alfa has n't told us anything about the likely big sellers in the range - the diesels . Taking the Giulia saloon as a starting point , we expect to see 150 , 180 and 210hp versions powered by the company 's 2.2-litre diesel engine , mated as standard to an eight-speed automatic transmission and , we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol model with 280hp , initially offered as a ' First Edition ' that is crammed with equipment , and the fire-breathing Quadrifoglio version . The latter features a 2.9-litre twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine drawing ' inspiration from Ferrari technologies and technical know-how ' producing a massive 510hp . <p> Expectations ? <p> We love the look of the Stelvio and there 's undoubtedly an increase in sales of such models , but it has to contend with a lot of rivals , many from marques that are well-established in the market as makers of premium SUVs .

It 's still a seven-seat car , but it now takes the shape of an SUV rather than that of an MPV , as its predecessor did . In spite of that , the new 5008 is no higher than the old one , though it is considerably longer and wider , to the benefit of interior space and the car 's design . We think it really looks the part and it 's tasked with bringing the Peugeot brand as a whole further upmarket . <p> What will its rivals be ? <p> That 's not yet very easy to answer , as Peugeot has n't released pricing and there are plenty of hints that it 'll be more than the old car , which makes sense given its new positioning .

As before , a dinky steering wheel is used and the main instruments are located nearer the windscreen and viewed above the rim of the steering wheel , but for the 5008 it has been reinvented with a high-resolution and customisable 12.3-inch digital head-up display taking the place of traditional instruments . That 's complemented by an eight-inch touchscreen in the centre of the dashboard , which features seven tactile switches underneath to shortcut to various systems .

At the top of the line-up will be GT Line and GT models , loaded to the gunwales with equipment . <p> Expectations ? <p> If the new Peugeot5008 drives as well as it looks then the French company will be onto a winner . The only potential worry is its likely higher pricing than before . The current 5008 is claimed to be the best-selling compact seven-seat MPV of 2016 , so the new car has a lot to live up to .

@@43825567 @3825567/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> Its a time of year when a great many of us are thinking of trading in or trading up , but to make sure you 're getting the best value for money , you need to make sure that the car you 're moving on from is ready to move on , so to speak . In other words , here are some hints and tips for helping you get the best bang for your resale buck <p> 1 . Clean it . No , really clean it lots . There is nothing that looks worse than a dirty car , inside and out , and nothing that improves the looks of a car so quickly and so affordably as giving it a good clean . Obviously this is the sort of thing that you can do on your own driveway with a bucket , sponge and vacuum cleaner , but to be honest , you might be better off leaving this one to the pros . A good valet will cost around 40 , but it ensures that your car will be spotless inside and out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a trade-in , or when a prospective buyer is coming round to see it , then you 'll get that 40 back several times over . Do n't  forget to keep it cleaned and tidy inside on successive days if you have a number of people lined up to view it . <p> 2 . Make sure the paperwork is in order , and make sure you have everything to hand . Put yourself in the mind of a prospective buyer . If you were on the other side of the deal , what would you want to see ? Youd want to see a thick sheaf of service records , of receipts for maintenance and repairs , tyres and tax and youd want the cars ownership document the registration certificate , complete with the Part B form that must be filled in and sent to Shannon on foot of a sale . Be ready to produce any document related to the car , and do n't  let yourself get caught searching through random drawers looking for stuff . <p> 3 . Make sure the car is in good condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now what about the car itself . Any dents , dings or big scratches ? Probably worth having them looked at ; again probably best to leave it to a professional . Small stone-chips etc. are probably unlikely to be an issue if the rest of the car is in good fettle , but no harm in getting them touched up . Check the interior to make sure there are no rips in fabric , or loose panels of trim dangling down and make sure all of the vehicles keys are present and correct . Any blown bulbs should be replaced and check the tyres to make sure that at the very least they have legal tread depth and that they 're inflated to the correct pressure . Make sure oil , brake fluid and power steering fluid are all topped up and at their correct levels too , because those are areas any self-respecting buyer will check too . <p> 4 . If the NCT is up soon on the car , consider booking in for an early test as its no harm at all to be able to dangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can have your car inspected and passed up to 90 days before the test is officially due , so keep that in mind . <p> 5 . It could be worth having your own history check done with a service such as Cartell.ie . While many buyers these days check a cars history as a matter of course , its no bad thing to be able to produce your own report to show that the car has a clean bill of health . On that subject , if possible try to make sure that any outstanding finance payments owing on the car have been cleared as that 's a major worry for many buyers . <p> 6 . Finally , find a nice clean background against which to take lots of photos of your car for your Carzone advert . Remember buyers like to see crisp , clear photos ( any decent smartphone , with a bit of practice , can take perfectly good shots ) and theyll want to see things such as the back seats , the boot and a close up of the instrument panel to show the mileage .

You 'll notice that while it has some of the same hallmarks of the old car - like that dropped roofline aft of the C-pillar and a set of roof rails - it 's quite a bit different to its precursor , courtesy of a chunky black front bumper , squared-off headlight clusters and really big rear lamp clusters . New colours for the body include Island Blue metallic and Chestnut ( this is very , very brown ) , and take a note of the arrow-shaped side indicator housings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means MINI is claiming this new Countryman is a ' fully-fledged ' five-seater , rather than a ' 4+1 ' masquerading as a full-sized machine . But hold your horses , as there are another two seats available on the Picnic Bench , which folds down from the tailgate . Nifty . Anyway , returning to the regular seating , the back chairs can all slide forwards and backwards by up to 130mm , their backrests split 40:20:40 and behind them is a boot that starts at 450 litres and rises to 1,309 litres - in that instance , it 's fully 220 litres more capacious than the old Countryman . <p> The new Countryman will come with an automated tailgate as an option , too , which can even be opened and closed in contactless fashion , while the high-quality interior features a strong horizontal design that 's specific to the Countryman .

Otherwise , your Countryman is as front-wheel drive as any other MINI . The marque says this all-wheel drive technology is more compact and internally efficient than before . <p> As the Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 name attests , the part-electric off-roading MINI is pretty powerful . In fact , MINI has decided to keep this drivetrain - borrowed from the BMW 225xe Active Tourer - exactly as is , meaning with 224hp it out-punches all the conventionally powered Countryman models at launch ; and its 385Nm is only out-torqued by the Cooper SD 's 2.0-litre diesel unit ( 400Nm ) .

The SD Countryman gets the eight-ratio unit as standard . MINI has n't given a full range rundown on the performance or eco-stats , but does cite one or two figures to give an indication of the Countryman 's prowess .

@@43825589 @3825589/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> Of course you should , is the short answer . Pre-registering , the process by which a car maker , importer or dealer registers cars to themselves in order to inflate their overall sales figures , is perhaps less prevalent now than it was a couple of years ago . Back during the depths of the recession , it was suggested that as many as a third of new car registrations at certain times of the year were pre-registered and plonked on dealer forecourts as nearly new. Anything to keep the sales numbers buoyant . <p> The upside to all of that is that you can bag yourself a bargain new car . Pre-reg cars are essentially brand new , usually come with barely any more than delivery mileage and can often be discounted by as much as 5,000 , depending on the car in question . In many ways , its a no-brainer , but you do still need to follow a few careful rules to make sure you 're getting the right car . <p> 1 . Inspect the specification <p> Its a temptation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic model , as that 's going to be the least expensive one for them to register and pay the VRT and VAT on , so check any nearly-new car carefully to make sure that it has the sort of equipment that you want . Its probably OK to compromise on a couple of items to save some money , but you need to weigh that decision up carefully , as do n't  forget , you 're going to be living with this car for a good while . <p> 2 . Check it like its a used car <p> Do n't  assume that a dealer demo or nearly-new car has simply been sitting in the corner of the forecourt gathering dust . Anything with a reg plate on it is liable to be used by the dealer in question either as a test car for potential customers or as an office dogsbody for running errands . So make sure you go through the car with a fine-tooth comb looking for any potential damage or defects . <p> 3 . Get your timing right <p> Pre-registering takes place in three waves towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarter and towards the end of the year . Those are the times when the greatest amount of cars are going to be pre-registered , so if you get your timing just right , you 'll be able to snap up a proper bargain . To get the most amount of choice , go shopping on the first day after the end of the month or the quarter ( especially March in Ireland , when the all-important first quarter registrations are totted up ) . If its more of a bargain you want , you need to box a little cleverer . Leave it until about a month after the end of the first quarter and then pounce its a higher-risk strategy in terms of there being available cars , but you might catch a dealer who 's sick of the sight of a specific car and they might be willing to do a sharper deal to get shot of it . <p> 4 . Do n't  be talked round <p> Incidentally , were talking here about someone being determined to get themselves a bargain by buying a pre-reg car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or second hand , allow yourself to be talked into buying a pre-reg that you just do n't  want . It can be very easy to get tempted into a car that you actually did n't require nor need , simply because of the apparent bargain on offer . <p> 5 . Watch the depreciation <p> Depreciation is a fickle thing , especially in Ireland with our highly-visible vehicle ages stamped on our number plates . It is true that a car registered on the 30th of June with a 161 plate will be worth fractionally less than one registered the day after with a 162 plate , but the difference should be pretty tiny as long as you 're keeping the car for more than just a few months . Overall though , pre-registering can drive down second hand values of all cars , as if there 's a glut of one particular model or make , it can push prices down even for those who did n't  buy pre-reg versions . Just remember that there 's no such thing as a free lunch , and that by getting the discount for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve already , if for no other reason than that technically you 're now the second owner . <p> 6 . Make sure that the dealership is up front <p> If a car is advertised as nearly-new or dealer demo just be brazen and ask if the car was a pre-reg . If the dealer admits it , then ( a ) you 're onto a potentially better bargain as you know for a fact that the quicker the dealer offloads the car the better it is for him and ( b ) you 'll know that they 're honest . If they harrumph and spin tales , then you know that they 're not . <p> 7 . Make sure the warranty is solid <p> Of course , a pre-reg car should have no issues with its warranty , as its effectively still a new car and three years is generally the minimum warranty anyone offers . Make sure you check before driving away that all the terms and conditions have been satisfied though . With some car companies warranties , its the car that 's covered regardless of who 's name is on the registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the owners name , so make sure , in that case , that the warranty transfers to you .

Make a booking over the phone , drop your car off , pick it up later that day all shiny and perfect . <p> The first thing to remember is to actually get your car serviced at all . As a nation , were not the best when it comes to vehicle maintenance , and there are a worrying number of cars out there with holes and gaps in their service history . For some reason , were culturally averse to spending money on our cars once we have them bought . This is , of course , pure folly whatever you spend servicing your car , no matter how much , it will always amount to a saving in the long run . As with so many things in life , prevention is better than cure . <p> If that 's not enough to convince you , then perhaps cold , hard cash in your hand will . Research ( from Cartell.ie incidentally ) has shown that a full service history , especially a main dealer one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by as much as 1,750 . With depreciation being the single biggest cost of motoring , that 's a significant amount of money put back into your account . <p> For those who simply do n't  know when their car needs to be serviced , there are some simple answers . Many cars will actually tell you flashing up a notice in the dashboard that a service is imminent . BMW and MINI started this trend , and its spreading to other car makers , with some even including a monthly count-down . The growing number of smartphone apps that can remotely connect to your car can also help you keep a track of the service record . <p> For the rest , its still pretty simple and comes back to the oldest advice in motoring : read the manual . Every cars owner 's manual will tell you when a service is needed , so simply look it up in the index and check the mileage . Of course , there 's an even easier way to tell . Simply look at the calendar . If its been a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it booked in even for low mileage drivers this is a good idea , and really only those covering exceptionally high mileages will need to have their car in more frequently than that . Some car makers reckon you can stretch servicing intervals to two years or even more sometimes , but that just does n't  sound like good practice to us . An annual inspection is best . <p> As for price , that will vary enormously depending on the car you drive and the dealer to whom you bring it . Obviously , a main , franchised dealer will be more expensive than a small back-street operation , and a premium-badge dealer more so again , but that does n't  mean you should avoid one and go for the other . The age-old advice of shopping around is still good advice to follow , and while a main dealer will be more expensive , there can be fringe benefits such as having them collect and drop back your car , or at the very least a complimentary taxi to work and back . <p> Generally , while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serviced with a main dealer for that brand , and the growing number of service inclusive plans means that you can pay ahead for those services , and even add the cost of them to your Personal Contract Plan or Hire Purchase payments , making it even more painless . Once out of warranty , it could well be time to start looking for a good independent garage , but be sure to ask around and find out which are the best ones in your area . <p> Incidentally , its a good idea to be wary of the growing number of fixed price services available . These are helpful , in budgeting terms , but they do mean that the garage is generally sticking to a rigid , and brief , procedure for each car , so there wo n't necessarily be time to have your cars inspected for any issues beyond the usual fluids and filters . Yes , fixed-price servicing can save you both money and headaches , but its easy for issues with the car to be missed , which can mean bigger expense down the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're getting the service you need . Do n't  be afraid or embarrassed to ask questions , and do n't  take back the car until you 're happy with what 's been done .

The outgoing car is a little cramped inside and it ca n't match its rivals for technology or perceived cabin quality , yet it continues to top the sales charts for superminis in Ireland . That is undoubtedly thanks in part to massive brand loyalty and the excellent Ford dealer network , but we reckon it 's also due to the fact that the Fiesta remains the most fun of all superminis to drive .

Thanks to the big VW badge on the front , it comes with instant , classless kudos that somehow distances it from other models in the supermini sector . As with the Skoda , the Polo line-up is wide , with three- and five-door body shells , power outputs between 60- and 150hp , manual or automatic transmissions , three different core petrol engine and a super-frugal diesel .

The rear doors open wide , all passengers sit quite upright ( it 's easy to get in and out of the seats , which is why it appeals to the elderly , I guess ) and there 's a big boot out back . On top of that , the rear seating is called Magic Seats , with a unique cushion folding trick that allows the carrying of long , tall objects where most cars of this size can not . <p> 5 - Mazda2 <p> In reality , the supermini market is quite fragmented now , with some buyers driven purely by PCP rates and low purchase prices , while another group are more interested in chic design and high-end technology and equipment .

@@43825603 @3825603/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> We have all watched in horror as the price of insurance has sky-rocketed in Ireland in the past year , and many of us are now paying as much as double our old premiums . The situation is bleak , with the government stalling on putting measures in place to bring premiums back down , but in the meantime there are things you can do to get your insurance costs down to manageable levels . <p> 1 . Who are you ? <p> Are you a learner driver with your own policy ? Well get the test done and passed as quick as you can , as nothing brings down the cost of insurance like getting your full licence . Are you under the age of 30 ? Well , there 's not much you can do about that , of course , but for those of us approaching the big 3-0 , the good news is that insurance starts getting much cheaper once you 're out of your twenties . For those still under 25 , just hang in there , we feel your pain . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses , Gardaf and people who are on shift work can often find that their premiums are higher because they are judged as driving at unsociable hours . <p> 2 . What are you driving ? <p> The Irish insurance industry is sadly far more opaque than that of the UK and other countries , and we still do n't  have a transparent insurance grouping system for cars that would help people to choose their wheels on the basis of likely insurance costs . In the continued absence of that , there are a few tips for getting a car with minimal insurance costs . Basically , these boil down to the newest car possible with the smallest engine possible . If you 're under 30 , realistically , you need to be sticking to an engine of between 1.0- and 1.2-litre capacity . If your car is more than 10-14 years old , you 're going to either be refused insurance outright or simply given a totally unaffordable quote , as Irish insurers have decided that older vehicles carry an unhealthy level of risk . You also need to avoid anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random S in the cars name or trim level can be enough to start the premium loading , so buy carefully in that regard . Your best bet is probably a five-year old Toyota Yaris 1.0-litre to be honest . <p> 3 . Take an advanced driving course <p> This is a good idea anyway , as anything that increases your skill level behind the wheel helps to keep you and your fellow road users safer , but you need to check with your insurer first to make sure that they will actually give you a meaningful discount for taking and passing an advanced course . Many Irish insurers still do n't  recognise such courses , in spite of their proven results . <p> 4 . Cut your mileage , up your excess <p> Reducing your annual mileage can bring down your premium a little , as quite simply less time on the road means you 're exposed to less risk . If your average annual mileage is less than 5,000km then you 're on to a winner . Choosing to pay more excess in the event of damage to your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but just remember that it means some small prangs will be pointless to claim for . <p> 5 . Use your garage <p> If you 're lucky enough to have a garage , then its a good idea to clear out all the junk from within and start parking your actual car in it , especially overnight . For anyone with a fully comprehensive or third party , fire and theft policy that can trigger some significant savings . <p> 6 . Consider a black box <p> Many insurance companies are now offering significant discounts to those who fit their cars with a black box , which monitors their driving and issues monthly reports . Its a good way to stop yourself exceeding the speed limit and it also encourages smoother , more careful driving . It does , to our minds , rather offer a get-out clause on better driver training and it is something of a sinister spy-in-the-cab , but for younger drivers especially , fitting one may be the only route to affordable insurance . <p> 7 . Shop around <p> A terrible old clichT , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play one insurer off against the other the better the premium you will get . Never ever simply sign a renewal form and send it back , as insurers admit they artificially pad renewal quotes in the expectation that people will ask for a discount . Make the best use of the internet to research the best possible deals . Its also well worth getting friendly with a good local insurance broker , as often they have access to deals that you wont be able to find yourself . <p> 8 . Do n't  add extra people to your policy <p> Its always a good idea to encourage others to have their own insurance policy , and even if it ends up being a bit more painful for them , its certainly going to save your potentially hundreds on your own costs . Time to get those sponging teenagers to move out , eh ? <p> 9 . Do n't  pay by the month <p> Most policies can now be paid for in monthly instalments , but in general this is a bad idea . There are no zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premium is , you 're going to pay more to pay it monthly . Its better then , as much as is possible , to pay it all up front . If you cant , its worth looking at the idea of getting a zero per cent credit card solely for the purpose of paying the policy , making sure that you clear the debt before any extra charges kick in . <p> 10 . Move ? <p> With average Irish insurance prices now well north of 1,000 a year , why not move to Northern Ireland where they 're around a quarter of that ? With the weakened Pound now could be just the time to buy a nice flat in Belfast and start long-haul commuting to work . Well , its an idea anyway 
@@43825604 @3825604/ 36615 @qwx446615 <p> Well , 2015 was a pretty good year for the Irish car industry , which saw a certain amount of shrugging off of the sack cloth and ashes of recession , and which saw sales peak at nearly 125,000 units through the year - a healthy number . This year , it 's been predicted that sales could reach a very healthy number of 150,000 , but data experts at Cartell.ie reckon that it could go even higher . <p> The conclusion is based on the potential for a large number of older vehicles to be scrapped and removed from the national car park . Now , the maths on this is a touch complicated , but basically , what Cartell.ie is saying is that , thanks to the bumper car sales Ireland enjoyed in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 , there are a huge number of those cars up for retirement and a trip to the breakers this year . That retirement is being driven by a number of factors , not least that many of those cars will now be outside their original anti-perforation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resale values and the high cost of parts and labour , relative to the values of these cars , will also be factors , as will the number of very attractive ' scrappage ' offers that dealers currently have in place . <p> In fact , Cartell.ie expects that as many as 130,000 older cars could be taken off the road this year , potentially driving a huge segment of the market back into dealers for something shiny and new . <p> John Byrne , of Cartell.ie , says : " If the industry is predicting new car sales of 150,000 units in 2016 based on existing levels of growth , demand , and natural market attrition , we would say that number could be even higher based on this research . We expect thousands more cars will retire from the fleet this year compared to last year and this leaves an opportunity for significantly improved new car sales - as owners shuffle up the market into newer vehicles . Obviously time will tell if the industry can capitalise on the opportunity these numbers present . "

Nonetheless , there 's a huge amount of hype surrounding the car , as there always is for new Type R Hondas , denoted by their red ' H ' badges . The new car has some pretty big shoes to fill , as the outgoing Type R was an animal of a hot hatch . Enthusiasts will be hoping for more of the same , while some will hope the image is calmed down somewhat . <p> What will its rivals be ? <p> That 's an easy one , though the hot hatch sector has burgeoned in recent years and there are almost two different categories within the C-segment . On one side there are restrained looking options with up to 250hp , such as the Ford Focus ST and Volkswagen Golf GTI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astra OPC , Megane RS and SEAT Leon Cupra . All of those employ front-wheel drive . On the other side of the equation are the four-wheel drive super hatches , such as the Ford Focus RS , Volkswagen Golf R and Mercedes-AMG A 45 . The Civic Type R , though expected to retain front-wheel drive , is likely to be as powerful and priced on a par with the latter cars and it 'll probably appeal more to those that really love driving rather than those that want their hot hatch to double up as a family car . <p> Any tech info ? <p> None confirmed , as mentioned above , but we can take some clues from the concept version revealed at the Paris Motor Show last year . The rather tacked-on appearance of the old car 's aerodynamic package has been considerably refined and now adds muscle to the shape of the five-door Civic in a good and much more cohesive way . The concept 's aerodynamic add-ons are all made of carbon fibre too , in a bid to keep weight gain down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the production model . Intriguingly , the show car featured three centrally-mounted exhaust outlets and Honda let slip that they were all functional , so it clearly has some new engine tricks up its sleeves . <p> What will the range be like ? <p> Pretty limited as ever , and with pricing expected to be north of 50,000 it 'll not be a big seller in Ireland . There 's likely to be a single 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol option , a six-speed manual gearbox and perhaps two different trim levels . It 's an outside possibility that Honda will offer a dual-clutch automatic transmission too . <p> Expectations ? <p> We have high hopes for the next generation Civic Type R. Our main gripes with the old one concern its extreme appearance and suspension that is just too firm , even in its ' softest ' setting . It looks like Honda has addressed the design of the car so we can only hope it has breathed new live on the chassis too .

As if the fines ( and the shame ) werent bad enough , we get to have these scarlet letters ( numbers , actually ) branded on our licences as a reminder of what we did wrong , and a warning not to do it again . <p> Of course , it really is all for our own good , no matter how painful , and the points system is part of the Road Safety Authoritys Closing The Gap strategy , which , by 2020 , is intended to bring Irelands road safety standards up to the same level as those of the UK , Sweden and The Netherlands , all of which set the bar for driving excellence . <p> " The penalty points system has proved to have been an effective deterrent in changing road users behaviour for the better over the past decade .

Speeding carries the same penalties ( although you get fined more for speeding than you do for using a phone ) , as does driving without a seatbelt . <p> Do n't  forget , if you run up 12 points ( or seven points if you 're on a learner 's permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its easier to run up points than you might imagine . Everyone knows the speeding , drinking , seatbelt and phone points , but there are a myriad of other offences that will add up the points pretty quickly . The most serious are failure to have a current NCT , incorrect or illegal number plates , or no number plate at all , parking in a dangerous position , failure to stop for a stop or yield sign , dangerous overtaking , crossing a continuous white line , failure to observe traffic lights , tailgating , plus improper use and or non-use of correct child safety seats and restraints , all of which will get you three points on the spot , rising to five points in the case of a conviction . <p> Offences that will get you two points on your licence include not having a qualified driver with you when you 're a learner , failure to display L- or N-plates , making an illegal U-turn , failure to comply with traffic signs , failure to stop for a Garda ( or a school warden , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable consideration. <p> One-point offences include proceeding beyond a no-entry sign , driving over ghost islands or angled hatch lines , driving on the motorway in a vehicle that cant get above 50km/h , reversing from a minor road onto a main road , driving on a footpath or cycle path , going the wrong way up a one-way street , or driving an over-weight vehicle . <p> If your blood alcohol level is between 50mg and 80mg ( 50mg is the legal limit ) and commit any of the offences on the penalty point list , then therell be an extra three points added on . <p> All the data for penalty points is available on the Road Safety Authoritys website and its well worth reading up , if for no other reason than to remind yourself to be careful and attentive when behind the wheel .

@@43825612 @3825612/ <p> We try to give a range of price options in our Top 5s , so let 's kick off with an early model , pre-2008 . Unless you 're doing high mileage , then you 're better off sticking to petrol power anyway , so the 1.6-litre petrol Touran is probably a better option at this age than the 1.9 TDI version . Regardless of what 's under the bonnet , what matters here is the interior of the car . There are seven-seat versions of the Touran , but even the five-seat variant has space in the second row of seating for three child seats . That 's because the seating is separated into three distinct chairs that slide and recline as needs be . It 's a real star for family buyers that do n't want a huge car . <p> Not many people know that the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate was available from new with the option of an extra pair of seats . These were rear-facing in design , popping up out of the boot floor and engineered to accommodate two children , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all passengers , obviously , but gives family buyers with three children and an aversion to people carriers something else to consider . The only snag is that there do n't seem to be load of examples on the market with the seven-seat option so dig around and make sure the car you 're looking at has it before you part with your cash . <p> At the other end of the " I really care about my image " scale to the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate above is something like the Hyundai Montana . Let 's not beat about the bush ; it 's a minibus , based on the underpinnings of the Hyundai H1 van . You may ' only ' have three children to cart around , but what that means is that they have friends that may want a lift to GAA/rugby/cricket every now and then , or that they 'll want to bring their bikes to the woods or you 'll all want to travel to the airport together with enough luggage for two weeks in the sun . Only a car as large as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are other makes and models with eight seats and a huge interior , but the Hyundai is probably the best value on the used market . <p> Ok , we 'll accept that the majority of parents with three kids will probably be horrified by the prospect of having to drive something based on a van , even those that do n't care so much for image or status . In reality , the best all-round option that 'll suit all needs is a genuine seven-seat people carrier and one of the very best is the SEAT Alhambra . It 's well-made , very comfortable , spacious , well thought out and it has sliding doors on each side to allow access to the rear of the cabin . Believe us : if you have small children and you 've experienced sliding doors you 'll never look back . <p> If you 're in the position to buy a new , or nearly new , car , and you like the sound of the Volkswagen Touran , another good option is the Kia Carens .

It has never really been what we 'd call the best car in the segment though . Until now . Launched in 2015 , the current Astra really is a revelation . It has a lovely looking , well-designed interior that is also spacious front and back . The engines range from the surprisingly perky and refined 1.0-litre turbo petrol to a fast 1.4-litre petrol alternative and , of course , a 1.6-litre diesel engine , the most popular option - if not the cheapest .

It probably wo n't get cold enough for snow this year , but there will almost certainly be some frost and ice and if the temperature is regularly dropping below seven degrees Celsius then its well worth considering investing in some winter or all-season tyres .

If anythings not working or blown , it might not be as expensive as you think to get fixed an average car bulb costs only around 10-15 and most motor factors will fit them for you , saving you a few scraped knuckles and a heap of frustration .

Time <p> It sounds obvious , but allow extra time for all your journeys in the next couple of weeks . Whether its people crowding into the shops on the 23rd for that last-minute gift search or families on their way to visit relatives on Stephens Day then the roads are going to be busy , town centres are going to be bottle-necked and car parks are going to fill up quick . If you 're going into town , plan to go either early or late to avoid the crush , and if you 're planning to go cross country then you will really need to allow an extra hour or so on a long haul . Be patient . Bring lots of audiobooks or good music ( see above ) and maybe even a flask of tea in case the tail-backs get really bad . <p> 4 .

If you 're , sensibly , leaving the car parked up overnight and enjoying yourself then maybe think about buying a personal breathalyser . No-one wants to get caught with morning-after booze in their blood when they 've been conscientious enough to leave the car last night . Other than that , be careful and be sensible drink driving is stupid at any time of the year , but a tragedy at Christmas would be worst of all . <p> 5 .

Phrases such as one lady owner or one careful owner are these days redundant and just make you sound like a dodgy car dealer from the 1980s . <p> 7 .

All it takes is a wander around the paddock at your nearest classic car run , a few glimpses of old-school chrome and the whiff of well-used leather , or the smell of warm , aged oil ( its a very distinctive smell ) you 're hooked . Classic car ownership is a bit like a drug ; once you 've tried it , its easy to become hooked , and youll always , always have the craving in your veins . Like drugs , it can also be catastrophically expensive <p> Should you do it , though ? Should you take the plunge and trade in your bland , diesel box with wheels for something a bit more fun , a lot more stylish ? Something that Grace Kelly might have happily been seen in ? <p> Yes , you should , but you really , really need to do your homework and make sure you go into classic car ownership with your eyes wide open . Go in with rose-tinted glasses already in place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are certain benefits to owning a classic car . For a start , they 're cheap to import anything that 's over 30 years old can be brought in for a flat Vehicle Registration Tax fee of just 200 . And theyll only cost you 56 a year for a tax disc . <p> Cheap to insure too , which is fast becoming a major financial incentive to buying an older car . With insurance premiums for normal cars still rising fast , now could be the right time to snap up that old pile of rust and chrome . Ah , about that Irish insurers are nothing if not rapacious , and unlike their more enlightened counterparts in the UK , they do n't  just hand out classic car insurance without some penalty . <p> You see , unlike in the UK , where you can insure a classic as your only car , Irish insurers demand that you only cover very low mileages , sometimes as little as 5,000km a year , and worse ; that you have another normal car taxed and insured for more regular use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only in Ireland , eh ? <p> You 'll also have to consider what fuel you 're using . Precious few classics can be found with a diesel engine ( although we do know a guy who converted his BMW 1602 to run a Ford 2.3 diesel , but that 's another story ) , so you 're going to have to either have the engines head converted to run on unleaded fuel ( many mainstream classics will have had this done some time ago ) or resort to carrying around a bottle of fuel additive for each time you fill up . <p> The parts and spares situation will depend greatly on which model you decide to go for . For a great many cars , there is pretty much full parts backup now , with popular models such as the MGB , Mini , Morris Minor and more actually available with freshly-made body shells , allowing you to effectively create a new car from the ground up , if you like . For more expensive models , parts can be re-made from original drawings , frequently by the original factory as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Jaguar , Land Rover , Mercedes-Benz and Porsche all have big , and very profitable , classic car departments as part of their main factory operations , allowing you to get pretty much anything you need , for a hefty price in most cases . Jaguar and Land Rover are currently in the process of effectively re-starting production of classic models such as the Series 1 Range Rover and the E-Type , taking in original cars and rebuilding them using factory-spec parts , to better-than-new standard . The prices will make your eyes water , though <p> Speaking of prices , there is a temptation to enter classic car ownership assuming that you cant lose , financially . Its true that classic car prices have been climbing at ridiculous rates . For instance , an Aston Martin DB5 , which could have been bought for around 40,000 in the early nineties , would now set you back at minimum ten times as much , and other cars have seen similarly massive price hikes . " The initial tipping point for the current price boom was definitely 2008 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coys Auctioneers . " Money was still about but it had nowhere reliable to go . Did it go into the stock market ? No , that was on its knees . Did it go into an apartment in Docklands ? No , property was tumbling . Or did it buy an old Ferrari ? Yes Fine art , fine wine and fine motor cars became seen as something if a safe haven because every other option was dead . " <p> The market has been , according to all but a few observers , well and truly over-inflated for some time . As long as interest rates stay low , then classic car prices will probably keep rising , but as soon as the rates the banks pay go up , then well probably see the bubble burst . <p> That 's why its best to buy for enjoyment , and a little nostalgia . Buy a car that makes you excited , rather than one you think might appreciate .

Whereas I was keen on cars from the sixties and early seventies , cars that were around and that I drooled about when I was a kid . Now you see the same thing happening all over again , with younger enthusiasts getting all excited about cars from the eighties , which did n't  seem to be that special in my book at the time they were around . So I do n't  think its an image problem as such , but you just have generation gaps between the various classic car lovers . Each to their own era , I should say .

The name might sound familiar , but the 3008 has changed significantly and Peugeot hopes to take a big bite out of the C-SUV segment . It 's a busy market though , with new and impressive additions including the Ford Edge , Hyundai Tucson and Volkswagen Tiguan . By completely redesigning the 3008 , Peugeot hopes to steal buyers away from some of those , helped not only by the new car 's stylish looks , but also by high levels of standard equipment . <p> Given just how much of a departure this new Peugeot3008 is from the outgoing model that bore the same name there 's less relevance in examining the differences . Nonetheless , it is 8cm longer , but remains the same width as before at 1.84m , while overall height has been reduced to 1.62m ( from 1.63m ) . The ground clearance remains at 22cm . <p> A vertical front-end and large bonnet area help to give the 3008 greater presence . This is carried along the flanks where a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumpers , around the wheel arches and along the base of the doors add to a beefier look . Alloy wheels measuring 18 inches in diameter ensure those arches do n't appear too empty either . A painted C-pillar adds to the look of a floating roofline . <p> Styling clues such as the ' three claw ' tail lights are familiar to other models in the current range such as the Peugeot 208 and the recently updated 2008 crossover . The lion badge takes pride of place in the centre of the grille , which is flanked by sleek halogen headlamps . Buyers will be able to specify a gloss black roof as well as full LED headlights . <p> All 3008 models , regardless of specification grade , will come with the high-resolution 12.3-inch digital dashboard display . Capable of five different display modes , it also uses some very impressive , if at times quite abstract , graphics to relay all the relevant information to the driver . <p> In addition to this there will be an eight-inch colour touch screen that will host all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . In an evolution from a similar system already employed in some of the PSA Group cars , this will now utilise six shortcut buttons at its base . <p> The back seats provide comfortable seating for three and can be folded flat to increase boot capacity from the standard 520 litres ( up 90 litres over the previous 3008 ) to 1,580 litres . Peugeot also claims that the boot loading level is one of the lowest in the segment . <p> Peugeot will offer some familiar engines in the 3008 's line-up including a 130hp version of its 1.2-litre PureTech petrol unit . This will come with a choice of six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmissions . A more powerful 1.6-litre THP petrol engine , with 165hp , will also be offered , although this will only be available with a six-speed automatic and will see emissions rated at 129g/km , which will mean an annual motor tax cost of 270 . <p> Likely to be of more interest to Irish buyers will be the diesel engine range . This will start off with two versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120hp with emissions remaining at a tax-friendly 100- and 121g/km respectively . Two punchier 2.0-litre diesel engines are also going to be available with 150- and 180hp . <p> Despite the SUV appearance , the 3008 will remain solely a front-wheel drive car . Peugeot will offer its Advanced Grip Control system , which is an enhanced form of traction control . This system will also provide a Hill Assist Descent Control ( HADC ) function that enables the 3008 to automatically control its pace when driving down steep slopes , leaving the driver to only focus on steering . <p> The Peugeot3008 will make its public debut at the Paris Motor Show in September .

The new name is reflected by many significant changes that will set this car apart from its predecessor . A total of 175kg has been shaved from the weight despite an increase size , so we expect it to perform well in terms of fuel economy and emissions - something the existing Insignia already excelled at . <p> The change of name to the Insignia Grand Sport represents the car 's more athletic appearance . Its bodywork appears to be much tauter than before , with overall length remaining mostly the same . It is the roofline , now 29mm lower , and track at 11mm wider , that add to its more dynamic shape .

New headlights play a bigger part in shaping the face of the Insignia Grand Sport , and like the recently launched Opel Mokka X include a ' double wing ' design in the LED daytime running lamps . <p> Like its predecessor , Opel 's new flagship saloon will feature distinctive surface treatments along the side , including something that Opel 's Vice President of Design , Mark Adams , calls a " sweepspear " that runs through the doors to give it a more poised stance . At the rear , slimmer but wider tail lights wrap around and feature a similar ' double wing ' light signature . <p> Inside , the new cabin has a familiar feel to it . Drivers will sit 3cm lower than in the current Insignia and the dashboard has been made more driver-centric . There is a cleaner look to the dashboard too , with fewer buttons , which is helped by larger infotainment screens - of up to eight inches . The latest IntelliLink infotainment system also links in with Opel 's OnStar connected services . There will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sale later next year , but , as these first images show , range-topping models will be offered with options like two-tone leather upholstery and piano black inserts . <p> The full range of engine options for the Insignia Grand Sport has yet to be revealed , but it is likely to feature versions of the company 's 1.6- and 2.0-litre diesels and possibly the 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engine . At this stage , it is not known if Opel will develop a more powerful version of the 1.0-litre petrol engine from the Astra for the Insignia . <p> Both automatic and manual transmissions will be available , as well as Opel 's latest all-wheel drive system . This features two electrically controlled multi-plate clutches in the rear axle to give the Insignia Grand Sport all-wheel drive with torque vectoring . During cornering , this system can transmit additional torque to the outside rear wheel to improve traction . <p> In a bid to keep ahead of the competition , Opel will offer plenty of high-tech options in the Insignia Grand Sport . New IntelliLux LED matrix headlights will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt to multiple traffic situations .

Also joining the fold is the 340hp/450Nm supercharged 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine , this unit coming across from cars like Jaguar 's entry-point F-Type and the XE S sports saloon , although it has n't been confirmed as yet whether this motor will come to Ireland . <p> Back with the diesel , this is the first time the Ingenium engine has been used by the 4x4 company outside of its ' baby ' Land Rover Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque families , with the newcomer instantly assuming the title of the most economical Range Rover Sport yet . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return 6.2 litres/100km ( 45.6mpg ) and emits just 164g/km of CO2 .

There 's a visual giveaway for the SD4 , too , so even if it is de-badged by a self-conscious owner you can spot it 's the 2.0-litre as it has a single twin-exit exhaust , where all other Sports get a single exhaust on each side of the bumper instead . <p> Despite its 340hp , the supercharged V6 petrol is slower to 100km/h from rest than the existing SDV6 diesel , the new Sport taking 7.1 seconds to tick off the sprint ( 6.8 seconds for the SDV6 ) and capable of the same 209km/h top speed as the 3.0-litre diesel .

Nissan recently revealed its X-Trail ' 4Dogs ' concept to show what could be done to make a dog 's life easier when travelling in the car and it got us thinking . Are there cars for sale in the Carzone.ie database that are perfectly suited to carrying a dog or two , with little or no modification ? This is what we came up with , all started by using the keyword search facility within the used car listings and simply searching for " dog " . <p> We 'll start with the cheapest to buy and work our way up . Clearly a large boot is a priority here , but also one that let 's in plenty of light for the dog or dogs sitting back there . This 2007 Kia Sportage ticks all the boxes and is inexpensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its 2.0-litre diesel engine is perfectly capable of a lot more . This generation of the Sportage had a no-nonsense cabin made from sturdy plastics so you wo n't be worried if Fido gets into the front every now and then . For safety , though , there is a dog guard in the back . <p> Here 's a huge amount of car for your money . The Ford Mondeo Estate is a vast vehicle with a cavernous boot so it would suit those that have a couple of big dogs to take out walking regularly . This example has a perfectly acceptable 160,130 kilometres on the clock and an NCT until October 2018 so it should n't need much in the way of unexpected maintenance . Road tax is relatively low too at 390 a year and it even comes with a few toys like dual-zone climate control to keep you and your ' best friend ' comfortable . <p> Now , this example of BMW 's classy looking estate does have high mileage , but we chose it for two reasons . The first is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above recorded mileage , as this car comes with a full BMW service history . That 's very reassuring , as is the fact that , for a nine-year-old car , it has had just two owners , which suggests that it has been largely trouble free and pleasant to own . It 's still an elegant looking thing , too . The second reason we chose it is that it comes with a dog separator in the boot and the glass section of the rear hatch can be opened separately . Useful . <p> Clearly a Range Rover is n't the most sensible in terms of running costs , especially an older model like this 2005 example , powered by a whacking big 4.4-litre V8 petrol engine Nonetheless , the Range Rover is massive inside , with a beautifully carpeted boot - you 'll be jealous of your dog curling up there in comfort . What 's more , there 's a dog protector included with this car and , let 's face it , a pair of well-groomed pedigrees suit the Range Rover image to a tee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list is probably our favourite , in truth , as the Skoda Yeti is a brilliant crossover in any guise . This 2014 example looks like new , has very low mileage and a full Skoda service history . It 's the Outdoor version , with chunkier body styling that looks like it can tackle serious off-roading on your way to walking the dog . It does n't , however , have four-wheel drive , so perhaps leave the really rough stuff to your wellington boots and the dog 's paws Speaking of which , this car also has a dog guard , so it 's ready to go .
