@@49782859 @3282859/ <h> Fund Services &amp; Management Companies Market Update Q2 2017 <p> Jamie O'Riordan / July 4 , 2017 <p> The funds market in Ireland continues to have an upward trajectory as we move into Q3 . So far , this year the level of funds under administration stands at roughly G4.1 trillion . This is split between international funds that are domiciled in Ireland and abroad . This comes off the backdrop of Ireland solidifying its position as a leading hub for back-office functions for hedge funds . Despite global economic uncertainty , it is expected that assets under administration in Ireland will continue to rise to G4.7 trillion by the end of the decade . <p> The Fund Services market is currently in a resilient state with opportunities available in global 3rd party administrators and boutique fund administrators . The key areas for hire remain to be Fund Accounting , Investor Services , Risk &amp; Compliance and Regulatory professionals . With these skills in demand , salary levels have grown for Funds professionals and this is turn has led to a rise in counter offers . <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration in Ireland will continue to rise to G4.7 trillion by the end of the decade . <p> During Q2 , many candidates returned to the market following their company 's payout of bonuses in Q1 . The bonuses tended to be between 5-10% for junior/mid-level and 10-15% for more senior roles . The main reasons for candidates changing roles remain to be a strong benefits package , work/life balance , a clear path for career progression as well as the opportunity for either flexible working hours or to work from home . <h> Funds Accountants <p> The first half of the year has highlighted , there is an increased demand for Fund Accountant roles across all levels , in particular for Fund Accountants with 1-2 years ' experience and Senior Fund Accountants with 2-4 years ' experience. - Keeping with this trend , the requirement for specialist skills such as hedge , private equity and hybrid funds experience still remains . <h> Investor Services <p> Similar to fund accounting , there is a steady rise in demand for Investor Services professionals . This is largely due to Fund Administrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business to hire Investor Services professionals with A-Z experience and onboarding exposure . <h> Risk &amp; Compliance <p> The requirement for Risk &amp; Compliance professionals continues to show no sign of abating . This is a result of businesses needing to be more transparent in order to be fully compliant with the latest EU directives . Many candidates in operational roles have seen this increase as an opportunity to up-skill and side-step into a compliance function . <h> Regulatory Professionals <p> Lastly , another area of skills which remain in demand is the role of Regulatory professional 's due to a more stringent regulatory environment by the Central Bank . Ireland continues to have a strong reputation for robust and efficient regulations that aid the Fund Administration market , as well as be seen as the destination for businesses as their EU hub post-Brexit . The Central Bank 's ruling on risk and disclosure are considered sage and the Irish regulatory framework provides for independent , regulated administration and trustee/custodian functions . <h> Dublin Growth Post- Brexit <p> Prior to the decision to activate Article 50 , Ireland has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opus , Alter Domus and Virtus . Following on from the activation of Article 50 , this trend sets to continue as companies such as FundRock and Legg Mason have also decided to set up an Irish operation . Likewise , JP Morgan is looking to increase their foothold in Dublin and are currently looking at additional office space . Bank of America Merrill Lynch has said it views the Irish capital as its default EU Centre , given it has a banking license here and employs more than 600 people across two locations . <h> The Rise of the Manco 's <p> The third-party management company is a concept originating with UCITS . It has taken its evolutionary step with AIFMD . The traditional model has to evolve from focusing on regulatory compliance to emphasising on asset class and actual operations . Third-party , or rented ' , Mancos are used by fund firms that need to establish a material presence in EU jurisdictions to meet regulatory governance requirements for traditional and alternative funds . <p> The Manco industry is readying itself for an expected increase in demand from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market after the UK completes its departure . <p> Over the course of the past 2 years , Ireland has seen a lot of activity in the ManCo space . For instance , KB Associates , Bridge Consulting , DMS Offshore , GoodBody and Carne have continued to grow as well as FundRock who is a new entrant to the market . The global investment banks in Dublin are also in the process of setting up ManCo 's as they see it as an area of growth . <h> In Summary <p> We predict the volume of Fund Accounting , Transfer Agency , Risk &amp; Compliance and Regulatory roles will continue to increase for the remainder of 2017 and through to 2018 . Due to this rise in business in Fund Services , it is essential that companies utilise their back-office support to keep up in this competitive market .

We expect this was due to law firms feeling more optimistic about the market in general and hence the decision to increase recruitment in their departments . There has been a reduction in in-house activity in the second quarter versus the first quarter which is often a seasonal aberration , whereby budgets are released in the new year for increased headcount and in-house recruitment soars as a result . <h> Key Trends <p> In the second quarter , we have seen a significant increase in recruitment in private practice , especially in smaller firms ( staff numbers below 50 ) recruiting at rates that we have not seen since pre-2009 .

@@49782869 @3282869/ <h> Understanding the Power of Introverts in the Workplace <p> Niamh O'Byrne / June 28 , 2017 <p> Its easy to get convinced in a job interview that an extrovert candidate is the best fit for the position . But what if their introvert competitor is actually more suitable ? Do n't  dismiss a candidate because they might not have engaged as actively or discovered a shared hobby in the course of the conversation . Instead , take the opportunity to embrace the secret power of introverts in the workplace . <h> Current Biases Against Introverts <p> Introverts are more common in a workplace than managers might realise . According to one study , as much as 50 percent of the U.S. workforce self-identifies as introverts . And yet , 96% percent of leaders and managers self-identify as extroverts , creating a significant chasm and even some biases against talent that is not as outgoing or seems shyer than their peers . <p> Society tends to have an implicit cultural bias against introverts , and that bias manifests itself particularly strongly in the workforce . Someone who talks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gets to their desk , sits down and begins to work without much interaction . Similarly , the colleague who speaks up at a meeting will receive more accolades than the one who sits down and takes in everyone elses opinions . <p> However , that bias could be a significant mistake . <p> Introverts tend to have qualities that make them exceptionally well-suited to be more productive and even take on leadership roles . All you have to do is learn how to harness that power . <h> The Power of- Introversion <p> Firstly , its easy to confuse introversion with shyness . But in reality , the two are not the same . While shy people refrain from speaking out in public settings because they 're nervous , introverts take the same action because they see the value in listening . And that 's the first indication of their potential power . <p> The end result might be the same . But the reasoning to get to that point differs , in some ways significantly . <p> In fact , introverts tend to develop a number of skills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen , and are more considerate of others opinions before arriving at a decision . As a result , according to U.S. author Susan Cain , introverts tend to be more reflective , and are better able to build productive professional relationships . <p> One study of MBA students- is particularly revealing in the gap between perception and reality when it comes to introverts . In group projects , students tend to give their extrovert peers higher ratings than introverted group members . But as the project goes on , the ratings begin to reverse themselves , as introverts reveal their true value and productivity . <p> Actual work , it turns out , is more than just talking . Or , as the researcher responsible for the study stated , <p> Extroverts disappoint us over time when they 're part of a team . On a team , you 're expected to work hard and contribute a lot . But they 're often poor listeners , and they do n't collaborate . - <p> Contrast that with introverts , who may not make as good of a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and successful over time . <h> Introverts as Business Leaders <p> In reality , there is a significant case to be made that despite the current chasm and biases , placing introverts in crucial company positions and leadership roles comes with significant benefits . As Forbes highlights , some of the todays most influential and well-regarded leaders such as Googles Larry Page and Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg self-identify as introverts . Charles Darwin , Al Gore , and Albert Einstein also fit on the spectrum . <p> Introverts are beneficial employees to have in the workplace and employers need to harness the potential both introverts and extroverts can bring to the table . The secret power of introverts might just be the variable that ensures long-term success for your company . 139968 @qwx549968

However , you do n't  have to drain company resources or slow down productivity by taking on the burden of hiring temporary staff . <p> Many temp agencies now offer specialised staffing solutions and there are several benefits to hiring temporary staff over the summer months . <h> Hiring an expert on a contractual basis <p> Due to changes in the world economy and the rise in the gig economy , there are scores of high-level professionals who have chosen to work on a contract- to -contract basis . These types of individuals tend to be extremely focused and take great satisfaction in working on a particular issue or project during a designated timeframe . After meeting their goals at one organisation , they bring their expertise to the next company . Legal experts , accountants , interim CEOs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the databases of agencies that specialise in making these kinds of high-powered matches between independent contractors and organisations . <h> Covering longer -term temporary absences of permanent- staff <p> Temporary employees are a wonderful resource when it comes to covering lengthy absences that your permanent staff may need to take from time to time . In fact , all parties involved benefit from this situation . Whether it is a matter of maternity or paternity leave , or whether your permanent staff member needs to take time off to recuperate from surgery , illness , or take a career break , there are motivated contingency workers available to fill virtually any position while your permanent employee takes the time he or she needs to come back fully charged . <h> Saving money by hiring independent contractors <p> Contracts with temporary agencies free the company from paying for benefits or other expenses to which a full-time permanent employee may be entitled . Although the EU Directive on Temporary Agency Work requires that temporary employees receive the same pay as their permanent counterparts , when you contract an individual through an agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hours that the employee works , while providing that individual with the same on-the-job treatment that your permanent employees receive . <h> Covering the holidays of management <p> Top temp agencies have access to lists of managers who work on contract in a variety of areas . From departmental managers that keep track of daily operations , to software project leaders , and key account managers , these agencies have pre-s-creened managerial capital standing by . As these individuals finish up a management project with one company , they prepare to make the transition to another organisation at a mutually agreeable time . <p> The desired result is a seamless transition while your in--house management takes their annual leave . <h> Assess if a temporary employee is a candidate for a permanent role <p> Everyone knows that interview processes and assessment tools have their shortcomings . While you include these screening methods in your formal candidate selection process , the summer is an opportune time to assess whether a temporary employee who displays the skills and knowledge your company needs is a good fit for a permanent position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , summer does not have to be a time where you are burdened with training temporary staff or paying your in--house staff overtime wages to fill the gaps left by your valuable staff members that have taken annual leave .

Digital skills remain at the forefront of demand and in particular skills such as SEO , Data Analytics and Marketing Automation are increasingly sought after . This increase is due to more organisation 's concentrating on improving their online business interactions and retention of customers . - We found that customer-led insight and experience enhancement across multiple channels has been a primary focal point for many large organisation 's this year . <h> Digital Marketing <p> The demand for experienced digital marketing staff has been significantly evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allocate more and more budget and resources to marketing efforts across digital channels .

The battle for customer acquisition and retention has also lead to an increase in roles across the telco and utilities sector . Candidates with customer segmentation experience and customer experience development are highly sought after in this sector . <h> Salaries <p> With increased demand for specialist skills , salaries have started to increase slightly as businesses look to not only attract but also retain talent in these areas .

The evidence is there with regular announcements of growth in various sectors and job creation in others . There has been quantifiable data to support these signs : an increase in employment , a decrease in unemployment ( both with number and long-term unemployed ) . We can say with certainty that 2015 has seen a truly positive year for the Irish economy . <p> So , what are the areas that have been most notable for growth ? What areas have seen the biggest shift in skills needed ? What areas will be the beacon for growth in 2016 ? 139963 @qwx549963 <p> Throughout 2016 , Ireland has continued to see investment from sources locally and abroad . Not all of these were Multinational Organisations ( where the IDA reports over 15 thousand jobs were created in January and that number is set to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ireland in 2015 , a sign that risk and trust in the local economy is at a high . This shift towards small firms and self-employment , as well as an increase in the number of professionals engaged in entrepreneurship and business growth are all indicators that the economic recovery is raising business confidence . <p> The need for local talent is higher than ever and many companies are looking at more creative ways to attract the pool of IT talent locally . After all , many companies have decided to move here for a number of reasons one of those reasons being the high calibre of IT professionals already present in Ireland . <p> There is some good news , however , with one statistic released showing that 18% more professionals have decided to come to Ireland than leave in Q3 of 2015 . With this data , it is understood on a wider scale that Ireland is among the top destinations for foreign talent to explore the next stages of their careers . <p> The need for local talent is higher than ever and many companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT talent locally . " <h> Salaries <p> Overall , salaries have steadily increased across all areas of IT , most notably in Software Development , Data Analysis/Science and Information Security , all exhibiting up to 10% increases in base salaries . Software Development has traditionally seen the most robust upwards trajectory of salaries and this trend continues with no sign of slowing down in 2016 . <p> The data obtained in our research also underscores this positive momentum in the Irish economy . According to our research , 71% of IT professionals received a salary increase this year . Professionals in this sector are also very content with their remuneration packages with an impressive 82% rating theirs as positive or very positive . <p> Some of the respondents of our survey found that it was difficult for smaller companies to adjust to the almost real-time change in overall salary expectations . Multinational companies find it easier to adapt to these rapid inclines not only by adapting their base salaries ( which they do not do as well as some of the smaller companies ) , but by augmenting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits ( e.g. dental ) , support ( educational , well-being ) , a well-defined career path and , in some cases , reference manuals and case-studies of what it is like to work for their company and what they can expect if they made the decision to join them . <p> Over 2015 , we have spoken to hundreds of IT professionals and there has been a very positive response to these incentives , especially when many others do not offer them . It seems to be a question of confidence , and many of the companies hiring the best talent at higher volumes seem to know that it works . One of our clients offers most of these things and focusses a majority of their technology hires in the most highly sought-after areas such as Java &amp; . NET Development , Data Analysis , Business Analysis , Automation Testers and DevOps , and they have experienced huge successes this year with over 300 hires . <h> Area Shortages <p> Over the last 3 years , the specific sectors that are most in demand have changed just as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hype was Software Engineering and Testing .

As well as the Finance , Construction and BioPharma sectors , this will also be spearheaded by the Technology industry in Ireland . <p> It is expected that the need for Infrastructure professionals , especially Cloud experts , will become increasingly in demand as more businesses move some , or all of their infrastructure to the Cloud . <p> Also , as more businesses leverage data to their advantage in the struggle to push ahead of their competitors , the analysis of this data and the ultimate use of it to increase revenue will be increasingly important .

This unique in-house service can be used in tandem with our normal selection and advice facilities and creates a seamless profiling service , without passing part of the process out to a third party who may not be as familiar with client or candidate requirements or objectives . In addition to recognised personality tests such as 16PF and Myers Briggs , we are licensed to offer various ability tests including a range of numeric testing and are also qualified to test and administer EQi , the widely used test of emotional intelligence . <h> What is Psychometric Testing ? <p> Psychometric Tests are the jewels in the crown of modern psychology , and are more widely used now than at any time in the past . A psychometric test is a way of assessing a person 's ability or personality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conjunction with other proven methods as test scores can only be understood in relation to other known facts about the individual . However , research shows that psychometric tests are among the best methods of predicting how well a candidate will cope with training and performing the job . <p> Understanding the ways in which people differ enables a wide range of questions to be addressed : What career or area within my chosen career would I be good at ? Which candidate is most suitable and should be employed ? What areas of future training are required ? How can my interpersonal skills be improved ? <p> There are three main types of tests : Ability , Personality and Interest . Some tests are used by employers to help them in their selection process , while other tests can help professionals with career decision making . <p> Ability tests are generally categorised into two areas : Attainment Tests , which examine skills and knowledge that you already possess . Aptitude Tests measure your potential for certain activities . They do not rely on any previous knowledge or training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning and numeric reasoning are the two most common forms . <h> There are also more specialised tests that can examine specific skills : <h> Ability Tests <p> It has been shown that scores do improve if you become more familiar with ability tests and the type of questions you are asked . There are a number of ability tests but you are most likely to encounter a verbal reasoning and a numerical reasoning test . If you know in which you are weaker then practice . <p> Advice when taking a test : Make sure you understand the example items before starting the test and ask questions at this stage before going on to do the actual test. Be clear about time limits and work at an appropriate speed. Do n't be put off if some of the questions seem very difficult . Most ability tests will contain some items that are designed to be difficult for all test sitters , regardless of ability. Practising similar tests beforehand will help , especially if you have not sat such a test previously . <h> Personality Tests <p> These are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike the tests listed above there are no right or wrong answers . They seek to present a picture of how a person will behave in particular circumstances and learn about the style in which you like to work . Well known tests in this area include the 16 PF and Myers Briggs . <h> Interest Tests <p> Interest Inventory tests are used primarily to aid occupational exploration by helping individuals identify occupational fields that contain career areas they might find interesting . These measures are based on many of the same assumptions as personality measures ; where it is assumed that the individuals themselves are the most reliable source of information for describing how they typically behave . Do n't try to make out that you have a different personality because you think it is what the company is looking for . The answers are inter-linked , so any kind of skew in the results will indicate that you have not been answering consistently and may invalidate the test . Be honest , answer quickly and intuitively . <p> Advice on taking a Personality Tests / Interest Tests : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions. The basis is that you are the most reliable source of information for describing how you typically behave or what your career interests are. There are no right or wrong answers.

The evidence is there with regular announcements of growth in various sectors and job creation in others . There has been quantifiable data to support these signs : an increase in employment , a decrease in unemployment ( both with number and long-term unemployed ) . We can say with certainty that 2016 has seen a truly positive year for the Irish economy . <p> So , what are the areas that have been most notable for growth ? What areas have seen the biggest shift in skills needed ? What areas will be the beacon for growth in 2017 ? 139963 @qwx549963 <p> Of the respondents we approached in the local IT market , 46% said that they would expect to move jobs within 6 months and half of those would consider a move immediately . The reasons for this were many , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration with their careers , with 48% of people who were interested in the job market saying this was their primary motivator . In addition , 42% of career-mobile IT professionals were concerned about ever-present compensation concerns , while the work/life balance was the least of people 's concerns with only 8% of people citing it as a primary motivation for seeking new employment . <p> Clearly , this is a worry for businesses , as is the frequency of how often IT professionals move between employers . A huge 78% of our respondents say they will look to move employers within 5 years and half of those expect to move within 3 years . <p> So what do they expect to find in a new employer ? What are the factors that they will be looking for when considering a new employer/job ? Our respondents were asked to choose 3 of the most important factors that are critical to them in a new role .

The companies that are more agile in their recruitment strategy and pay attention to the speed of hire and candidate interview experience will fare better than those who ignore these factors .

This year however we saw sustained activity through July and August with each month as busy as September . New jobs registered and candidate applications are up 20% on the same time last year and although there is a wary sentiment following the Brexit vote , it has n't dampened hiring expectation with nearly all of our FS clients expecting to make numerous new hires going into the final Quarter of the year . <p> Salary increases are getting more dramatic and counter offers more frequent with companies realising they have to take action if they are to retain or attract top level staff in today 's market .

Nearly all of our clients within this space have registered jobs within the last quarter , a trend that looks set to continue until the end of the year .

This has been a welcome release and has meant that activity and competition have grown once again with candidates not as reliant on a select number of employers . There is no longer a huge talent pool in this area waiting for the right move and gradually things are starting to normalise . <h> What do we expect for the remainder of the year ? <p> We expect there to be continued volume hiring with the Personal Banking , Private Banking and Wealth Management space carried through to the end of the year and into next year .

@@49782932 @3282932/ <h> Public Practice Advisory &amp; Taxation Market Overview <p> The accountancy practice sector can be seen as a strong barometer for the overall health of the Irish Economy ( since their clients , big and small , make up the Irish economy ) . Happily this year our survey , which is reflected in the broader economic data out there , suggests that Ireland Inc. is in rude health . <p> While the Big 4 ' and many of the Top 10 ' accountancy practices were quick to recover from the GFC due to their international client base , it has taken a while for the recovery to trickle down to the smaller practices . From the results of our research this year , we 're happy to report that just about all of our practice clients are reporting a return to growth this year . This is reflected in our survey results with 91% of accountants surveyed feeling secure in their current role . <h> Audit <p> The country 's audit teams remain the largest training ground for qualified accountants in Ireland and this year , like most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of demand are at the manager and senior manager level , with auditors being able to negotiate significant raises for themselves on moving . This shortage has led to large practices being more open than ever to taking auditors from their smaller practice counterparts , as well as an increased desire to take candidates from non-EU nations , despite the visa sponsorship hassles . We see this demand continuing throughout 2017 , so qualified auditors looking for an improvement in remuneration , progression , location or work life balance should get in touch as there are plenty of options out there . <h> Tax <p> We have seen consistent demand for tax candidates this year , particularly from larger practices , and especially at manager and senior manager level . Again , firms are aware of the tightness in the market for candidates at this level , which is leading to significant wage inflation for Tax professionals , as well as companies creating more flexible working environments or reducing the compliance burden for candidates who are not primarily motivated by money . <h> Consulting <p> The demand for consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong interest in Management Consulting , Finance Transformation , Risk Consulting , Regulatory Affairs and Financial Effectiveness . Candidates from a variety of backgrounds , including industry , have moved seamlessly into these roles . This is not only driven by growth of the existing consulting business , we 've also seen some of our practices ' clients look to add brand new consulting arms to their business to meet the increased requests they are getting from their clients . This further increases the opportunity for driven consultants to build a business around themselves . <h> Mergers <p> Another area of significant growth for us here in Lincoln has been assisting clients to identify companies to merge with or acquire . This , once again , is a result of a new-found confidence in the market , with small and medium-sized practices having money to invest in their growth and seeing the merger/acquisition of another firm as being an effective way to do so . We have taken these processes from cradle to the grave in 2016 and the demand has been high . We have also created a definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the process . <p> - From our research we 're happy to report that just about all of our practice clients are reporting a return to growth this year . <h> Summary <p> 2016 has continued the trend of recent years of being a candidate driven market . We hope that the uptick in trainees post-GFC will help to cool salary inflation , particularly at Manager level , but that remains to be seen . Over 80% of respondents received salary increases in 2016 , demonstrating the demand , with over a third of candidates getting +10% increases . ( We are aware of many examples of people receiving way above 10% . ) We expect this trend to continue into 2017 , so if you are a qualified accountant who is not entirely happy with your situation it 's well worth testing the market to see what you could achieve . 139968 @qwx549968

@@49782944 @3282944/ <h> Why You Should Hire Athletes <p> Orla Doyle / June 14 , 2017 <p> A recent survey has revealed that- 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs had high achieving sporting backgrounds . This statistic shines a light- on the fact that people who have a background in sports , bring something extra to the workplace . A candidate with a background in sports is equipped with valuable skills that ca n't be easily quantified or listed on a CV . The hours of commitment to training and competition . The heartache of loss . The ambition required to excel . These lessonslearned the hard way in sports , are exactly what make the difference between a workplace contributor and a superstar . <p> Here are three reasons why athletes make the best hires : <h> Know How to- Prioritise <p> Sports professionals have to lead highly structured lives to reach the high levels of success . Whether they are working towards completing a marathon or winning a competition , their success depends on prioritising time each day to accommodate demanding training requirements . Prioritising- is essential in the workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceiving what needs to accomplished first. - Athletes are goal-oriented by nature , which means they 're constantly assessing and reassessing where they stand in relation to their objectives and fine-tuning the strategy they need to get there . Like a football midfielder reading the defense to decide whether to shoot or pass , the best employees constantly reprioritise to focus on the goals that matter most to their team . <h> Goal Oriented <p> Whether it is to beat a new record or reclaim a Championship title , all athletes are well versed in setting goals , creating a plan and putting it into action . They have the ability to put their vision , into sub-goals and execute them efficiently . Reaching goals is a priority for every business and this type of mindset is essential to an organisation- that looks to reach ambitious growth targets . Successful sports people understand that if one avenue is blocked , they have to find another path to success . If their physical strength has given out , they adapt to learn to work smarter , not harder . <h> Adaptability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented but competition losses or an injury setback can make an athlete 's goal more difficult to achieve . This experience gives athletes the ability to strategise to overcome challenges and adjust their attitude and expectations so they are still on track to achieve their goals . Being adaptable in the workplace is essential . In the work environment , every day can uncover new challenges , there may be an influx of new work or changed deadlines and employees who possess adaptability can bring a balanced approach to overcoming these obstacles . <h> Teamwork <p> If you want a business with a collaborative ethos , adding athletes to your resource mix is essential . Sportspeople understand teamwork is more than just sharing the workload and supporting your teammates , but understanding a groups dynamics and adjusting their role to better aid the organisation- as a whole . From years of being part of a team or solo performance , athletes are aware of the ever-changing role which is invaluable for creating effective teams in the workplace . Great teamwork requires people who understand group dynamics and know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . <h> Have Experience of Winning &amp; Losing <p> Winning and losing occurs as much in the workplace as it does in sport . Athletes are humble winners and steadfast losers . Scoring a top client or assisting ones team in reaching a goal is a win for the entire organisation . Sportspeople in the workforce can humbly accept a win and disperse acclamation to the whole team for their efforts . But , just as winning is inevitable , so too is losing . Losing is something every athlete has experienced throughout their sporting career and they have experience in how to deal with it . In other words , in the face of adversity athletes are capable of turning defeat into a learning experience . Translating this into the workplace , undoubtedly businesses will meet failure at some point and having- an experienced team member that knows how to bounce back and persistently try again is invaluable . <p> It 's no surprise former athletes , make up the largest percentage of leadership roles in todays top companies . Sportspeople have learned and developed leadership traits from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and pass these on to their co-workers either through direct teaching or through the examples they set. - So the next time you sit down to interview a potential candidate for your business , ask which sport they played . It may be the best question you can ask a potential hire . How are you finding , fostering , and training the athletes in your workforce ? <p> At Lincoln , we understand the value athletes bring to a workplace .

@@49782974 @3282974/ <p> That was the question addressed by guest speaker Shane Mulhall at Lincoln Search &amp; Selections Breakfast Briefing on Dublins Pearse Street this morning . Mulhall is the former chairman of Irish food tech firm Odenberg and was present at Chartered Accountants House to offer an alternative to what they say makes the world go round . Morale has fallen in more than half of the companies in the world , " according to Mulhall , who said that " correct motivation " was key to a successful organisation . <p> Mulhall drew attention to two important motivational areas " " reward " and " recognition " . However , he was quick to add that a correct balance must be found . " Money alone does not satisfy a man " according to Mulhall and he used Oscar Wilde , to illustrate the point , " If you marry a woman for her money you will earn every penny of it " . " Those just interested in money " are " small minded " according to Mulhall and if companies continue to opt for such blinkered employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy , reason is overturned and stupid decisions follow . " Not many people really drive company value " so companies should adopt the principal whereby each person who does is rewarded while giving " due attention " to " recognition motivators " . <p> A lot of the ideas associated with running a company are quite simple , such as " people do business with people they like " and " if they love you there is no practical limit to what they will do for you " . This can apply to both their customers and to their fellow employees and managers . So how do you make yourself likable ? Mulhall explained it was about integrity , and urged that there be " no gap between what you say and what you do " . All great motivational leaders , i.e Gandhi and Martin Luther King , had no gap in their integrity and people were motivated to support their dreams despite obvious hardship and strife . The same dynamic can be established and implemented in any company but a few things have to be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer to the organisation , understanding what their needs are and realising that the simplest way to bring out the best in anyone is to praise them " " all praise and gratitude felt must be spoken " , when the person in question is alive , Mulhall joked . Its all too often left to a eulogy to praise someones achievements . Mulhall said that in " an excellent relationship , measurement does not come into it " and that " recognition motivators are even more important now given the current economic climate " . A relationship will develop instead in to a deal between employee and employer if its only about money , measuring output against input and refusing to do any more without financial compensation . So why do companies not use recognition motivators more often ? There are a number of factors . Those with influence in companies the world over still believe an " employee can be bought " . This is not true stressed Mulhall . Furthermore , " recognition motivators require more time and care " but deep down managers do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out ? Ask them ! Motivation is an " inside job " . Employees are not looking for exorbitant rewards but a justified one , aswell as people they can relate to and work alongside . <p> A third factor that influences people to work most productively is when they have an " abundant energy " that facilitates an organisation becoming an exceptional one . The aforementioned Martin Luther King famously said that " If you serve a cause greater than yourself , you will never be alone " and Mulhall agrees . " Vision always lends energy " and an abundance of energy is vital as it gives employees a cause greater than themselves . They will strive to achieve this higher vision , not pay lip service to an unworkable mission statement , and so feel proud of their organisation . Mulhalls own company , Odenberg , sold at the beginning of the year for G64 million ( thirteen times its valuation in 2003 ) strove to achieve its vision that it would become the number 1 in food production manufacturing . With strong competition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the " horror years " of 2008-2010 , the whole Odenberg team achieved this goal . If you 're eating french fries in the US , chances are 9 times out of 10 , they were prepared using an Odenberg machine . Mulhall finished off with another question , " If your employees are not willing to go the extra mile you have to ask , what ideal you are asking them to serve ? " How do you motivate your employees to drive the success of your business ? Do you pay them handsomely against the competition so as to retain them , or have you already adopted Mulhalls recognition motivator ideals ? 139968 @qwx549968

In fact , many employees end up hiding mental health concerns out of fear that they will be labelled " unstable " or " unreliable . " With increased awareness about mental health and a movement toward removing the negative stigma associated with mental conditions , many workplaces are stepping up to make changes to their policies . Improving mental health awareness- in your office begins with these six key steps . <h> Increase awareness <p> Training sessions- for all employees , particularly those in management positions or those who could potentially need to work directly with employees with mental illnesses , can make it easier for everyone to communicate , build rapport , and react appropriately to situations involving mental health . Topics should include a basic understanding of mental health problems like depression and anxiety as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for most mental health concerns . <h> Provide tools for support <p> The biggest surprise for many , when dealing with employees with mental health issues , is the fact that they are n't  expected to " fix " them. - Instead , its necessary to provide tools to support those employees much like the tools provided to other employees with disabilities . With the right support , many employees suffering from mental health concerns can go on to become highly productive individuals who are able to accomplish great things for the company . This does , however , require support and understandingand the right tools can make all the difference . This might include , for example , offering a private office or other distraction-reducing tools for individuals with attention problems or providing a more flexible work schedule for employees with depression or anxiety concerns . Written instructions , not verbal ones , may prove to be the only accommodation an individual with memory problems needs while removing environmental triggers like smells can solve many problems for individuals who have panic attacks . <h> Create a mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put together a great sample mental health policy- that will help you establish clear guidelines for your business . Keep in mind that your mental health policy needs to include information about : <p> Avoiding discrimination due to mental illness <p> How to establish mental illness and what criteria are required <p> How to create accommodations for employees with mental illnesses <p> Remember that each individual is different . Like employees with physical disabilities , unique accommodations will be required based on the individuals skills and strengths . A flexible policy will make it easier to meet the needs of every employee . <h> Encourage a healthy work/life balance <p> Employees who have a poor work/life balance are more likely to show signs of depression , anxiety , and instability . Promoting mental health at work includes preventing hours from climbing too high , encouraging and supporting life events outside the workplace , and creating policies that do not penalise employees for taking accrued vacation time . Life outside the office can have a significant impact on life within it , so supporting employees in their everyday lives is critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness training , managers and supervisors throughout your business should receive training in recognising signs and symptoms of stress in employees . Learning to alleviate that stress will help make healthier , more productive employees who are better prepared to give their full attention to their jobs . Some common signs of stress include : <p> Acting consistently tired <p> Irritability <p> An increase in the need to take sick leave , particularly in an employee who has not previously been i 'll on a regular basis <p> Sudden difficulty completing regular work tasks <p> Indecisiveness or insecurity <h> Create a culture of openness <p> Mental health concerns or stresses can appear without warning . In many cases , current employees will hide or minimise those concerns in an effort to prevent discrimination . On top of worrying about the condition itself or the things that have led to it , they 're also concerned that theyll lose their job or be labelled incompetent as a result . Encouraging a culture of openness throughout the office instead will enable employees to open up about mental health concerns , from admitting when they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many hours in an effort to keep up to sharing mental health concerns with their supervisors . <p> Supporting mental health in your office is a critical part of maintaining a safe , healthy environment for all of your employees . By creating an environment where employees are encouraged to thrive regardless of mental health concerns , you 'll find that you have happier , more productive employees who are firmly committed to your organisation . Taking these steps to support mental health will help reshape your company in a highly positive way . <h> How can I support the Campaign ? <p> Visit the Green Ribbon- website- to learn how you can support the campaign .

Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and empathise with the way that your team members , peers and manager see the world and how they are feeling on a given day .

It 's comforting when we go on holiday and it seems like the place falls apart because we 're away . The problem is that this is particularly poor both from a business point of view and from the career aspect . A business needs to be secured so that the risk of one employee leaving is hedged and they can be safe in the knowledge that things can still go on . But thinking about it from a purely personal point of view ; imagine being up for a promotion but losing out because everything falls apart just because you are away . Great managers develop great deputies and when they get the call to move up to the boardroom the business can be confident that there will be little or no adverse impact . 139968 @qwx549968

The opportunities in this area at the moment are substantial , as many of the leading industry and financial services companies have learnt lessons from the downturn in the economy- and are bulking up their Internal Audit functions to ensure their controls are much tighter and comprehensive . The fact is for some of the leading multinationals and PLC 's in Ireland , Internal Audit is a genuine opportunity for candidates to get in the door with a company of choice , - with the view to moving internally in the short to medium term . <p> Here are the key reasons why- Internal Audit is a good career step for qualified- accountants : <h> A gateway to top employers <p> Most PLC 's use Internal Audit as their talent acquisition pool ' .

@@49783081 @3283081/ <h> Interview Advice <p> Concepta Cadogan / November 19 , 2014 <p> Invariably , when pursuing new career opportunities , you will be asked to attend for an interview . The interview is often the most critical event in you securing that new job , and while each interview differs from the next there are some guidelines that will always apply . In addition , competency based interviews , are increasing popular and we have addressed this form of interview separately . <p> In such a competitive market it is crucial that you conduct a good interview . Interviews are an opportunity for an organisation to assess your suitability for them as well as an opportunity for you to assess if the organisation and position is right for you and your career . You should market yourself for the specific job and come to the interview prepared to talk knowledgeably about what you have to offer . You must really think about the company and the job that you potentially would be doing . Read our interview advice below ; <h> Preparation prior to interview <p> Quite often a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so your personal presentation at interview in very important . If you are in any doubt about dress code , it is best to err on the side of conservatism and always wear a business suit , even if the organisation has a casual dress code . In addition , <p> Ensure that you have read the job specification and all related company information that you can avail of . Our consultants will be able to provide you with their information and insight into the organisation , but do your own research too and relate it back to you own professional experience . We live in an information age and there is always useful information available . <p> Make an effort to visit the organisation 's web-site and especially look at their company news section if they have one . <p> If the organisation has services available to the public make an effort to visit these e.g. if a retail organisation visit the outlet to experience their services first-hand . <p> This may sound obvious but be familiar with your CV and be able to discuss it in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gained . Relate the role you are interviewing for back to your professional experience , highlighting any strengths or weaknesses . See our advice on competency based interviewing too . <p> Find out about the format of the interview in as much detail as possible i.e. if it will be a straight forward verbal interview , or for example if you will be required to give a presentation . <p> Avail of any information on the person who is interviewing you i.e. if they are part of the finance team research their professional background as this will influence the type of interview they will conduct . <p> Make sure you know the correct location of the interview , and be on time . <h> Interview Techniques <p> You are being assessed from the moment you enter the client premises , so from the start project confidence , professionalism and a keen interest in the process . <p> Be aware of non verbal communication as well as verbal as these are indicators for an interviewer too . This includes a firm hand-shake , making eye contact and your general physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully to what is asked and take your time to answer appropriately . Do n't be afraid to ask for clarification if you are unsure about what is being asked . <p> When answering questions look for opportunities to express your strengths and suitability for the job . <p> In answering questions never criticise former employers or never appear negative in any way . <p> Always remain calm and professional no matter how challenging a question or the situation may get . <p> Try to build a rapport with the interviewer and get a sense of what they are looking for in a suitable person ; quite often this will be more telling than what was on a job specification . <p> At the interview progresses , be aware of any weaknesses or short-comings you may have for the position and try to address them honestly . At times , it is the candidate with the least amount of short-comings rather that most amount of strengths that gets the job . <p> Finally , ask questions . It 's not acceptable to say that I have no questions or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least two relevant questions to ask . <h> Possible Questions to Ask <p> Firstly , do not ask questions that are clearly answered on the employers web site and/or in any literature provided by the employer to you in advance . This will highlight your lack of research ! In addition , not asking questions is passing up a chance to stand out from the competition . <p> Who will review my performance ? <p> How often ? <p> How have others progressed in the organisation ? <p> What do you consider to be your firms most important assets ? <p> What can you tell me about your new product or plans for growth ? <p> How do you rate your competition ? <p> How long has the position been open and why ? <p> Can you explain the reporting structure for this position ? <p> What is the overall structure of the company and how does your department fit the structure ? <p> What are some of the skills and abilities necessary for someone to succeed in this job ? <p> What were the major strengths and weaknesses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most immediate challenges of the position that need to be addressed in the first three months ? <p> What are the performance expectations of this position over the first 12 months ? What types of skills do you NOT already have onboard that you 're looking to fill with a new hire ? <p> At the end of the interview , you can also ask : What are the next steps in the interview process ? <h> Competency Based Interviews <p> Many companies currently use competency based questions to identify the most suitable candidate for a position . A significant number of large corporate organisations have adopted this format for interviewing and selection purposes . <p> The aim of competency based questions is to make the interview process as standard and as fair as possible . It also offers a set structure to the interview which allows the interviewer to equally assess candidates ' skills and experience against the core competencies required for the position . <p> Core competencies relate to the particular skills and/or expertise for the successful performance of a role . When responding to such questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of their competence and suitability for the position . <h> Examples of core competencies required in many jobs are : <p> Assertiveness <p> Attention to Detail <p> **27;98;TOOLONG Skills <p> Decision Making Ability <p> Energy <p> Flexibility ( Ability to adapt to the characteristics of the current environment and/or changes ih this environment ) . <p> Integrity ( level of interest in their work , willing to give 100% . ) <p> Organisation/Planning <p> Self Confidence <p> Self Reliance ( Has a level of independence from others and is able to use their own initiative to achieve the results . ) <p> Supervisory Ability <p> Team Player <p> Competency based questions usually start with some variant of the following ; <p> Tell me about a time when you . Give an example of a situation where . Describe a scenario <h> To help you prepare for competency based interviews we suggest the following : <p> Know your CV and be able to talk through thoroughly <p> Read the job description a number of times to ensure you have a strong awareness of the technical and competency demands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover requirements of the position . <p> Prepare yourself to discuss your professional career to date , showing a logical progression , explanations for different moves and reasons for selecting previous jobs/employers . <p> To demonstrate your success and achievements to date , have situational examples ready . For example , a time when you may have implemented a new process or manipulated systems to improve efficiencies . Relationship management with different teams/business areas is also a useful example . <p> Situational answers are considered to be the most effective way of providing evidence and demonstrating competencies to interviewers . It gives the candidate an opportunity to highlight skills and competencies acquired in a clear precise manner . <p> Discuss your time with past and current employers as constructively as possible . Focus on what you learned from a role and what aspects you enjoyed most while working with a company . Explain your reasons for deciding to leave or for making a move in a positive light . <p> Finally , before the interview make a list of the information you may want confirmed , e.g. company turnover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical questions relating to the position . If during the interview this information does not transpire , use the candidate question time at the end to enquire with the interviewers . If your prepared questions are already covered , it can be beneficial to ask at least one question from the information provided/discussed so far . <p> As part of our services to candidates , Lincoln Consultants offer full advice on competency based interviews and will assist our candidates in preparation of such interviews . It is our top priority to encourage and support our candidates to perform to their very best when meeting with perspective employers . <p> Our consultants are always available for any questions you may have : Tel : 01 6610444 , Email:info@lincoln.ie. 139968 @qwx549968

With more vacancies in the market , HR professionals looking for a new role in 2016 are likely to be presented with multiple opportunities . They can therefore be more selective in the roles they pursue . This shift has allowed candidates to feel more at ease with their career progression as they have more control over their future career paths . <p> Since there is a serious shortage of labour in Ireland , it has become increasingly important for companies to maintain their talent ; companies realise that the HR function plays a pivotal role in making this a reality . A good HR function can help them maintain a happy , healthy and most importantly , a stable workforce . 139963 @qwx549963 <p> " Since there is a serious shortage of labour in Ireland , it has become increasingly more important for companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays a pivotal role in making this a reality " - <p> In the past year , employers in our survey have noted the areas where they have experienced the biggest shortages in the HR market . HR Managers , Reward Specialists/Managers and In-House Recruiters top the list as demand continues to significantly outweigh supply . There is a noticeable skills gap for these positions , meaning that what they were looking for in terms of experience and expertise was not available on the market . <p> Additionally , the HR market is becoming increasingly data driven . We notice that candidates with Data Analytics experience such as HR Analysts and HRIS Specialists are increasingly sought after year after year. - Furthermore , as companies implement more growth-focused strategies , we see Organisational Development Managers and Employee Engagements Specialists in bigger companies becoming increasingly sought after . <p> An important point to note : as skill shortages become more apparent , many organisations will look at upskilling current staff for different roles with the potential to develop new skills . When we asked our clients about how they will address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at current employees with the potential to develop and 62% of employers stated that they will invest more in the training of existing employees . For this reason , we would expect to see Learning and Development roles increase steadily on the market in 2016 . These roles will require specific areas of expertise such as eLearning , senior management training , and organisational design . <p> This year in the Human Resources market , as was the case in many other sectors , brought about the shift towards more permanent positions being offered and also sought after by candidates . Candidates seek the stability of a permanent role and as the market continues to pick up , more and more companies are offering permanent roles in HR . Many view a strong HR Team as pivotal in the future growth potential of the company . <h> Salaries <p> Retaining key HR Professionals is high on the agenda for many employers this year ; this resulted in internal salary increases . Our survey reflected this with 69% of HR professionals receiving a pay rise this year . The most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a significant number , ( 25% ) , receiving a pay rise of 25% or more . <p> While salary is still a very important factor to professionals in the market , location , company culture and client exposure have also begun to play an important role in final decision-making . Salaries stabilised in 2015 and companies are now giving additional benefits to employees in many cases instead of raising salaries ( i.e. car allowances , additional days off , pensions , health cover , gym memberships ) . These benefits have become more appealing to candidates as the overall package is now taken into consideration , not just the basic salary . <h> The Year Ahead <p> We expect the Human Resources market to see continued growth and expansion in 2016 . This was also highlighted in our survey results with 79% of employers expecting to grow their headcount over the next 12 months . Additionally , 74% of employers surveyed admitted that their company 's performance has increased in 2015 in comparison to the previous year . <p> These results all paint a very positive picture for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland and we see more job opportunities being announced across the board . Employers will continue the search for candidates who are skilled and have experience in specific areas ( i.e. Compensations &amp; Benefits and/or Learning &amp; Development ) . The market is evolving and candidates will now be in a position to be more selective regarding where they work and what packages they receive . These factors will play a big role in the hiring processes in 2016 . <p> For a full list of opportunities in HR , - please click on the following link , you can also contact me on 01-661 0444 or email an updated CV to- paulflynn@lincoln.ie. 139968 @qwx549968

Loan portfolios within these areas are still significant and the potential cost to leaving them short staffed has meant that a number of larger institutions have had to once again look to the external market for staff . The area has actually become very competitive as there was once again activity in the sale of certain loan portfolios and the successful bidders for these projects have had to ensure adequate staffing levels to service them .

Clients are eager not to make the same mistakes they made previously and while they are keenly driving new strategy they are also keen to do so with as little risk as possible and make sure any new business is done in the right way . <p> It is obvious to us that confidence is starting to return to the financial services market and that has been reflected by an increase in salary for key staff and long awaited promotions are starting to be worked through .

@@49783109 @3283109/ <h> Accounting Industry &amp; Commerce Market- Overview <p> 2016 was another solid year in terms of the volume of industry accounting and finance roles that came to the market throughout the year . Employer demand for accountants remained steady as staff turnover in finance roles remained low and this was predominately due to natural attrition . <p> During the year , it tended to be additional hires that were employed for a finance team , rather than replacements . On many occasions , an employer hired a qualified accountant because of an internal promotion or the current incumbent had moved to a new position within the business . <p> This was the case for newly qualified accounting roles , as well as those positions that require an experienced accountant with a number of years PQE . On the senior side , senior management roles ( FC , FD , CFO etc. ) arose on a more ad hoc basis . <p> An accountancy qualification is the foundation for many finance professionals who undertake a wide range of business roles within commercial organisations . Qualified Chartered , Certified and Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success , growth and progress of private and public companies in Ireland , from project management to mergers and acquisitions , leading a system implementation / upgrade to business and financial planning analysis . The past 12 months demonstrate again that an ACA , ACCA or CIMA qualification is the platform to a diverse range of career opportunities . <h> Part-Qualified Market <p> We have witnessed similar observations in the part qualified accountants market where we have seen a significant rise in newly created vacancies throughout Industry and Commerce . Conversely , there has been a decrease in the number of part qualified accountants and finance support professionals coming to the market reiterating once again the candidate driven nature of the overall market . <p> Demand is high specifically for Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable Specialists from entry level roles right up to managerial levels . Moreover , there is a demand for part qualified accountants with strong financial analysis and advanced excel skills . The candidate at this level has become a lot more specific in terms of location , organisational structures , industries and roles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a finance team , rather than a replacement . <h> Salaries <p> While base salary is an important factor in the decision to accept a position , the overall remuneration package will most definitely be considered , including benefits ( pension , health cover etc. ) , the potential for annual bonuses and annual leave days . There was little or no change to salary ranges in 2016 , with employers taking the cautionary step of not hiring new employees with over-inflated salaries . This leaves room for rewarding performance with salary increases internally as an employee develops within the role . The finance team structure , working environment , staff amenities and company culture are all significant considerations for qualified accountants when they decide their next career step . <p> On the infrequent occasions that our industry clients seek our assistance to recruit an Internal Audit Manager or a Treasury Specialist , these candidates can take a significant time to source . <p> If either of these areas are your specialism , remuneration packages are often quite generous when such opportunities arise within commercial businesses arise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the organisation . <h> The Year Ahead/ Future predictions <p> Our expectation is that blue-chip Plcs and multinationals will certainly continue to require finance and accounting roles , but at a more steady pace . Improving economic conditions clearly indicate there will be an increased need for finance headcount in many organisations . <p> However , this will remain closely monitored to ensure there is no over-hiring . Accounting and Finance teams are busy , particularly as reporting deadlines approach . <p> The year ahead is going to be dictated by a shortage of skilled accountants in the newly and recently qualified market and by certain skill sets . Recently qualified accountants of up to 5 years PQE are a scarce commodity across all areas , including Commerce and Industry , Financial Services and Professional Services . It is not unusual for these recently qualified accountants to have as many as 3-5 offers at any one time from prospective employers . <p> Within these specific skill sets , both internal and external audit , commercial business partnering and financial planning all remain in strong demand , while professional practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , organisations will need to have a clear , concise hiring strategy to attract these candidates going into 2017 .

We have witnessed what many thought was unthinkable with Brexit being voted in and already certain arms of investment banks that were previously based in London have been relocated to Dublin and others are planning to follow suit " in what capacity though , remains to be seen . This has obviously been a welcome relief after the previous year 's exits within the banking sector . <h> Area Shortages <p> As with 2015 , 2016 witnessed an increased demand for experienced and qualified Banking and Financial Services professionals across a range of areas . <h> Retail &amp; Business Banking <p> The impact of automation is starting to be felt , particularly in areas such as Retail banking and stockbroking , and we are starting to see the emergence of much higher qualified relationship managers . So much so that we have seen clients look to other industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , this has also meant consolidation within the branch network and an overall restructuring of existing staff . <h> Personal Banking <p> The personal banking space has is now of key strategic importance to the main banks , particularly within the Mass Affluent segment with a number of key players competing for top performing staff . Clients , such as Banks , Life companies and boutique Wealth Management players , have all been successful in growing their service offering and qualified candidates with QFA and CFP qualifications have been in high demand . <h> Lending <p> The Lending space has once again become very competitive across all areas due to the influx and growth of alternative lenders , extra funding from government bodies and an increased appetite from traditional lenders . This has provided a welcome alternative for staff in these areas and allowed them to kick on into specialist areas . <p> Highly qualified candidates coming from Corporate Finance , Investment Banking , Accountancy , Corporate and Commercial Banking have been in high demand in this sector , considering the huge variety of investment focus . From Invoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who would rather seek an alternative to the traditional banking route . Roles vary from analyst positions and relationship managers , all the way up to Investment Director Level . <h> Restructuring <p> We predicted that there would be a slowdown in the restructuring and recovery arms of the banks , and although that was true for the first 4 months of the year , we saw that slowdown steadily increase throughout the year . This was largely due to staff attrition within these areas , with candidates moving to new business areas or out into the wider market with boutique players . Loan portfolios within these areas are still significant and the potential cost of leaving them short-staffed has meant that a number of larger institutions have had to once again look to the external market for staff . The area has actually become very competitive as there was once again activity in the sale of certain loan portfolios and successful bidders for these projects have had to ensure there are adequate staffing levels to service them . This has led to serious pressure on mid-level candidates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4 years , but maximum salary caps have been employed meaning that more senior candidates are not being considered at the moment . <p> Another area that looks likely to have increased hiring is within European banks that are focused primarily in the Corporate space in areas such as Cash Management , Trade Finance and Multinational focused product . We have seen Domestic banks strengthen their corporate teams as well and that trend also looks set to continue as market activity picks up . <h> Salaries <p> Salaries in this sector continue to remain above average compared to other industries and 2016 brought with it further increases across the board , as companies fought to keep their top performers . There is once again more frequent promotion on offer and counter offers are becoming standard practice in this ultra-competitive market . Top tier candidates continue to have numerous options open to them and employers have to ensure that their ambitions are fulfilled internally . We foresee no sign of this abating in the year ahead .

Whilst there has been much speculation that Dublin may benefit as a result of Brexit , this is not yet apparent and it remains very much uncertain . If , however , jobs do end up migrating across the channel , it will place a lot of pressure on the Financial Services market in Ireland and we would expect high pressure , firstly on hiring strategies to keep up with demand and secondly , most definitely on salaries . <p> If you are thinking of looking for new career opporunities , for a confidential discussion please contact me on EBlake@lincoln.ie or call- 01 661 0444. 139968 @qwx549968

We have witnessed what many thought was unthinkable with Brexit being voted in and already certain arms of investment banks that were previously based in London have been relocated to Dublin and others are planning to follow suit " in what capacity though , remains to be seen . This has obviously been a welcome relief after the previous year 's exits within the banking sector . <h> Area Shortages <p> As with 2015 , 2016 witnessed an increased demand for experienced and qualified Banking and Financial Services professionals across a range of areas . <h> Retail &amp; Business Banking <p> The impact of automation is starting to be felt , particularly in areas such as Retail banking and stockbroking , and we are starting to see the emergence of much higher qualified relationship managers . So much so that we have seen clients look to other industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , this has also meant consolidation within the branch network and an overall restructuring of existing staff . <h> Personal Banking <p> The personal banking space has is now of key strategic importance to the main banks , particularly within the Mass Affluent segment with a number of key players competing for top performing staff . Clients , such as Banks , Life companies and boutique Wealth Management players , have all been successful in growing their service offering and qualified candidates with QFA and CFP qualifications have been in high demand . <h> Lending <p> The Lending space has once again become very competitive across all areas due to the influx and growth of alternative lenders , extra funding from government bodies and an increased appetite from traditional lenders . This has provided a welcome alternative for staff in these areas and allowed them to kick on into specialist areas . <p> Highly qualified candidates coming from Corporate Finance , Investment Banking , Accountancy , Corporate and Commercial Banking have been in high demand in this sector , considering the huge variety of investment focus . From Invoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who would rather seek an alternative to the traditional banking route . Roles vary from analyst positions and relationship managers , all the way up to Investment Director Level . <h> Restructuring <p> We predicted that there would be a slowdown in the restructuring and recovery arms of the banks , and although that was true for the first 4 months of the year , we saw that slowdown steadily increase throughout the year . This was largely due to staff attrition within these areas , with candidates moving to new business areas or out into the wider market with boutique players . Loan portfolios within these areas are still significant and the potential cost of leaving them short-staffed has meant that a number of larger institutions have had to once again look to the external market for staff . The area has actually become very competitive as there was once again activity in the sale of certain loan portfolios and successful bidders for these projects have had to ensure there are adequate staffing levels to service them . This has led to serious pressure on mid-level candidates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4 years , but maximum salary caps have been employed meaning that more senior candidates are not being considered at the moment . <p> Another area that looks likely to have increased hiring is within European banks that are focused primarily in the Corporate space in areas such as Cash Management , Trade Finance and Multinational focused product . We have seen Domestic banks strengthen their corporate teams as well and that trend also looks set to continue as market activity picks up . <h> Salaries <p> Salaries in this sector continue to remain above average compared to other industries and 2016 brought with it further increases across the board , as companies fought to keep their top performers . There is once again more frequent promotion on offer and counter offers are becoming standard practice in this ultra-competitive market . Top tier candidates continue to have numerous options open to them and employers have to ensure that their ambitions are fulfilled internally . We foresee no sign of this abating in the year ahead . For breakdown of salaries in this sector please click here <p> Salaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries and 2016 brought with it further increases across the board . <h> In Summary <p> The Banking and Financial Services jobs market will continue to grow in 2017 as confidence in the market returns , coinciding with steady , albeit more conservative economic growth . Whilst there has been much speculation that Dublin may benefit as a result of Brexit , this is not yet apparent and it remains very much uncertain . If , however , jobs do end up migrating across the channel , it will place a lot of pressure on the Financial Services market in Ireland and we would expect high pressure , firstly on hiring strategies to keep up with demand and secondly , most definitely on salaries . <p> If you are thinking of looking for new career opporunities , for a confidential discussion please contact me on EBlake@lincoln.ie or call- 01 661 0444. 139968 @qwx549968
