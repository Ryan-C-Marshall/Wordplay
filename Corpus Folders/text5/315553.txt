The business aviation industry continues to face a slow near-term pace of orders due to a slow-growth economic environment across many global markets along with many political uncertainties , according to the 25th annual Global Business Aviation Outlook released by Honeywell . The Global Business Aviation Outlook forecasts up to 8,600 new business jet deliveries worth $255 billion from 2016 to 2026 , which represents a 6 to 7 percent reduction from the values noted in the 2015 forecast . <p> " We continue to see relatively slow economic growth projections in many mature business jet markets . While developed economies are generally faring better , commodities demand , foreign exchange and political uncertainties remain as concerns , " said Brian Sill , president , Commercial Aviation , Honeywell Aerospace . " These factors continue to affect near- term purchases , but the survey responses this year indicate there is improved interest in new aircraft acquisition in the medium term , particularly in the 2018 " 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year indicated plans to increase usage of current aircraft modestly in the next 12 months , providing some welcome momentum to aftermarket activity , which has been flat recently . " <p> Key global findings in the 2016 Honeywell outlook include : <p> Deliveries of approximately 650 to 675 new jets in 2016 , a low- to mid-single-digit percentage decline year over year . The pullback in deliveries expected in 2016 comes on the heels of a small increase in 2015 and is largely due to slower order rates for mature models and a stabilization in fractional-usage type of aircraft deliveries . <p> 2017 deliveries are projected to be slightly lower , reflecting transitions to new models slated for late 2017 and 2018 service entry . <p> Operators plan to make new jet purchases equivalent to about 27 percent of their fleets over the next five years as replacements or additions to their current fleet , an encouraging increase but one that is less than firm in timing . <p> Of the total purchase plans for new business jets , 21 percent are intended to occur by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 , respectively . <p> Operators continue to focus on larger-cabin aircraft classes , ranging from super mid-size through ultralong-range and business liner , which are expected to account for more than 85 percent of all expenditures on new business jets in the next five years . <p> The longer-range forecast through 2026 projects a 3 to 4 percent average annual growth rate despite the lower short-term outlook as new models and improved economic performance contribute to industry growth . <p> Gains in five-year operator purchase plans are offset in the long-term forecast based on changes in new program timing , slower economic growth projections , and political and currency uncertainties , resulting in a moderately lower overall outlook . <p> BRIC industry purchase plans rebounded off 2015 lows , reaching just over 32 percent in this years survey . The 32 percent rate returns the BRIC composite to a rate exceeding the world purchase plan rate . These purchase plans would reverse several years of decline . <p> Brazil remained a bright spot by recording the strongest new aircraft purchase plans in the survey from a major aircraft market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <p> The combined BRIC countries near-term demand profile has shifted somewhat later in the forecast period this year , with 38 percent of intended new jet purchases scheduled for the next two years . <p> Operators in Asia Pacific report new jet acquisition plans for 28 percent of their fleet over the next five years , roughly doubling from 2015 levels and reflecting optimism extending beyond the China market . <p> Based on the improved level of purchase plans , Asia Pacific could garner up to a 6 percent share of global new jet demand over the next five years . <p> Only 33 percent of Asian respondents plan to schedule their new purchases within the first two years of the five-year horizon . <p> Middle East and Africa " Improved purchase plans were reported , which was unexpected given another year of significant political upheaval and ongoing conflict in the region in tandem with only moderately improved oil prices . <p> The share of projected five-year global demand attributed to the Middle East and Africa recovered to just below its historical range of 4 to 7 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 21 percent of respondents said they will replace or add to their fleet with a new jet purchase , up from 16 percent last year but still below the overall world average .

These improved survey responses appear at odds with the obstinate nature of the issues facing the region . <p> Latin America " 2016 results pulled back in line with the world average , but planned acquisitions remain more front-loaded than the world average . Slightly higher Brazilian purchase plans partially offset broader declines from other countries . <p> Nearly 27 percent of the Latin America sample fleet is expected to be replaced or added to with new jet purchases - 2 to 3 points lower than last years survey .

Resilience in the Brazilian operator base helped offset some of the darker mood elsewhere in the region . <p> With 47 to 48 percent of this regions projected purchases planned to occur between 2016 and 2018 , this indicates some potential deferral of purchases suggested last year for the 2015 " 2017 period , which was equally front-loaded . <p> Based on the current purchase plan levels , Latin Americas 12 percent share of total projected demand slipped several points compared with a year ago . <p> North America " New aircraft acquisition plans in North America are very important given the regions size and the unsettled conditions elsewhere around the world . <p> An estimated 65 percent of projected demand comes from North American operators , up 4 points from the 2015 survey . <p> New jet purchase plan levels rose 5 points in North America , the industrys largest market , and helped drive the world average up to 27 percent . <p> Current plan levels are now in alignment with the averages of the 2008 ? 2012 period .

Europes share of estimated global five-year demand remained at 14 percent in the 2016 survey . This outcome is due in large part to the fact that the European fleet has not expanded in recent years . Many aircraft have migrated to other regions , resulting in an active fleet that is slightly lower despite an infusion of new jet deliveries . <p> A comparison of the planned timing for European purchases indicates uneven proportions of demand in the next three years of the five-year window , with about 26 percent allocated through 2017 followed by a dip to 15 percent each in 2018 and 2019 , suggesting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleets with new acquisitions . <p> Used Jets and Flight Activity Turning to used jets and flight activity , over the course of the past year , the pace of flight activity has not recovered .

With respect to the used jet market : <p> Roughly 10 percent of todays fleet is up for resale , down from a high of nearly 16 percent in 2009 but up from the low point achieved last year . Current levels are still within a reasonable aggregate level in light of the past decades history , but inventory levels are trending up . Meanwhile , asking prices continue to drift lower . <p> In 2016 , the total number of recent model jets ( less than 10 years old ) listed for resale rose significantly to about 675 aircraft , excluding personal jets and business liners . In proportion to the level of overall listings , the share of recent model jets for sale has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition plans by about 8 points , equating to 24 percent of their fleets in the next five years . All regions used jet purchase plans fell . The decline in used jet purchase plans clearly aligns with the expansion of used inventory for sale and continued price pressure on used jets . <p> Weaker used aircraft purchase plans may slow the pace of aircraft upgrades . <p> Making an Impact on Business Decisions <p> This annual outlook reflects topical operator concerns but also identifies longer-cycle trends that Honeywell uses in its own product decision process . The survey has helped identify opportunities for investments in flight-efficiency upgrades , expanded propulsion offerings , innovative safety products , services , upgrades and enhanced aircraft connectivity offerings .
