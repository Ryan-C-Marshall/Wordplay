@@49163387 @2663387/ <h> Bat Roosts <p> The place a bat lives is called its roost . Bats need different roosting conditions at different times of the year and they will often move around to find a roost that meets their needs . Some bats prefer hollow trees , some like caves and some use both at different times . Many bats shelter in buildings , behind hanging tiles and boarding or in roof spaces . <p> UK bats do not construct roosts , but use structures that are already available . <p> Bats are not rodents and they do n't  nibble on wood , wires and other bits and pieces in buildings . <h> Maternity roosts <p> When the weather gets warmer , usually in early summer , pregnant female bats gather together in warm , safe places to have their babies . These roosts are called maternity roosts . Some groups of bats return to the same site every year . <p> A bats pregnancy lasts between six and nine weeks . The length of the pregnancy depends on the species and can be influenced by weather , climate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single baby ( called a pup ) each year . They keep their babies close and nurture them carefully . The young bats are suckled by their mothers for four to five weeks until they are old enough to fly . They then begin to venture out from the roost to forage for food . <h> Hibernation roosts <p> In winter , bats go into hibernation . Hibernation is an extended period of deep sleep ( or torpor ) that allows animals to survive cold winters with harsh weather . A bats body temperature lowers and their metabolic rate slows , meaning they use less energy and can survive on the fat they have stored up instead of trying to forage for food . During hibernation , bats need roosts that are cool and remain at a constant temperature . They often move into underground sites , such as caves . <p> Pipistrelles are our most common bats , but we do n't  know where they all go in winter ! We have not found enough hibernation roosts to account for the numbers we see in the summer months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter when they hibernate . The females then store the sperm and do not become pregnant until the spring . <p> In North America , white-nose syndrome has been associated with the deaths of 5.5 million bats since 2006 . The fungus grows on hibernating bats , irritating and possibly dehydrating them so they wake up . Being aroused from hibernation costs the bats a lot of energy , which makes them lose body fat and can lead to starvation . <h> Roosts in trees <p> Most bats in the UK evolved to roost in trees . Around three quarters of British bat species are known to roost in trees . The remaining species tend to favour human-made structures because of a lack of suitable and available tree habitat . <p> Trees provide shelter and attract a diverse range of insect species for bats to feed on . Since bats are not able to bore holes or make nests , they use whatever gaps are available including cavities and crevices made by other animals , the natural decay of the wood or arboricultural methods . <p> Bats use different parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year and temperature . For example , in the summer bats might use the higher canopy sites to have their young in warmer temperatures . In winter , they might move deeper and lower into the tree to hibernate . Male bats and non-breeding females tend to prefer cooler conditions throughout the year . Breeding females prefer warmer roosts in spring and summer , when raising their baby ( pup ) places high demands on their energy levels . Breeding females cluster together to retain body heat , but they also get through this challenging time by gaining ' free ' heat from tree roosts in two ways : <p> Selecting naturally warm sites , such as sheltered trees receiving some sunshine during the day ; <p> Selecting highly insulated sites , such as a tree hole with a small space and thick wood . <p> Trees such as oak , beech and ash are particularly suitable for bats , but any woodland or tree has potential for a bat roost especially if it has cavities in the trunk or branches , woodpecker holes , loose bark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on how bats use trees , advice on what to do if you have concerns about tree work or are planning to fell or prune a tree , download our useful Bats &amp; Trees leaflet . <p> A collaborative effort between BCT and the Mammal Next Door has taken the Bats &amp; Trees leaflet diagram to produce an electronic poster to help illustrate how important trees are for bat species . This poster can be downloaded here . <h> Roosts in buildings <p> Over the centuries , human development has encroached on woodland and other wild spaces , so bats have adapted to roost in buildings . All our British bat species will make use of buildings on occasion , but for some species , buildings are essential as roost sites . Bats can be found in a variety of buildings and structures such as houses , bridges , barns and churches . <p> Bats often roost in houses , both new and old . You may realise that you have bats roosting in your house during the summer months , when they are more active .

You can also download the booklet at the bottom of the page . <p> Visit the Roost website for case studies on bat roost replacement and enhancement . <h> Underground roosts <p> Bats hibernate where they are less likely to be disturbed by light , noise and predators . Underground sites like caves , mines , cellars and service tunnels are ideal . Such sites are often referred to as hibernacula and they provide the optimum humidity and stable low temperature that bats require during their winter hibernation . Some bats also use underground roosts during the night in summer for feeding or for mating . Of all UK species , greater and lesser horseshoe bats rely most heavily on caves for roost sites .

@@49163391 @2663391/ <h> Buildings , Planning and Development <h> Why do bats roost in buildings ? <p> Bats and people have been sharing dwellings for thousands of years . As natural roosting sites have become scarce due to development and land use change , so the number of artificial roost sites has increased in the form of houses , bridges , mines , barns , icehouses , etc . <p> Man-made roosts can provide stable micro-climates for the bats . Loss of natural roosts has increased the importance of man-made structures for bats to the point that artificial roosts are becoming essential in the survival of many bat species .

@@49163392 @2663392/ <h> Echolocation <p> Bats are not blind ; in fact they can see almost as well as humans . But to fly around and hunt for insects in the dark , they use a remarkable high frequency system called echolocation . <p> Echolocation works in a similar way to sonar . Bats make calls as they fly and listen to the returning echoes to build up a sonic map of their surroundings . The bat can tell how far away something is by how long it takes the sounds to return to them . <p> These calls are usually pitched at a frequency too high for adult humans to hear naturally . Human hearing ranges from approximately 20Hz ( cycles per second ) to 15 to 20 kHz ( 1000Hz ) depending on age . In comparison , some bats can hear sounds up to 110 kHz in frequency . By emitting a series of often quite loud ultrasounds that either sweep from a high to low frequency or vary around a frequency , bats can distinguish objects and their insect prey and therefore avoid the object or catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency ranges that suit their environment and prey types .

These studies have shown that the number of large seeds under the tents is higher than would occur at random , so tentmaker bats might be playing a crucial role in the dispersal of up to 44-65 large seeded plant species throughout the forest .

Natural habitats such as hedgerows , woodlands and ponds have been declining and fragmenting . It is important that we create new suitable habitats and manage and enhance existing habitats to help bats recover and survive . <p> Loss of habitat , the use of pesticides and intensive farming practices have lead to a reduction in the abundance of insects which the bats rely on as their only food source . For example the change from hay making to silage , has meant that many insects do not reach adulthood so there are less flying adults available . Changes in climate may also influence insect life cycles and so this may affect when bats can feed .

@@49163418 @2663418/ <h> Roads <h> A position statement from BCT <p> The construction of roads has the potential to negatively impact bat populations , through loss of roosts , foraging habitats and by severing landscape elements used as commuting routes by bats . Roads create an open space , which most bat species are reluctant to cross . Traffic further increases the barrier effect due to sudden movement , noise , headlamps , street lighting and the risk of collision . Most species of bat fly relatively close to the ground or close to trees and hedges for protection against the weather and potential predators . Those that do cross roads typically do so at traffic height , with a high risk of collision . Research shows that roads also have a major negative impact on bat foraging activity and diversity . <p> Bats are afforded protection by European and UK law in an effort to help bat populations recover from the devastating losses sustained in the last century . Mitigation for the impacts of roads is therefore an essential part of helping to ensure the survival of our bat species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of under-passes ( tunnels and culverts ) and overpasses ( hop-overs , elevated verges and green bridges ) are important for providing safe crossing points for all types of wildlife , including bats . The effectiveness of such schemes in helping biodiversity should be robustly monitored , pre and post-construction , to enhance the design of future mitigation . <p> Wire or mesh structures placed at height over roads , known as bat gantries or bat bridges , have been proposed as artificial road crossing structures for bats and have been erected as mitigation over many roads in the UK and Europe . However , one recent study in the north of England has demonstrated the ineffectiveness of such structures because at the sites investigated the bats still crossed the road at the height of the oncoming traffic . <p> We are keen to see further pre- and post-construction monitoring and research across the UK and Europe to consolidate knowledge on what constitutes effective mitigation for the fragmentation of commuting routes by roads . We would encourage more investigation of natural crossing points such as hop-overs , elevated verges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges ) that could deliver a benefit for the bat species involved , and also for other species impacted by such developments . This is an approach often used in Europe where the use of green bridges is more widely adopted . The effectiveness of such schemes in helping biodiversity should be properly monitored to enhance the design of future mitigation in the UK.

@@49163428 @2663428/ <h> What is white-nose syndrome ? <p> White-nose syndrome ( WNS ) is the name used to describe a group of symptoms associated with the deaths of millions of bats in North America . These symptoms are : <p> bats with a white fungus ( Pseudogymnoascus destructans ) , particularly around the nose , but also on the wings , ears and/or tail ; <p> bats clustered near the entrance of hibernacula , or in areas not normally identified as winter roost sites ; <p> bats flying outside during the day in temperatures at or below freezing ; and/or <p> dead or dying bats in or near hibernation sites . <p> In isolation , the symptoms do not necessarily indicate WNS ; for example bats with a white fungus might otherwise be perfectly healthy . Conversely , not all bats affected with WNS will necessarily be found with white fungus on them . <h> What causes WNS ? <p> The fungus , P. destructans ( previously known as Geomyces destructans ) , has been confirmed as the cause of WNS . It is a soil fungus that grows optimally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bats and causes energetically-expensive arousals from hibernation , loss of body fat and starvation . Recent research has also suggested that infections on the wing membranes of bats may lead to dehydration thereby increasing the frequency of arousals . Additionally where the fungus causes lesions in the wing membrane , this may affect the fitness of bats that survive the hibernation period . It is very likely that P. destructans was introduced into North America from Europe . <h> Have there been any cases of WNS in the UK or Europe ? <p> In Europe the fungus P. destructans was originally identified on a single hibernating bat in France in 2009 . It has been positively identified in a total of 15 European countries ( from molecular analysis ) . This includes the UK where the fungus was first discovered in 2013 , through a combination of active and passive surveillance projects . <p> Unlike North America , there have been no reports of mass die offs and therefore there is no evidence of the syndrome ( WNS ) itself in Europe . It is thought probable that European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over thousands of years of exposure <h> What will happen now there are confirmed cases of P. destructans in the UK ? <p> When P. destructans was confirmed in the UK ( in July 2013 ) , BCT notified bat workers through communications to bat groups , NBMP volunteers and bat carers . We request that all bat workers continue their usual activities , continue to follow the protocols and submit data to BCT/the APHA as this will help us to develop a better understanding of the fungus presence in the UK . <p> The guidelines for bat workers and bat carers were revised following the initial discovery and are reviewed annually ahead of the hibernation season , following updates from researchers in the UK , Europe and North America . <h> What is being asked of UK underground workers ? <p> Primarily , we are asking all visitors to underground hibernation sites to remain vigilant for the symptoms commonly associated with WNS as part of their usual survey activities . We are not requesting that bat workers or other underground users do additional checks for signs of WNS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bats ; in cases where a live bat is found with a suspect fungus , a sample should be taken from visible fungal lesions whilst the bat is in a hanging position . <p> All UK bats and their roosts are fully protected under UK and European legislation . This means that you must not enter a known hibernaculum without an appropriate licence or a licensed bat worker , anddisturbance to bats during licensed work must be kept to a minimum . <h> What decontamination products are recommended ? <p> The decontamination products you use need to contain an anti-fungal agent . Prior to use of a disinfectant please check the relevant product data sheets to ensure anti-fungal action and the correct dilution rates for use . An increased concentration should be used if boots , equipment , etc. are wet . <p> There are a number of disinfectants available that have anti-fungal properties : <p> Ark-Klens available from Vetark ( the ready to use product is 6.04 ; December 2016 price ) <p> Anigene available from various suppliers including online from Amazon ( from 19.99 per litre of concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) available from various suppliers including online from Animal Medication Direct ( 16.39 for 1kg box ; December 2016 price ) <p> Lysol ( Reckitt Benckiser ) available from various suppliers including Amazon ( various sizes and prices ) <p> For easy application , we suggest decanting ready to use disinfectant into a trigger spray container , such as those available from hardware stores ( check usage instructions on the product you have purchase ) .

@@49163433 @2663433/ <h> Population Trend Analysis <p> In order to produce a clear picture of the long-term trend for each species , GAMs ( General Additive Models ) have been used to fit a smoothed line to each dataset , allowing for factors that could influence the means ( e.g. bat detector make , temperature ) where appropriate ( see Barlow et.al. 2015 for more details ) . These smoothed curves are quite robust against random variation between years , except at the ends of the series where annual fluctuations and extreme outliers can have an unacceptably large impact on the first and last few years . To counteract this problem , it is best not to use the first year of a survey as the baseline year ( where the index equals 100 ) and in this report the year 1999 has been taken as the baseline year wherever possible . Most surveys start from 1997 , although there are a few exceptions . The Field Survey starts from 1998 , and some Hibernation Surveys and Roost Counts have earlier years of data for some species . Where these data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in the GAMs but as they comprise small amounts of data , the start year is still shown as 1997 . In all cases , the estimate for the most recent year should be regarded as provisional and a dotted line is used on the graphs to indicate this . <p> The average annual percentage change is an approximation based on the assumption that the trend during the period considered is constant and linear . It is estimated by calculating the annual percentage change that would take the population from 100 in the base year to the index value in the current year . <p> The Generalised Additive Models ( GAMs ) are based on the method described by Fewster et al . ( 2000 ) . These involve fitting a log-linear generalised linear model ( i.e. a regression model with a logarithmic relationship to the explanatory variables and a Poisson error distribution ) to the counts on each survey . A site term is fitted in the model to allow for differences in abundance between sites and the time trend is modelled using the GAM framework to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sophisticated version of a polynomial curve , and are less likely to display misleading trends at the extremes of the data than a polynomial . The degree of smoothing is controlled by specifying the degrees of freedom for the smoothing process ; this may vary between 1 ( equivalent to a simple linear trend ) and one less than the number of years ( a saturated model equivalent to fitting individual annual means ) . For the results presented here the degrees of freedom are generally set to the default value suggested by Fewster et al . ( 2000 ) , which is 0.3 times the number of years . However curves for different degrees of freedom are always checked to ensure that the model provides an appropriate degree of smoothing to the annual means without being unduly influenced by individual outlying years . The index values are derived from the fitted curve , taking the base year to be 100 . Annual means from the saturated model are also shown on the graphs in order to give a visual impression of any deviations from the smoothed curve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits based on standard theory will not be valid due to temporal correlations . In addition NBMP data suffer from other complications not present in the data examined by Fewster et al . which also invalidate the usual method of calculating confidence limits . Firstly the data are much more variable than would be expected from a Poisson distribution . This phenomenon , known as overdispersion , is very common in biological data , but is particularly extreme in these datasets . Fewster et al . ( 2000 ) suggest a negative binomial distribution might be an alternative but simulations suggest that , whilst it sometimes produces more precise results , this is not always the case . Secondly the repeat counts in each year add a further complexity to the correlation structure of the data . All these problems are avoided by using the bootstrap approach recommended by Fewster in which the model is fitted to a large number of new datasets created by resampling sites with replacement from the original sites . At least 400 bootstrap samples are used for each model to ensure robust 95% confidence limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence limits to other quantities of interest , including the short- and long-term assessments used in the Defra biodiversity indicators . <p> Data for Great Britain are weighted to allow for the different sampling rates in England , Scotland and Wales . This is achieved by weighting each site in proportion to the ratio of non-upland area to the number of sites surveyed for the relevant country , thus ensuring that each country contributes equally to the trends based on land area . Weighting is not applied to those species , such as serotine and horseshoe bats , which have a restricted range within the UK . <p> Overdispersion is a particular problem for the bat detector surveys , where a single bat repeatedly flying past the observer may give rise to a large count of bat passes . This results in wide confidence limits for Poisson or negative binomial GAM models and so we have instead presented results for a binomial model of the proportion of observation points on each survey where the species was observed . Apart from this difference in the response variable , the same GAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simulations suggest that these binomial models have greater power to detect trends with the high levels of overdispersion seen in the bat detector surveys . <p> In order to test whether the smoothed curves differed between different countries or regions Fewster et al . ( 2000 ) suggest a deviance test . However , simulations have suggested that this test can produce too many significant results , and so the results presented here use a randomisation approach to obtain a probability value from the change in deviance. 
@@49163438 @2663438/ <h> Roost Visitor Training <p> Bat roost visiting is one of the most important activities carried out by volunteer bat workers . It is suggested that a householder with a roost in their house consults the appropriate Statutory Nature Conservation Organisation ( SNCO ) before taking any action against the bats or their roost , in order that they do n't break the law and take the bats into account . The SNCO ( Natural England , Scottish Natural Heritage , Natural Resources Wales , Northern Ireland Enviornment Agency ) is usually consulted before the householder carries out any activities that may affect the bats , for example , timber treatment , roof repairs or cavity wall insulation . <p> On these occasions , the SNCO will contact a local Roost Visitor , who will visit the householder .

@@49163440 @2663440/ <h> Accommodating Bats in Buildings <p> What do bats look for in a home ? <p> Like us , bats are looking for shelter that is clean ( free of disease and parasites ) , comfortable ( protected from the weather ) and secure ( safe from predators and disturbance ) .

Bats are different to us in that they look for warm roosts in the summer and cool roosts in the winter . <p> Summer : Bats usually only have one young a year . Mother bats gather together and find somewhere warm to rear their young called a maternity roost . Males will form smaller roosts elsewhere that are often cooler than the needs of the females . Generally maternity roosts are usually between 30 and 40C , however species can have their own unique preferences and studies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose one building over another . It is always best to provide a number of different options for bats , so that they can choose the right roost with a temperature based on their needs . <p> Winter : British bats feed on insects which are scarce in the winter . Bats have adapted to this seasonal scarcity by going into hibernation where they lower their body temperature to the ambient temperature or just above . Hibernation roosts are often a cool space with high humidity . For most species this is generally between 0 and 6C , however horseshoe bats prefer slightly warnmer conditions of 6 - 10C . <p> Aspect and orientation <p> Summer maternity roosts in the northern hemisphere often have a southerly or westerly aspect for maximum solar heating .

We are proud to recognise the achievements of these remarkable new researchers and their contributions to bat conservation : <p> We are delighted to announce that Rachael Cooper-Bohannon ( University of Stirling ) is this year 's winner of the award for her contribution on identifying priority areas for bat conservation in southern Africa . <p> In this study , Rachael used species distribution models to model species current distributions and assess species richness across southern Africa and within each of the seven major biotic zones . These species distributions were then used to identify range-restricted and narrow niche breadth species , alongside other features considered to put species at risk .

@@49163493 @2663493/ <p> Surrounding habitat : Soprano pipistrelles preferentially feed on insects in wetland and woodland habitats ( as found in previous studies ) ( Davidson-Watts et al. , 2006 , Nicholls and Racey , 2006 , Bartonicka et al. , 2008 ) but this study has found that the species is more mobile than previously thought . The average mean maximum nightly commuting distance was 4.46 km . This means that it is important to retain wetland , woodland and other trees in the landscape in areas surrounding soprano pipistrelle roosts and where opportunities arise , to recreate these habitats , to compensate for historic and ongoing losses . <p> Alternative roosts : Bats from three soprano pipistrelle colonies in churches in Essex , Norfolk and Peterborough were radio-tracked . These bats were found to use several alternative day roosts across large areas surrounding the church maternity roost , in a variety of structures , which supports the suggestion that this species is a generalist with respect to roosting habitat ( Avery , 1991 ) . However , although some individual bats switched roosts , the " main " church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In total , for all three colonies , only four alternative communal roosts were located , three of which were in domestic houses and the fourth in a garage attached to a domestic house . <p> Bats use churches throughout the year : Soprano pipistrelles were present all year-round in three medieval churches monitored over 12 months . Activity peaked in mid-July , which coincided with the time juveniles were starting to fly . This indicates that without survey work to suggest otherwise , it should generally be assumed that where soprano pipistrelle bats are known to use a church in summer , that they may hibernate there too . The likely year-round use of medieval churches should be taken into account during building repair work ( e.g. by consideration of whether a licence is needed and the timing of such work ) and any mitigation should include provision to replace lost hibernation habitat as well as maternity roosting habitat . <p> Numbers of churches with pipistrelle bats : Surveys of 124 churches with previous records of common or soprano pipistrelle bat roosts , some of which were maternity colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had evidence of these species , relatively few had obvious communal or maternity roosts present . A repeat of the National Bats in Churches Survey ( Sargent , 1995 ) would allow a better understanding of the scale of issues caused by bats in churches . These surveys highlighted that church doors are frequently used for common or soprano pipistrelle species for their access into and out of churches , and that access over doors is sometimes threatened by draught exclusion and by restoration work . <p> Roost selection in churches : Within churches , soprano pipistrelle maternity and communal roosts are more likely to be situated in south-facing rather than north-facing areas . So to encourage bats to use less sensitive areas of the church building , it is important to identify other areas within the church with similar aspect and environmental conditions available for roosting . <p> Churches provide a range of temperature conditions for roosting during summer and winter .

@@49163506 @2663506/ <h> Development <p> Landscape changes that replace semi-natural habitats such as woodland and farmland with urban environments dominated by buildings , roads and other man-made infrastructure ( such as wind turbines ) have the potential to affect bat populations in a number of ways , both directly through habitat loss or fragmentation or indirectly through secondary impacts such as lighting . <h> Urbanisation <p> Some bat species in the UK make use of urban habitats . For example , in a study of habitat use of bats ( predominantly pipistrelle species ) across the UK , urban habitats were positively selected in some land classes and used according to availability in others ( Walsh &amp; Harris 1996 ) ; Leislers bat was shown to use urban habitats and forage along roadsides in a study in Kent ( Waters et al . 1999 ) and common pipistrelles are regularly found in urban habitats ( e.g. Wicht et al . 2003 ) . However data from the National Bat Monitoring Programme was used to show that common pipistrelles demonstrate a strong negative response to local urbanisation ( within 1km ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to the urban landscape ( Lintott et al . 2016 ) . A study in Birmingham , UK , examined bat activity around urban ponds , along an urban-rural gradient and showed that most bat species studied demonstrated a negative association with urbanisation ( Hale et al . 2012 ) . However , common pipistrelle displayed a nonlinear relationship between activity and built area . Activity was highest at around 40% built land-cover but rapidly reduced as built land-cover increased above 60% , leading the authors to propose that this may represent a threshold or tipping point . <h> Loss of roosts <p> A fundamental ecological requirement for all bat species is the use of roosts ( safe resting places which play many different roles in the bat life-cycle ) . Bats need suitable roosting locations within commuting distance of foraging habitat and most species make use of several different types of roost during the year to meet different biological and energetic needs . Many different natural and man-made structures may be used as roosts by bats . Examples of man-made structures that are used as roosts in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flats , barns and stables ( Marnell &amp; Presetnik 2010 ) and at least 13 of the 17 bat species that are resident in the UK are known to use built structures for roosts . Within Europe all bat roosts have legal protection from damage or destruction . <p> While little is published on the extent to which roost availability may limit the distribution or abundance of bats , the loss of roosts was one of the factors implicated in late twentieth century population declines ( Racey &amp; Stebbings 1972 , Stebbings 1995 ) . Renovation of or refitting existing buildings and the conversion of buildings such as barns to new uses may often result in them becoming less suitable as bat roosts . Some species , for example Natterers bat and brown long-eared bat , are considered to be especially vulnerable to such changes , because they have quite specific roosting requirements which may not be present after buildings have been altered . Recent changes in building practices to enhance energy efficiency are a new concern , since these buildings may offer few opportunities for use by bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of natural roosts has also been a serious issue in the past , and remains an ongoing risk . The widespread loss of cave and underground hibernation sites through destruction , blocking and gating of entrances is considered to have contributed to past population declines ( Stebbings 1995 ) . Roosts in trees are vulnerable to management practices that selectively remove important potential roosting sites such as standing deadwood or trees that have woodpecker holes .

Sensitive and proactive woodland management can help protect bats as well as enhancing the habitat for bats and a host of other wildlife . <p> Because bats are so sensitive to light , heat and humidity , woodland managers need to consider the impact of operations in the vicinity of trees with roosts .

However , current biodiversity approaches taken by industry , planners and designers are often tokenistic , contributing little to overall ecological value and resilience . To address this issue , a four-year partnership study between BCT and University College London was launched in September 2012 . The research aims to overcome barriers to integrating biodiversity into the built environment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green infrastructure . <p> In the first year of the project a systematic review was conducted to investigate the ecological effects of different forms of urban development . It was discovered that the core of cities are very degraded in terms of the number of species they support , but that urban suburbs often support diverse ecological communities , sometimes being more ecologically rich than less disturbed areas outside of cities . These patterns are now being looked at in more detail in order to understand how cities can be designed and developed to support biodiversity . <p> The project also aims to improve the way biodiversity is monitored in cities . Monitoring urban biodiversity is typically difficult due to the difficulties of getting access to sites , safety concerns of surveyors and equipment security issues . This project is investigating whether soundscape monitoring could provide a new opportunity for monitoring biodiversity in the urban environment . This has involved microphones being deploying across London to record the urban soundscape and the development of methods to automatically identify the sounds recorded , which include bats , birds , invertebrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are typical of a busy metropolitan city . In addition to developing the technology to automatically identify the sounds recorded , the project is also investigating what these sounds can tell us about the environment they were recorded in . Perhaps the characteristics of the soundscape can be used as a proxy measure for the ecological health of an environment ? If so , soundscape monitoring could provide an opportunity to monitor long-term biodiversity trends in the urban environment . <p> Several manufacturers are reporting breathable roofing membranes as ' bat friendly ' . These claims have not been substantiated by any scientific research . In fact , there are an increasing number of reported cases where bats have died after becoming entangled by fibres that had been pulled loose and concerns have been raised following reports of roost abandonment .

The results of this study so far , have been reported in a number of publications , listed here . <p> Green spaces within urban areas can be important for ameliorating the impacts of urbanisation on biodiversity , and can hold relatively rich wildlife communities . Understanding how different species use urban environments and how habitat management and urban planning can promote population persistence is therefore important in conserving them . Although it is well known that some bat species forage in urban gardens and parks , and are able to exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as roost sites , little is known about the ecology of bats in urban environments . Whilst some studies have shown a general avoidance of urban areas by bats , others have suggested that urban environments may have a positive role to play in resource availability for some bat species , particularly in landscapes dominated by intensive agricultural land use . <p> The aim of this PhD is to investigate the ecology of bats in urban areas and how this is influenced by habitat composition and configuration of the surrounding landscape . Work is currently underway to assess resource availability and bat activity and abundance in urban woodlands . Future work will use data from BCTs National Bat Monitoring Programme to investigate associations between urbanisation , species diversity and foraging activity . <p> Some results of this study have been reported in the following publications : <p> Bats , churches and the landscape : sustainable conservation of bats in the East of England , University of Bristol <p> In the early 1990s BCTs original Bats in Churches project estimated that 60% of pre-16th Century churches host bat roosts .

A regional survey has been undertaken to establish the occurence of bats in relation to church and habitat data . The field research involves radiotracking and studies of roost microclimate conditions . In a small number of churches , heated bat boxes are being trialled as an approach to mitigate the impact of the roosting bats on the church community .

Radio-tracking was used to determine whether the bats depended on the churches as roosting sites or also used other roosts , and to reveal how they used the landscape . The project involved modifying environmental conditions to encourage bats to relocate to alternative , less sensitive areas of the church building . To do this alternative roosting areas were provided both within and outside of church buildings and deterrents were trialled under license inside the body of the church . Radio-tracking was then used to determine how bat roosting and foraging behaviour were affected . The research was overseen by a Project Advisory Group including Natural England , Defra , the Church Building Council , English Heritage and National Trust , to ensure that the work was is in the interests of both bat and church conservation , and addressed the concerns of all stakeholders . <p> Impact on bat populations of exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some circumstances , house owners or tenants are affected severely by the presence of a bat roost , for example in the case of genuine phobias . In exceptional circumstances , bats can be excluded from a roost in a house under license . Although a key requirement of current legislation is that licensed activities will not be detrimental to the population , very little is known about the real impact of exclusion on colonies and the status of local populations . Between 2011 and 2014 , Defra funded research at the University of Bristol ( with BCT and BTO as subcontractors ) focused on the soprano pipistrelle , a species that is commonly the subject of domestic exclusion requests . The work attempted to assess the impact of roost exclusion , where alternative roosts are not provided , on subsequent roosting and foraging behaviour and modelled the likely impact on local population status .

BCT and the PAG were committed to ensuring that all relevant bat conservation and welfare issues were addressed , and considered aspects such as the criteria for site selection , methods and timing of exclusions , ethics , welfare , and conservation relevance to ensure the study minimised the impact on bats and bat roost owners and took into account the interests of the wider community of batworkers , roost visitors and roost owners . <h> Species conservation and landscape-scale studies <p> Habitat use by woodland bat species in Britain , University of Bristol <p> This study of woodland bat species focussed in particular on the cryptic small Myotis bats : whiskered bat , Brandts bat and Alcathoe bat .

Most commonly the offers relate to taxidermy specimens , specimens encased in resin or preserving fluid and less commonly mounted skeletons .

Since 2005 there has been widespread uptake of schemes in England : for example by 2009 66% of farmland was enrolled in a scheme and 41% of hedgerows were managed under a scheme ( Natural England 2009 ) . In 2012 AES guidance in England was updated to include information for farmers on the requirements of bats and the management options they could choose which may benefit them ( Natural England 2012 ) . These include enhanced hedgerow management , developing strips of scrub along woodland edges and establishment of hedgerow trees . <p> Across Europe there have been concerns about inadequate ecological evaluation of AES ( Kleijn &amp; Sutherland 2003 , Primdahl et al . 2003 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been mixed , with common species often benefitting more than rarer species ( e.g. Kleijn et al . 2006 ) . For bats , Fuentes-Montemayor et al . ( 2011 ) studied the effect of AES in Scotland and found that pipistrelle bats did not benefit from a combination of AES prescriptions , including the management of field margins and water margins , as well as hedgerow cutting regimes , with overall levels of bat activity being lower ( by 4050% ) on farms under AES than those not participating in schemes . There have been few studies on the benefits of specific AES management prescriptions on bat activity . However , there is evidence that a range of bat species benefit from hedgerow management that results in larger , bushy hedgerows . <h> Trees in hedgerows <p> In England in 2010 an AES option was added to reward landowners for maintaining hedgerow trees . There is evidence that some bat species are more active around hedgerows with trees ( e.g. Linton 2010 ) and therefore bats may benefit from these measures . Boughey et al . ( 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedgerows with or without trees , linear features with trees were preferred by soprano pipistrelle . The use of linear features by this species was affected by the density of trees within the feature , as well as the distance from the nearest woodland and results suggested that hedgerows without trees were utilised only when higher quality habitats were unavailable . <h> The Greater Horseshoe Bat Project <p> The Greater Horseshoe Bat Project which ran between 1998 and 2003 provided advice for landowners in Devon , Cornwall and Somerset on the management of key greater horseshoe bat foraging areas . Landowners were encouraged to enter into agreements of the Countryside Stewardship Scheme ( CSS ) , which included management options thought to benefit the species . CSS agreements included management options aimed at improving foraging areas such as reverting arable land to grazed grassland , creating wide grassy margins in arable fields and management of permanent pasture and hay meadows with targeted grazing regimes to increase prey populations .

The information produced by the NBMP is used by Government and conservation bodies to inform evidence needs , address policy-relevant questions and provide metrics of bat population status , change and distribution . <p> Data from four ' core ' NBMP surveys are used to produce population trends : Roost Count , Hibernation Survey , Field Survey and Waterway Survey . <p> Volunteers taking part in our four core surveys contributed approximately 17,700 hours of their time , representing an in-kind contribution to the NBMP of 264,760 . <p> In total 6,330 sites have been surveyed as part of the NBMP since its inception in 1996 . In 2016 1,984 sites were surveyed by 960 volunteers . <p> At present sufficient data are collected by the NBMP to produce population trends for 11 of Great Britain 's 17 resident bat species . <p> Of these species , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the baseline year of monitoring ( 1999 for most species ) . <p> Species considered to have increased in Great Britain in comparison to the baseline year are greater horseshoe bat , lesser horseshoe bat , common pipistrelle and soprano pipistrelle .

However these findings should be treated with caution for several species : <p> Serotine is encountered relatively infrequently during surveys and therefore there is a high level of uncertainty associated with serotine trends , meaning population changes are more difficult to detect for this species . <p> Trends for whiskered/Brandt 's bat combine data from two species with differing ecological requirements and potentially differing conservation status , and may also include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For brown long-eared bat , the Roost Count trend shows no significant change since the baseline year , while the Hibernation Survey shows a marginally significant decline in the most recent year when compared to the baseline year .

@@49163556 @2663556/ <h> Loss of linear features <p> Linear landscape features , such as hedgerows and tree lines , are important habitats for bats , providing flight paths between roosts and foraging sites and as foraging habitats ( e.g. Verboom &amp; Huitema 1997 , Oakeley &amp; Jones 1998 , Russ &amp; Montgomery 2002 ) . Common and soprano pipistrelle , Daubentons bat , Natterers bat , greater horseshoe bat , lesser horseshoe bat , brown long-eared bat and serotine all forage or commute along linear features ( e.g. Limpens &amp; Kapteyn 1991 , Downs &amp; Racey 2006 ) . However , the dependency on linear features in the landscape varies between species : while smaller species such as Daubentons bat and common pipistrelle most commonly choose to avoid open areas by following linear features quite closely , larger species such as noctule will cross open areas more often and intermediate species such as serotine do both ( Limpens &amp; Kapteyn 1991 , Verboom &amp; Huitema 1997 ) . <h> Loss of hedgerows <p> Widespread hedgerow removal occured between the 1960s and early 1990s to allow improvements to farming efficiency , stock-proofing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although hedgerow loss slowed in the 1990s and agri-environment schemes encourage their reinstatement and better management , there is continued severance of these important commuting and foraging habitats due to increasing urbanisation and new infrastructure development , of for example roads .

Russ et al . ( 2003 ) recorded low pipistrelle activity in areas of improved grassland with cut hedgerows less than 0.5m high , while Russ and Montgomery ( 2002 ) found that hedgerows were generally avoided in Northern Ireland and suggest that it is due to the predominance of mechanically cut , box-shaped hedgerows . <p> There is also evidence that bats prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in Holland for example , Limpens and Kapteyn ( 1991 ) found that linear elements such as hedgerows of less than 1m in height were rarely used ; in England greater horseshoe bats in particular prefer tall and wide hedgerows ( 2-5m in height and width ) ( Duverge &amp; Jones 2003 ) and one study ( Bates 2010 ) found that activity of several species ( including Myotis species , serotine and Nyctalus species ) was higher at large hedgerows than small hedgerows on farms . Although pipistrelles are strongly associated with hedgerows , analysis of NBMP data has shown that the size of the hedgerows seems to be less important for common and soprano pipistrelle ( Boughey et al . 2011 ) . <p> The general preference for larger hedgerows may be due to the windbreak effect of bigger hedges and a higher abundance of insects on the sheltered side of the hedge .

@@49163557 @2663557/ <h> News <h> 21 December 2012 <p> Parish churches are treasured places of worship and enduring features of our landscape . Since many churches house bat roosts , churches are also important to bat conservation . Bat populations suffered huge declines in the last century , as important features of our landscape were lost or degraded and consequently all bats and their roosts in Great Britain are protected by law ( The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 ( as amended ) ) . Churches have been constant features , and the only national survey ( Sargent 1995 ) , concluded that at least 60% pre-16th Century churches could have roosting bats . At least 8 species of bat are known to roost in church buildings , including some of our rarer species and some churches have provided sanctuary over many generations . The Bat Conservation Trust ( BCT ) values the contribution made to society by the many churches that support or tolerate the conservation of bats , and by doing so set a good example of how individuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse biodiversity declines . <p> The Bat Conservation Trust recognises that in some cases , the presence of bats can be very problematic for those who use or maintain church buildings , and that integrating the protection of bats into the care of church buildings can be challenging , especially for small or under-resourced communities . Although many churches may be unaware of the presence of small numbers of bats , some churches that host large bat roosts experience a range of challenges due to the presence of bats . These include people being discouraged or prevented from using and enjoying the church for worship or community activities because of an unpleasant or unclean environment ; difficulty in maintaining their historic buildings and the contents , and cleaning and protecting heritage objects . Although this is very distressing , it is often possible to find solutions to address or alleviate such problems , given the right support , and the willingness to find a solution that helps both people and bats . BCT wants to ensure that all churches that have bat roosts , have the advice and support they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bat Conservation Trust is working with Natural England , Church of England and through several research projects , to improve the guidance , support and options available for churches . <p> The Bat Conservation Trust is very sympathetic to the congregation of St Hildas , Ellerburn and we recognise that they have struggled to cope with the impact of a regionally important colony of Natterers bats over a long period of time . We understand that this case is particularly challenging and that Natural England , North Yorkshire Bat Group and Church of England have devoted considerable time and financial resources to resolving the issues at St Hildas . In most cases , it is possible to work towards solutions that support both people in the church community and bat populations . In some cases there have been requests to remove bats or prevent bats from roosting , however this can put bats at risk , and damage bat populations .

We believe the proposal is unlikely to provide an effective solution for the church community or bats , and has the potential to damage bat conservation .

Similarly the process allows little time to explore satisfactory alternatives to excluding bats . Currently the alternative roosting sites constructed around Ellerburn have not been proved to be used by bats . We are concerned that allowing an exclusion in these circumstances will set a precedent that could lead to applications for similar exclusions of bat colonies from other buildings such as developments . <p> The Bat Conservation Trust strongly urges Natural England to re-evaluate its proposals and the time-frame in which it seeks to apply them .

No evidence of how bats use alternative roosts or the surrounding habitat has been gathered at the church , despite the history of problems . Natural England should study how the bats use the area throughout the active season before making any decisions . The Bat Conservation Trust has seen no clear evidence on the suitability of the alternative artificial roosts in the lych-gate and neighbouring barn . Natural England should seek to ensure that all factors that might impede the use of these alternatives are addressed before any exclusion is licensed . Natural Englands own guidelines state that evidence of the use of replacement alternative roosts should be established prior to exclusion .

@@49163566 @2663566/ <h> Climate change <p> Climate change is one of the most important drivers of current and likely future change in global ecosystems . Increasing temperatures , changes in patterns of precipitation and altered weather patterns are likely to have damaging impacts on biodiversity for the most part , although some species in some parts of the world may benefit . Species are expected to move away from their traditional areas as our climate changes to find new locations with suitable climate and habitat , which could lead to declines in numbers or loss of populations if new favourable areas are not available or species are unable to move . Changes in the timing of when species breed , move to wintering sites or when their food is available may also have impacts on populations . <h> Climate change in the UK <p> In the UK , our climate has already shown signs of change over the last 100 years , with an increase of 1 degree C in central England during that period , for example ( Hulme et al . 2002 ) . The trends of overall increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to continue . Average annual UK temperatures are predicted to increase until the 2080s with an earlier onset of spring and a later onset of winter . Average annual precipitation is likely to decrease overall but with wetter winters , drier summers and more frequent periods of extreme weather ( Hulme et al . 2002 ) . Climate change has an impact on our biodiversity . <h> Impacts of climate change on bats <p> So how might climate change affect bats in the UK ? Bats may be affected at all stages in their annual cycle : temperature changes may affect hibernation of bats , both in terms of the availability of suitable sites and behaviour , length and timing of hibernation . Changes in temperature and precipitation may affect breeding success of female bats through changes in prey availability , including the time of year when insects are abundant . Climate change may also affect the habitat types and insect prey types available for bats for foraging , which could have indirect effects on bat populations . The distribution of UK bat species may also change in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that climate has had an impact on our horseshoe bats . It is likely that the very cold winters in the second half of last century reduced population sizes of horseshoe bats , but it has been suggested that more recently the mild winters have allowed populations of both lesser and greater horseshoe bat to recover ( Ransome 1989 ; Battersby 2005 ) . Spring temperature is also important for some bat species : greater horseshoe bat numbers increased after a period of warm springs for example ( Ransome &amp; McOwat 1994 ) and the timing of births is influenced by spring temperatures in pipistrelles ( Racey &amp; Swift 1981 ) and greater horseshoe bats . However we do n't  yet know enough to determine whether reproductive success of bats is directly related to climate or to the availability of their insect prey ( which may also be affected by climate ) and it is possible that there could be mismatches between timing of breeding and the availability of food , particularly for specialist species of bat reliant on particular prey types ( Rebelo et al . 2010 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year if spring temperatures are higher and then could be at risk from mortality during subsequent cold periods ( Jones et al . 2009 ) . <p> As temperatures increase with climate change , shifts in or expansion of species ' ranges are expected to be in a northerly direction or to higher elevations . Some UK bat species reach the northern limit of their range in the UK and are predicted to expand northwards in the future ( Rebelo et al . 2010 ) . However , this assumes that there will be suitable roosts and habitats available and that the bats are able to disperse successfully into new areas . Dispersal may be more likely for bat species than other mammals due to their ability to fly and for some species , to migrate . The extent of bat migration in the UK is not well documented but it is likely that most bat species in the UK are less migratory than in continental Europe where long distance migrations have been recorded for a number of species ( Hutterer et al . 2005 ) . There is evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be showing a range response to climate change . Records for this species have increased in recent years , and its recorded range expansion in the UK matches that predicted by changes in climate over the last few decades ( Lundy et al . 2010 ) . <p> More research and ongoing monitoring of population change is needed before we can fully understand how bat species will be impacted by the future predictions of climate change in the UK.

The award encourages postgraduate students to conduct substantive bat research projects by providing them with financial support . <p> It is with great pleasure that we are able to announce that Kristen Lear ( PhD candidate at the University of Georgia ) is the first recipient of the Kate Barlow Award . Her research project focuses on conserving the endangered Mexican long-nosed bat ( Leptonycteris nivalis ) . This species is a rare but vital pollinator , classified as endangered by the IUCN due to drastic declines of over 50% in the past 10 yearsa decline expected to continue without immediate conservation action . Each spring , the females migrate 1200 km northward from central Mexico to northeast Mexico and the U.S. southwest , where they give birth to their young . During their journey , they rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during foraging provide critical pollination services to the plants which are of vital ecological , cultural and economical value . <p> The project aims to implement community bat-friendly agave management programs in northeast Mexico .

Findings will be incorporated into the revision of the Species Recovery Plan through my involvement in the Nivalis Conservation Network , a bi-national group of researchers , NGOs , and government agencies from the U.S. and Mexico working towards the conservation of this species . <p> The BCT would like to thank Kristen for her incredible efforts in aiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project will lead to an immediate and significant benefit for the species .

Its important not to survey alone so make sure you bring a friend or family member to help you . <p> Bring suitable clothing . Remember to bring warm clothing as it can be cold after dark and at dawn , plus waterproofs in case of rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see above link ) , a pen , a torch and a watch or mobile phone so you can check the time . If doing the Sunrise Survey you will need an alarm clock to wake you up early ! <p> Do n't  worry if you do n't  know how to identify different bat species . It is fine to just record that you have seen bats , though the instructions include a simple guide to species identification if you would like to have a guess at which species you are seeing . <p> Try not to disturb the bats . Avoid shining your torch at the bats and in particular where they might be roosting . <p> Take care . Use the torch for your own safety , to check for trip hazards , low hanging branches and any other obstacles . <h> Sunset Survey <p> Where to do the survey . Just go into your garden or a local open space . Make sure it is somewhere that has public access or you have permission to be . Also make sure that it is n't a public park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survey . The survey starts at sunset and you can find out sunset times on the front of your instructions booklet . <p> Choosing where to look for bats . If possible , go where there are features that tend to be attractive to bats , such as trees or water . Stand where you are likely to be able to see bats silhouetted against the sky . <p> What to record . Watch out for any bats that fly past . Record how many you see and which direction they appear to come from . <h> Sunrise Survey <p> There are two different ways you can do this survey <p> Stand outside a structure that you think bats might use . This can be your own house or a neighbours ; a public building such as a church , town hall or school ; a structure on public land , such as a bridge or tunnel ; or a tree . Do n't  survey a private property without the consent of the owner . <p> Do a walk near your house . Choose a route that takes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trees and bridges . Make sure you stick to public rights of way and avoid dangerous areas . Walk the route beforehand during daylight hours to familiarise yourself with it . <p> Or you can do both . Do a walk that also includes standing outside a structure for part of the time . <p> If you already did the Sunset Survey and spotted bats flying from a particular direction , then you can explore in that direction when doing the sunrise survey . <p> When to start the survey . The survey starts an hour before sunrise and you can find out sunrise times on the front of your instructions booklet . <p> What to record . Any bat sightings . In particular , make sure you record if you see bats swarming around a structure as this indicates that they are roosting there . This is an amazing sight !

To enable bat populations to continue to recover , we need the help of everyone including Churches , in many cases church roosts are of high conservation value to bats .

The common and soprano pipistrelle were only identified as separate species in the 1990s but this research indicates that the soprano pipistrelle ( Pipistrellus pygmaeus ) has very different habitat preferences within the urban settings . <p> The research was led by Paul Lintott ( University of Exeter ) who studied the two pipistrelle species using data from the NBMP , a long-running citizen science scheme ( more about this project HERE ) . The scientists aimed to determine if these two similar species responded similarly to an urban landscape and how the latter affected their distribution . <p> Contrary to what is frequently assumed the two pipistrelle species had distinctive responses to their anthropogenic environment . The soprano pipistrelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of freshwater compared to the common pipistrelle .

P. pipistrellus was actually more frequently recorded in urban landscapes containing a high proportion of green space and it showed a strong decline in areas of " gray space " ( i.e. buildings and roads ) . <p> The authors , thus , demonstrate that even what is considered to be a very adaptable UK bat species the common pipistrelle can be negatively affected by urbanisation .

@@49163664 @2663664/ <p> We wanted to contact you to let you know that a Daubentons bat has tested positive for European Bat Lyssavirus strain 2 ( EBLV2 ) ( a rabies virus ) at a site in North Yorkshire . The bat was submitted to the Animal &amp; Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) as part of the on-going passive surveillance scheme . <p> This is not a cause for concern as we have known of the presence of EBLV2 at a very low level in our Daubentons bat population for a number of years . The presence of the virus in a small number of bats ( a total of 13 positive bats , including this most recent case ) does not affect the UKs rabies-free health status . There was no bite incident ( neither person nor animal ) associated with this case and therefore Public Health England have confirmed that there is no public health risk linked with this incident . <p> If you have any questions about this case or the general situation relating to rabies in the UK there is information on the BCT website or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bat Helpline ( enquiries@bats.org.uk or 0345 1300 228 ) . <p> The bat in item 1 . was tested under the surveillance programme to monitor for EBLV in Great Britain . More than 13,000 bats have been tested since 1986 and only 11 have previously been found to be infected via this programme . All were Daubentons bats and the last case was in 2015 ( a further bat was found to be positive under a different scheme in 2010 , making the total 13 in all ) . <p> Of the more than 13,000 bats submitted to the scheme less than 500 have been Daubentons bats . We would therefore like to take this opportunity to encourage bat workers to submit dead bats ( for example ones that have died in care , been found during roost visits , etc. ) for testing . The passive surveillance programme is important to our understanding of the distribution of EBLV2 in the UK . <p> The APHA are especially interested in Daubentons bats , Natterers bats and serotines but all species ( apart from pipistrelles ) are accepted . Pipistrelles no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of those involved in a bat bite incident with either a person or another animal such as a cat or a dog ; or where identification of the species is in doubt . <p> The National Bat Helpline ( enquiries@bats.org.uk or 0345 1300 228 ) can send out packs to people who want to submit bats for testing . <p> EBLV is normally transmitted by means of a bite or scratch from an infected bat . The risk of the disease being passed from a bat to a human or other mammal is very low because the disease is present at such low levels in Great Britain and most people have very minimal contact with bats . However , as a precaution anyone who regularly handles bats in the UK is routinely vaccinated against rabies and BCT recommends that anyone needing to handle a bat wears gloves . <p> If you have questions about vaccinations , the wearing of gloves , or the general situation relating to rabies in the UK there is information on the BCT website or you are welcome to contact the National Bat Helpline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookings for the National Bat Conference 2016 have now closed .

The Bat Conservation Trust would like to reassure churches with bats that , in many cases , their historic buildings and artefacts can be used , maintained and enjoyed the without excessive costs being incurred . There is no evidence to suggest that in the UK bat urine or droppings carry diseases that are harmful to humans . <p> British bats not a risk to public health <p> The Bat Conservation Trust was dismayed by Sir Tony Baldry MPs irresponsible statements about bats and disease in the Westminster Hall debate . He quoted from a paper published by the Royal Society out of context , citing bats as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily focusses on bats in Africa and Asia and viruses not known in Europe.This is misleading and may cause undue alarm about the risk bats pose to human health . <p> Author of the Royal Society paper Dr Luis explains " I do find this use of our paper disturbing .

Since many churches house bat roosts , churches are also important to bat conservation . Bat populations suffered huge declines in the last century , as important features of our landscape were lost or degraded and consequently all bats and their roosts are protected by law in the UK by both domestic and European legislation . <p> Around 60% of pre-16th century churches may be home to bat roosts . At least 8 species are known to use churches as roosts , ( resting places to rear young , or shelter from predators ) , including some of our rarer species . Many churches happily co-exist with the bats roosting in their buildings . Some do n't  even notice bats roosting with in the building . <p> As highlighted in the State of Nature report this summer , Britains wildlife is in critical condition and needs the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy . The Bat Conservation Trust ( BCT ) values the contribution made to society by the many churches that support or tolerate the conservation of bats . <p> However , the Bat Conservation Trust ( BCT ) recognises the severe problems that some churches experience when large roosts of bats are present inside church buildings and that droppings and urine can affect not only the church fabric and furnishings , but the ability of church congregations to worship and use the church building for the full benefit of the church community . BCT is deeply sympathetic to the church communities that experience this problem . <p> Protecting bat roosts in churches <p> The Bat Conservation Trust believes it is vital that the current levels of protection afforded to vulnerable species like Britains bats should be maintained . Certain species of bats will always seek sanctuary in churches . We believe legislation alone can not address the problems that some churches experience . Practical solutions for churches lie in developing , researching and sharing information on approaches that work and improving access to specialist support services . <p> On-going research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This looks at understanding how bats use churches and trials techniques to mitigate their impact on church users , by deterring bats from the most sensitive parts of church buildings . Research at University College London to understand how bat faeces and urine affect artefacts , with the purpose of addressing problems is also on-going . BCT is also encouraging the sharing of information on practical solutions that have been used by ecologists . <p> Calls for exclusion of bats from inside church buildings , often do not recognise the technical challenge of preventing very small animals accessing very large old buildings with many tiny gaps . Were exclusions to become common place in churches , bat populations could be harmed . However BCT accepts that in some situations it may be necessary to use interventions to restrict the activity of bats or even , in rare situations to exclude bats if the bats have an alternative roost site , but in many cases other solutions can be found . BCT is collaborating with two research projects that seek to mitigate the impact of bats where severe problems occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal without a license . Bats should not be prevented from roosting ( excluded ) except where all other options have been exhausted and the conservation status of the bats will not be affected . <p> To help churches with bats the Bat Conservation Trust is working on the following areas : <p> The Bats , Churches and Communities pilot project is working with churches , communities and volunteers to build partnerships , develop the available help and support and explore practical , cost-effective solutions . It is a pilot project due to end in August - a longer term large-scale programme is needed to ensure all church communities get the help they need . This project has developed draft guidance for parishes , written solution-focused studies for the Church Care website and supported new bat worker training .

We would encourage more churches call the Bat Helpline 0845 1300 228 . <p> Bat Conservation Trust is calling for more support for volunteers to be given specialist training to help churches in areas where the problems seem greatest . <p> Bat Conservation Trust is calling on the Government to help provide clear guidance on the support available to parish churches about bats in churches . <p> Julia Hanmer , Chief Executive Bat Conservation Trust , says : <p> " As both a committed Christian and conservationist I have been lucky enough to see churches putting into practice the Church of Englands mission of " strivingto safeguard the integrity of creation and sustaining and renewing the life of the earth. <p> Many churches have the potential to play a key role in conservation if given the right support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace this role , sometimes even in challenging circumstances .

We want to make sure that considering bats in building works is straight forward , easy to integrate with existing processes and not a burden , or excessive expense and we want those churches that are struggling with droppings and urine to have a route to help . We want to make more people aware of this service . <p> Training more volunteers to give advice to churches . In some parts of the country there are n't  enough bat experts with the skills to help churches .

Could there be more support for churches by establishing a fund churches could access to allow them to participate in wildlife conservation ? In some cases where churches want to undertake complex building work , there may be costs involved from employing an independent professional ecological consultant and from the measures taken to accomodate bats . In much the same way that a church will pay an architect or building conservation expert to ensure building works are in keeping with heritage protection , sometimes an independent professional ecological consultant needs to be employed to ensure repairs and alterations safeguard nature and preserve the features that native species depend on for their survival .

This approach means that , for some species , bats are surveyed at more than one stage of their annual life cycle . As a general rule , trends from the Field Survey and Waterway Survey are currently considered most robust , followed by the Hibernation Survey , and then Roost Counts . <p> A sampling approach is used on all surveys with the assumption that trends occurring in sample sites reflect trends occurring in the general population .

Introduction <p> The three applied research studies were established by University of Bristol , and supported by the Bat Conservation Trust as part of BCTs strategy to ensure bat conservation is underpinned by sound evidence . Each of the projects aims to understand better the ecology of the species concerned with a particular focus on improving the practices used when people consider bats to be a problem . <p> 2 . Impact of exclusion of bats from roosts in houses <p> Background <p> Roost owners are sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. in the case of genuine phobias . In exceptional circumstances , exclusion of bats from domestic properties can be licensed without provision of alternative roosting sites . A key requirement of current legislation is that licensed activities will not be detrimental to the population concerned , but in reality very little is known about the actual impact of exclusions on bat colonies and the effect it has on local population status . In 2011 Defra commissioned the University of Bristol , with BCT and the British Trust for Ornithology ( for their population monitoring expertise ) as subcontractors , to assess the impact of roost exclusion on soprano pipistrelles , when alternative roosts are not provided . Specifically the 32-month study seeks to determine if excluded colonies relocate to sub-optimal roosts e.g. those with differing thermal properties , light levels etc , whether the bats maintain the same foraging areas and remain in the same locality , and whether excluded colonies have poorer breeding success . BCT sees a clear need to determine whether bats excluded from houses are able to find suitable alternative roosts and to determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamics , as this evidence could enable Natural England and BCT guidance to be updated . <p> Update on the study <p> Studies to assess how soprano pipistrellesrespond to exclusion were planned to take place in spring 2012 and 2013 at three roost sites in each year ( a total of six sites ) . Throughout last summer , householder exclusion applications to the National Bat Helpline were scrutinised for potential participation in the study . BCT also liaised directly with other NE Helpline contractors , the NE licensing team and volunteer bat-workers . Thanks to the help of bat-workers who responded to our request for information on sites that might be suitable , three maternity roosts in northern England have been recruited . At each of these sites , the request to use the site in the exclusion research was made after it was certain that the householder had applied for , and that NE was expected to grant , an exclusion licence . Volunteer roost visitors played a key role in liaising with the roost owners . The three householders agreed to postpone the exclusions until April/May soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fitted to a sample of bats from each roost to track foraging and roosting behaviour before and after each colony is excluded . The University of Bristol researchers will check roosts for the presence of pups or heavily pregnant female bats . At any site where pups or heavily pregnant bats are found the study will stop and exclusion will not take place . We thank volunteers from the North Merseyside &amp; West Lancashire , Cheshire , South Lancashire , North Lancashire and North Yorkshire bat groups who have offered help with radio-tracking and emergence counts . This summer , BCT will again be helping to identify exclusion applications of potential use for the study next spring ( 2013 ) and we ask bat workers who are aware of soprano pipistrelle roosts that are to be excluded and may be suitable for this study to get in touch . BCT will continue to work with Natural England and the University of Bristol to ensure the research on exclusions minimises the impact on bats and bat roost owners and takes account of the interests of the wider community of bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understanding of exclusions needed to improve future bat conservation practices . <p> Contacts for this research <p> If you have specific questions about the research or know of roosts that are to be excluded and could be incorporated into this study please contact karen.haysom@bats.org.uk . <p> 3 . Bats and Churches <p> i . Bats , churches and the landscape : sustainable conservation of bats in the East of England <p> This project is funded by SITA Trust and Natural England for three years to study soprano pipistrelles in East Anglian churches . In 2011 , PhD student Madeleine Ryan collated recent and historical regional records on bats in churches , undertook surveys at 17 churches in Norfolk , and radio-tracked bats from one north Norfolk church to understand use of alternative roosts , and local foraging behaviour . In 2012-13 Madeleine plans to extend the area of general surveys to encompass other eastern counties including Cambridgeshire , Suffolk and Essex . During 2012 she plans to undertake microclimate and activity studies at five churches and further radio-tracking . She is looking to identify a small number of churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within or outside church buildings , so she can monitor bat response . <p> We thank the bat workers who have already helped Madeleine with data and other advice . If you are able to suggest a church in Norfolk , Suffolk , Cambridgeshire or Essex which has a pipistrelle maternity colony and might be suitable as a survey site please contact **28;373;TOOLONG . <p> ii . Mitigation of the impacts of Natterers bats in churches <p> Natterers bats sometimes form large maternity colonies in churches , especially in East Anglia where they can cause severe problems for church users . Defra is funding research to examine the issue , led by the University of Bristol , with BCT and Philip Parker Associates as sub-contractors . BCTs role is to collate NE helpline data on church enquiries , organise focus group consultations of key stakeholders to understand attitudes to bats in churches , help locate study sites , and develop guidance materials . A key aspect of the project will involve manipulation of environmental conditions to encourage bats to relocate to alternative , less sensitive areas of churches and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of churches . <p> Update on the study <p> In late summer 2011 , the University of Bristol undertook radio-tracking studies at several churches in Norfolk , to determine where church colonies of Natterers bats foraged and whether they also use alternative roosts . General radio-tracking studies are scheduled to be repeated in summer 2012 . BCT hosted two discussion group meetings with Norfolk church communities in November and a project website **26;403;TOOLONG , targeted at a church user audience , is being used to communicate with and gather church user views from within and outside the immediate study area . The University of Bristol team has reviewed literature on potential mitigation approaches , focusing on alternative artificial roost provision and the use of deterrents , to inform trials using combinations of these methods to move bats away from the most sensitive areas . The review of alternative roost provision has examined properties of heated bat boxes , to inform box design for trials , while the deterrents examined were the localised use of light , ultrasonic or radar deterrents . Bat Conservation International has supplied acoustic deterrents used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be evaluated further . <p> The University of Bristol team is currently developing the methodology for short-term trials in late summer 2012 . These will combine heated bat box provision and one or more of the above deterrents . Planning is ongoing and must be considered flexible at present . The final deterrent methodology used in the trials will be selected following short outdoors tests at foraging sites in June 2012 , and a short pilot study at up to 3 churches not in the main study in mid late July once young are flying . Researchers will check for the presence of lactating or post-lactating females and will not run the pilot while lactating females ( and therefore dependent young ) are present . Pilot studies will last one night only . After selecting a potential deterrent , 9-day trials will take place between late July and mid September at six study churches . At each church , a sample of bats will be fitted with radio-tags , to enable foraging behaviour and day-time roosting positions to be located and monitored . The trials Days 1-3 will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roost location in the absence of a heated artificial roost or deterrent . Alternative roost sites already used by the bats will also be identified . On days 4-5 bats will be tracked following the introduction of two heated alternative roosts , which would be left in place for the whole trial . On days 6-9 a deterrent would be used near the existing bat roost to encourage the bats to relocate to a less sensitive area . Static detectors , dropping counts , and radio-tracking and possibly video recording will be used to document uptake of artificial roosts , changes to foraging behaviour and use of any existing alternative roosts . The study results are intended to lead to solutions that help users of churches and at the same time make sufficient provision for the ecological needs of bats . Bat welfare is paramount , and the University of Bristol team is putting in place safeguards for the welfare of bats during the trials . The study is planned for when young are independent , and if the welfare of bats is thought to be compromised during the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion . <p> Changes to the study <p> The research contract scheduled manipulative trials in a total of six churches , three in late summer 2012 , followed by a further three in late summer 2013 . Project conclusions require the analysis of data collected from all six churches and the final report to Defra was scheduled for January 2014 . The high profile of bats and churches issues in the media and in parliament has resulted in a direct request from Richard Benyon MP , Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries , to explore whether the research could be accelerated . Consideration of possible ways to accelerate the research by Defra officials resulted in a request to the researchers to draw up detailed proposals to undertake the trials at all six churches in summer 2012 and , dependent on the results from 2012 , repeat them in 2013 to evaluate and refine the most promising management options . Conducting the trials at all six churches in one season is a huge logistical task , requiring considerable planning and organisation and double the resources in terms of staff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which brings together statutory and NGO stakeholders from conservation , heritage and ecclesiastical sectors , has met specifically to discuss whether the project could be rescheduled without undue risk of compromising the outcomes . The PAG accepted the research teams plans for trials in six churches this season . A revised contract with Defra has been negotiated , allowing for the recruitment of a second research team led by an experienced post-doctoral researcher ( Dr Matt Zeale ) . Two of the six churches have been identified , and four more will be decided from a shortlist in summer 2012 . Provision has been made for BCT to hold discussion meetings , similar to those run in winter 2011 , with community representatives from the short-listed churches in June . <p> Heated bat boxes will be installed at the six churches in 2012 and pending discussions with individual churches , may be left in place to remain available for bats after the end of the trials . If the short-term trials of management options in 2012 suggest that bats are using alternative roosts that meet their conservation needs and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , these management options including heated artificial roosts and deterrents may be tested over longer timeframes at the same churches in 2013 . The research team has emphasised to Defra and the Church of England bats and churches working group , that for the best chance of achieving a stable solution that continues to help both people and bats , it is necessary to take a measured approach in determining what the effects on bats are likely to be . A decision on whether to conduct longer-term ( potentially over weeks or months ) trials of mitigation and deterrence at the same 6 churches in 2013 , will not be taken until early 2013 , when data from 2012 have been analysed . Any longer term trial would be scheduled after the bats have finished breeding ( so that disturbance to pregnant females or newborns is avoided ) . <p> BCTs position on the churches research <p> In a small proportion of cases the damage and impact of bats is obvious and not straightforwardly mitigated . Church communities need support to reduce these impacts so that the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bats are addressed . These two projects will help Natural England , BCT and English Heritage to provide better advice to those churches that are severely affected by the presence of bats . Participation in these studies is helping to establish deeper understanding and closer partnership between nature and heritage sectors , leading to a securer future for bats and for the church buildings that they roost in . <p> BCT will continue to contribute to the Project Advisory Groups for these projects . These comprise a broad range of statutory bodies including Natural England and Defra , as well as English Heritage and the National Trust , to ensure the work is in the interests of both nature and heritage , addresses the concerns of all stakeholders , and is undertaken with the highest regard for both bat welfare and ecological requirements and the needs of church users and heritage . <p> At the same time , BCT recognises that other important options to support and work in partnership with churches are currently under funded . For example in some areas , there are few volunteer bat workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see many opportunities for providing improved resources and working directly with church communities . We are seeking funding for such work . <p> The Church Buildings Council ( CBC ) , assisted by Natural England , has been drafting guidance on bats and churches which is designed primarily to assist dioceses . This is currently going out to consultation . If you would like to comment on the draft guidance please email ERROR?

@@49163700 @2663700/ <h> News <h> Man fined for destroying bat roost. <h> 2 July 2013 <p> On Monday 1st July 2013 a Chorley Magistrates Court heard a case against a Mr David Michael Dalton , 33 , of Chorley New Road , Lostock , Bolton.Dalton , who had been charged with destroying a bat roost. 1 Following a guilty plea Mr Dalton was fined 500 with 140 costs and a 54 surcharge2 . <p> Offences against bats are one of the UKs wildlife crime priorities of identical standing to the illegal trade in endangered species and the persecution of birds of prey3 . <p> Mr Dalton is the owner of property in Rivington Lane that he wished to develop . He engaged the services of an ecological consultant who surveyed the buildings and found a roost of brown-long eared bats . To allow the building to be developed a licence would have been required outlining how the needs of bats were being considered . Mr Dalton demolished the building without a licence and destroyed the bat roost . <p> Wildlife Crime Officer for Lancashire Police Mark Thomas said ; <p> Lancashire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have worked hard to bring this case to court , people cant just start carrying out building renovation work and think they do n't  have to have the correct surveys and licences to cover the work they intend to do . The reason they have to do this is to protect certain species in this case bats and their roosts . Working together with the Bat Conservation Trust , we put together a package for criminal proceedings against a local land and property owner Mr Dalton from the Rivington area who chose to ignore the law and the codes of practice . It is the responsibility of property owners and developers to ensure all building work has had appropriate ecological surveys undertaken . " <p> " There are very few prosecutions for bat related offences are heard by the courts . A Typical year will only see 2 or 3 across the UK . We would suggest that Magistrates may need to reassess levels of appropriate penalty . We would argue that this latest fine of 500 plus 140 court costs is an insufficient deterrent to those potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be sending is that rare British wildlife needs protection . <p> " In our view the outcome of this hearing adds weight to the argument for CPS to appoint specialist wildlife crime officers . The sentencing council who are at present considering the production of guidelines for environmental offences may also take note of this case and extend the scope of the proposed guideline to wildlife crime . " <p> " Bat roosts are very important sites for conservation . The loss of bat roosts is thought to be one reason why bat populations declined dramatically in the 20th Century . By following conditions set out in a license the impact of building , development and demolition on bats can be minimized . If you plan works and follow the mitigation measures as outlined in the license , projects can run smoothly ; if you do n't  it is a serious offence that puts bat populations at risk . " <p> " The Bat Conservation Trust have provided support to Lancashire Police during this investigation and are very grateful both to the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Impact of roost destruction <p> Most British bat species , including brown long-eared bat , have become at least partially dependent on built structures for roosting . This species is vulnerable to the impacts of roost destruction during building renovations or demolition . The brown long-eared bat is of particular concern as they have more specific requirements than other UK bat species and has been identified as sensitive to building renovation works ( Bat Conservation Trust 2009 ; Joint Nature Conservation Committee 2007 ) . Loss or damage to a roost can have a significant impact on the local population . Where there are limited alternative roosting opportunities locally , loss of a roost site would result in bats moving away perhaps to a site that is less suitable . In other cases there may be no suitable roosting sites nearby . <p> The destruction of a maternity bat roost in particular can have a major impact on the local population of bats . Female bats gather together in the summer months at maternity roost sites to have their young . Unlike many other small mammals , bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only produce one baby per year and not all females will have babies each year . Not all young survive the first year . For this reason bat populations are very slow to grow or recover their numbers and the loss of one maternity roost site may result in all the breeding females from an area being unable to rear young in that year , and possibly future years if there are no suitable alternative roosts nearby . <p> Illegal damage or destruction of bat roosts that is carried out without taking the appropriate measures and providing suitable mitigation for the bats may be detrimental to bat populations of brown long-eared bats in the UK by reducing the number of sites this species has available for roosting . <p> Brown long-eared bats are particularly loyal to their roost sites and will return to the same site each year for many years ( Swift 1998 ) so retaining and protecting bat roost sites is essential for the survival of the species . <p> Note to editors further images available on request . <p> Interviews are available with <p> BCT Investigations Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience <p> Experts on bats to talk about these rare creatures and why their roosts are protected at law <p> Bat Groups in your area local volunteer conservationists who conduct research and surveys using bat detectors to locate them and who can offer a visit-along to such work . <p> The Bat Conservation Trust ( BCT ) is the only national organisation solely devoted to the conservation of bats and their habitats in the UK .

@@49163704 @2663704/ <h> News <h> Ongoing issues with new permitted development legislation related to agricultural buildings <h> 24 June 2014 <p> The National Bat Helpline has been receiving an increasing number of calls concerning " The Town and Country Planning ( General Permitted Development ) ( Amendment and Consequential Provisions ) ( England ) Order 2014 " which came into force on the 6th of April 2014 and their potential to impact on agricultural buildings . Unfortunately , the provision did not take into account any of the recommendations that the Bat Conservation Trust ( BCT ) made during the consultation period leading up to implementation . We are aware that there is now a great deal of confusion in the way in which Local Planning Authorities ( LPA ) are taking this matter forward and are currently compiling evidence of this . BCT is also tackling this issue at ministerial level and has requested a meeting to discuss the matter . <p> In October 2013 BCT responded to the consultation on ' greater flexibility for change of use ' ( permitted development ) which incorporated farm buildings and included their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mention at all was made for the consideration of impacts on European Protected Species .

" Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 ( NERC ) requires all public bodies to have regard to biodiversity conservation when carrying out their functions . In the exercise of its functions the Council is also required to have regard to the requirements of The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 ( as amended ) ( Habitats Regulations ) . <p> The Council believes that presence and implications for protected species should form part of the consideration of whether the location or siting of the building makes it otherwise impractical or undesirable for the building to change from agricultural use to residential use.

Bat Conservation Trust recognises the problems that some churches experience with bats . When large roosts of bats are present in churches their droppings and urine can affect not only the church fabric and furnishings , but the ability of church congregations to worship and use the church building for the full benefit of the church community . BCT works with a number of different organisations and individuals to find solutions in these difficult situations and we will continue to do so . <p> With the right support there are solutions already available to the problems faced by some churches and we work with researchers and others to find more alternatives ( http : **28;492;TOOLONG ) .

In 2013 the helpline answered more than 12,000 enquiries about bats , and arranged 1,514 free volunteer visits on behalf of Natural England for householders and churches . The majority of enquiries from churches to the Bat Helpline relate to advice on building works .

With the right support and by working in partnership with conservationists , churches can often find solutions to the challenges of living alongside bat colonies . " <p> Many individuals and organisations have taken the same approach as BCT in calling for a reasoned response to this issue . Among these Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon spoke eloquently on behalf the government during a recent Lords debate on the matter ( Full transcript in notes ) . Christian conservation groups such as A Rocha and the Anglican Society for the Welfare of Animals ( Church Times letter see notes ) have also called for a more reasoned and balanced approach . <p> At least 60% of pre-16th century churches are home to bat roosts although in many cases the roosts are small or may even go unnoticed .

This is one of those issues about which , when I sit down as a Minister for my briefings , I have very limited knowledge .

Being the younger of two brothers , I always ended up playing Robin , but took some consolation from the fact that Robin was often called the Boy WonderI leave the rest to your Lordships assessment . As for bats specifically , most medieval churches will have bats , and Norfolk churches seem to have particular problems in this respect . In fact , historic buildings , especially churches , play an important role in helping to protect the conservation status of native bats . In a changing landscape , churches can represent one of the few remaining constant resources for bats , thus giving them a disproportionate significance for the maintenance of bat populations at a favourable conservation status . If churches wish to undertake works to address this problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rush to itwhere advice is given for free on timing and on whether investigation may be required . Under this service , 202 visits were made to churches last year . <p> I know there were different opinions about bats , but I am also mindful that noble Lords , including the noble Lord , Lord Berkeley , talked about music in churches , while the noble Baroness , Lady McIntosh , talked about the role of the church beyond the faith of Christianity . I look back to my Church of England education and remember a hymn : " All things bright and beautiful , All creatures great and small The Lord God made them all " . Perhaps we can reflect on the conservation of bats in that light . <p> I am pleased to say that many places of worship may be able to secure funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund for conservation or repair works . This could include , on a serious note , bat surveys or mitigation works as part of a wider project .

Loss of roosting habitat to development and construction , loss of foraging habitat as farming practice has changed ( using pesticide and losing meadows and hedgerows ) and loss of hedgerows , waterways and commuting routes linking the two all contributed to the declines in bat populations . <p> - Because of widespread population declines and continued vulnerability , all British bat species are European protected species and afforded a high level of protection under both the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981 .

British bats are not known to host viruss that affect people with the one exception of a rare rabies-like virus ( European Bat Lyssavirus ) .

All bats and their roosts are protected by law because of the declines bat populations have undergone . Although congregations can often coexist with small numbers of bats , larger roosts can create problems if large quantities of droppings and urine build up over the summer .

Over this period a worrying pattern has started to emerge that undermines the very necessary legislation meant to protect bats and their roosts ; the fines given following conviction are being set at such a very low level that it is working out cheaper for criminals to break the law but the tide may be turning on this injustice . <p> In August 2013 a case was heard in Bridlington magistrates court . A developer pleaded guilty and was convicted of six charges of destruction of bat roosts after demolishing six buildings , knowingly destroying brown long-eared bat , whiskered bat and pipistrelle roost sites . Despite this clear admission of guilt , the conviction was marred by the penalty . On each charge the fine was 35 per roost destroyed ( a total of 210 ) with a victim surcharge of 20 and costs of 85 . <p> These rulings inadvertently support a stance that it is cheaper to destroy wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) to ensure that sentencing for wildlife reflects the damage done as well as being dissuasive and real deterrent to offenders . <p> The nature of offences committed against bats means that it is possible to assess the financial profit derived from committing the crime . In many recent cases the defendants had undertaken surveys to assess the costs involved in responsible development . By choosing to demolish roosts without making the necessary provisions the financial benefit can readily be calculated . <p> On Monday April 28 , Chesterfield magistrates court heard a trial , hearing how Hargurdial Singh Rai , 55 , of Birmingham-based ISAR Enterprises Ltd , went ahead with the redevelopment of former offices on Dale Road despite a survey which identified the site as a resting place for brown , long-eared bats . <p> The court heard how an ecologist originally concluded the site was a roost after he had been instructed by an architect acting for ISAR . Mr Truscott later noticed development work had started on the site and informed police . A wildlife crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been destroyed . <p> The Bat Conservation Trust assisted both the police and the prosecution with the provision of an Expert Witness Statement detailing the conservation impacts of the act and outlining the amount ( a total of 5,737 ) Rai had sought to save through the illegal destruction of the roost . <p> The Magistrates found Rai , of North Drive , Handsworth , Birmingham , and ISAR Enterprises Ltd guilty of destroying the resting place of a protected species between March , 2011 , and July , 2012 . <p> In a ground breaking decision the court , instead of imposing a sentence on Mr Rai and Isar Enterprises have referred the case to Derby Crown Court in order that consideration can be given to confiscating assets belonging to the offenders equivalent to the amount saved by not following lawful processes . In addition the Crown Court will impose a penalty for the offences . The case was adjourned to Derby Crown Court for confiscation and sentencing on June 2 . <p> It is hoped that the costs provided as part of the prosecution will be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the first time that the proceeds of crime act has been used in a wildlife crime case resulting in a fine that really does send the message that bat crime does n't  pay . <p> Other recent cases include : <p> Mr Michael Taylor a builder of Marshbrook Lane , Hailsham appeared at Hastings Magistrates Court on Tuesday 1st April 2014 where he pleaded not guilty to a charge of destroying a bat roost . He was convicted of the charge and was given an unconditional discharge with no award of costs . <p> This was an unusual case in that it was Mr Taylor who reported the finding of bats whilst demolishing a small outbuilding . Unfortunately he chose not to follow the advice to stop work given by helpline staff and the volunteer bat roost visitor . For a number of reasons the matter could not be dealt with outside the court system .

The facts of the case were that in 2014 Mr Taylor purchased a property with a view to improving it and then using it as his place of residence . To support his planning application a bat survey was undertaken by a consultant ecologist which identified roosts by solitary common and soprano pipistrelles . The report referred to the need to obtain a licence from Natural England before undertaking work that would impact on the roosts . <p> Despite the advice contained in the report Mr Taylor during the Autumn of 2014 stripped the roof of the house , and work that destroyed the roosts .

The full report is available here . <p> The second project is a SITA Trust and Natural England funded PhD project between BCT and University of Bristol , about Bats , churches and the landscape : sustainable conservation of bats in the East of England . This project was first introduced in a bulletin on 28th July 2011 , with updates included in subsequent bulletins . The study is due to complete later this year , and this edition summarises the interim findings of the study . <p> 1 ) Management of Bats in Churches a Pilot <p> Background <p> A significant proportion of medieval churches are home to bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternity roosts . Where large numbers of bats are present , this can impact upon the church , disrupting use for worship and community events , causing damage to objects and materials of heritage and religious value , increasing the cleaning burden and giving rise to perceived health risks .

The project concluded that Natterers bats were very dependent on the churches they were present in . The bats did not use any other sites away from the church as maternity roosts , suggesting that total exclusion from a church could harm the conservation status of a colony . Each colony used a number of roosts within each church .

Bats were counted on emergence , to assess numbers present and identify roost exit points . Bats were then caught and radio tagged , to study their behaviour and locations during a trial of the acoustic and lighting deterrents . Acoustic deterrents were used to encourage bats to roost away from sensitive areas in the church whilst lighting deterrents were used in areas where bats were not roosting to create " no-fly zones " . The roosting behavior of the radio-tagged bats was investigated before the deterrents were applied , during their operation and after deterrents were switched off . <p> During the next phase of work , different deterrent measures were implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bats to deterrents in the initial trial . At each church the project team discussed with the Churchwardens which areas are most in need of protection . These discussions informed the development of plans to progressively move the resident bat colonies away from the sensitive locations to the agreed less sensitive areas . The project team used the deterrent approaches that were considered suitable for each individual building and colony ( e.g. acoustic deterrent alone , acoustic deterrent and lighting etc . ) . In addition , alternative roosts and " boxing in " of existing roosts within church buildings were trialled , where appropriate , to restrict the areas where bats were active and limit the spread of their droppings and urine . <p> The impacts of these techniques on the bats , and on deposition of droppings and urine , were monitored throughout the study .

Acoustic deterrents were effective in moving Natterers bats away from sensitive areas of the church in both spring and early summer . <p> In the Northamptonshire church , the majority of soprano pipistrelle bats sought alternative roosts within the church upon first use of acoustic deterrents .

However , the impacts of boxing-in ' was not assessed at the time of birth or pup rearing , so this would need careful consideration , implementation and monitoring .

Bats , churches and the landscape : sustainable conservation of bats in the East of England <p> Background <p> SITA Trust and Natural England funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research study , by Madeleine Ryan , supervised by Professor Gareth Jones , on soprano pipistrelle bats in churches in eastern England . The project focused eastern England because of the high proportion of enquiries to the Bat Helpline from churches in this region . Soprano pipistrelles ( together with common pipistrelles ) are one of the species of bats about which churches most commonly seek advice from the National Bat Helpline . They can form large summer maternity roosts in churches . <p> The study aimed to reduce the impacts of bats and safeguard long term conservation of bats and built heritage . The project sought to understand why soprano pipistrelle bats select certain churches and how they use the interior of the church and the surrounding habitat throughout the year . The research aimed to answer the following specific questions : <p> Do church-roosting soprano pipistrelles make use of other summer roosts ? <p> Where in the landscape surrounding church roosts do soprano pipistrelles forage at night . What habitats do they select to feed in and what are their commuting distances ? <p> How does the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soprano bat activity at churches ? <p> How does habitat configuration around churches affect the presence of soprano pipistrelle summer roosts within them ? <p> How do aspect and crevice temperature affect the location of soprano pipistrelle roosts within churches ? <p> A regional survey was undertaken to establish the occurrence of bats in relation to church and habitat data . Detailed research was then carried out , involving radio-tracking bats at two medieval and one Victorian church , and studies of roost microclimate conditions and bat activity throughout the year . Bat boxes were also trialled as an approach to mitigate the impact of the roosting bats on the church community . <p> Summary of interim results <p> Alternative roosts : Bats from three soprano pipistrelle colonies in churches in Essex , Norfolk and Peterborough were radio tracked . These bats used several alternative day roosts in a variety of structures across large areas surrounding the church maternity roost . However , although some individual bats switched roosts , the church maternity roosts were always occupied during the radio-tracking periods . In total , for all three colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which were in domestic houses and the fourth in a garage attached to a domestic house . <p> Surrounding habitat : Soprano pipistrelles are known to preferentially feed on insects in wetland and woodland habitats but this study found that the species is more mobile than previously thought . The average maximum nightly commuting distance was 4.46 km . This means that it is important to retain wetland , woodland and other trees in the landscape in areas surrounding soprano pipistrelle roosts and where opportunities arise , to recreate these habitats , to compensate for historic and ongoing losses . <p> Bats use churches throughout the year : Soprano pipistrelles were present all year-round in the three churches monitored over 12 months . Activity peaked in mid-July , which coincided with the time juveniles were starting to fly . This indicates that without survey work to suggest otherwise , it should generally be assumed that where soprano pipistrelle bats are known to use a church in summer they may hibernate there too . The likely year-round use of churches should be taken into account during building repair work ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timing of such work ) and any mitigation should include provision to replace lost hibernation habitat as well as maternity roosting habitat . <p> Numbers of churches with pipistrelle bats : Surveys of churches with previous records of common or soprano pipistrelle bat roosts , some of which were maternity colonies , indicated that although almost all of the visited churches still had evidence of these species , relatively few had obvious communal or maternity roosts present . These surveys highlighted that church doors are frequently used for common or soprano pipistrelle species for their access into and out of churches , and that access over doors is sometimes threatened by draught exclusion and by restoration work . A national survey would allow a better understanding of the scale of issues caused by bats in churches . <p> Roost selection in churches : Within churches , soprano pipistrelle maternity and communal roosts are more likely to be situated in south-facing rather than north-facing areas , with south-facing areas being significantly warmer than north-facing areas . To encourage bats to use less sensitive areas of the church building , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar aspect and environmental conditions available for roosting . <p> Churches provide a range of temperature conditions for roosting during summer and winter .

The preliminary findings show that : <p> Soprano pipistrelles may have access to some alternative roosts ( four communal alternative roosts were used in the three church colonies studied by radio-tracking ) and may be generalists with respect to roosting habitat . However , some individual bats remain very faithful to their church roost and did not use alternative roosts during the observed study period ( up to one week per bat radio tagged ) . <p> Churches provide a range of temperatures and roosting conditions which may be important to bats and may not be straightforward to replace . <p> Churches may also be used all year-round and used by more than one bat species . <p> All of these elements , along with practical difficulties , make whole-building exclusion from churches complex , compared to exclusions from domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can provide warm and stable temperature conditions throughout the day and night . However , for heated bat boxes installed in cool locations , such as church towers , the temperature regime will be unsuitable for soprano pipistrelle maternity roosts if the heating unit stops working ( e.g. is accidentally turned off or blows a fuse ) . <p> Non-heated bat boxes in sunny positions outside a church can provide suitably warm daytime roosting conditions which mimic existing roost crevices , but they do n't  provide the same amelioration of outside conditions ( e.g. at night ) , that church buildings as a whole provide . <p> The installed heated and non-heated bat boxes were not used by bats within the first year after installation . It was difficult to find sites to install heated bat boxes , for a variety of reasons : <p> Lack of electricity supply at some churches . <p> Some church wardens were not convinced it would work and had concerns about their operation , running costs and insurance restrictions . <p> A longer time is needed to test whether soprano pipistrelle bats voluntarily take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion . The existing research suggests that heated bat boxes are not a quick fix . A fundamental concern would be how to guarantee the necessary maintenance and running costs required to keep a box in good working order for several decades . A more practical solution may be to box in roosting areas around bat access points , in situations where there are a limited number of access points . <p> What is happening next ? <p> Madeleine is currently writing up her PhD .

Summer roosts were reported empty and many maternity roosts did not form . In those maternity roosts that did form some mother bats were forced to abandon their babies . Bats have just one baby a year so one bad month can lead to long lasting consequences . In November bats normally head for hibernation as the weather cools and their insect prey dwindle in number , hibernating over the winter months in cool quiet roosts .

Bats need a connected landscape with hedgerows , waterways and trees , so they can travel safely between their roosting and feeding sites . We must lobby governments to ensure that the roads , railways and lighting that slice through the landscape do not act as barriers to bats , blocking bat flight lines and severing the hedges that link their habitats . <p> Maps of the landscape are being developed from a bat perspective showing planners and local authorities where there are important bat sites .

The book and associated website summarise scientific evidence relevant to different conservation interventions for a number of different habitats , conservation issues , and species groups , including bats .

Predicted and inferred studies are however useful in extrapolating when particular interventions could bring conservation benefit and when an intervention has not yet been tested in the manner described above although this information may not be as reliable . Thus important alternative sources of evidence commonly used in generating guidelines and recommending actions are not used in this assessment as its purpose is to provide objective evidence by testing interventions directly . <p> Evidence related to each intervention was summarised and assessed by panels of experts , to determine the effectiveness of the intervention , the certainty of the evidence and whether the intervention is likely to cause negative side-effects to the species or system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorized into one of the following : Beneficial ; Likely to be beneficial ; Trade-off between benefit and harms ; Unknown effectiveness ; Unlikely to be beneficial ; or Likely to be ineffective or harmful .

This does not mean that a particular intervention has no conservation benefit , just that there is no available evidence fitting the above criteria to assess any benefit . <p> The book should be used in conjunction with the more detailed accounts of the evidence available on the website , when making decisions about which conservation interventions to implement to meet a specific goal . <p> Limitations to remember when using this bookThere are limitations to this study , summarised in the book introduction , which should be taken into account when reading the book and thinking about particular interventions : <p> - No evidence found DOES NOT mean that an intervention may not provide any benefit , just that no studies adhering to the strict criteria above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlight areas that require further scientific study to directly test and quantify the benefit of particular interventions .

But in other cases conservation methods can be tested and this publication highlights the need for this to happen . <p> - Worldwide coverage . Some evidence presented and used to assess an intervention may be restricted in geographical scope or in the particular habitats or species involved , and may therefore not be relevant to other situations .

The project focused on East Anglia because of the high proportion of enquires to the Bat Helpline from churches in this region . Soprano pipistrelles ( together with common pipistrelles ) are one of the species of bats about which churches most commonly seek advice from the Helpline . They can form summer maternity roosts with large numbers of bats in churches and houses . <p> The project sought to understand why soprano pipistrelle bats select certain churches , how they use churches and the surrounding habitat throughout the year and why they choose certain locations within churches to roost .

This is the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in North America . It has been found at many sites in continental Europe but importantly without the associated syndrome that has caused the deaths of millions of bats .

This project was undertaken in collaboration with the Animal &amp; Plant Health Agency ( APHA , formerly the Animal Health &amp; Veterinary Laboratories Agency ) and Northern Arizona University . The methodology involved testing environmental samples for the presence of the fungus rather than bats directly . During their annual NBMP hibernation visits , volunteers collected sediment and surface samples from six sites in South East England .

These findings fit with that modelling work and indicate that it is highly likely the fungus is present across a wider part of the UK . Additional systematic survey work is underway to understand the distribution of the fungus across a larger area . Knowing this , with reasonable certainty , has significant implications for bat conservation and the guidance provided to bat workers . <p> BCT is very grateful to the NBMP volunteers who took part in the pilot project .

An update on the additional sites is given below in relation to the trend analysis completed in 2014 . <h> Additional sites : <p> In 2012 counts from a large number of additional sites not previously included in the NBMP Hibernation Survey were added to the NBMP database .

Counts from all these additional sites and years were included in the 2012 analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data prior to the start of the NBMP Hibernation Survey in 1997 , the counts contribute to the trend models , although in this report we focus our reporting on changes since 1997 . The number of sites contributing to the trends reported for each species includes sites where data are available for the years prior to 1997 . <p> As in 2013 a large number of these sites have been excluded from analysis in 2014 as further interrogation of the additional data provided in Wales revealed that there were a number of cases where several sites were recorded at the same location and counts were provided separately for each site . It is likely that for at least some of these sites , counts are not independent as they may represent different areas or sections of a single hibernation site . We have therefore excluded any potential sites that fall into this category in the population trend analyses of Hibernation Survey data . Since the analysis for this report was completed we have now been able to clarify with the surveyor how these sites should be treated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports . <p> This has had an impact on sample sizes for the Hibernation Survey in 2013 and 2014 compared to 2012 . However , the survey coverage is still improved in comparison to 2011 and temporary exclusion of these sites from the analyses reduces the likelihood of introducing unwanted biases into the trends . The sample size for 2014 was also greatly increased by another recorder in Wales kindly sharing data from a large number of hibernation sites . <h> Hibernation Survey date range : <p> The NBMP survey method for Hibernation Surveys asks for two counts , one in January and one in February . Prior to 2012 , all counts from 25th December to 6th March were included in species trend analyses . In 2012 we investigated the effects of including counts from a wider date range as some data have been submitted to the NBMP for counts outside the normal survey period . The graph below shows the total number of surveys completed ( for all years ) in each week from November through March . <p> Counts by species generally show a quadratic trend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very low . Analysis of the effect of extending the date range , taking into account the week of survey and the temperature information recorded by observers , including a generalised linear mixed model by species , showed that increasing the date range for the Hibernation Survey to include all of December and all of March had little effect on trend estimations . Since 2012 , all Hibernation Survey trends are therefore based on counts carried out between 1st December and 30th March .

In North America Pd is a novel pathogen and so native species do not have the same resistance to the fungus . <p> Research by STbastien Puechmaille and his team at University College Dublin had previously indicated that conditions in the UK should be suitable for Pd . These findings fit with that modelling work and indicate that it is highly likely the fungus is present across a wider part of the UK .

Knowing this , with reasonable certainty , has significant implications for bat conservation and the guidance provided to bat workers . <p> BCT is very grateful to the NBMP volunteers who took part in the pilot project .

@@49163835 @2663835/ <h> News <h> Habitats Directive Review : Our position and recommendations <h> 21 December 2011 <p> The Government has announced that it will undertake a review of the implementation of the EU Habitats Directive in England through the Habitat Regulations ; key legislation which protects bats and their habitats . The Habitat Regs provide an essential mechanism for safeguarding vulnerable species and habitats whilst ensuring social and economic needs are met . They provide the framework needed to drive conservation through regulatory systems , scientific monitoring and evidence gathering . In the case of bats , the adoption and enforcement of structured legislation has been fundamental to fighting persecution . The level of protection afforded to bats and other species and habitats through the legislation should not be weakened . <p> The Bat Conservation Trust supports a review of the Habitats Regulations provided that the focus of the review is to strengthen best practice and refine implementation , with an overall aim of meeting the Biodiversity 2020 targets . The Bat Conservation Trust opposes any weakening of the level of legal protection afforded to bats , other species and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Europe during the latter half of the twentieth century resulted in the development of legislation to protect bats and their habitats . The National Bat Monitoring Programme has shown in recent years that some species populations are no longer declining .

BCT are deeply concerned that species and landscapes will be left vulnerable by an over emphasis on development for supposed short-term economic gain . The Government needs to acknowledge that the long-term health of our natural environment underpins our wealth and well-being and that regulation is a vital part of the mix of measures needed to address environmental issues , as demonstrated by the UK National Ecosystem Assessment . <p> The Lawton Review and the Natural Environment White Paper clearly identify the importance of an integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only effective ways that we can enable biodiversity to adapt to the impacts of climate change and safeguard species . Integration of environmental objectives into local decision making is fundamental to conservation . However , a lack of expertise and clarity combined with a failure of engagement with the environmental aspects of projects at an early stage can result in delays , unnecessary expense and ineffective measures being applied . This leads to the view that conserving biodiversity and the natural environment is a costly and arduous process with limited results . This is further exacerbated by a lack of evidence from post construction monitoring on which to base future improvements . <p> Recommendations <p> BCT will be submitting case studies to illustrate that failings often attributed to gold plating are in many instances a result of ineffective implementation rather than problems with the legislation itself . Based on this evidence , BCT makes these recommendations to improve the implementation of the Habitats Regulations : <p> 1 . Improve the quality and consistency of advice and implementation across the sector : Consistent and informed advice is needed by developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Habitats Regulations . This means standards and knowledge need to be raised , reviewed and enforced within the private sector , local authorities and Statutory Nature Conservation Organisations . <p> Training and professional standards should be introduced and more rigorous assessments applied to individuals seeking to obtain personal European Protected Species ( EPS ) Licences <p> Decision making bodies charged with the review and assessment of planning applications should have direct access to expertise in ecology and the environment - Local planning authorities must have access to expert ecologists to help them make informed decisions , either in-house or via service level agreements with neighbouring authorities <p> 2 . Make better use of existing support structures : Utilise current support structures such as volunteer schemes and advice systems that exist to improve compliance and good practice . <p> Better training and investment in the volunteer support networks that currently alleviate burdens on the community <p> 3 .

We also recommend that you choose a Solicitor who is also a qualified " Trusts and Estate Practitioner " ( Known as a " STEP member " ) , meaning that the Solicitor has undertaken extra training and examinations in the field of Wills and Trusts . <p> To find out more information on leaving a gift to BCT under the laws in Scotland , please see our Scottish guidance page . <p> The most common ways to help out BCT in your Will are described below : - <p> Pecuniary Legacy <p> A pecuniary legacy is a gift of a fixed sum of money in your Will , for example : - <p> " I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 ) to The Bat Conservation Trust ( RCN : 1012361 ) of 250 Kennington Lane , London , SE11 5RD with freedom to spend it as income and for its general charitable purposes " <p> It is worth bearing in mind that the value of a pecuniary legacy will decrease the longer you live , as the cost of living increases . For example , 1,000 today can buy far less than it could buy 10 years ago . It is likely that 1,000 in 10 years ' time will be able to buy you even less that it could today . <p> It is possible to link the value of a pecuniary legacy with the " Retail Price Index " to ensure that your gift keeps pace with inflation . Again , whilst it is possible to do this , it is advisable to seek specialist legal advice to ensure that this provision is correctly included in your Will . <p> Specific Legacy <p> A specific legacy is a gift of a particular named item in your Will , for example : - <p> You must still possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legacy to be effective . It is also essential that the item you wish to leave is clearly defined . What if you have more than one Rolex watch ? In those cases , there is a chance that your gift to the BCT would fail . That is why specialist legal advice in these cases is essential . <p> Entire residuary estate to BCT <p> After you have died , your " executors " named in your Will have the task of gathering in all of your assets . They then pay any legacies , Inheritance Tax , funeral expenses and other debts . The remainder of your estate is then known as " the residuary estate " . <p> You may wish to give the whole of your residuary estate to BCT , for example : - <p> A gift of the whole of your residuary estate to a charity would usually be Inheritance Tax free . However , if you are making other tax free gifts within your Will , it is worth taking professional advice to ensure that BCT will receive what you expected them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a charity <p> As an alternative , you may wish to give your residuary estate to a number of people and / or charities , for example : - <p> " My Trustees shall hold my residuary estate UPON TRUST to divide it or treat it as being divided into number of shares shares of equal value and to hold them on the following trusts and subject to the following provisions : <p> a ) as to one share for The Bat Conservation Trust ( RCN : 1012361 ) of 250 Kennington Lane , London , SE11 5RD <p> b ) as to one share for name of recipient of other share " <p> This type of gift can be very difficult to get right . What should happen if one of the other recipients of a share of the estate has died before you ? Should their share pass to someone else , or should it be added to the other gifts that have not failed ?

Charities merge and amalgamate and alter their addresses . Ideally your Will should contain clauses to deal with this . A properly drafted Will ensures that the charity you have chosen to benefit will receive the gift that you intended . By making sure your Will is clear , you are removing any doubt and making sure the administration of your estate runs smoothly . This saves time , money and upset for your family at an already difficult time . <p> By taking specialist legal advice , you will be able to ensure that these important clauses are incorporated into your Will .

Check the instruction booklet to find out when to be in position to begin the count . For some species it is sunset , while for others you need to be in position a bit earlier , perhaps 15 minutes before sunset . <p> Choose the best place to see the bats . Stand below the roost exit , if possible where you are likely to see the bats silhouetted against the sky as they fly out . <p> Try not to disturb the bats . Do not shine a torch at the roost exit as this may disturb the bats and prevent them from emerging . <p> Record the temperature . Try to record the temperature as this is included when we analyse the counts . If you do n't  have a thermometer you can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Met Office websites . <p> Be patient . It can sometimes take longer than expected for the first bat to appear and there can be another gap before most of the bats begin to emerge . <p> When to finish . After the main emergence has begun , if you then have a period when no bats emerge for 10 minutes , it is time to finish . You can also stop if it is getting too dark to see , the bats behaviour becomes confusing , or if the weather gets too bad . <p> Zero counts are useful . If you get no bats at all coming out of the roost then still send in your results , as zero counts are still very important .

Unlike in North America , there has been no observed mass die-off of bats which could indicateUKbats may be resistant to the fungus . <p> In North America the fungus causes White-Nose Syndrome ( WNS ) which has devastated many North American bat populations .
