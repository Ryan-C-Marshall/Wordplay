They also serve to connect us to our families , and to our past . <p> Sometimes the best place to look for a name that feels new is to look back . There are many classic baby names that have seen a revival in recent years . These names feel familiar and have an element of the traditional , but they are far from boring . <p> Of course , there are some names that should just stay in the past . Sometimes there is a reason why a name falls out of favor . But the names here are those that topped the lists in their own day , appealing to many parents then and many parents now . <p> While looking at your family tree might lead to some interesting and sentimental choices , sometimes broadening the search can help to find more options that appeal to you . <p> Join me on a walk through memory lane as I review the top 25 baby names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #1 <p> James 4,866,619 babies had this name as of the end of 2013 .

If someone wants to help you out and clean your house , great . Otherwise , let it wait . <h> Adult time <p> Let someone else watch the baby . Once your milk is in , you can use a breast pump and leave a bottle for someone else to give . Get out of the house and do something for yourself . Or , you and your husband can let a family member or trusted friend watch the baby and you can go out together . <p> Make sure to get adult time .

You should not have sex after delivering your baby until your obstetrician says it 's okay , but you can have special alone time together . <h> Taking care of mom <p> Do n't forget your own checkups and medical care . Go to your postpartum checkup . Tell the doctor if you are very tired . It may be appropriate for the doctor to check you for anemia , low thyroid , and other treatable medical problems that can come on after the baby is born and make you more tired . <p> Do n't forget your emotional needs .

When you go into labor next time , someone will have to be taking care of your other child . If you get pregnant six months from your first child 's birth , you have a higher chance of going into labor early with your next baby , so you may need even more help .

Voiceless sounds , such as /f/ , /h/ , /k/ , /p/ , and /s/ , do not require the vocal folds to vibrate together . <p> Example : A child pauses awkwardly between sounds and syllables so a sentence sounds choppy . ( " **29;29;TOOLONG " instead of " The dog is under the fence . " . <p> Example : A child may be trying to say the word " hat " - but separates each sound with great effort , so the word sounds like " hhh-aw-t " . <p> Example : A child had a hard time transitioning from a voiceless to a voiced sound when trying to say the word party so there is a long pause between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vowel Distortions- Children with CAS make vowel sounds that are not part of the English language . Distortions may occur because the child has poor coordination to move his lips , tongue or jaw or does not have enough muscle tension . Vowels may also be distorted because the child has reduced the movement required to get to the vowel or the sound after the vowel . <p> Example : When trying to say the word " bike " the child produces vowel sounds that like " bek " or " bok " but are not accurate enough sound like any vowel in the English language . <p> 4 . Prosody Errors <p> Prosody is the pitch , stress , rhythm , intonation , and rate of speech . In other words , the music of speech and language . A child with CAS often has very little to no prosodic features , resulting in robotic or monotone speech . <p> 5 . Inconsistent Error Sounds in Repeated Production of Words <p> A child with CAS may repeat the same word several times and produce it a different way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered being able to coordinate and time his or her movements to produce a word correctly . <p> Example : A child may try to say the word " happy " , but says " babby " , " hoppy " and " habby " . <p> Children with CAS have a mismatch between their expressive language ( the use of words to communicate what a person wants and thinks ) and receptive language ( the ability to understand a message that is heard , read or interpreted from body language ) skills . The child 's receptive language skills are developmentally at age level , but their expressive language skills are significantly delayed . <p> If you are concerned that your child may have childhood apraxia of speech , it is important to have them evaluated by a qualified Speech-Language Pathologist ( SLP ) . Once a diagnoses of CAD is determined , the SLP will recommend a specific frequency of therapy . Children with CAS require frequent and intensive therapy . 58 @qwx410058 55 @qwx410055

This figure does not include any college or educational expense beyond the age of 17 , and an average collegiate tuition rounds out to approximately $24,000 per year for an out-of-state college and approximately $10,000 for an in-state school . These are the figures for one child and any family with more than one child will spend much , much more . When you see this in black and white , it is almost amazing that any family can afford to have children . <p> According to a 2008 survey , the most expensive years are the ones between the ages of 15-17 , when the average household can expect around $8,000 in total expenses ! <p> According to a 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ages of 15-17 , when the average household can expect around $8,000 in total expenses ! <p> Food costs alone for one child from birth to the age of 17 totals a whopping $24,000 , and this does not consider that many families shop haphazardly and without pinching pennies . Perhaps all those prepackaged snack foods and convenience foods should be quickly taken off the shopping list . <p> For parents who only have one child the costs are drastically increased because research shows that single children households spend more money on their one child , than families who have multiple children do . This might explain the " only child " syndrome that takes over many children who have no siblings . <p> Consider also that the average cost for miscellaneous expenses is between $600 and $700 per year , per age ; whereas in reality miscellaneous expenses like softball uniforms , supplies , dancing costumes , birthday presents , parties , and holiday gifts can cost more than that in a single month , and you can easily see that the figures are deflated . If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norm , thousands upon thousands of dollars can be added to these figures . No wonder so many parents are depressed ! <p> Common sense should shift all of us to take a good hard look at these figures , and try to imagine where all of this money is going . When parents are putting off medical care of their own , and avoiding buying new clothes or shoes for themselves so they can provide these things for their children , they are leaving very little in the kitty with which to take care of themselves . $170,000 essentially divides into about $10,000 per year to raise one child ; that is a decent chunk of annual income for a lot of people . <p> The cost of raising a child is perhaps one of the biggest reasons that young people these days feel like they are entitled to so much . They have spent a lifetime being given things that were beyond their means and traits like being frugal , thrifty , and cautious about money have been tossed out the window in an attempt to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-run with brand named clothes and toys , many of which look like new , yet there are still plenty of parents willing to go and buy these items , brand new and shiny ( which only lasts a week ) , rather than save the money . Credit card debts are at all time highs , and credit card millionaires are popping up all over the place . With the economic crunch , many of these people are losing their homes , cars , and jobs , and finding solace in the fact that their 6-year-old is wearing $40 jeans , and that their 16-year-old is driving a new , but modest Honda ! What are we thinking ? <p> There are other costs to raising children as well that are not accounted for in these figures . Savings for college , vacations , and other recreational activities are simply things that people do if they can . If they ca n't , they take out loans and end up paying for them until it is time to retire ( if they are lucky ) . So when does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long should parents be expected to take on the financial responsibilities of their children ? Even more concerning is the fact that all this giving and getting leads our children to be grown-ups and parents who do much of the same in order to keep up with what their own parents did for them . None of this makes for happy or content adults , and seeing as money issues are the number one cause of divorce ; parents are clearly spending too much . When the cost of raising a child becomes more than a relationship can bear , and more than what is left in the bank , the time has come to pull in the reins and begin using common sense . No amount of " well adjusted " or " lucky " is worth ruining the lives of two people because they are lying awake wondering how in the heck they are going to afford all of this . <p> Most parents would admit that this is something they never think about in the beginning . In the middle of it , when the kids are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other menial expense like a fundraiser , or school fees , or sporting activities , or birthday parties . In a week 's time , you can rack up hundreds of dollars worth of unforeseen extras , and no matter how hard parents try , they will never get ahead unless they learn to say no . They will never teach their kids about gratitude unless they learn to say no . They will never last if they can not learn the all-important and guilt-free ability to say no to every whim , wish , need , and want that a child can come up with . <p> It does n't take a financial genius to see why so many people are in such financial trouble . And for what ? When it 's five dollars cheaper to buy a big bag of cheese puffs and some cheap Ziploc bags than it is to buy the neatly wrapped Frito Lay snack packs , why would any family choose the latter week after week ? In just one year 's time that equals well over a hundred dollars worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And is the pretentious gratitude of your child showing up at school with prewrapped cheese puffs really worth a divorce or financial strife ? Obviously , there is much more than cheese puffs to be concerned with , but the attitude that parents have is universal and just as ignorant ! The important things in life should be provided ; however , a line has to be drawn at some point early on in the life of a child to show them that they can be rich and wealthy without having the latest and greatest gadget or brand ! Down the road , the cost of raising children may not seem worth it to some when you realize what can be lost if you go about it with the wrong type of thinking . <p> yes I know it will be expensive , but growing up my parents were bargain shoppers . To this day I am sometimes I might be too picky when it comes to prices . In the end its all about how much are you willing to pay for the items . To me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route so that I will have more $ later on . This helps so you are n't  so stressed . yes I agree that there are certain things that you want to spend more $ on for the quality , but clothes in my opinion is not one of them . If you need the name brand clothing to be friends with a certain group you should ask yourself are these ppl really my friends . I loved the way my parents raised me and I plan to have very similar parenting strategy <p> I 'm all about saving money . Costco and Sams club for her food , target brand diapers , and store brand snacks . I buy her Hugs juices from Sams they are cheep and low in sugar . reusable squeeze packs filled with applesauce bought in bulk rather then paying 1.50 for one 4 oz snack . Also thrift and consignment shops for her clothes . .50-1.00 for a pair of jeans verses 8-10 at Walmart . Baby and Toddler clothes do n't  get worn out before they are out grown ! Most of the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .15 Yes ! 15 cents ! <p> Children have to keep up with the joness . They want the $200 sneakers and the $100 jeansfor what ! ! ! to keep up with the image .

@@41574262 @1574262/ <h> What to Do When Your Kid is Afraid of Everything <p> A mom recently reached out to me about her six-year-old son . Although he 's never shown any signs of anxiety in the past , kindergarten seemed to be the year of fears . Spiders ? Scary ! Dogs ? Scary ! Cars driving just a little too fast ? Super scary ! She tried her best to soothe his fears but with a big family trip coming up , she did n't want a new fear of flying to emerge and put a damper on the vacation . She also did n't want him to have to exist in a state of fear , but she was out of ideas . <p> Childhood fears do tend to spike between the ages of 5-8 . While the days of monsters under the bed might fade away , real world fears become a new reality . This is the period of development when kids begin to understand that bad things can and do happen in the world . Natural disasters , death , robberies , car accidents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . Separation anxiety can return for some during this time , but for others specific fears become heightened . <p> A child who witnessed a dog bite , for example , might develop a fear of dogs . Similarly , a child who endures a fender bender might suddenly fear the car . Children in this age group tend to engage in globalized thinking . They apply one experience to a wide range of potential experiences . This can result in excessive fears . <p> Not to worry , you and your child will get through this . Forcing the issue , no matter the fear , will only intensify the emotional experience . Do not shame , embarrass or yell at your child because of his fears . While your child 's fears might be frustrating for you , your child is n't trying to upset you . He 's struggling with his emotional responses to fear and needs your support . <p> Parents are fixers by nature , and sometimes this means that we forget to slow down and listen . We get so busy trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our kids are trying to tell us . <p> Listen more than you speak when dealing with childhood fears . When you listen to and empathize with your child , you give him the opportunity to work through his fears . When you attempt to fix the problem without listening or simply tell him not to worry , you shut him down . <p> Ground fears in reality . <p> Fears can stem from a feeling of no control . The child who fears dogs , for example , does n't know how to cope if a dog seems aggressive . That child is n't sure how to know if a dog is friendly to kids or not or what to do if a dog does become aggressive . Avoidance feels safe because a positive outcome is guaranteed . <p> Information helps . Get to the library and find kid friendly books to help your child understand the triggers of his fears . When my kids were worried about hurricanes , a National Geographic book helped them make sense of them . It also helped them understand that huge hurricanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit . <p> Rattling off statistics wo n't necessarily help your kids with their fears , but learning together can reduce their anxiety . <p> Make plans . <p> Worriers like action plans . When you have a plan , you feel more in control of the situation . <p> Make a list of your child 's biggest fears ( no , this wo n't cause more fears ) and start brainstorming together . If a child fears a house fire , make sure you establish and practice the escape plan ( it 's a good idea to do this , anyway ) . If a child fears dogs , make a step-by-step plan for approaching a dog . You get the point . <p> The trick to dealing with specific fears is to proceed slowly and with tons of patience .

He has a little more freedom to explore than my older son did and his schedule is not as set in stone , but he still gets plenty of attention and focus .

Is it just simple PMS , or could you be newly pregnant ? Though the two spell drastically different paths for your future , they are eerily similar in the beginning . <p> The signs of implantation are often overlooked as PMS symptoms , so if there is any chance you may be pregnant , it 's best to confirm with a test . <p> Let 's have a quick look at how implantation happens . Typically , women ovulate one to two weeks after their periods , which means a follicle in the ovary will release the hormone progesterone to thicken the uterine lining , and an egg will be released into the opening of the fallopian tube . <p> During intercourse , sperm travel through the cervix and uterus and into the fallopian tubes in hopes of meeting an egg . This part of the process is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fallopian tubes within minutes , " said Dr. Amber Cooper , assistant professor in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Washington University and a specialist in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis . <p> The sperm then burrow into the shell of the egg and one lucky sperm- will fertilize it , making it a zygote . Once the winner reaches the center of the egg , all sorts of chemical reactions start taking place , and after much cell division , the zygote separates into two parts , forming the blastocyst and the nourishing trophoblast . It then travels down the fallopian tube and emerges . <p> Implantation Itself <p> " Implantation is the attaching and embedding of an embryo into the endometrial lining of a woman 's uterus .

Once bound , the trophoblast helps to embed the blastocyst even further and aids in forming the placenta . <p> " Usually there are no symptoms of implantation , but a small percentage of women will have light spotting or bleeding with implantation . PMS symptoms are often the same for women early in the implantation process . But if implantation is successful , as women approach their expected menses date , symptoms of breast tenderness , bloating , and nausea may appear or worsen , as hormone levels may be higher than normal , " said Dr. Cooper . <p> Spotting may occur because the trophoblast may damage some of the mother 's blood vessels during implantation , causing tiny blood leaks from the cervix down through the vagina . Implantation spotting is very light and quick " it can even be just a few drops " whereas menstruation blood gets heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , light cramping may be associated with implantation , but if the cramping increases or lasts , it may be due to an upcoming period or an ectopic pregnancy .

With that said , in order to get actual work done , I quickly realized I needed a babysitter to watch my toddler . <p> The gal who comes over a few days a week is amazingtruly , she 's every parent 's dream babysitter . She 's in her late 20s , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in graduate school , and has a passion for hanging out with young kids ; she 's been a live-in nanny for several families in the past ( and still has a good reputation with them ) , she 's responsible ( i.e. she arrives on time , unlike several other sitters we 've had who just plain " forgot " to show up before ) , and best of all : my daughter loves her . <p> As I 'm typing this from my little corner in the house , I can hear both of them squealing with delight . They just finished blowing bubbles outside , and are now playing ring-around-the-rosie . Before the bubbles they were making " burritos " out of Play-Doh while simultaneously participating in impromptu dance parties . My daughter 's giggle bounces off the walls and ricochets back into my officeit 's the kind of laughter that forms deep in her belly . <p> When it 's just the two of us ( and my 3-month-old little girl ) , she does n't get my complete undivided attention . Sure , we play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have play dates , but in truth , I have other things happening , and the TV is usually on as a fallback . I have dinner to work on , a house to clean , another child to care for , etc . She hears the word " no , " or " maybe later , " probably more than she should , and while she is n't jealous of her new sister often , she definitely wants to be held morewhich is quite a feat when you 're already holding/wearing a baby . <p> Here are just a few reasons why I 'm totally jealous of my daughter 's babysitter : 57 @qwx410057 <p> She gets complete undivided time with the coolest 2 year old around . Nuff said. - <p> She 's artsy . I can draw a grand total of four things : a fish , a heart , the sun , and a flower . That 's it . Our babysitter , on the other hand , is pretty spectacular when she has chalk or crayons in her hands . 57 @qwx410057 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate being outside , it 's that I hate being hot and feeling like I 'm in a sauna when I 'm clearly not at a spa is pretty much miserable . I 'm also not a fan of bugs ; particularly those that like to dine on my blood ( and I have some pretty tasty blood ) . This is a huge problem since my daughter likes everything about being outside . The sitter and my daughter spend the majority of their time outside . 57 @qwx410057 <p> She has the patience of a saint . I 'm a work in progress , and one thing I know about myself is that I 'm impatient , especially around tiny humans . I 'm trying to get better at " slow-parenting " instead of rushing her to go , go , go , but I fail often . 57 @qwx410057 <p> " No " is n't in her vocabulary . Of course she puts her foot down when need-be , but she also let 's my daughter take the reins for what they do during their time together . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom , she 's done this before with the kids she 's nannied , whereas this is my first time parenting . She and my daughter have tea parties with actual water ( and my daughter will pour it into the teeny-tiny tea cups ) . The first time I saw them do this , I immediately realized that 's something I never would 've thought of , and if I did think of it , I probably would 've thought she was too young to pour it herself . <p> Image via Jessica Lynn <p> She keeps the TV off . They are always doing something other than staring at a screen . 57 @qwx410057 <p> She gets to go home . I 'm not going to lie , but this is one of the major reasons I 'm jealous of my daughter 's babysitter . At the end of her 3-4 hour shift , she gets to go home . Perhaps , she naps the rest of the day , binges on Netflix , reads a book ( for pleasure ) , or maybe she gets to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I know is that she clocks in and gets to clock out . As a SAHM , I 'm here 24/7 ( or 20/7 on the days she 's here ) . I may clock out when I go to sleep at night , but I 'm still very much on-call since I sleep with my oldest 's video monitor on my night stand , and my youngest still wakes up a few times a night to eat . 57 @qwx410057 <p> She gets paid . There , I said it . I 'm totally jealous that she 's getting paid to watch my daughter . It turns out that even though I 'm working again , the majority of the tiny income I 'm bringing in goes straight into my babysitter 's pocket . <p> I 'm incredibly grateful and fortunate that my husband 's job allows me to stay home with my girls , and I truly believe that by hiring our babysitter and having her come over a few hours a week saves my sanity . Yes , she gets the majority of my paycheck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thoughts .

They recognize that one parent is gone from the home , but they have no idea why . They may become moody , anxious , or more aggressive .

While they may show their anger with aggressive behavior , they may also become more withdrawn and depressed . <p> How well your children adjust during and following a divorce will be impacted by several factors .

Though you might feel exhausted , swollen , and stretched ( in more ways than one ) , you also know that , within weeks , your baby will be in your arms . There is excitement , anticipation , and nervousness and many moms feel torn about how to spend their free time during the last few weeks before baby 's arrival . Should you relax ? Clean ?

Pamper yourself <p> Though everyone likes to pamper themselves in different ways , most women know just what they like to do to feel good . If you like massages , book a 90-minute session .

Take the time now to build your bond and reaffirm your partnership . While it can be helpful to talk about who will complete which baby-related tasks and how you 'll split up household chores , life is often unpredictable and , when the list of who does what gets shaken up , the most important thing is to know that you have one another 's backs and are there for each other .

Make sure to let your friends know that even as your life changes and how you spend time together shifts , they 're still important ! - <p> Though having fun and relaxing before your- baby arrives is important , make sure you spend a little time now preparing your home for baby 's arrival .

@@41574311 @1574311/ <h> The Benefits of Arts &amp; Crafts <p> For your toddler , the ability to create and imagine comes naturally . Few toddlers are inhibited by rules of color and size and few are concerned with the reality of a situation when they are being artistic . For a toddler , arts and crafts can be something as simple as using crayons and paper to something as complicated as pastel painting or quilting . The truth is that there are few limits to what your toddler can create when given the tools and imaginative freedom to spark their innermost artist . <p> Toddlers love to get their hands in things . They learn by using all of their senses and being able to finger paint , use play-doh , draw in shaving cream , or paint ' music opens up their minds and enables them to fine tune motor skills , as well as cognizant learning aspects . Arts and crafts teach toddlers in an indirect manner , the truths of cause and effect , and allow them to always find the right solution . When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is nothing that does n't seem art worthy . They are happy to make faces out of their cheerios , get their hands dirty , and create sculptures in the mud or draw with their Popsicle on the kitchen table . This is a great approach to take for toddlers . Anything that they feel they can use to make art or put together a craft should be allowed in order to not inhibit their creative freedom . Give them some glue and they will be able to make a mural worthy of hanging on the mantelpiece in no time . <p> Just about every worthy pre-school curriculum entails doing some sort of art and craft activity daily . Toddlers are much more adept than we give them credit for and can manipulate things like scissors , knitting needles , hooks and latches , markers , paint brushes , modeling clay , and a plethora of other materials in order to create art .

It may not seem like art to you but allowing a toddler to play with chocolate pudding on a linoleum floor is an incredibly fun way to allow them to experiment with art . <p> Arts and crafts are also notoriously used in efforts to support letter and number recognition in toddlers , and are a great way to support academic lessons . When a toddler is being artistic they are often having so much fun that they do not even realize they are learning . Additionally , arts and craft projects help toddlers build confidence , and as they see their parents hang up and brag about their newest creation , they are filled with an overwhelming sense of accomplishment . <p> Arts and crafts can be done on the road , on vacation , outdoors , and in virtually every environment your toddler will visit .

I 'd like to see sites like this one and Drs pushing insurance companies to cover this testing from the age of 25 on since some people show a decline in egg reserves at a young age , or drastic drops rather than a gradual decline . Secondly , please inform readers about Fetal Cell Free DNA testing that can be done at 10 weeks gestation and does not carry risks of miscarriage .

@@41574336 @1574336/ <h> Must Have Baby Items From a Mom of Four <p> When I was expecting my first child , I was overwhelmed with all of the things I was told I needed for my little one . Since I did n't have any experience with babies , I did n't know what I really needed and what I could do without . A few years ( and four kids ) later , I 've discovered that the only things you truly need are a way to feed the baby and a way to get the baby around from place to place . <p> But , there are a few things that will make your life easier <p> Image via Jamie Davis Smith <p> It 's normal for babies to want to be held all the time . While you may blissfully spend the first few days ( or even weeks ) snuggled in bed with your little squish , chances are soon you will want to resume a few of your pre-mom activities and do things you did before you had a baby like eat with two hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry your baby and engage in all sorts of activities . Nursing moms will eventually be able to nurse in a carrier as well . <p> There are so many different types of carriers out there ! Some moms may find it useful to find a babywearing group , such as Babywearing International , to talk to other moms and try on wraps , soft structured carriers , and slings . From my experience , while I have tried some truly gorgeous wraps , they become cumbersome to use . I 've also found that ring slings are great for newborns but that I prefer a soft , structured carrier for long-term use . That 's me in the photo above using a Tula , which is comfortable enough for long walks with my little one . <p> It 's well known that most babies will fall asleep in the car . In fact , I 've known some moms who get in the car and drive around for as long as it takes to get their little one to take a decent nap . ( If you do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , many babies will stay asleep in their car seats for a good long while after the motor stops , making nap time a perfect time to get out and walk or run some errands . <p> To make sure you are able to transport your little one in his car seat easily , I recommend investing in a stroller travel system that allows you to snap an infant car seat into your sturdy stroller frame . A good example of an easy-t0-use system is the Quinny Buzz Xtra that is compatible with the super-light Maxi Cosi car seat . Another option is a light-weight car seat frame , such as this universal model from Baby Trend . <p> Babies use a lot of blankets and for a lot of different uses . Blankets from aden +anais were n't around when I had my first child but by the time I had my third , it seemed like they were everywhere I had to check them out for myself ; and once I did I discovered why so many moms considered them a must-have . <p> These blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are super cute . I 've used mine for everything from swaddling , a nursing cover , a cover for my car seat and stroller when my baby was napping , and to use as a play blanket in the park . They come in different weights , from the classic muslin to a silky-soft bamboo , and also for different seasons and climates . Be sure to include a pack or two on your registry ! <p> I 'm the most well-read I 've been in a while now that I am caring for a baby . Why ? I find myself spending a lot of time sitting while nursing and lying down with my little one . I treasure these moments with my baby , but wo n't lie and say I never get bored when pinned down by a fussy , feeding , or sleeping baby . <p> I 've found that my Kindle Paperwhite has been a great companion during these times . It 's much lighter than a book so I can hold it with one hand , it emits very little light so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly limitless amount of reading material including magazines so I never need to worry about running out of something to keep me occupied . It 's also small enough that I always throw it in my diaper bag for those times my baby falls asleep while we are out and about . As a bonus , its low light means it does n't wake my husband up so I can read during late-night feedings . <p> Almost as soon as your baby realizes he has hands , he will start using them to pick up anything and everything . Then , he will start throwing whatever he picks up . While your baby will likely find your constant stooping down to retrieve his discarded toys hilarious , you are likely to get frustrated , particularly when he starts tossing toys out of his stroller and car seat . For this reason , I 've found a good toy " leash " such as a lil sidekick to be indispensable . <p> Before too long , your baby 's beautiful toothless grin becomes a toothy smile . Those little teeth look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your little one will thank you for getting her a good teether or two to help her cope with the pain . <p> Chewbeads are a good choice not just because babies love them but also because they look good on Mom 's neck or wrist for easy access for your little one . <p> A good diaper bag will make your life easier . Must-have features are a wipe-off interior , lots of pockets to stay organized , and room to grow with all the things you 'll be carrying , like diapers to carrying diapers , snacks , sippy cups , toys , etc . <p> You will also be using your diaper bag a lot , and for at least a few years , so choose one that you love right off the bat so you wo n't feel like you want a replacement before your diaper bag days are over . Ju-Ju-Be bags are a popular option because they have so many styles and are constantly introducing new prints . <p> A good playmat is a must sometimes they 're called activity gyms . These serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space where they can look at brightly colored toys for stimulation in their early days . As babies get older , playmats are a soft place for tummy time . Once babies can sit , playmats are the perfect place for babies to sit and practice batting at and grabbing toys . A good playmat will have a few activities for baby and lots of room for hanging toys . I also prefer a padded playmat so baby will be extra comfortable . An example of a good playmat is the Light &amp; Sound Lotty Ladybird from Mamas &amp; Papas . <p> Before I had my fourth child , it seemed like everyone was telling me about something I had to get : the NoseFrida . I discovered for myself is the absolute best way to clear a tiny stuffed-up nose . You will need to do this more often than you think ! Do n't be put-off by the weird-looking contraption it 's the best and fastest way to make your baby more comfortable when he has a cold . <p> Another thing you will need to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb , is cut tiny fingernails on tiny fingers . The thought of doing this struck fear into my heart . So I was happy to find the NailFrida which was designed especially to cut little nails a far better solution than inefficient emery boards or trying not to cut your baby 's finger with clippers designed for a grown-up . <p> The FeverFrida is a flat design that my baby seems to prefer . And , unlike any other thermometer I 've seen , it can be worn by your baby while he sleeps and you can get updates sent to your phone complete with alerts if your baby 's fever goes above a certain temperature . When my infant had a nasty cold I was able to sleep a little better myself knowing I would get an alert if my baby started heating up . Another bonus is that the app stores your baby 's temperature so you do n't need to worry about remembering the details to share with the doctor in the morning . <p> Before your baby can sit up on her own , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will want to look around . A floor seat is a good option to engage baby with the world . I loved putting all of my little ones in floor seats so that they could watch me doing whatever it was I was doing , from making dinner to folding laundry . My younger kids loved being able to sit up and watch the older kids . Look for a floor seat with a tray so that you can put toys on it for baby to play with and later use for feeding . Some floor seats , like the Baby Snug , from Mamas &amp; Papas have compatible toy attachments and removable inserts for when baby gets bigger ( and to make cleaning easier ) . <p> A swing or a bouncer is a must-have . If you 're lucky , your baby will like either or both . Some babies make things difficult and only like one or the other . It 's impossible to know which your baby will like before he 's born , so if you can borrow both , even for a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings are basic , some have more bells and whistles like the InLighten Cradling Swing that will give your baby a light show and plays music via an MP3 hook-up . <p> You probably already know that it 's not safe for babies to sleep with blankets . You also probably know that babies get cold too ! The answer : baby sleeping bags . I thought it was a strange concept at first , but they work really well for keeping babies warm . Look for something super soft , and importantly allows easy access to your baby for diaper changes . Candide Padded Baby Wraps are a great choice .

Whose eyes is the baby going to have , and whose hair ? <p> Children who are going to have brown eyes may start with blue , and their eye color may start to darken and eventually turn to brown. - <p> When the baby is born and you first get a look at your little one , you can count all their fingers and toes and get a pretty good idea of how healthy they are right away . But you have to wait to know about their hair and eyes , especially if they are born with light-colored eyes . How long you have to wait depends to a large extent on the eye colors in your family . <p> Babies are usually born with blue/blue-gray or brown eyes . If both parents are light-skinned Caucasians , blue or blue-gray may be the eye color you will first see . If you both have dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brown eyes at birth , but not necessarily . It depends on the genes for eye color that you passed down to them . <p> Eye color is inherited . It used to be thought that it was a simple inheritance pattern , and often it is . Brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes . Research has revealed that there may be more than two genes involved in eye color as it was previously believed . If you have brown eyes , you might have- multiple brown-eye genes , or some brown and some blue . If you have blue eyes , you have more genes for blue eyes . Two brown-eyed parents will usually have brown-eyed babies . However , if both parents have a blue-eye gene , they can have a blue-eyed child . To help anticipate if this might happen to you , look back at your parents and grandparents . Think if there were any blue eyes among your relatives . <p> Green eyes are harder to understand , genetically speaking . Green eyes are dominant over blue eyes , and brown eyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these genes in the family , eye color can wind up a mixture , with hazels and other variations on green and brown . There are in fact more than two genes that actually determine eye color . That is why some people are born with eye colors that ca n't be explained in the normal way . But in most people , the main genes cause the eye color , and it is not difficult to understand . <p> Brown eyes stay brown . So if your baby is born with brown eyes , that is the color their eyes will be as they grow up . On the other hand , blue eyes do not always stay blue . <p> Eye color comes from the iris , a structure surrounding the pupil , the black area in the middle of the eye . <p> There are cells in the iris that contain the pigment called melanin , which also makes the color of your skin . All of a baby 's melanin is not present at birth . More gets synthesized with passing time . A baby who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their eye color may start to darken and eventually turn to brown . This normally happens by anywhere between six and 12 months . <p> In fact , most people used to say the eye color was set by the time the baby turned a year old . As it turns out , that is n't always true , especially in Caucasians . Eye color can change well past the first year of life , generally up to three years of age . There have been some studies that show small changes in color can occur even later , well into adulthood . The later changes may not be as dramatic as turning from blue to brown , but the changes can still be easy to see and significant . This is usually true for people whose eyes are in the middle , with grays or greens or light browns . Their eyes can get darker or lighter . These changes are slow and gradual . <p> Depending on the eye color in your family , your baby 's eyes may be their permanent color at six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown or turn brown during their first year , they will have brown eyes .

This is not a hard , fast guideline . Because some children get their baby teeth early , and will lose them early as well . The tooth may first become loose between the ages of four and five . It is generally thought that girls lose teeth sooner than boys do , according to BetterHealth.gov . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order they came in . She will lose the two bottom incisors , then the two top , and so on . It can take up to six years to lose all of her baby teeth , according to the Mayo Clinic . <p> What to Expect <p> Your child will let you know when his tooth is loose . Encourage him to move the tooth around with his tongue and wiggle it , to help loosen the bond between the root and the tooth . <p> When the tooth does fall out , your child will likely hear a " pop " as the tooth separates from the gum and roots . <p> Do not encourage him to wiggle it with his hands unless he has thoroughly washed them first . After sufficient wiggling , the tooth will become looser . This process can take days , weeks , and even months in some cases . As long as the tooth and the gums around it are not red or swelling , you should wait until the tooth falls out on its own . When the tooth does fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tooth separates from the gum and roots . He will experience some bleeding , so do n't be alarmed . <p> Removing the Tooth Through Force <p> If your child wants the tooth out , or you are tired of seeing it hanging on by a thread , you can attempt to remove it yourself . With clean hands and a piece of gauze , grasp the tooth and pull . If the tooth does not come out with that first pull , wait a few days . Removing a tooth from the mouth before the roots have dissolved enough can lead to infection . <p> When to Worry <p> In general , a loose tooth does not need to be discussed with or addressed by a medical professional . The exceptions are if the tooth is causing extreme discomfort , if the gum area is swollen , or if your child will not allow the tooth to fall out on its own and has stopped eating to avoid using the tooth . There is also some cause for concern if your child stops brushing the loose tooth out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the gum . 53 @qwx410053 <h> 2 comments <p> Both my children , 4 &amp; 6 , lost their first tooth the same day ( the 6 yr old with a little assistance from Daddy , because his sibling just could not get tooth fairy cash first and he not get any ! ) It was special and the tooth fairys mom had made the cash run that night , as well as tooth fairys husband because he was unaware his mother-in-law had made the route ( he was asleep ) . tooth fairy had it under control = 55 @qwx410055

Here are some important things to keep in mind when tackling your working situation during pregnancy . <p> It can be intimidating to break the news of your pregnancy to your employer and co-workers . It 's best to start by knowing your rights . <p> The Pregnancy Discrimination Act ( PDA ) prevents employers of companies with more than 15 employees from discriminating against you based on your pregnancy , whether it 's related to hiring , firing , pay scale , promotions , layoffs , benefits , training , or pretty much any other term or condition of employment . Always be aware of that ! <p> If you 're searching for jobs while pregnant , do n't make your pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need to disclose that you are pregnant , though employers can not discriminate you based on it . Keep employers focused on your skill sets and what you can offer them " not your pregnancy . At the same time , being honest will create trust between you and a potential employer , so avoid being overly secretive . <p> Any health insurance your employer provides must cover pregnancy-related expenses in the same way it covers other medical conditions , with the exception of abortion ( unless the mother 's life is at risk ) . <p> As long as you 're able to perform your job effectively , your employer can not force you to take leave because you are pregnant . <p> If your pregnancy advances to where you can no longer work properly , you can take part of your maternity leave before you give birth , thanks to the Family and Medical Leave Act ; however , there are some requirements under the FMLA : You have to have worked at least 1,250 hours for the employer during the 12-month period IMMEDIATELY preceding your departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer that has at least 50 employees within 75 miles .

Talking to your employer may solve the situation . But if not , the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will listen to the issues you 're having and help you file a Charge of- Discrimination .

I am afraid I will get fired and will be told that I am being laid off due to no work . They lay people off using that excuse when they feel someone is a liability for the company . Is there anything I could possibly do to calm my sickness and to avoid my employers cutting my hours ? I live in Florida and Florida does not require breaks in the work place . And I have been very unlucky to find a new job . I need this job very much . <p> Tomorrow is my first day on a new job I applied for , but I am extremely worried . I 'm in the 90 day probation before they hire me . I got hired 2 days ago , and I did not tell them I am pregnant . Should I tell them tomorrow right away ? I feel like they will fire me because Im pregnant , well technically I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking of working all of this upcoming week , and then next monday after they see how I work I could come out and be honest and let them know about my pregnancy .

Be sure you 're not doing anything too physically demanding , which could harm you or the baby . If you start to show to the point where you cant hide it anymore or if you 're having trouble performing your duties , say something . Best wishes ! <p> I 'm starting a job as an environmental tech full time i 'm 25 weeks and they do n't  know i 'm pregnant its for a hospital and i 'm wondering should i tell them or not ? I 'm able to do the job o even went to our employee health nurse to have a physical done and i 'm able to perform the job duties so i 'm wondering do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latisha If your doctor feels it is safe for you to work , and the Employee Health Nurse deems it safe , then there is really no need for you to let them know until you start to show and/or need any modifications to your job duties . Just be careful not to share your news with anyone at your office so that it does n't  get back to your employer before you 're ready to tell them . = <p> I work at my retail job for 8years , I finally became full time back in 2013 , I always worked my butt off , I eventually became sick in January leading into February came to find out I am pregnant , during that time I was late for work couple of times due to morning sickness I explain it all to my manager , a few months later she took away my full time position because of my situation , now I work part time 1day a week I became stressed out because I have bills to pay and my little one to prepare for , so some how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do at my job that does n't  affect my pregnancy and on top of that my bills and my family has to suffer . <p> I honestly think if you go looking for a job while pregnant you should disclose your pregnancy upfront . One of the things to consider BEFORE conceiving would be your current employment , need for employment , or lack thereof ( SAHM ) . I would consider a recently hired employee to be dishonest if they withheld information right from the beginning . Also if you have held your job for a respectable amount of time and have done well in your position you do n't  have to worry about losing your job due to pregnancy . <p> I worked through a temp agency who assigned me to a sales &amp; marketing place .

Even if there are laws to protect you , they still look for every excuse to get rid of you aside from telling you its because you 're pregnant .

Is there anything I can do To save my job ? <p> I have been working with my employer since the beginning of September 2013 , through a temporary service . They just asked to hire me on last week and started on their payroll on Monday , the 10th .

I feel bad not telling my boss , but I am scared that since I just started my " probationary period " with the company that they will let me go if I tell them I am pregnant and will have to take some time off after having the baby during the busiest month of the year for this company ! Should I tell them ? Should I wait until they ask , due to the obvious belly ? I do n't  know what to do ! Can they let me go due to pregnancy since I 'm in my 90 day probation period ? ? ? ? <p> This article does n't  give enough details .

A very-early preterm baby may be obviously sick , needing breathing support and tube feeding , and may sustain brain and lung damage . An older preemie may have much less in the way of visible problems . However , many premature babies have at least some behavior or learning difficulties as they get older . <p> Preterm babies need to be cared for in a NICU .

Some of the more serious conditions related to prematurity include : <p> Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( RDS ) . Preemies less than 34 weeks of gestational age usually have RDS , which occurs because the baby 's lungs have not had time to develop . It is treated with a medicine called surfactant , oxygen , and sometimes a ventilator . <p> Apnea . Apnea means that the baby stops breathing for 20 seconds or more . Preemies are monitored , and an alarm goes off , telling the nurse to stimulate the baby to breathe . <p> Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) . IVH is bleeding into the brain .

This can lead to cerebral palsy , mental retardation , learning and behavior problems . <p> Patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) . The ductus arteriosus is how blood bypasses the lungs of the baby in the womb . It closes after birth so that the blood can go to the lungs to get oxygen . Failure of the ductus to close can lead to heart failure . PDA is usually treated with medicines to help close it . Occasionally surgery is necessary . <p> Necrotizing enterocolitis : Necrotizing enterocolitis , which is a very serious infection of the intestine , usually comes on later , 2 to 3 weeks after birth . Treatment includes antibiotics and intravenous feeding to let the bowel heal . If it does n't , surgery is needed to remove the affected part of the bowel . <p> Retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP ) .

BPD usually improves over the first 2 years , but some children have a persistent disease resembling asthma . <p> A study of all premature babies born in Norway between 1967 and 1983 revealed a lot of information about their long-term prospects .

It 's best to be prepared . <p> Bees deliver venom through their stinger . If your child is stung by a bee , you want to get the stinger out as quickly as you can . Once you remove the stinger you should wash the area with soap and water . You should put ice on the area for 20 minutes at a time . If there is any redness , or your child appears to be having pain and/or itching , you can give him Benadryl at the appropriate dose for his age , and Tylenol or ibuprofen , again at the appropriate dose for his age . <p> Bee stings always hurt and itch .

It is not dangerous . <p> You have to keep an eye on the local reaction . Sometimes a child can develop a bacterial infection after a bee sting , although it is very unlikely . It may start during the same time you would expect a local reaction , or it may begin after that . Some of the indications of an infection include fever , oozing , or pus coming from the area , and increasing redness and pain . Sometimes it is very hard to tell the difference , and you will need to take your child to the doctor . <p> Some people are allergic to bee stings . Not only will the area of the bee sting get red and swollen , but the person who has been stung can have a whole-body reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vomiting , trouble swallowing and breathing , and lowered blood pressure . A full-blown reaction is called anaphylaxis and it can be fatal . <p> If your child has his first bee sting , and you see redness and swelling , and you do n't know if he is allergic to bee stings or not , take him to the doctor to be evaluated . If you see anything that looks like an allergy , any symptoms beyond the area of the sting , you may need to get to the doctor quickly . If your child is having any trouble breathing , call 911 . <p> The remedy for an allergy to a bee sting is called epinephrine , or adrenaline . If you know your child is allergic to bee stings , he should have an autoinjector called an Epi-Pen with him whenever he is outside where there are bees . Since he is too young to use it , you or whoever is taking care of him must learn to give the injection of epinephrine after a bee sting .

A large volume of bee venom can make any small child very sick . <p> Wasps , hornets , and yellow jackets all cause similar reactions to a bee sting . They do not leave behind stingers , so there is nothing to remove . Fire ants are relatives of bees . Their bites look like bee stings , except for the fact that they can cause blisters .

No it was n't informative but it was a good mood lifter . I for one am scared to find out if I get twins or not . I commend any parent that does have multiples because it is n't an easy job , its exhausting and you parents have a lot more guts and patience than those of us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all of this , you just need to grow up and have a sense of humor because reading your comments just makes me lose the happiness when reading others opinions . <p> Im having twins , but I keep having dreams its a singleton . I guess I better call the doctor and double check ! <p> Seriously , though . These are not really signs of having multiples . The only way you can know if you 're having multiples is an ultrasound . Until you have that pic of two happy little uterus hijackers in your womb . <p> Were probably reading it because were familiar with twins/multiples . Therefore when an article claims to map out signs of something were familiar with , well probably read it . In this case , well read it and laugh hysterically . <p> This is absolutely rediculous ! This article is incredibly misleading and very uninformative . The ONLY way you will ever know if its twins is by an ultrasound . According to your article I should currently be mountain climbing in the nude with my best friend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was last night . <p> I have twins I also have a singleton . My singleton baby I was my first and I was also bigger with him . Just because its twins does not equal a bigger belly ESPECIALLY BEFORE SECOND TRI ! Also if you are feeling kicks in different spots you should be to the point where twins has already been confirmed . Ugh this really just makes my head hurt . Way to do your research before publishing this . I see this has been shared and pinned almost 2,000 times just misinforming that many more who happen to come across this . <p> And lady who commented about twin running in our husbands family for one YOUR eggs have NOTHING to do with his genetic line if you release two eggs and have Di/di twins it has nothing to do with him ad if you have identicals that has nothing to do with either of you and your familys history . You just made yourself sound very under educated . <p> Thanks for the good laughs though . I hope other moms who have twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of research that went into this ! ! <p> Hey there ! Fellow twin mama here . Of course this is n't actual scientific data to support whether or not you are having twins . Its just a fun blog to discuss the ways some twin moms felt it was obvious to them early on . Myself ? I told my husband the night before my first ultrasound that my morning sickness was " twice as bad . " It was n't proof that I was having twins , but you can bet I remembered saying that when the nurse pointed out the TWO blips on the screen . <p> As you know , many people are intrigued by multiples , and like to hear stories and wonder about their own potential for having twins . This is just a fun way to show that there are all kinds of ways that twins do or dont- reveal themselves early on . Its also a chance for members like you to share your own experiences . So thank you for that ! We want to keep this a community where we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each have our own experiences and opinions . <p> Well considering the fact the Im nursing my twins as I respond to all the stupidity on this article as well as the comments , I do not have time to care about grammar . I 'm not here for that . I 'm writing a quick response so the women who happen across this disaster of an article do n't  get misguided and exceptionally misleading information . <p> Are you even a mother to multiples ? If not shut up and sit down " lady " . I do not care what you have to say , I especially could care less about the fact I missed a punctuation marks . Why do n't  you turn your attention to the article that says if you have dreams its totally twins . That Is not even realistic and flat out stupid . Oh well , at least it had given the moms of multiples community a really good laugh ! ! So please continue to make a fool of yourself . I 'm sure we would all love to see what you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont continue to speak up , until then I 'm going to go google that pet unicorn I have been wanting . After reading this Im going to say its safe to say they are real . Since I had a dream of owning one last night = <p> The fact that your reply was to correct grammar shows that you have no legitimate argument here . <p> This article is 100% ridiculous and an embarrassment for someone who has " credentials . " Its falsely giving women like you hope that you 're having twins because of your " dreams . " Guess what , if the ultrasounds still havent told you that you 're having twins ; you 're more than likely not . So just stop . Start preparing for your one baby and see that as a reality and let go of false hopes/suspicions . <p> There is not one thing factual about this article . Its a joke that the website even posted it . You can not interview one person and claim it to be credible . Everyones pregnancy is different . And guess what ! Not everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily mean double the hormones . You 're not even eating for three . <p> Im having twins and in my first trimester , I gained 1 pound . Riddle me that according to this article . Also , like Melissa said , if you 're feeling movements , you 're already way past the point of having an ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy . <p> But , oh , please do post with your results from your next appointment . While you 're at it , please educate yourselves on the facts of twin pregnancies because this article is n't teaching you one thing . <p> I felt pregnant the day after it happened ! I thought I was going insane . I actually looked up false pregnancy . I also felt nauseous from the start , which was n't too bad with my son . I do not have twins in my family , but I had a feeling before I was pregnant with my girls that I would have twins . When I was 8 months pregnant with my first baby , I had a dream that the day after I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Congratulations ! You are having twins ! " That dream stuck with me and I thought about it the day before my ultrasound . Yet , even though I had a feeling , I was still surprised when we saw two little babies on the screen ! I 'm not going to lie , the pregnancy was tough , the newborn stage was tougher , but we have survived ! They are four months old today , and although it can be difficult and overwhelming , they are well worth it ! <p> My dad teases all the girla in the family saying " you 're going to have twin " of course none of ever did . However this last time when I got pregnant of course he told me and my mom at my first appt did the same . Well we had 3 different ultrasound before I was 14 weeks and all said single . I had started to show already around 12 weeks which was really odd for me because I 'm a tiny person and did n't  show with my daughter till almoat 6 month so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter and I went in for my doctors appt that day my daughter says mom which is the head ? Lol causing me to say WHAT and it was at that time the doctor asked if we had talked about multiples because there were 2 babies not just one . <p> My mom actually had a dream i was having twins . At my first initial appt . With my pcp , she told him that and we got an ultrasound ordered that day and because could hear only one heartbeat on the Doppler . Sure enough two babies showed up on ultrasound. 55 @qwx410055

One example of that would be postpartum uterine contractions . <p> These pains may be uncomfortable , but they 're a signal that your body is slowly returning back to normal , so they 're nothing to worry about . <p> Postpartum uterine contractions occur in the days after your child is born- and range in pain levels from menstrual cramps to labor contractions . These cramps serve the purpose of shrinking the uterus back down to its prepregnancy size . <p> During pregnancy , your uterus grows up to 25 times its original size . After delivery , it has to shrink from about the size of a basketball to the size of a small pear . Postpartum uterine contractions seem to worsen with each successive delivery . This is most likely due to the extra force needed to make up for previous stretching . <p> Postpartum uterine contractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tend to be strongest immediately after delivery and during breastfeeding .

@@41574407 @1574407/ <h> The Phenomenon of Twin Talk <p> Essentially , twin talk is sort of like learning another language . Since the twins are together so often , they begin to identify words and both agree on an understanding of them . Then they will use them and expect the rest of the world to understand as well . In fact , twins often have a language of their own that is saved for those special toddler moments when they are playing well together . Twin talk also involves certain noises and grunts and can be compared to the way dogs or cats communicate with one another . <p> The problem arises when they take their twin talk on the road . When they try to talk to family members , other kids , or even mom and dad , no one can understand them . The best thing to do is to encourage them to speak properly , help them along with their words , and allow them to talk to each other that way . Eventually their language will evolve and their use of words will correct itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin talk into more realistic terms , the other will follow suit . There is a low occurrence of twins who have any long-term speech problems due to twin talk , so parents really should n't be that worried . It is time to seek help when and if they refuse to alter their language when speaking to others , or if they are n't able to learn correct words or pronunciations . According to an online clinical study in pediatrics of twins who had developed twin talk , 98% of the three-year-olds tested were language adept when given words and asked to identify the corresponding picture . <p> Essentially , twin talk happens because it works for the twins . They are able to communicate with one another in a manner that is comfortable and easier for them , and they can be understood by each other . Encouraging them to use and pronounce words properly , and using educational props like flash cards or pictures to build their language will ensure that their verbal skills are up to par . <p> Twin talk is no different from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrectly without intervention or who finishes their every sentence for them . This hinders language development , which is largely motivated by need . When it comes to being a twin , the need is always to communicate to their sibling quickly , and as long as they are understood they have no idea they are doing anything " wrong . " <p> In a way , twin talk is sort of a secret language and is something they have together . While it should n't be outwardly encouraged , it should not cause stress and should be seen as a cute phase of their twin life together . If any two people could make up a language of their own , twins would be the ones to do it ! <p> That is really neat and cute , but i have twin boy and girl and they wo n't even look at each other lol. my baby girl loves to sleep snug under her brother but he does not like it .

Today , most nipple shields are made of silicon , rubber , or latex . Nipple shields are recommended to many mothers who have sore nipples , have nipples larger than their baby 's mouth , and flat or inverted nipples . While nipple shields can help some mother 's breastfeed their babies , there are some cons associated with the use of a nipple shield . <h> How They Work <p> A nipple shield fits over the mother 's nipple , and the baby sucks on the shield instead of the actual nipple . The sucking draws out the nipple , and the milk flows through the holes in the shield . To avoid dependence on the shield , remove it after the nipple has been drawn out and place the baby directly on the mother 's nipple . <h> Pros <p> A nipple shield may help build confidence , for both baby and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . Nipple shields can help draw out a flat or inverted nipple when used at the beginning of a feeding " after a few sucks , the mother can remove the shield and feed the baby just on the breast . <h> Cons <p> Nipple shields can lessen the amount of milk the baby gets ; they also can reduce milk supply if the baby is not getting as much milk as they would from the straight breast . The mother may also be at an increased risk of getting clogged ducts , or mastitis . Using a nipple shield before exhausting all other techniques can affect the baby 's ability to transfer to a bare breast , making breastfeeding almost impossible .

I tried my hardest to calm her fears , but in reality , I completely understood . As an OB nurse , I 've been in on countless c-sections , being the first person after the doctor to hold a baby fresh from his mother 's womb , so in a way , the surgery seems pretty routine to mebut that does n't mean I 'm not aware of the risks that can accompany the procedure. - <p> Scar tissue/uterine weakening . One of the biggest risks for a c-section is not necessarily within the surgery itself , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have more children . Because a c-section literally cuts through the uterine muscle , it weakens the muscle fibers . As the incision heals , scar tissue replaces the healthy tissue , making the uterus much more susceptible to splitting open , through what is called a uterine rupture . According to an article by the- National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , the risk of uterine rupture increased by a factor of 5 for each repeated indicated c-section . Or , in other words , the more c-sections , the higher the risk of uterine rupture . Which makes sense. - <p> Trouble breastfeeding . Unlike a vaginal delivery , where a mother can literally be breastfeeding her infant seconds after giving mother , a mother in a c-section often has a much longer recovery time . After the surgery itself , which can take upwards of 30 minutes to complete after the baby is delivered , a mother usually has a one to two hour recovery time where she is carefully monitored by a nurse . She may have received additional drugs that make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painful for her to hold her baby right away and/or initiate breastfeeding . One study by the- Neonatal Medicine , Department of Medicine in London found that early initiation of breastfeeding was , predictably , much lower for mothers who had received c-sections. - <p> Respiratory problems for baby . The risks for the baby in a c-section are often two-fold , because many c-sections are usually " emergency " surgeries wherein the baby has displayed some type of distress during labor or there is a dangerous condition with the mother c-section babies are naturally more prone to have negative outcomes at birth , since that 's what usually caused the c-section in the first place . Further complicating matters is that c-section babies are notorious among healthcare staff for having trouble breathing . Unlike a journey through the birth canal , when a baby will have all of the secretions of birth " squeezed " out on her way out , a baby delivered through c-section may swallow mucus or have a more difficult time clearing secretions , which can lead to respiratory problems .

Obviously , the risk of blood loss is elevated with any type of surgery and the American Pregnancy Association reports that 1 in 6 women receiving a c-section will require a blood transfusion . One of the most common fears with a c-section is that the bleeding might actually lead a woman to require an emergency hysterectomy especially a worry for women who would like to have more children .

Before he turned 18 months , he was counting from 1 to 10 and knew the entire alphabet . When he was 2 , he was not speaking in sentences , his vocabulary was still limited , and he did not call me Mama . As my concern mounted and I talked to a few friends , some assured me that it was " normal " for boys to be slower in the speech and language areas , and because he is multilingual ( English and Arabic ) , a small delay was bound to happen . <p> My gut told me something else .

We were lucky ; - we found a wonderful speech and language pathologist who has been working with our son for the past 18 months , and we have definitely seen some improvement. - <p> For the- first- six- months , progress was slow . It probably had a lot to do with the fact that we expected overnight miracles , so overjoyed were we to get him the help he needed . At the same time , I realized that in getting help , my husband and I had stopped getting involved in his progress . We relied too much on his speech therapy . Realizing that error and learning a few things along the way has- brought about- greater progress in our son . <p> Not every speech-language pathologist is the right fit for your child .

At every session , she writes down what they worked on in that session , his progress in certain areas , and what they will focus on the following week . We are shown these notes weekly , which is very helpful to know the kind of progress he 's making . <p> We also ask our speech pathologist for " homework " " ideas and suggestions on how we can practice with our son at home , based on what they work on that week . It 's not just a great way for our child to improve , but it 's a sensible way for parents to get involved in the process . 57 @qwx410057 <p> Ask for reports <p> We ask for detailed progress reports from our speech pathologist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some are more structured and tend to have their own " reporting " style .

This also gives you the opportunity to assess if speech therapy is helping and- that you have the right speech pathologist working with your child . <p> This one is a no-brainer !

@@41574502 @1574502/ <h> Switching from Breast Milk or Formula to Cows Milk <p> The best source of nutrition for a baby is breast milk . Every group examining infant feeding has come to this same conclusion . It should not be a surprise . Breast milk , after all , is made to feed babies . A baby does not need any other food source but breast milk for the first six months of life . Women are also encouraged to breast feed longer than that for at least some of the feedings . <p> Eventually , you may want your baby to drink cow 's milk for a number of reasons . Cow 's milk is considerably cheaper than formula and is readily available . <p> Cow 's milk differs from human milk in a number of ways , all significant . It has more protein , too much for a baby . It also has too much salt . The protein in cow 's milk is not well-absorbed by babies , and it can cause small amounts of bleeding in the intestinal tract . In addition , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing blood and not getting any iron can lead to anemia , or low red blood counts , in babies . Breast milk also has more fat and cholesterol , which are actually needed by the growing baby . Breast milk has antibodies and other non-nutritional benefits that go way beyond just food . <p> Infant formulas are better for babies than cow 's milk , although not as good as breast milk . The formulas try and approximate human milk . If you are not breast feeding , you are giving the baby formula in a bottle . <p> Or you may be breast feeding and using supplementary formula . <p> Eventually , you may want your baby to drink cow 's milk for a number of reasons . Cow 's milk is considerably cheaper than formula and is readily available . It is still a good source of protein and the best source of calcium that anyone can get as they grow older . <p> Your baby has to be weaned from the breast , or from the bottle . An older child will not be breast feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she has to learn how to drink from a cup . Most babies are ready to try a cup at about 6 months of age , but are not fully weaned until 9 to 18 months . This is a separate issue from switching to cow 's milk . However , the two often overlap . Your baby will also most likely be eating solid food at this point and getting some nutrition from that . He or she will not need as much milk as previously . <p> Your baby can not digest cow 's milk until he or she is a year old . At that point , you should be trying to give him/her formula in a cup . If he or she is using a cup successfully , that is where you will introduce cow 's milk . You can try giving it to your baby straight . If he or she hates it , the best thing to do is introduce it gradually . That means mixing milk and formula . At the beginning , you should use mainly formula with a little milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can begin to increase the amount of milk and decrease the amount of formula . Eventually , you will be giving your baby whole milk . <p> If your baby will not use a cup consistently and is still taking a bottle , you can use the same methods with a bottle . <p> If your baby is only taking the breast , he or she has to learn to take a bottle or a cup . At a year 's age , it may be time for the cup . However , if your baby is not ready , you can give him breast milk in a bottle or formula in a bottle . Similarly to using a cup , you can gradually mix in whole cow 's milk . It is probably easier to mix milk with formula than breast milk . <p> So there are two things related to the switch to cow 's milk . Weaning from the breast or bottle and learning to use a cup . You need to be careful not to give your baby too much juice from a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 4 to 6 ounces a day is recommended . <p> Some infants seem to object to the temperature of milk . If necessary , you can heat the milk a little , but eventually your child will have to drink cold milk from a cup . <p> For some babies , this switch is very easy . For others , it takes longer . If you are weaning from the breast at the same time , it may be more difficult for you and your baby . It is easier to introduce the bottle and or cup first , sometime between 6 months and a year at the latest . Some women prefer to breast-feed even longer , which is perfectly healthy . However , your toddler needs to learn how to eat solid food and drink from a cup . Even if it is difficult , you and your baby will make this transition . 53 @qwx410053 <h> 14 comments <p> I was hoping to actually learn something from this article bc I 've been wondering if my daughter who just turned a year should not be drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a better nutritionally . This was def hard to read and the only reason it gives for introducing cows milk is because its " cheaper " ? ! Yes , that is true , but I 'm sure I speak for the majority of moms in saying I 'm more concerned about what is the best for my child , not what is the cheapest ! And whoever wrote this should have broken it up into 2 articles , one about weaning from bottle to cup , and the other about transitioning from breast milk &amp;/or formula to cows milk . Personally I feel like the toddler formulas would prob be more the more nutritious option , but it looks like I 'm going to have to Google it since the author of this did n't  even mention toddler formula <p> This article should be telling paren to trust their judgment and their babies . Because the babies will tell them when they are ready . You just need to be very watchful . If you have questions , ask someone who has kids , they will give you advice and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow it . Do what YOU think is best ! You are the parent ! ! ! ! <p> This has some good information in this article . However , we have been giving our son milk since he was 5 months old . Not much , when we eat a bowl of cereal he wanted some , so we gave him some . He loved it . Now he eats anything we give him at 9 months ! And he drinks out of a cup ! <p> It seems to me this article mostly talked about switching baby to a cup more than actually transitioning to cows milk .. I started my baby with a cup at 4 months and she has become very good at it . She is now 17 months and can drink from a cup ( no lid ) without spilling ( unless she does it intentionally ) . Anyway , when I tried to get my baby to drink cows milk , she pretty much hated it , so I gave her soymilk . She loved it . Now , all she drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This article was very poorly written , I had a hard time even reading it . Also , the information that they are trying to get across is very one-sided .

I cant believe this poorly written article was written by a doctor , or that a doctor would even write an article like this . <p> My thoughts exactly ! Most opinions stated in this article are just that . statements of opinion . Where are the references to scientific studies ( &amp; the dates of the research ) ? This article is ludicrous . Why do I " have " to wean my baby ? At a year old , I " should be trying " to give my baby formula in a cup ? What if my baby is exclusively breastfed ? Ick this article clearly lacks good editing at least I hope that 's the case ! Shame on you Everyday Family for posting this poorly written article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also do n't  believe a child should drink cows milk . Sooo let 's have a new informational article about cows milk . I also want to point out that cows milk does NOT make your bones strong .

@@41574505 @1574505/ <h> The Stages of Labor <p> Are n't you glad to know that labor comes in stages ? - Once you begin real labor , your body will systematically , and instinctively , perform certain aspects of labor and delivery that help physicians know where you are in the labor process . <p> Some experts say that labor comes in three stages , while others say it comes in four . <p> The stages of labor are normally divided by the progress of the cervix , once contractions begin . <p> The first stage of labor occurs at home . This is the stage that usually coerces you into going to the hospital ; it starts with light , timely contractions that seem to remain constant . They begin a pattern or a rhythm , and will last until delivery . Many women may spend several days in early ( or latent ) labor with fairly predictable contractions that thin out and dilate the cervix . It is not unusual for you to have a bloody discharge , which can be identified as the mucous plug becoming dislodged ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days or weeks beforehand ) . <p> Once you begin active labor , you will know . The timing between contractions will get shorter , - lasting for a minute or more each as your cervix becomes completely dilated ; - and the contractions will become more painful and will feel stronger . When you are completely dilated , at 10cm , you are ready for delivery . <p> This first stage of labor can take a long time . On average , women spend 8 to 12 hours in the first stages of labor . Often , doctors will give women pitocin , or another medication , to help the cervix dilate- more quickly . It is nice to have the freedom to walk around during this phase of labor . Some women may even benefit from taking a shower . Just make sure that you outline your wishes in your birthing plan . <p> Once you are completely dilated , you begin the second stage of labor .

Women who have delivered vaginally before will find that their second , third , or fourth time delivering will progress faster than their first . If you have taken an epidural , the urge to push may be dulled , and the nurses or your partner may be responsible for coaching you to push . Within minutes , or hours , your baby 's head will emerge , and you will have completed the most trying stage of labor . <p> The third stage of labor is comprised of the delivery of the placenta and afterbirth .

These contractions after labor will last anywhere from several hours to a day or more and are facilitated by nursing .

There are many scary unknowns and exciting things you 're probably looking forward to as you journey through pregnancy and begin your new chapter of raising a baby . <p> You 'll most likely seek the advice of your closest friends who 've been pregnant before and begin stocking up on must-reads to answer all your pressing questions .

You 'll probably get away with wearing your regular clothes for the first trimester , but once you start to show , do n't go rushing to spend your whole maternity budget right away . <p> Instead , opt for a pair or two of pants ( or use a belly band that allows you to rock the unbuttoned pants look without anyone knowing ) and some longer shirts .

Squat Machine <p> While this may seem harmless enough , the squat machine was one that I was extremely wary of . Not only was I a little unsure of what I was doing , but I was terrified of getting stuck in that squat position and not being physically able to push it back up , only to crawl out of it on my hands and knees crying .

Hammer Strength <p> This machine totally intimidated me . One , because I had no idea how to use it , and two , because I never saw anyone else on it , either ! I walked around it a few times thinking I was probably smart enough to figure it out , but I was always questioning myself . I did n't want to use it wrong .

Weight-Assisted Chin Up/Dip Machine <p> Just looking at this machine scared me . I did n't know how I was supposed to get on it , and once I was on it , I was n't sure what I was supposed to do . It seemed like I should know where the weight adjustment was , but I promise you , I walked around the machine twice and still did n't see it until it was pointed out to me .

While there is n't a " wrong " way to pull up/dip , you do need to be careful you do n't lock your elbows , and when you are mounting/dismounting the machine , remember their is a bit of resistance and recoil . <p> Image via Jeanna Strassburg <p> 4 . Rope Pull Down <p> Yes . I am this dramatic . I honestly had no idea why these machines had ropes ! Was this different from a bar ? Why ? How am I supposed to stand ?

@@41574527 @1574527/ <p> The good news is by the time they were 12-14 months old , all of those special feelings and contentedness with bonding seemed to naturally fall into place . For someone who has twins , especially if you have them first , it is important to realize that your pregnancy , birth , and first year experience is completely different from someone else 's . The problem is that I did n't realize this until some 4 years later when I had my singleton birth . Mothers of twins need to know ! <p> Twin pregnancy and delivery is nothing short of a 3-ring circus . There are so many people constantly watching you , asking you questions , and treating you as if you are a delicate piece of porcelain . The birth of twins is also accompanied by so many people , many of whom , like the respiratory therapists , are expecting the worst . For many moms who may have been dead-set on a vaginal delivery , they are encouraged by the medical community to submit to a C-section . Once the babies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be checked out thoroughly . They may end up in a nursery or NICU where mom does n't have access or where they are surrounded by too many well wishers that mom feels an immediate disconnect . This can make the birth experience feel like a let-down to say the least , and many twin moms report feeling as though their involvement in the birth and direct days following is almost like an afterthought . The whole thing is very hectic , which is not conducive to bonding at all . <p> Then there is the almost surreal feeling of holding two babies at once . Even though you knew they were there all along , once you see them in the flesh , it is totally different . In flood the feelings of joy , pride , and of being overwhelmed , worried , and stressed all at once . Before you have time to heal , it 's game on , and you become a non-stop caregiver for the next 12 months with little time to breathe , let alone bond ! When there is always so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your own feelings ? <p> The other problem is that when you have two babies , there is always one for someone else to hold . This means that you do n't get that intimate time looking deeply into your newborn 's eyes , and if you try to hold both of them , some well-meaning person will always snag them from you . In the first few weeks , just like in all births , family involvement is often intrusive and abundant stealing away those first few days of adjusting to the new lives in your life . Let 's mention hormones as well , and all the endless decisions about bottle or breast , co-sleep or crib , etcthat a new mother is faced with . Together , a mother of twins is doubly stressed ! Then , one day 6-12 months later , you realize as you are changing two diapers for the 10th time that morning , that you have n't had one minute to stop and smell the roses ' , that you still do n't feel like you have bonded with your babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in books ! <p> The truth is that you have to be patient with yourself . You have to give yourself time and you have to realize that your twin ' experience is not like a single birth . In fact , there are plenty of things that make it better ! You also have to realize that no one person , book , friend , doctor or other mother can tell you how this bonding thing is supposed to work . It is personal , intimate and completely unfolds in your own time . There is an emotional process that comes with having twins and the time will come when you feel just as bonded as is right . The time will come when you will have processed everything from conception to birth and come to terms with it regardless of your early expectations . There will come a time when people will finally leave you alone to do what you do bestbe a mother of twins . It takes a certain kind of person who is organized , realistic , confident and not dreamy or weak to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether you feel that metaphorical sense of bonding ' or not , your twins feel it .

You just have n't had time to notice it . For every mom , whether she has one baby or three , the bonding develops slowly and surely just like it does in every relationship in our lives ; the difference with out children is that the love part comes first .

Darlene and her identical twin sister , Diana , were visiting relatives who lived near the convention and decided to stop by . <p> Mark experienced love at first sight when he met Darlene and he wanted to introduce his brother , Craig , to Darlene 's identical twin sister , Diane . To make a long story short , two brothers met their identical twin soul mate sisters . After dating for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the exact same engagement ring . <p> To take the identical twin theme even a bit further , they had a double wedding and the ladies even wore the exact same dress design and their father walked them both down the aisle together in 1999 . But , they did n't stop there with twins <p> In 2001 , Craig and Diane gave birth to identical twin boys , Colby and Brady . What are the odds ? Glad you asked . The odds of identical twin brothers , marrying identical twin sisters and then one of the couples giving birth to identical twin sons in one in millions . <p> Mark and Darlene have 2 little girls and Craig and Diane have the identical twin boys and another son . Due to genetic makeup , all five of the children are technically considered siblings but reason , and the fact that they have different parents , makes them cousins . If your mind is not completely blown away by this family and you are not seeing double yet , the families live next door to one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an identity of your own in that family . Then again , would n't it be awesome to have two of you ? <p> I 'm not a twin but I would think that after awhile you would want to stop having who you are permanently tethered to someone else . I think this story is very cool but if I had a sister , who looked just like me , living right next door with her husband that looked just like mine , I 'd feel like I was always being compared to her and that would get old really fast . I 'd imagine the price of having a built in best friend is losing some of your own independence and identity . <p> I wonder if the spouses ever mistake the wrong person for their partner ? Or what about the children do they call Auntie Darlene Mommy accidentally and vice versa ?

Twins are real people , we are not some cute dolls for you parents to make a spectacle out of .

Quit encouraging disabling codependency between your twins so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other friends ! <p> You may think I am bitter from my own experience , but my parents were fabulous and allowed me and my sister to be ourselves , not half of a whole known as the " Twins " . Even with all they did , it was hard to be recognized as an individual and as an adult I 've had childhood friends admit that they struggled to tell us apart and to remember who they had what conversations with . I 've watched other twins though , grow into adulthood , unable to function as an individual because they never learned how to socialize with others . This is why twins marry other twins , because they are used to being part of a unit ! Parents of identical twins if your children were not twins , how would you feel about people never bothering to remember their names , or appreciating their distinct personalities ? SO stop putting barriers up by making it even harder for your friends , family , teachers and peers with matchy matchy clothing , rhyming names and identical haircuts ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I 've known 3 sets of identical twins in the 61 years I 've been on this planet and not a single one of them resented their twin looking like them all of them felt lonely when the other was away on a trip or vacation . 1 set of twins were raised NOT wearing identical outfits but later in life were both drawn to the same styles and colors and would often appear , unplanned , in almost identical outfits . You are entitled to your opinion about how identical twins should be raised but this is not really the right forum for that . These ADULTS could have stopped the " identical " dressing at any time after they began dressing themselvesthey chose to do what they 've been doing .

The redheads hated each other , the brunettes could n't function without the other one around ( could n't sleep over unless the twin was there even tho they were in seperate classes at school . ) Mine were in the same class ( small Christian school and only 1 class for their age group . ) I TAUGHT them how to prioritize their lives : #1 : GOD FIRST , #2 : Their spouse , #3 : Their children , #4 : Their twin , #5 : Their parents &amp; siblings .

Children of multiple births are blessed with their first best friend at birth that will always be around to the end . <p> When I was growing up we had 2 identical twin brothers that married identical twin sisters . Both couples got pregnant twice at the same time . The first time they both had sons that looked very different , but the second time they both had daughters that look exactly alike . It was mind blowing . <p> How many times must this writer use " exact same " within this article ? Maybe this goes along with the twin theme , but if two things are the same , then they are also exact . " Exact same " is redundant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet peeve of mine , and I find it hard to forgive when its a professional writer using it . Besides this little gripe , this is an interesting article . <p> Hi scp1957 So good to read your story here ! It took me ages to work out , but surely your mum and dad must have had the same surname before they married . Maybe if it is a common surname they may not have suspected they were related . Do tell me if they were the same , otherwise I have not been so successful as I thought working it out ! The only way I could grasp it was to substitute my family relations , imagining that two male siblings and two female siblings were actually twins . But that would make your mums twin aunts having married their nephews and their nephew ( your dad ) having married their niece , ( your mum ) ! That is assuming your dads granddad married your mums mum ! I still havent figured out who the two married couples on each list would be ! MY you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

Chances are your twins are a bit smaller than the standard baby , and their needs , especially feeding , will be more encompassing in the first few weeks . While most babies need to eat every 3-4 hours , twins will need to eat around every hour and a half in the very beginning ; this is often complicated by the fact that many twins born a few weeks early , and babies born a few weeks early usually do not have properly developed sucking muscles , therefore , special attention will be required during feedings . <p> You , like most other mothers of twins , will have tons of help in the immediate days and weeks following birth .

The best thing you can to do is to get them into a routine or schedule of doing everything at the same time . Feed them bottles at the same time , give their baths one right after the next , and even do diaper changes in tandem . If one baby wakes up to feed at 2:00 am and the other seems peaceful , wake the other up anyways and give him a bottle . By doing everything at the same time , you will actually be giving yourself more time to rest ensuring that you wo n't spend 24 hours a day tending to a newborn .

When one needs a burp , simply dislodge both from eating , and burp them one right after the other . Chances are you will have one twin that is a gulper while the other one can barely stay awake during the feeding . When it 's over , you will have time to hold and rock two sleeping angels , and when you are ready you can transport them to the crib to sleep . Guess what ?

Allow one to be resting peacefully in his bouncy seat while the other gets the sink bath ; and then switch . This way they can be dried , diapered , and dressed together . Giving baths this way only takes about 15 minutes once you become a pro , keeping bath time from being an all day event . Make sure you keep all the supplies you need in a handy basket to be as efficient as possible . Dress them together afterward , and then start a routine of having some floor time in the living room for a brief period of stimulation . <p> While it might be difficult at first , ensuring that their sleeping schedule is simultaneous can be a life saver .

If you pull double duty with everything in the first few weeks of life , you will effectively get time between duties to relax or at least do the mountains of laundry piling up in the nursery ! <p> From the word GO , make sure that you allow yourself time to care for your twins alone .

Something along the lines of , Guys , Guess What ? Sex Leads To Pregnancy ! or More Sex = More Chance of Getting Pregnant. - <p> Well , duh , sex can lead to pregnancy . We know this and I definitely know it now , even my 21-year-old self did n't exactly heed the warning . Ahem . But a new study found that more sex could increase a woman 's chance of getting pregnancy for a rather surprising reason because more sex actually boosts her immune system . <p> Essentially , one study found that having sex at certain times during a woman 's cycle boosted her immune system , activating specific immune system cells that helped defend her body against harmful bacteria or viruses that might prevent her from getting pregnant . Women who had more sex also had lower- types of cells that helped make sure the woman 's body did n't actually attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the same cells responsible for helping her get pregnant naturally were also activated with condom use . Something they should put on the boxes , perhaps ? - <p> Taken- all together , the study suggests- that with the " activation " of sex at key times of the month , the woman 's body primes her immune system to not only help her get pregnant , but have a healthy pregnancy as well. - <p> And the benefits do n't just extend to women getting pregnant the old-fashioned way. - <p> Another study in Fertility &amp; Study found that couples undergoing IVF to get pregnant had higher success rates for pregnancy if the woman 's immune system was boosted before the IVF process . Essentially , by some process doctors do n't fully understand just yet , when a woman 's immune system is in tip-top shape and activated , it somehow affects her eggs and the embryos that result from women have immune system activation actually end up being more viable when she goes through IVF . Put more simply , if her immune system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryo through IVF appears to be higher. - <p> I guess the moral of the story here is pretty simple . If you 're trying to get pregnant , more sex might be a good thing and not just " saved " for when you 're most fertile . And if you 're just trying to boost your immune system to avoid the next cold and flu season well , you know what to do .

For many reasons , some babies just do n't want to stay in your uterus for the full 40 weeks , and any child born before 37 weeks is considered premature . <p> What a premature baby may need entirely depends on just how developed they are when born . Premature babies most often need help breathing and may have problems with kidney function .

When feeding your baby , hold him or her as close as possible , to your bare skin if you feel comfortable , as this will allow you to create that important bond between mother and child , even if breastfeeding is n't an option . <p> Once your baby reaches their original due date , they will most likely have caught up to where they would have been had they gone full term .

Now , number three is on the way and while I will attempt to breast feed one more time , I am prepared to supplement and to bottle feed only if necessary without tears or guilt . I would love to breast feed if it were possible but thank goodness for formula for those of us who ca n't . And if you choose to never try to breast feed that should cause no guilt . Its whatever works for you and baby . Feeding your baby should be bonding time no matter how you are feeding . Not time for guilt . <p> Same here I tried like crazy for 4 weeks and those were the most miserable weeks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby cried so much when latching on well to find out it was his frustration of nothing coming out I felt horrible when finding this out as I felt that I was making him starve , i would get less than an ounce at an hour of pumping ! !

Mind this is my 4th child , breastfeeding is tough and I applaude the ones who hang in there and succeed but some of us just do n't  produce not even after lactation cookies , teas , pills and so on . nothing wrong with formula , feeding time should be bonding time not a time of frustration for both mom and baby <p> I went through the same thing ! The lactation consultant refused to believe that I was n't producing enough , my younger sister kept saying keep trying ! You 're just not trying hard enough ( what ? ! ) . Finally since I was supplementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast milk than formula I just decided to go ahead and formula feed . I was not going to let anyone make me feel like a bad mother for feeding my child the only way I could ! <p> To all mommys , STOP THE JUDGING ! Breastfeed if you can , formula feed if you can , just make sure that baby gets fed ! Formula is n't evil , it saves lives . Ive run the gammut of breastfeeding issues with my 3 sons . First one was small , had a slight tounge tie , but fed well . My biggest problem was no where to pump when I could n't be with him . I pumped ( with a manual pump ) in my car , in january in South Dakota . Let me tell you , you do n't  get much milk out when you are freezing your ass off . Made it 3 months before I dried up . But I was taking classes and working , and even with breastfeeding my son caught everything that came down the line . My second son , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't keep up and had to start supplementing . Again , working all the time , plus a 3yo .

With him , I was producing enough ( I lived on mothers milk teas , breastfeeding cookies etc ) but he was a light eater , and never did take a bottle ( tried 6 different kinds ) So instead of letting the haters bother me , I learned to do what was right for my boys . Both breastfeeding and formula feeding worked . I have 3 healthy sons , 13 , 10 and 3 . <p> I did n't  know breastfeeding was supposed to be enjoyable ?

I just do n't  get this point of view , especially if there 's the usual bumps in the road that occur with breastfeeding . I get when there is truly low supply issues and latching difficulties where a mother stops and I 'm not judging mothers that cant breastfeed , is finding it too difficult because of whatever problem or even the mother who chooses to formula feed because she simply wants to but I just do n't  get where we are supposed to enjoy it comes in ? There is much to do in parenting that is n't at enjoyable ( discipline , helping with homework , organizing birthday parties , getting them ready for school etc ) <p> I wish I would have heard more stories about moms not being able to breastfeed when I gave birth to all three of my children . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no success . In fact I spent more money on supplements and lactation appointments than I spent on formula for my kids . It would be a wonderful concept for health care providers to offer up to new moms that sometimes , for whatever reason some moms just can not produce enough milk to solely provide for their children . This would have saved me a lot of emotional guilt and allowed me to truly enjoy this bonding time with my child . Even after having 3 kids , I still have not had any provider tell me , you did nothing wrong , sometimes it just does n't  work . So thank you to all the moms out there that are speaking up about this sensitive topic . <p> Sad how no one tells us just how hard bf can be . If health care professionals did this and prepared us a bit better we would have higher success rates . I had a lot of issues initially but knowing breast milk is the ideal I chose to stick it out . I am so happy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame to hear bf is not your priority when it is the best for baby . <p> Itd be ridiculous to make something a priority if you are physically incapable of doing that thing .

But there is no shame in formula feeding your baby , especially when your body has decided that a milk supply just is n't going to happen . As long as a mother is providing sustenance for her little one , you cant look down upon them . <p> The fact that so many women think they physically CANT breastfeed and that they have supply issues is the reason pro breastfeeders get SOOO upset ! ! !

So once again , thank you so , so much ! <p> You should REALLY do research on supply ! At this stage your baby should be nursing VERY frequently to give you your supply . you skip nursing and give your baby a bottle you are hurting your own supply . Only 3% of women have low supply and that is from very rare medical conditions ! Unless your baby stops having dirty diapers then your supply is fine . You should give yourself and body more credit !

I spent a lot of time crying feeling like I had failed as a mother , but I have come to terms with it because he is happy and healthy . <p> Of course breastfeeding a baby is the most natural thing . I do n't  think any of the wonderful mommies on here are trying to say its not . That 's wonderful that you have been able to nurse all of your babies .

I actually was a formula fed baby as well.due to my mom not having enough milk for me . She did the same thing let people pressure her and I ended up with severe jaundice and having to be hospitalized at 2 weeks old . SO.needless to say with my baby.supplementing and having to go to formula was what I had to do , even though that was not what I would choose . An article like this makes us moms who had to supplement or formula feed all together ( due to no lack of trying ) feel like we are not alone ! It makes us realize other women are going through the same battles and the fact that she was ok sharing her story is brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter was born I felt like a failure and terrible mom when I could not breast feed . It was the worst feeling in the world at the time and I felt like I let everyone down . SO . Comments like yours above are only going to be negative for a new mom during a time when moms need the opposite.to hear the most positive things ! Looking back I wish I had given myself a break as a new mom instead of loosing so much joy in those early months due to guilt and feelings of failure . I realize now I did the best thing for my baby by making sure she was fed and making sure I got my confidence back as a mother ! This time around . Ill sure be trying again.but without the guilt and pressure . If I can , great . and if not . well I know that I will have done my very best trying and that my daughter is going to be around a happy mom who is going to truly enjoy every precious moment with her no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursed my son for 8 weeks . Fed him everytime he was hungry , every hour to 3 hours . He was not gaining weight . Worked with lactation consultants . Had a beautiful latch . Had lots of tests done in me , no red flags . Took fenugreek til I smelled like it . Seank tons of water and ate extra calories . He would nurse for an hour , weighed before and after did n't  gain an ounce . I pumped 5 min . Before , nursed both sides 20 minutes , pumped 20 minutes , at the advice of lactation consultants . I never pumped more then half an ounce . I never leaked of felt let down or full . My son the first two weeks was starving , not gaining weight , because I was mortified to give him formula because of all of the hype on breast feeding is best , formula is evil . After 8 weeks I could n't take it anymore , I was n't bonding or spending quality time , it was stressed time worrying about how many ounces or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired of people not talking about some women milk is not enough ! My doctors , pediatrician , and lactation consultants said feed your baby formula ! <p> You know what ? The same thing happened to me . I delivered my daughter a month early due to pre eclampsia and my milk never came in . I rented a breast pump for about 2 months and all I was ever able to pump was 2 ozs . My daughter was constantly hunger and losing weight . I thought I lived attached to that horrible device . I felt horrible I could n't produce enough for her and got some ridicule from others that I had failed to give my daughter the proper immunity , but in the end I too said enough was enough and returned the pump and moved on . It happens . I also have PCOS , so I imagine that with the pre eclampsia triggered my body not to produce . But in the end it turned out ok . My daughter now at 15 months is 23 lbs and 32 inches . I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed this story today ! Its nearly identical to what I 've been through the last few days ( my daughter is only 6 days old ! ) . I did n't  realize I was n't producing enough milk until a couple nights ago after 4 hours of nonstop crying , 1 1/2 hours of breastfeeding in 3 hours and she still seemed hungry . Thank goodness we had some formula samples mailed to us that I did n't  toss , tried one and she was gulping it down ! ! Tried to pump for the first time the next day and realized I was barely producing ! I was starving my little girl ! ! So I said screw all the lactation people and drs that make it sound like formula feeding is the ultimate sin ! My daughter is hungry she is getting formula with intermixed bottles of whatever milk I can produce each day . If and when my milk comes in enough to cut back the formula , that 's what we will do . They say bottle fed babies do n't  bond as well with their moms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I snuggle with her and appreciate the time when she is happily being bottle fed and I can see her face more than in the awkward positions trying to teach her to latch while I sit in agonizing pain because she is trying to chew my nipple off ! ! <p> I am typing as a nurse my 4 month old son ( who just had 3 oz of formula right before that ) . I had no supply problems with 5 babies- nursed each one fully till they were at least 1 yr old and most till 20-24 months . My 6th baby , a boy was born no different than the rest , and seemed to latch just fine . He seemed ok until he was weighed and was n't gaining and he was hardly wetting/dirtying diapers in his first week . After trying everything for 6 weeks , we came to realize it was my supply that was the problem . I started supplementing and he has grown so well since then . At first I felt like a failure . I could n't understand why this was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with my 5 other babies . I felt guilty each time I 'd pull the bottle out , especially in public ( where I also always felt being judged when I was breastfeeding too ) . I felt like I had to justify my actions to everyone . Soon after , my 2 yr old daughter was very sick and almost died . She spent 10 days in the PICU and it was a hard and stressful situation . I am glad that I had introduced formula by then so I was actually prepared for this in a way because my baby was not allowed in the PICU so I had to leave him with whoever was available to take care of him while I visited my daughter . I am so glad that I realize that it is not as important WHAT you feed , but THAT you feed your baby . Yes , breastmilk is the most ideal , but sometimes it is n't feasable and we all need to be more supportive of each other . I nurse my baby as much as I can now and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that we have that available to us . He is healthy&amp;happy now and were doing what we need to and what 's best for us . <p> honey what you are describing here is called " cluster feeding " . all babies go through this several times in the first few months i assure you your baby is not starving . when your baby goes though these cluster feeding stages just simply let them nurse as much as they want . that 's the magic of BF , its a supply and demand basis . meaning the more your baby nurses today the more milk you will have tomorrow . this is a common mistake many new mothers make and why so many fail at breastfeeding . If you want to successfully breast feed then do n't  give up ! do n't  offer formula in fear that your baby is starvingoffer the breast every time ! <p> THANK YOU ! ! ! ! Drives me CRAZY when people blame not breastfeeding on low supply ! ! ! It does n't  matter how expensive the pump it still can NOT tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than your baby ! If someone wants to quit because they want to quit than FINE but them thinking they have to because they cant see that their l baby is trying to up their supply makes me CRAZY ! ! ! Ok rant over ! <p> Kayla , Just so you know , this is not always cluster feeding . I breastfed and pumped , I did this habitually and worked with lactation consultants and it really could be that you really are starving your baby . All three of my children lost too much weight that the doctors and lactation consultants told me to stop exclusively trying to bf and supplement . I was only producuing about an oz per feeding . Clearly this is not enough . I tried my best not to beat myself up over this , feeling like I was to blame , but none the less there were many tears at my being able to be exclusive . I found for myself that I would offer the breast until they showed to me I was empty and then would supplement . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose to give to new moms who are really trying to bf , but struggling . We all are dealing with a lot of emotions and when you are unable to produce and satisfy your child naturally , it can be a very devasting experience . Once we started supplementing and I watched my kids truly being satisfied and gulp down their bottle , I was very sad , but relieved at the same time . <p> I 'm still breast feeding my 13 months old and pplanning to wean him off but donno how Its not a simple thing breast feeding is painful to start as well as to end Now my little ones not accepting any other milk or formula I 'm worried if I stop bf what happens to the nutrition thing I think I 'll go with formula feeding the next time . May be . <p> I get tired of people telling me all the negatives to formula feeding babies . I had a " friend " who criticized me and always sent me articles about the benefits to breast feeding and the downside to bottle feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not so much . I tried , and just like the author I was devastated when my daughter stopped . But then I realized that I was bottle fed and I turned out alright . All the things she said that made breast feeding better ( breast fed babies are healthier , skinnier , and smarter than bottle fed babies ) are n't  necessarily true . I am not dumb , I have never gotten sick ( besides seasonal cold ) and yeah I 'm over weight but that 's because lazy and did n't  try to loose the baby weight after my first . I am currently 34 weeks pregnant and I 'm going to try and breast feed again but if it does n't  work . Well then , oh well . My daughter is five and she is perfectly healthy , not overweight and damn is she smart . So thank you to the writer of this article . I 'm glad that I 'm not the only one who is n't worried about breast feeding . I get tired of all the breast is best stuff and the criticism women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is or is n't breast feeding so do n't  judge . <p> This resonated so strongly with me . Especially the part about being ashamed to pull out a bottle in public for feedings . I 'm over that now and me and my healthy 4 month old are happier . = I shared this article on FB and was amazed at how many of my friends have had the same experience . Its time to lose the guilt . Feed your baby . Love your baby . Period . <p> supplement and eventually formula feed all together . I felt like I failed and was letting everyone around me and most importantly my baby down . Looking back now , I realize I had the wrong viewpoint ! I did the very best I could and I have a beautiful and healthy baby girl now . I refuse this time around to let any negative , judging ( yet supposed well meaning ) comments effect me . Being a new mom is hard enough without thatwe all need positive support instead ! Thank you for sharing your experience with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this article ! I am any moment away from my second baby girl arriving and this is just what I needed to hear ! This is very similar to what happened to me and her description of the guilt , pressure , tears and judgements matches my what I went through . Looking back I missed out on so much of the joyful part of having a newborn and small baby as I stressed with the nursing and when I did have to s <p> You know the thing that bothers me the most is that if these accounts had been about men struggling with the breastfeeding/bottle feeding delimma no one would have batted an eye . They would never stare at a man feeding his child demanding to know what was in the bottle . Only smile and nod encouragingly . Why can we not give the same support to women ? Because it is expected of women . Very rarely does a lady get a nod for carrying around , feeding , cleaning , or playing with her youngins .

The idea of consciously preparing for conception and pregnancy is a phenomenon of our times . The theory and teachings of conscious conception are simple but few modern couples practice these preparations for conception , even though they can influence the finished product in the womb . The practice of conscious conception has brought hope and happiness to women and their partners by helping them to overcome their personal obstacles and successfully conceive and maintain healthy pregnancies . Conscious conception begins with your intention to invite a child into your family . As you refine your intention for the highest good , and practice communicating your intention , you will experience a shift within yourself . <p> Preconception For couples wanting to give their children the absolutely best start in life , the preparation will begin before conception .

The man 's sperm is produced constantly and is more vulnerable to toxins , drugs , and environmental pollutants .

It was a wonderful adventure for the two of us to share , and I found as we read that I saw the books and the characters through new eyes this time around . <p> The first time I read the books it was with breathless joy , staying up all night to tear through the pages , sobbing and laughing and rejoicing and feeling at home with the story but alone with my thoughts as I processed and understood the words . This time I had a perceptive and inquisitive second voice that would pipe up to ask " why ? " or to cry out in anger ; and tiny hands to pass me a tissue as we mourned together when a beloved character was taken away . <p> As I read , I kept coming back to the fact that while it seems to be a story about a boy , it is also a story about family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sharing 7 things that the Harry Potter books reinforced for me about parenting , and about motherhood . <p> Sometimes , mothers suck . They berate and belittle their children and fail to see the value that they bring to the world if they are n't doing exactly what they are " supposed " to be doing . Sirius Black was raised by one of those . And while it 's only in the magical world that your dead mother 's portrait can continue to torment you by screaming insults and angry words , I think it represents well the feeling a child who is forced to live with a mother like this has to carry with them for the rest of their lives . <p> Hagrid also carries the influence of his absent mother , in his physical being and enormous size . He is marked as having giant 's blood , and faces ridicule and suspicion frequently as a result . Despite this , he stands out as one of the most accepting , nurturing , and gentle characters one willing to offer love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of these characters , we 're reminded that it 's not impossible to be better than the way you were raised . With all of their flaws , both Sirius and Hagrid , play vital roles in showing that your childhood and your past do n't have to define you . <p> We have to accept that the best we can do is the best we can do , and we must also accept the limits of others . <p> Sometimes , as mothers , we have to do things that do n't make sense to others . We have to take what may seem like an impossible situation and make the best of it for our children . We see this happen for two mothers Voldemort 's and Dumbledore 's . <p> Voldemort 's mother does n't have much to offer her son . Born of trickery into a family who pretty much owns the word dysfunctional , his mother ca n't imagine bringing a child into the world she has inhabited and only wishes to leave . So , in her final act , she manages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a chance at something other than the life she knew . <p> Dumbledore 's mother is also facing the world alone , with her husband imprisoned and her daughter suffering from a dangerous illness . She willingly abandons the life she might have had to do the best she can to care for the child she ca n't give up . <p> Both Voldemort and Dumbledore come from broken families , from a history of anger and unhappiness . But each also comes from a mother who did as much as she was capable of to offer a better life to her children than the one she knew for herself . The difference in their outcomes is related to their assessment of their mothers . Voldemort blames his , Dumbledore forgives his . <p> Neville Longbottom is n't unique in the fact that he is growing up without a mother present . But the legendary force that he does have is worthy of repeated mention . Who could forget the boggart appearing as Snape , decked out in grandma 's finest outfit ? In all seriousness , Neville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fills the role of mother is n't the one who gave birth to you but that does n't make them any less important or influential . <p> Without a doubt , one of my favorite characters is Mrs. Weasley . She is the embodiment of what movies would like us to believe a mother is nurturing , attentive , reliable , and a little bit flustered by caring for her family . She is genuine and the closest thing that Harry experiences to having a mother of his own . But it 's also easy to forget just how powerful and important she is , not only to her family , but to the world she is working to protect . <p> One of my favorite moments is when Molly Weasley has finally had enough of dear Bellatrix . In that moment of fire and anger , she embodies the essence of what it is to be a mother . You want your children to grow , to find their own strengths , to be their own people . But if someone is intent on harming your child , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Narcissa Malfoy is hardly an example of a good role model , but even as she vows to serve the Dark Lord she is not able to give herself entirely over to his service . Not if the cost is her son . We see this determination in her insistence that Snape make an Unbreakable Vow to protect Draco . <p> But at the pivotal moment , wherein she decides that the life of her son , Draco , is worth more to her than the wishes of Voldemort , hers is the lie that changes the course of the battleand once again , Harry is saved by a mother 's love . <p> Which leads us to the mother who is really the center of the whole story , Lily Potter . A mother who , without hesitation , gave her own life in an attempt to save the life of her son . If it were n't for Lily , there would be no Harry , no story , no love to save them all . Her protection , her act of total and unconditional love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't that the love we all want our children to feel ?

She also wrote it after losing the important presence of her own mother .

@@41574631 @1574631/ <h> How to Organize All of Those Digital Photos ! <p> I am guessing that most of us feel lucky if we even manage to get all of our photos off of our phones and cameras and onto our computers . But once the photos are there , the process of reviewing them and then doing something with them is just too much ! <p> But just thinkif you had a system of storing and organizing photos , you would actually be able to find and enjoy the photos you have , find a particular photo if you are looking for it , and perhaps even turn some of your photos into framed pieces for your home or even assemble them into a digital scrapbook ! Lately , I 've been making an effort to stay on top of uploading , reviewing , and organizing my digital photos . Here 's how to organize all of those digital photos : <p> Since I am an all-Apple kind of girl , I use the iPhoto app , which comes pre-loaded on Macs . But if you are a Windows fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does many of the same things . Or if you want to store your photos online , you can try Google 's Picasa , where your photos are not stored on your computer at all , but are saved in the cloud . ( And of course , there are dozens and dozens of photo storage sitessome paid and some freeso do your research before committing to a solution . ) <p> As a Mac user , I have Photo Stream turned on , which automatically uploads all of the pictures that I have taken on my phone and tablet to the " cloud " so that they are instantly available on all of my devices , including my laptop ( up to 1000 photos ) . The cool thing about Photo Stream is that it is a temporary sync of these photos ( for just 30 days ) . All of these synced pictures are in stored in iPhoto by month and are automatically removed from my laptop if I do not specifically save them to iPhoto on my laptop . If I decide that I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I move them into their own folder within iPhoto . <p> For pictures taken on my camera , I have to put a reminder in my calendar at the end of each month to make sure that I upload all of them onto my laptop , and then I delete the originals from my camera , which frees up the memory cards to be used again . After they are uploaded , I group them into logical " events " ( which are like folders ) and then label each of the events so I can easily find any picture that I need . I know that some people label their photo folders with just the date range of when the pictures were taken . But I find it so much easier to find photos later if I label them by subject , like " New Hampshire Vacation " or " Spencer 's fall soccer season . " <p> Here is an example : I recently watched my son play in his first junior varsity soccer game and snapped 18 pictures of him on the field . I came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these 18 photos , six of them are awesome action shots of my son . So right off the bat , I know I can delete the 12 non-keepers . But what about the other six ? Do I really need to keep six pictures of him playing in one soccer game ? I do n't . I need to select just one great photo and delete the rest . Not only does this clear up space on my computer for other things , but more importantly , if later on I decide that I want to print a photo of Kyle playing soccer to frame it , I can go into this folder and find just the one picture that I need . I am not looking through six pictures to decide all over again which one is best . <p> I think the thing that overwhelms most people is deciding what to keep and what to delete . And so they err on keeping far more than they will ever use " just in case . " But that leads to " photo clutter " on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the pictures you love . <p> So once we 've uploaded all of our photos to a computer and then spent time reviewing and deleting , it would be awful to lose all of those photos that we decided we loved ! So it is important to back up your photos periodically ( every month or even every three months ) just so you know your photos are safe in the event of a computer crash or if your computer is stolen . ( I mean , you are backing up your hard drive regularly , are n't you ? ) You can back up photos on an external hard drive , sync them to the cloud , or burn them onto a CD or DVD , whichever method you find easiest to accomplish . But just be sure to do it ! <p> Why are you taking all of the pictures anyway ? Do you like to display them in frames in your home ? Do you enjoy having a series of photos that you can look at on your mobile device while out and about ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper ? How do you like to interact with your pictures ? <p> This is another area that tends to overwhelm people and leads to all sorts of mommy guilt about " not being organized . " First of all , there is no " right way " to use your photos , so do n't feel as if you need to print the best photos and organize them into albums just because someone else does it . You need to decide what makes you happy in terms of looking at your photos . <p> For me , I love to have mine on display throughout my home , and I like to keep them updated . To stay on top of that , at the end of each month , I upload my best photos to Shutterfly ( my favorite photo-printing site ) and order the prints immediately . <p> Are you a digital scrapbooker ? Then decide on the 5-10 photos you want to include on a page and export them now , placing them into a labeled folder on your computer . If you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( writing your description of the events ) , that 's even better because the events are all still fresh in your mind . If you 'd like to learn more about how to turn your digital photos into digital scrapbooks , then please check out my " How to Create Free Digital Scrapbooks Using PicMonkey " over on Momof6 ! <p> Are there pictures you want to email to friends ? Upload to a family website ? Then do it now . <p> Do n't focus on how " behind " you are because you have n't followed this process in the past . You need to begin by starting with the photos that you have on your camera and devices right now . Get them uploaded and into one place . Then begin the process of sorting , reviewing , and deleting the photos you have taken in the last 30 days . Decide how you want to use those photos from the last month and print or upload them now . Then stick with this process at the end of every month going forward . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you took in months past , I recommend giving yourself one hour every weekend to work on it as a project of reviewing , deleting , and using . Just work backwards one month at a time until you are caught up . Do n't think this is something you can do in one day ! You 'll get overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of photos ! <p> Are you on top of your photo organization ? If not , what about it is the most challenging ? <h> How to Organize All of Those Digital Photos ! <p> My name is Sharon and I am the busy Mom of six children ages 13 , 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 , and 8 .

" Gender swaying " has become a popular topic of conversation for some parents and doctors alike . <p> There have been numerous studies done regarding its effectiveness , and there have even books written on the subject . The Trivers-Willard Hypothesis is a gender-swaying theory introduced by Robert Trivers and Dan Willard , both of Harvard , in 1973 . <p> The hypothesis in its most basic form is akin to survival of the fittest . In evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology , it suggests that mothers who are in better " condition " will produce more sons , and those in lesser " conditions " will produce more daughters as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Willard believed that if weaker mothers birthed weaker sons , these sons would have a harder time mating and producing heirs , so biochemical reactions would step in to offset that outcome and , in essence , maintain a balance in the sexes . <p> Therefore , these weaker mothers would actually produce more daughters who would have a better chance at reproducing more offspring and carrying on the " family name , " so to speak . And vice-versa , stronger mothers would produce more sons for the maximum amount of offspring .

@@41574658 @1574658/ <h> Childcare Options : Pros and Cons <h> In-home care <p> In-home childcare involves hiring a caregiver to take care for your children in your own home . It is considered to be one of the best types of care for children under three years old . <p> Advantages Children remain in familiar surroundings and are not exposed to the illnesses of other children . This type of childcare may give your child a greater sense of security . In addition , you also have the opportunity to check in on or observe your children freely . What 's more , no transportation is necessary . <p> Disadvantages In-home care can be one of the most expensive types of childcare . In addition , if the caregiver is late or sick , you will have to make other arrangements . As children get older , they may lack the interaction with other children that they need for proper social development . <h> Family Daycare <p> Family daycare is provided by individual caregivers in their own homes . Some , but not all , family daycares are licensed by local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for up to 6 or 8 children . A large family childcare home may provide care for up to 12 or 14 children . <p> Advantages Usually , family daycare offers children a more intimate setting , smaller groups of children and a more familiar , homelike environment . This option also allows siblings to be together . Special requests and flexible scheduling are more likely . Finally , family daycare is usually cheaper than most types of daycare . <p> Disadvantages The childcare provider is often alone all day for long days without relief . In addition , family childcare providers are not always licensed and some may not have an early childhood education background . Do your research well before selecting this type of childcare . <h> Group Daycare <p> There are five types of group childcare . Private childcare centers , workplace childcare , cooperative childcare , nonprofit childcare , and chain centers . <p> Private childcare : Private daycare involves childcare outside the licensee 's own home and is usually located in commercial buildings . Daycare centers are facilities dedicated to providing childcare to larger groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ages , usually from infants through preschoolers . <p> Workplace or Corporate childcare : Workplace/corporate childcare centers are provided by employers at the workplace . Studies show that when employers provide daycare , employee moral , productivity , and retention improves . <p> Cooperative childcare : Cooperative childcare is daycare run by a group of parents who hire staff to care for their children . This allows parents to decide what services are provided and which childcare providers are hired . <p> Nonprofit childcare : Nonprofit daycare is usually for low income families and is funded by government agencies and private donations . <p> Chain centers : Chain centers offer standardized programs and curriculum for children . They are growing rapidly and are profit oriented . <p> Advantages Group daycare is very dependable . The programs are usually well organized and structured . In most cases , the staff is usually trained or educated in early childhood development . In addition , group daycare must be licensed and licensed daycare providers are monitored by the government . <p> Disadvantages While group care itself is dependable , the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daycare is usually less flexible than other types of daycare .

Your child will cry a lot at times simply because of the suddenness and surprise of a fall , even without much of a visible injury . A child can fall and hit his or her head on the floor or side of a table . If there is a cut on the face or head , it will bleed a lot . Do not be alarmed .

Again , it always looks like more blood than it actually is . Keep your child upright . Gravity is then working with you , since the blood has to be pumped up from the heart to the nose . Apply firm pressure to both sides of the nose with a cloth and your fingers . You have to press hard enough to keep it closed . Ice is not necessary . If the nosebleed does not stop in 10 minutes , you will need to see a doctor . <p> After a similar fall , your child might wind up with a " goose egg " on the forehead or back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inside a towel , for 20 minutes at a time , or you can use a commercial cold pack . If your child does not lose consciousness , and can communicate with you as well as he or she usually does , you probably do not need to take him or her to the emergency room . Your child may even vomit from this , but not repeatedly . If your toddler seems normal to you , but wants to go to sleep after hitting his or her head , that is okay . There is no reason to stop a child from sleeping ; it is a normal reaction to the injury . If you are unsure , you can wake your child up in 30 minutes or an hour to see if they still respond normally . If your child has been unconscious and does not make sense to you , or seems to have a terrible headache and repeatedly vomits , take him or her to the emergency room .

Never give a child aspirin ; it can cause a serious condition called Reyes ' syndrome . <p> Obviously , some accidents are more serious than others . If your child has jumped out of a tree , or fallen off a balcony , or anything out of the ordinary , you may wind up in the emergency room .

@@41574681 @1574681/ <h> Do You Really Need Two of EVERYTHING ? <p> Your baby registry probably looked like a long list of typographical errors . After all , everything you wanted you probably asked for two of , thinking that your twins would require it . What you 're left with is a nursery full of unworn clothes , toys , and baby accessories that take up more space than your children do . The question is , what do you really need two of in order to take care of newborn twins ! Besides hands , the list is rather limited . <p> You will need two rear facing infant car seats and two bouncy seats ! You will also need plenty of clothes that are easy to wash and wear , at least two blankets , a dozen or so receiving ones and towels , some infant laundry detergent by the case , lots of diapers , and plenty of formula and bottles if you are n't nursing . Add one easy to fold and use side-by-side double stroller and a baby monitor , and you are pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waste . In case you are wondering why two cribs are not mentioned on this list , keep in mind that the vast majority of infant twins fit easily into one crib at first and actually may sleep better together in unison . That is what they were accustomed to in utero , and it makes for a cozy sleeping arrangement once they are born . If you prefer to use sleeping wedges , then buy two of them as well . <p> Forget all the toys and trinkets that they are far too young to play with . Forget all the matching outfits made of silk and satin that will be ruined as soon as they spit up the first time , and forget all the other nonsense that you may be tempted to buy , thinking it will make your life easier . Equip your household with some infant Tylenol , a really good nose syringe , a vaporizer , and plenty of wipes and diaper rash ointment , and you will be as good as prepared for anything the newborns have to offer ! <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require that much stuff . They have no idea that they are sharing , and you will never run into the problem with them wanting the same toy to play with . That is up and coming . Twins are hectic , and filling your home with so much stuff really does nothing but provide you with a lot of environmental chaos . While they are immobile , and for the most part uninterested in anything but a nice warm bottle of milk , you are wasting a lot of money that could be spent buying diapers and formula . <p> Speaking of formula , the best trick that mothers of twins who bottle feed will pass on to others is to pre-make bottles ahead of time . If you start out making around 12-20 bottles ( depending on how often they eat ) and storing them in the fridge , you will always be no more than 3 minutes away from satisfying their needs . If your twins are on different formulas ( giving you a glimpse of what is ahead ) , then purchase two different colors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your home will easily be able to tell them apart . <p> The time is approaching when you will indeed need to have two of certain things around the home . The biggest mistake first time parents make when they have twins is assume that they will be twice the work and need twice the stuff . If you plan things well in regards to their schedule and simplify your needs , you will find that having twins is quite simply , twice as nice ! <p> This is interesting , I really do n't  think that we have to buy two of the same items for twins . Sharing them , is better because you spend less money and maybe some of the " money stress " , is less as well . 55 @qwx410055

This all occurred according to plan . The plan was to adopt a little girl from Africa when my oldest hit five , However life had a different plan for us .

" My two boys are great together and the oldest ( although he is a very active handful ) is an awesome big brother , the two are really the best of friends . I think both will take great care of their little sister , and I can not wait to meet her ! <p> Well , for one , we did n't  do it on purpose ; sometimes things just happen . Our oldest two are 17 months apart and they are buddies ( now 12 and almost 11 ) . After those two , come our two that are 14 months apart , a boy and a girl ( now 8 and 7 ) . They are pretty darn close too . Its so fun to watch them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I did have a pregnancy in between them that did n't  make it . They are now 4 and 2 . Our seventh is coming three years after our last one ( and this 7th was not planned , very much a surprise that I am still getting used toI was done with babies ! ) . But my pregnancies were all pretty healthy and its nice having them pretty close in age , for the most part . <p> We are n't  exactly baby bunching , since the due date for the new baby is on my sons 3rd birthday , but my sister and I were 18 months apart , and it worked out great for us . There was a three year gap between her and my youngest sister , and they get along very well too . Although not always when we were kids ! We fought just like other siblings , but I think we had a better understanding of each other than if wed been further apart in age . My mother and her sister are 11 years apart and hardly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart ! I constantly ask myself , " what was I thinking ? ! " But , I could n't be more proud of my children , and they 're best friends ! &lt;3 I 'm proud of how my son is protecting and teaching his little sister . <p> I " baby bunched " with my sons . My sons are 14 months apart and now I 'm doing it again ! I just had a baby last year and I 'm due in 6 weeks . They will be 14 months apart as well . So now I have a 15 , 8 , 7 , 1 year and newborn ! My house is going to get crazier but I can handle it ! My sons are very close to eachother and I hope that these two babies will be as close ! My oldest and only girl is not as close with her brothers but they maintain a good relationship . Everyone fights but they have a special bond that I feel that only comes from being so close in age . <p> Hubster and I tried for two years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I just could n't bring myself to go back on birth control , and risk going through the same heartache again .

J will turn 2 in August . I 'm tired just thinking about it . <p> When I had my last child 5.5 months ago , he was the youngest of 4 . His twin sister was 11 minutes earlier , my next daughter was 20 months old and my son turned 3 , only ten days before my twins were born . I love having them close . It is very busy sometimes and I do n't  know what I would be doing without them . All four will be in high school together , it will make vacations easier to plan since they will be in the same developmental interest groups , they will be able to teach each other also making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two are potty training together now ) . Lots of benefits . Plus by the time I am 50 they will all be adults . Yay for us ! <p> We definitely baby bunched ! Our boys were born exactly a year apart to the day ! They share the same birthday ! It was really hard at first having a one year old and a newborn , but got easier as they grew . Our Irish twins will be 3 and 2 this next month ! <p> I have a 14 month old and just recently found out Im five weeks pregnant with my second . So well be baby bunchers . Its fine if u can handle it . My sister did the same with her boys they 're twenty months apart . <p> My friend baby bunched with her two sons and had to send the youngest to live with his grandma because the older one was n't ready to share mom . I did n't  really understand why a sibling could react this way seeing that mom introduces new baby to the kids once her pregnancy starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding.of this . <p> That 's interesting . It seems like you would send the older one to grandmas because the first few months of a babys life is the most precious and you do n't  want to miss a single minute of it . Not saying all other times in life are not enjoyable but if he wanted to learn how to share mom maybe living without her for a little bit might help . Just my opinion . <p> Our daughter just turned 1 and we plan on trying for our second in the next few months so they will be right about 2 years apart , my brother and I are 19m apart and really close . My husband and his sister are 11m apart and not as close as my brother and I. I think baby bunching is fine . <p> My two boys will be 19 months apart also . it makes me happy to know that yours have/had such a great relationship growing up so far . I have 3 older brothers , two of them that are only about 14 moths apart and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same for my boys . <p> After 5 years and a miscarriage , my husband and I finally welcomed our baby boy , John Michael into the world . 10 months later while I was planning his first birthday party I found out I was pregnant again . Our second baby ( another boy ) is being welcomed by c-section into the world on Monday ( I 'm nervous and anxious ! ) . The second pregnancy completely took us by surprise since wed had to use UIU and fertility drugs with the first pregnancy . I guess they 're right when they say that after you have the first that subsequent pregnancies become easier.at least for us anyway . I do n't  think there 's anything wrong with " baby bunching " , if you can handle it then you can handle it .

Would he never sit in the backyard and suck the pits out of cherries ? Would he never experience my grandmother 's cooking that I have lovingly tried to carry on ? No one had the answer . <p> So , we resolved to practice . After he was discharged from the NICU at three months old , we worked with our local speech therapist and let him taste things . At first , he was only allowed dipped pacifiers . Then , we moved to letting him put empty spoons in his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiniest bites we could manage to get on a spoon . After three months of work , we took him back for a repeat swallow study which they said he once again failed . <p> We were crushed . Positively heartbroken . We had been so optimistic .

Everyone thought he was doing so well , and that he had surely made progress . We kept trying , kept working on things , even though the report had n't given us a lot of hope , and even though we were n't technically supposed to be feeding him still . How do you get better at swallowing if you do n't practice , though ? <p> Six months later , we were back in the swallow study room , with our now 1-year-old looking around confused , and a little scared .

Now , try getting a scared baby to perform exactly like you want in a weird , cold hospital lab : I 'd rather try nailing jello to a wall . He spent much of his time crying and looking around- until I thrust my phone into the therapist 's hand and said , " Here , hold Mickey up for him to watch ! " <p> And that 's how , with my son mesmerized by Mickey Mouse Clubhouse playing on my iPhone ( thank you , Amazon Instant Video ! ) , his life changed forever . We were able to get three toddler-sized bites into his mouth , and the radiologist said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down safely , with him protecting his airways . " <p> We finished up the test , cleaned up the boy , and then met with the speech pathologist who gave us instructions on working with thinner consistencies- since he still showed slight signs of aspiration with those . Then , I clicked my son in his stroller , and walked out of the hospital with my mom by my side , who was holding my daughter 's hand . Once we got the kids in the car and were sitting in our seats up front , we looked at each other , and then burst into tears . We were crying , shaking ; it was unbelievable . He could eat ! They told us he could eat ! It 's poetic , as this happened just a few days shy of his 1-year mark of having his feeding tube surgically placed. - <p> I called my husband who was at work two hours away , and he could barely understand me through my happy tears .

Far too many people allow or appoint their mother-in-law to be in charge of the children all the time ( as a full time babysitter ) , and then try to pull back those reins anytime they wish . You ca n't have your cake and eat it too . If you want boundaries that keep your mother-in-law in her familial place , then you have to make concessions on your side as well .

However , you also need to ensure that you allow her to be with your family on her terms as well ( at least some of the time ) . <p> Also , understand that if you share EVERYTHING with your mother-in-law , you are inviting her into your life . Try to keep your marital squabbles and troubles to yourself. - It would definitely be nice to have your spouse on your side when it comes to dealing with your mother-in-law .

You may find that her actions are just out of fear of losing her place of importance in your spouse 's life . Make sure you do n't place blame and rather speak from a place of how you feel .

No matter how much gratitude I show towards her , she manipulates me , situations , also tells unnecessary lies .

She want to have a say in out lives and my husband just does n't  see how controlling she is , he says she is " outspoken " . <p> The numbers of people that clash with their in laws far exceeds the number of crazy or annoying people there are in the world . Often , I think the annoyance develops more from the generational divide and the situations this can create rather than any real dislike on a personal level . My own in laws are n't mad , crazy or even slightly irrational . They are perfectly normal and likable people but they annoy the hell out of me because of a clash of interests that is probably very similar in a lot of families . <p> The main problem is that in laws tend to want to spend time with your spouse which normally means they end up spending time with you . That 's fine if they spend a little time with you every now and then but often ( and this tends to apply more to husbands than wives ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else ; this becomes especially true once you have children . In fact , outside of your immediate family there probably is n't anyone else in your life apart from co-workers that you spend more time with and on top of that you 're expected to be insufferably polite to at all times ! Add to the fact that there 's an age gap and very little in common and many of us quickly realise that we would rather be doing something else and not entertaining our in laws . <p> Their wanting to spend an unhealthy amount of time with you also translates into other problems . Often , they choose to live close to you ; they might even start popping around unannounced . In the worst situations , they hold you back , using emotional blackmail to confine you to a part of the world of your choosing when you might want to move to the city or even emigrate . <p> The wealth gap between young and old that has developed in the western world also causes friction . The older generations often enjoy mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their latest holiday or how hard they worked in their single income family and 9-5 job . Although we normally forgive our parents for this transgression , from other older people , even our in laws , we see them as smug and ignorant . Often , this can also result in being infantilised ' by in laws , who might suggest for example that you go on holiday with them to save money . Again , it 's not really their fault , unless your in laws happen to be George W.

I was warned of the lack of sleep I would experience and the zombie state I would live in for the first few years . I had an idea of how pregnancy was going to change my body , and was quite aware of how much more responsibility I would have . I welcomed those changes with open arms and looked forward to my new journey through parenthood . It was a long-time dream of mine to have a house full of children , and I was excited for all those changes. - <p> All those changes above were ones I experienced those and a lot more . Some were pretty expected and others like needing to completely overhaul my diet took me by surprise . My third child was only a few weeks old and she was miserable crying all the time and it did n't seem to matter what I did , nothing helped . I had heard before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother 's milk , and , at that point , I was willing to try pretty much anything . <p> So , I tried something I did n't think I 'd ever be able to do . I cut dairy out of my diet . Yes , I said " goodbye " to cheese and ice cream . No more cream in my coffee or butter on my breads . I did n't just eliminate lactose , but got rid of all dairy proteins including whey which meant a huge overhaul of my diet . I was already eating gluten-free and so taking another chunk of foods out of my diet seemed drastic , but it made a world of difference . <h> 1 . What signs made me cut dairy out of my diet ? <p> I had heard of colic , but had n't experienced in either of my older two children . When my third child was born and all she did was scream and cry I had my first colic experience .

I was breastfeeding her so we cuddled and were close all the time , but her colicky behavior made me turn to look at what I was eating . She also developed a bad diaper rash out of nowhere and had green poop , which according to KellyMom , can be a sign of food allergies . The pattern was coming clear too : I enjoyed a milkshake , the next day my baby screamed constantly . <h> 2 . How my baby changed for the better . <p> It did n't happen overnight and just around the time I wondered if it was even going to work at all my baby became a whole different baby . About two weeks after going strictly dairy-free , the colic was gone , the rash was gone , the clinginess was gone ; and in its place was a very happy , content baby and a much more relaxed mom . <h> 3 .

There are a lot of products available now that can replace the items you just ca n't do without ( like coconut coffee creamer ) and staying away from a lot of processed foods helps as well . <h> 4 . What did I learn about parenthood ? <p> I had always know that parents would do anything for their children , but I always heard that and thought of the most extreme , what-if cases .

@@41574719 @1574719/ <h> Lead by Example : Living a Healthy Lifestyle <p> Often , one of the largely underestimated influences in a child 's life is the actions of their parents . When it comes to living a healthy lifestyle , many parents set expectations of their children but behave in hypocrisy . Telling a child not to smoke when you do or limiting sodas and junk food but indulging yourself are just some of the mixed messages that parents can send their children . It is difficult , at best , to be the perfect role model to your own children , especially given the fact that they live with you and are privy to all the very personal aspects of your life . But it is a parent 's job to try ! <p> The American Academy of Psychology suggests when children grow up with parents who have bad habits , they are 65% more likely to take on those habits as adults .

Preserving health is the key to longevity and the number one ingredient for a happy and successful life . By showing our children the way , we are leading them down a road of health and happiness that will enable them to flourish . <p> Another aspect of living a healthy lifestyle is that it comes from an attitude of gratitude for the life and body that we have . Respecting ourselves at the deepest level of our being leads to self confidence and esteem , positive self image , assertiveness , and an innate ability to trust in our decisions and become a leader in life . All of these qualities are ones that every parent wants for their child . When we care about our lifestyle and strive to set our goals high , we are enforcing the fact that our lives have a lot of worth . As children watch this- they learn by the example they are being shown and develop a great deal of respect for themselves along the way ! <p> Naturally there are things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children the picture perfect example . It is widely understood that the rules for adults and children differ greatly . The point is that our children see us drinking wine on occasion not every day .

Our children may see us being couch potatoes every Sunday , but realize that for the better part of our life we are active and involved . The occasional slip into unhealthy things does not predetermine our child 's future . <p> Children are also extremely adept at picking up on hypocrisy . The " do as I say , not as I do " mentality may work when kids are very young , but as they grow and reach the important years of unfolding , they will be the first to point out this hypocrisy .

Having a low Body Mass Index ( BMI ) contributes to 12 percent of all infertility cases . In this segment , we 're going to go over how being underweight is thought to affect the ability to conceive . <p> Being underweight does n't affect the fertility of all women . The affects of weight vary with each individual ; it is n't an issue unless it disrupts ovulation and the menstrual cycle . If a woman has a low BMI , has a sufficient diet , and does n't exercise excessively , it generally means that she is naturally thin and fertility problems are minimal concerning weight .

This is the formula : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Height in inches x Height in inches ) . A normal BMI is anywhere between eighteen and twenty-five . If a BMI is lower than 85 percent of " normal , " then it is considered too low , susceptible to infertility . <p> In the case of being underweight when trying to get pregnant , body fatness is no foe- it 's a friend . See , fat is where the body stores and uses estrogen . If there is n't enough fat , there is n't enough storage . Too little estrogen diminishes the menstrual cycle and ovulation . Body fat is essential to fertility , which is why excessive exercise and insufficient diet lead to difficulty conceiving . <p> Besides keeping the BMI too low , exercise releases endorphins .

When I entered junior high school , I set my goals for college , determined to be the first person in my immediate family to attend a 4 year university. - In my senior year of high school , I was accepted into my dream school and on the road to achieving my goals . College went as planned and following graduation I began my career as a Speech-Language Pathologist . Two years later , I married my college sweetheart and shortly after was struck with baby fever . My husband did n't quite have the itch yet , as he wanted to wait until he was thirty to start a family . So I threw my energy into my career , working at a top pediatric hospital in the Washington DC area . <p> When my husband was close to 30 , he finally agreed to start trying for a baby . Shortly before becoming pregnant , we got into quite a disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a baby . He always imagined that I would stay at home and raise the kids .

I hate missing out on all the everyday moments during the week day . <p> It turns out I 'm not alone in these feelings of sadness and frustration . <p> Image via Jennah <p> " I went back to work when my daughter was 7 weeks old , like many moms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so small ! We were just really getting the hang of things ! It was also tough going back to a job that I was not crazy about before maternity leave . When I had to go back , I realized it was definitely not the job for me . I dreaded going in every day , and not just because of leaving my baby . I decided that if I did have to leave my baby daughter to work and help provide for our family ( as we definitely need two incomes ) , it was n't going to be to go to a job that I absolutely despised . So I started looking for a new job . Partially because of that stress , I also had a really hard time with keeping up nursing after I went back to work . We had a perfect symbiotic relationship while I was home with her , but my supply slowly diminished despite my best efforts when I went back to work . <p> " Luckily , I now have a job that 's a much better fit , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing other things or working only part time . It was pretty scary for me to be looking for a new job with a tiny baby at home , but I knew that I really needed to do it for my sanity and my family 's . <p> " It 's a really tough thing to leave your baby in the hands of another caretaker so that you can go earn money to keep your family afloat . Somehow it seems just wrong in the whole scheme of things . Should n't you be able to stay home and take care of your family ? Why does it have to be this way ? Unforunately that 's the way it is for so many families today , so if you are having those feelings just know that you are not alone . " <p> Jennah blogs at Jennah 's Garden .

The separation from my baby continued to be difficult but I grew to trust the sitter and she grew to love my son .

I did n't know how I would do with working after being there for everything with Paige . With some finagling , I was still an involved mom even if my job and commute had me gone for so much time . <p> " My tips and tricks for new parents ( and next time for myself ) : <p> Spend time at the daycare . Do n't just go to meet the provider and spend less than an hour there . Bring your child while other kids are there , see how they interact . Do n't be afraid to ask questions . <p> I also made sure to send extras of necessary items . If I forgot something on my way out the door , I did n't have to stress about going back to get it . <p> Our daycare provider ( someone I 've known for 15+ years ) had us send in pictures of us and family members . They would pull them out every so often and Paige could see ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sounds silly , and simple , but it was so important to me to soak up that time with Paige before/after daycare .

As much as I wanted to do something special and really enjoy that time with Paige by being out and doing something/going somewhere , it was important for us both to keep to a similar routine ( nap times , meal/snack schedule ) . " <p> " Working mom . If you had asked me shortly before I married my husband if those two words would be on my resume the answer would have been no . Most of my adult life I pictured myself devoting my days to caring for my husband , children and home . Donna Reed would have been proud .

When the day before her first day at daycare came I prepared her bottles , her bag of diapers , extra clothes and wipes . I set out her outfit for the next morning and wondered how drop off would go . When my husband and I dropped her off the next morning I hugged her extra tight , told her how much I loved her , kissed her sweet chubby cheeks , and walked back to my car .

I also have a boss who , being a father , not only supports but also encourages a healthy work life balance . If my child is sick , if she has a school function , if I feel like I need a day to spend with her my boss tells me that Evie is most important , to go and be with my daughter . That is priceless .

But hey that 's the way we wanted our family and we could n't be happier . But with my lack of knowledge on what it takes to , you know , - try- to conceive , I was curious about how the widespread use of birth control affected women after they decided they were ready to expand their families. - <p> So , I wanted to know , for all the mommas-to-be wondering : how long does it take to get pregnant after birth control ? - <p> I stopped birth control in May of 2012. - We did n't necessarily wait , but we did n't " try " either . I never charted things , took temperatures , etc . We just lived like normal and had sex highs and lows like normal ! My boyfriend fixes heat so in the winter he works so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Although he will deny that ! ) <p> I found out I was pregnant May 2013 ! - I 'm 19 weeks pregnant with my first , just found out its a boy . <p> Image via Melanie <p> Melanie said : - <p> We waited the " recommended " month before trying , and then got pregnant the first month of trying. - <p> - <p> Image via Ashley B. <p> Ashley B. said : <p> Ummm got pregnant ON birth control Quite the surprise baby but I am so glad she is here ! <p> Image via Leigha C. <p> Leigha said : <p> 2.5 YEARS . It 's a huge part of my testimony . After one year a doctor wrote infertile on my chart and told me to see a specialist ( this was at my yearly check up when he asked what i was using for birth control and found out it had been almost a year ) . But Matt and I prayed and I knew I was going to be a mom . I knew God was promising me my own baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ovulation monitor , never checked the calendar . Just continued to live our life and got into foster care . I decided until I had my own I would take care of someone else 's baby . Then just one day another year and a half later I knew the level of emotion and exhaustion was n't normal . I told Matt I either had cancer or I was pregnant. - - After 2.5 years the odds felt pretty 50/50 . And it was my daughter ! <p> We needed two years after going off birth control and ended up having a ICSI in the end . We never thought it would take so long , but somehow the decision for treatment took all the pressure out of trying to become pregnant . <p> I got pregnant while switching birth control ( from the shot to the pill ) and got pregnant despite the fact that there was no lapse in birth control . My doctor told me that I should get off the shot if I wanted to try to get pregnant within a year , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 9 months . Yeah , more like 9 days for me . It was absolutely meant to be though , and I would n't have it any other way . <p> So what 's the " normal " length of time before a woman gets pregnant after stopping birth control ? - <p> According to the- Mayo Clinic , women can start a regular menstrual cycle about two weeks after stopping birth control . This means that a woman could technically ovulate and get pregnant within a month after stopping birth control . Obviously , as this slideshow shows , that is definitely possible for some women , while other women may find that they have different cycle patterns . Like mothering , every woman is different , but as a general rule of thumb , follow the one year of trying rule when attempting to conceive . <h> How Long Does it Take to Get Pregnant After Birth Control ? 54 @qwx410054 <h> 88 comments <p> With my firstI was on birth control until the marriage . We actually werent even having sex until after the wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . I went off it because we wanted to start a family right away . We got married in June 2001 and I did n't  find out I was pregnant until September 2002 . Baby was born in May 2003 . <p> With my second , because it took so long with the first , we did n't  do birth control in between . I found out I was expecting #2 when #1 was eight months old . They are seventeen months apart . Baby #2 came in October 2004 . <p> Since they came closer than we were hoping , we did some birth control after #2 , and I went off when he turned one in October 2005 and was pregnant again by January 2006 . Three months that time . <p> When our third was about five months old , we found out in April of 2007 that I was pregnant again . Baby came in December 2007 when #3 was 14 months old . Apparently the b.c. did n't  work the 1% of times that it does n't  . <p> After our fourth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a break and was n't sure at that time if wed have more . When she was two , we decided we wanted another one . So in December of 2009 , we started trying and this time , it took us eight months to conceive . He was born March 2011 . Then I got pregnant again when he was four months old . I was breastfeeding and not on b.c . That one was a molar pregnancy . I found out in September 2011 and had a d&amp;c in November 2011 . I was supposed to wait until I was cleared by the doctor to get pregnant again ( after a molar pregnancy , which can lead to cancer ) . When I went in for my appointment in July 2012 to see if I was cleared , I found out I was pregnant . Apparently , I had missed one pill the month before . She came in March 2013 . After her we decided we were done . I was on b.c. for two years . In June 2015 , just a few months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new prescription . We used a condom . Now I am pregnant with #7 . <p> I had been on the depo shot for 4 years I finally stopped taking it and tried to get pregnant with no luck still till this day no luck its been 2 years since I stopped it .. I have NEVER been regular I could go months without getting my period until last year I went a whole year without it nd decided to go to the doctor nd she said it could of been the shot .. well she gave me bc pills nd told me to take them for 3 months nd stop and try to get pregnant well I took it for 2 months nd then I got a job nd I did n't  even have time to take it anymore so I just stopped nd I have n't taken anything after that its bee . Maybe 9 months since that nd I cant get pregnant and still have n't gotten my period .. Can somebody tell me what I should do fertility clinics are very costly . Thank you <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I switched types a few times , but after I ended my birth control we continued to use condoms for a few months . all in all I think it was about five or six months after quitting the birth control that I got pregnant . I am now two weeks away from my first . <p> I think you also have to take into consideration how long you had been on the pill . I had been on it for 13 years . It took a year to get pregnant-we werent timing or trying very hard to conceive when it happened . My doc had told me that was about how long it would take and he was right on ! <p> I got pregnant a month after going off oral birth control , and while I was under the impression it takes a few months for your body to regulate itself making it MORE difficult to get pregnant , my nurse practitioner told me the opposite is true . She said that in the first few weeks after stopping birth control , your body responds with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant . She said sometimes she prescribes birth control for a few months for people who are having fertility issues because of the spike you get once you get off it . <p> I took birth control pills for almost a year and then decided to hv a child but its been seven months since I stopped taking pills and I have not concieved yet .. do I hv a problem or is normal im really worried .. it will my first child <p> I was on birth control for about four years solid . I got married to my wonderful husband and we decided it was time to come off birth control . We got married on July 5 , 2013 and we concieved around January 15 , 2014 . I am now almost 14 weeks and couldnt be happier . Just hang in there . It shouldnt take much longer . <p> After my husband and I had four children ( we had no trouble conceiving the first 4 times ) I went on the Mirena IUD . We decided after the 5 year time frame was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the Mirena removed in September of 2012 , reading lots of blogs and posts I was under the assumption that I would conceive within a matter of weeks to monthsI was sadly mistaken . I took 13 months , but I finally became pregnant with our 5th child . I am now at 26 weeks and sooo happy ! But , rest assured that I WILL NOT be using the Mirena again for birth control until I know for a fact that I am done having children . While Mirena did have its pros- like no periods , cramps , or any other side-effects besides hair loss , I will opt for something else in the interim . <p> It was pretty interesting to read these testimonies . Were on natural family planning for medical reasons . Doctors said I could not take pills and i do n't  want IUD as an option . Well see how successful we are in the long run = <p> I was off birth control ( I was on the pill for one year ) for about 6 months when I conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son now and I was off birth control ( Mirena ( IUD ) which I had from March 2009-Nov. /Dec. 2010 ) and actively trying to conceive for 3 years . I will not be going back on birth control due to the negative side effects the various birth controls I have experienced as well as having such a difficult time conceiving after the Mirena . <p> I have been off Mirena for 8 months now and off of the pill for 6 . We have been actively trying for 4 months . Did you have any problems with Mirena ever I am wondering because I did and I think that might be affecting my ability to get pregnant . <p> I got pregnant about three months after stopping birth control , but that was because the particular month we got pregnant was when I wanted to get pregnant ! AKA it was when we started " trying " . I have friends that got pregnant while on birth control , and I have friends that still struggle with infertility long after stopping . The three months being off birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , and that is what I will return to after my first baby is here = <p> I had my baby on july after i had her i got the depo shot i was supposed to go back and get it but i forgot to go get it . So i only got it once . During the first two months i got my period but now it will be 3 months i do n't  get my period . Ive been feeling nausious latly . Could it be normal not to have my period for 3 months after my first shot or could i be pregnant agai <p> It took about the same amount of time for me to conceive my second time around after having the Mirena . I think its harder to conceive after depo or mirena but some people do n't  experience any delay . I personally think that if one wants to conceive again the pill , diaphragm , or possibly the patch are the best way to go if you want birth control . I personally will not be using birth control after my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in hopes for a girl and if we do not get a girl then we are done because 3 boys will be quite the handful : ) <p> I actually got pregnant accidentally the one week my insurance ran out and we needed to switch insurance companys so i couldnt pick up my BC . Went to my OB/GYN and found out i was 5 weeks ( at the time ) honestly my body had no problem and we werent trying at all . guess some people are affected by it more then others . <p> It definitely depends on your own body , and the type of birth control . With my first , I was on the depo shot and was scheduled to get my next shot in June and sure enough I found out in August that I had conceived in June . With my second , I had an IUD removed and conceived less than a week after that . Both times I was told it could take anywhere from 6months to a year to be able to conceive and it was only a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother is the most amazing blessing ever ! <p> I had my last birth control period March 2012 after being on it for over 10 years , found out I was pregant the first Thursday of May ( 1 month off birth control ! ) unfortunately I had a miscarriage on Sunday of that same week ( I was about 3 weeks pregant if that ! ) . Was told it would most likely take months to get pregant again and we just relaxed about well July 2nd I was pregant again almost 5 weeks ! Good luck to all that are trying = We are blessed with an amazing 8.5 month old WALKING little boy . 55 @qwx410055

Here are some of my favorite apps that promote language skills for preschoolers . <p> Image via Toca Boca <p> Toca Boca Kitchen <p> Toca Boca Kitchen is a simple game , where your child pretends to cook . Surprisingly , this app contains no verbal instruction or expressive language output other than a few silly sounds , and music . In order for your child to get the most language learning from the game , an adult should guide the child through the game . <p> Language Learning Tips : <p> Talk to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child can name all the food items , work on categories . Have him or her pick out all the fruits vs. vegetables vs. meats . <p> Once your child has selected a food item , talk about all the different options there are for cooking it , using action words ( blend , fry , warm , chop , etc ) . <p> Depending on what was chosen , talk about the steps to cooking or preparing the food item using that tool . <p> Once the food is cooked the character will then proceed to eat the prepared food . He or she may or may not eat it . If the food is not preferred the character will spit it out or not try to eat it at all . Ask your child simple questions about the characters behaviors . <p> Speech with Milo <p> This app uses the forward facing camera to place your child in the game , which makes learning about nouns so much fun .

My son 's favorite part about the app is that we can record our sentences and then play them back . <p> The developers of this app turned one of my favorite childhood books into an incredibly interactive and adorable story app . My son 's favorite part about this book is that Grover tells you to turn the page , which works on direction following . The animation and narration are super cute and often times sarcastic . I love that this app works on many different language and communication skills , including humor , description words , answering questions , verbs , and sequencing events. - <p> This is another great app created from a picture book .

When your child presses on each the corresponding word pops up . If they tap the item a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page is a different category of vehicles , which is a great way to introduce your child to new vocabulary .

All are equally as great for teaching your child new vocabulary in an interactive way . <p> Image via screenshot <p> Grandma 's Preschool <p> My son loves all the different games , challenges and puzzles in the app Grandma 's Preschool .

The fabric feels pretty durable . <p> It folds with little effort . Unsnap two straps and pull on the handle . Also , you can recline the stroller to near flat or any custom angle you want . " <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great on sidewalks , gravel paths , grass fields , everywhere ! I also picked this stroller because it lays almost completely flat , which is VERY handy when traveling . My daughter was able to take naps on a recent vacation where we were walking all over different cities because of this . " <p> This stroller , unlike many others which require an additional adapter/kit , comes ready for infant use : Infant ready without use of an infant seat or Carrycot . Universal Infant Seat Adapter also included , in case you have another common car seat . Independently adjustable canopy , backrest and footrest paired with a padded 5 point breakaway harness . <p> If you 're concerned about the lack of front-wheel turning , this Amazon reviewer will allay your fears , " For sharp corners you just push down on the handles and lift the front wheel up . It 's balanced well enough to turn . For long shallow corners you push towards the opposite side and it will lean to make the corners . " <p> This stroller offers reflective wheel trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your run is as safe as possible . And it comes with a parent tray , which includes 2 deep cup holders and storage area . <p> This Amazon reviewer offers a unique perspective on this strollers awesomeness , " I love this stroller ! I use public transportation quite frequently and this has made getting on and off a bus super easy ! It folds up super quickly , latches itself and then rolls like a suitcase . It is a tad bit heavy if you need to lift it , but I 'm up for the workout , lol . Rolls and steers really well and has a bit of suspension from the pneumatic tires . It 's also very large ! My husband is 6 ' 3 ? and he loves the height ! I 'm a foot shorter and I feel like I have the BMW of strollers ! All-in-all , this stroller is the best I 've ever had And I have 4 kids ! " <p> If you have limited storage space , or are just a neat-freak like me , this stroller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the ability to self-stand when folded , makes it pretty darn sweet . <p> This Amazon reviewer brings up a great point that I 'd never noted as a flaw in my own stroller , " I love the magnetic " window " flap ( instead of crappy velcro ) , it 's SUPER EASY to fold and unfold , and is compact . " <p> If you have a Chicco car seat like I do , this makes this stroller make even more sense . A friend of mine owns this stroller and really enjoys it ! It checks out well , but the canopy is not as big as the one on my Thule . It does have the stellar feature of a quick-release , one-hand fold allowing it to stand by itself when folded . <p> I love the feature this Amazon reviewer brings up about her little 's ability to sit further forward than typical strollers so he can see more of what 's around him , " I had a small jogging stroller for three years . It was light and easy to maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was so far back in the seat that he could n't see anything around him . I finally got around to trying a new jogging stroller and WOW am I happy ! ! ! The Joovy is super easy to steer The flat handlebar is much easier on my wrists when I 'm running . The storage bin underneath is also way bigger and easier to access than my previous stroller . My munchkin can see the world around him better and the large back wheels make pushing over uneven terrain a breeze . I highly recommend this stroller ! ! ! " <p> I like that this stroller is focused on your kiddo 's comfort and enjoyment : The high-riding seat ( which also has multi-position recline ) carries your child up to 75 pounds and offers great visibility for your child . <p> This list could n't be complete without the stroller we use for my baby boy . I LOVE our stroller . I 've been running with my son in the stroller ( using the infant attachment , sold separately ) since my doc gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , at 23lbs , and handles like a dream ! The front wheel has the option to lock out or not , and I find it 's a pretty straight ride and very easy to maneuver when left unlocked . It is easily able to go over rough terrain without any issues ; while still providing a comfortable ride for my baby . The sidewalks in the neighborhood I live in ( in Colorado ) are not the most even things in the world , and we have had no issues handling them easily and comfortably . <p> My son is now 9 months old , so he 's sitting in the stroller like a big boy and it looks like a comfortable ride ! He is able to see out very well , and the huge canopy keeps him very well shaded . I recently dropped the seat back for the first time and the recline is great ! This combined with the canopy make for a perfect napping environment . <p> I have had many moms tell me they have stroller envy after checking mine out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jogging stroller market . <p> Ergonomic handlebar with a range of heights for parent 's comfort <p> Rear suspension for a smooth and comfortable ride <p> Padded seat with vented top reclines to a near flat position for on-the-go naps <p> If anyone should be able to provide a review of a jogging stroller , it should be someone who has experience training for and completing half-marathons with one , " I have trained for and completed two half marathons and a 10k with this stroller . Nothing has broken , nothing has worn out , and it still works really well . This is worth every penny and then some . My daughter is now going on four ( we bought this as part of the travel system when she was born ) and it 's still in great shape . Even after being stored outside on the porch for two of those years ( and two years in a garage ) it is in great shape . We do most of our training with our border collie , and it 's easy to steer this stroller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of this jogging stroller really ca n't be beat . Plus , it has an extra wide ergonomically shaped rubber handle is both soft for pushing and cushy when transporting . The footrest reflectors provide greater low-light visibility , it comes with an extra large storage basket , and is lightweight due to its rugged , steel-frame construction . <p> This reviewer speaks to the convenience of the Burley 's S.I.T . elasticized harness straps , " Getting our child fastened into the stroller really is so much easier than any other stroller I 've encountered . Even in wintertime with bulky coats , the S.I.T . elasticized harness straps are extremely convenient to use . It 's surprising how much of a difference this makes , but it really does delight us every time we use the stroller. The canopy is very large and spacious our 18-month-old will have years of use before coming close to outgrowing the canopy ( or the stroller 's 75-lb weight limit ) . The under-stroller storage area is huge ! Comparing this with the B.O.B .. in-store really put it into context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simply a lot bigger . We can carry extra clothes , diaper bags , toys , books , etc . It works well to hold a couple of grocery bags too The stroller is very easy to fold and is extremely well-designed in this regard too . It folds forward , so you can fold it closed from a standing position and , once folded , can either sit upright or flat on its wheels . " <p> Handy features : One-handed fold allows for easy and quick folding even if you 're holding your child . The automatic locking mechanism allows the stroller to be folded and locked all in one motion . Wheels keep the stroller off the ground when folded allowing you to roll instead of carry the stroller . The yellow lever that locks the stroller can be released with one motion to unfold easily . <h> Jogging Strollers : The Best of The Best <p> I have a constant craving for adventure and love to pack as much fun into life as I can .

Many moms want to know how many people can be in the delivery room , when guests can visit after the baby is born , and how long they 'll stay once their little one has arrived .

@@41574774 @1574774/ <h> Does Your Baby Really Need to Go to All of Their Checkups ? <p> In the first year of your baby 's life , you 'll probably spend a lot of time at the pediatrician 's office . Beyond dashing in every time your little on has a fever or a rash , your pediatrician will also likely want to see them for check-ups on a regular schedule . The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all babies get checkups at birth , three to five days later , and then at one month , two months , four months , six months , nine months , and 12 months . While this seems like a lot ( and it can be really hard to get the time off of work to take them in each time they have an appointment ) making sure they get in for every check-up is vitally important . So , why are checkups so important ? - <p> Regular checkups allow you and your child 's doctor to work together to ensure that your little one is growing and developing as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life they will be changing and growing at an incredible pace , so heading in for their scheduled appointments means that your doctor can make sure everything is right on track. - <p> At each checkup , your baby 's doctor will likely measure their growth in both length and weight . Confirming that your baby is growing at a normal pace will let you know that they 're getting the proper nourishment for both their physical and mental development . If your little one is gaining too slowly or too quickly , your pediatrician will likely offer strategies to get them back on track and help you make a plan . Your pediatrician will also assess your child 's development by asking about the different milestones that they should be reaching by their age , and looking for the physical and mental signs that they 're track .

If you have questions about safe sleep , how much you should read to your little one , how to get your baby to try vegetables , or anything else under the sun , your child 's doctor will take the time to listen and answer your questions at each appointment . So , next time you look at all the appointments that are scheduled for your little one and wonder if it 's necessary to attend all of them , think about how much you love your little one and make a plan to get your baby to every one of their checkups. - <h> Does Your Baby Really Need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a master 's degree in public health and works full time in the field of positive youth development .

Scholars found a papyrus roll from 1350 B.C. that describes how a woman could pee on barley and wheat seeds to predict if she was having a boy or a girl . The resulting sprouts that grew would give her- answer . ( Barley meant boy . ) The test was surprisingly accurate .

@@41574784 @1574784/ <p> Fluoride is a double threat to cavities because it protects teeth by preventing cavities- and reverses early signs of tooth decay , strengthening the- tooth structure . <p> You may be startled to learn that tooth decay is the number-one most common chronic childhood disease according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Tooth decay is four times more common than early childhood obesity , five times more- common- than asthma , seven times more common than hay fever , and twenty times more common than diabetes . <p> The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry reports that about 60% of U.S. children will have had one or more cavities by the age of 5 . Poor oral health can have significant short- and long-term implications for young children . Cavities can be painful and impact a child 's ability to chew , swallow , smile , speak , and sleep . If left untreated , they can result in infection and tooth loss and cause a child to miss school or have trouble concentrating in class . Each year , over 51 million school hours are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer twice as many cavities as their peers . <p> Fortunately , tooth decay is preventable . However , many parents are unaware of the best ways to help their children fight this formidable foe . To figure out why cavities have reached epidemic proportions and what parents and caregivers can do about it , we- consulted one of our favorite experts , Dr. Lauren Companioni , pediatric dentist at South Tampa Kids Dental Krewe . With a pirate themed dental office , complete with ship and crew , Dr. Lauren makes going to the dentist a positive experience for kids ; so positive in fact , we actually overheard young patients not wanting to leave ! <p> In previous interviews with Dr. Lauren , we learned that early dental visits , healthy dietary choices , fluoride , and routine dental practices at home drastically reduce a child 's risk for tooth decay . Today , we asked Dr. Lauren to share her expertise with us on the use of fluoride . We asked her about sources of fluoride , its cavity-fighting abilities , and safety considerations . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that fluoride is naturally present in all water sources . If little pirates were to voyage by ship , they would find this natural mineral in the ocean as well as lakes , rivers , and streams . Pirates with inquiring scientific minds will be interested to learn that the fluoride ion comes from the 17th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust called fluorine . Fluoride ions are released into the water and become part of all water sources as water passes over rock formations , dissolving minerals and fluoride compounds . The amount of fluoride in water varies according to the body of water 's depth and mineral concentration . <p> The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry reports that about 60% of U.S. children will have had one or more cavities by the age of 5 . <p> What Causes Tooth Decay and How Does Fluoride Fight It ? <p> As little pirates sail the seas , they may be tempted to indulge in tasty treats and sweets from the ship 's kitchen and treasure chest . Sadly , cavity-causing bacteria in their mouths delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaque . The acid plaque attacks and softens the enamel in their young teeth , - which are already more porous and vulnerable to cavities in the first seven years of life . Soon , the pirates ' nemesis , tooth decay , moves in and throws a housewarming party , bringing gifts of erosion , damage to the inner pulp of the tooth , and infection . Do little pirates have time for this ? No ! After- all , they have parks , picnics , and play dates to attend to . So what tools can they use to combat these rotten villains ? One excellent option , Dr. Lauren suggests , is fluoride . <p> Fluoride is a double threat to cavities because it protects teeth in two important ways . It not only helps prevent cavities , but it can also reverse early signs of tooth decay . Fluoride helps strengthen tooth structure , providing protection against acid plaque attacks . It also helps repair and remineralize weakened teeth that are starting to show signs of acid damage . <p> Dr. Lauren explains there are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both have their own " superhero powers " and play an important role in protecting little teeth . Topical fluorides have the power to strengthen teeth already present in the mouth and make them more resistant to decay . Topical fluorides are applied to the surface of teeth and include toothpaste , mouth rinses , and dentist-applied treatments . Systemic fluorides are ingested and incorporated into the entire tooth structure to make them healthy and strong . They provide long-lasting protection and include fluoridated water , dietary supplements , and certain foods and drinks . <p> Dr. Lauren explains that pirate families can prevent cavities and promote long-term dental health by establishing routine oral-hygiene habits , like brushing teeth . She says that the earlier you get your baby used to some form of tooth brushing the better . Even before his or her teeth come in , you can clean your baby 's gums with a damp washcloth or soft toothbrush and water . Once your baby 's teeth begin to surface , she recommends brushing twice a day with a tiny smear of toothpaste and increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six . Dr. Lauren stresses that children under the age of eight years old often lack the dexterity to brush their teeth thoroughly so it is important for parents to help them brush their teeth . The American Dental Association ( ADA ) recommends parents use a fluoride toothpaste bearing the ADA Seal of Acceptance to ensure proper concentration . The ADA also endorses the use of fluoride mouth rinses for children six years old and above . ( Mouth rinses are not recommended for children under six due to the likelihood they may swallow the rinse . ) <p> 2 . Professionally Applied Fluoride <p> In addition to toothpaste and mouth rinses used at home , topical fluoride can also be applied professionally at the dentist 's office . These fluorides are more concentrated than self-applied fluorides and hence are not needed as frequently . The ADA recommends that children receive a fluoride treatment at the dentist 's office once every six months . <p> Once your baby 's teeth begin to surface , Dr. Lauren- recommends brushing twice a day with a tiny smear of toothpaste and increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through six . <p> Systemic Fluoride <p> 1 . Drinking Water : Community Water Fluoridation <p> Although fluoride is naturally occurring in all bodies of water , the concentration is usually below the **28;287;TOOLONG recommendation- from the U.S. Public Health Service and ADA for effective cavity prevention . As such , cities often add fluoride to bring the water up to the desired level . Water fluoridation has been touted as the most cost-effective and equitable way to provide fluoride to communities , and it highly benefits low-income families who are not able to take advantage of other dental services . <p> Research shows water fluoridation reduces childhood tooth decay by 20-40% . Water fluoridation costs approximately $0.50 a year per person in large communities and $3.00 a year per person in small communities . For most cities , each dollar- invested annually in water fluoridation translates into $38 in savings each year in dental treatment costs due to fewer incidences of cavities . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention praises water fluoridation as one of the top ten great public health achievements of the 20th century . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where water is not fluoridated , dietary fluoride supplements ( drops , tablets , or lozenges ) are available by prescription to prevent tooth decay . <p> Safety Considerations <p> Dr. Lauren explained that fluoride is both safe and effective when used appropriately and is a powerful tool in the fight against cavities . She noted that the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Dental Association , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all agree that fluoride is a safe and effective tool to combat tooth decay . Dr. Lauren endorses use of fluoride toothpaste , fluoridated water , and topical fluoride treatments at the dentist 's office to help little pirate patients fight cavities and enjoy happy , healthy smiles for life . She reassures parents about the safety of fluoride , explaining it all comes down to the question of amount and frequency . When families follow the ADA guidelines , brushing little teeth daily , using a slight smear of toothpaste for 1-year-olds , and a pea-sized amount for ages two and up , they are well within established safety limits for fluoride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if it tastes good , so parents need to teach them to spit it out . Children under the age of six often have weaker control over their swallowing reflex , so parental supervision , praise , and imaginative incentives can go a long way in helping remind them to spit and not swallow the paste . Mouth rinses are not recommended for children under the age of six . Even children over the age of six can benefit from a friendly reminder not to swallow the often tasty-flavored rinses . <p> Swallowing a pea-sized drop of toothpaste every once in a while wo n't cause kids any problems and is nothing for parents to worry about . If , however , children ingest an excessive amount of fluoride daily over a long period of time when their permanent teeth are forming , those teeth could develop fluorosis . <p> Fluorosis is a cosmetic condition involving the discoloration of the tooth enamel . Most cases are mild , with barely noticeable white streaks , but more severe cases cause dark stains . Although fluorosis can be treated cosmetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of teeth , care should be taken to use fluoride appropriately and avoid the stains . At the age of eight when a child 's adult teeth have come in , there is no longer a risk of fluorosis . <p> To maximize the benefit , xylitol should be used 4-5 times a day . Vigilant adherence to brushing , flossing , and keeping children 's teeth clean is also vital . <p> Xylitol as Cavity Preventative <p> On occasion , Dr. Lauren sees families at her practice that have serious reservations about fluoride and request alternative sources of treatment . Although Dr. Lauren is an advocate of fluoride , she respects varying opinions and works hard with her patients and their parents to find treatment options with which everyone is comfortable . In instances like these , Dr. Lauren recommends special vigilance to strong dietary practices , like avoiding sugary and starchy foods and beverages that promote tooth decay . She also recommends the use of xylitol as a cavity preventative and alternative course of treatment to fluoride . <p> Xylitol is a naturally occurring sweetener found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike sugar , xylitol does not cause- tooth decay , as it can not be broken down into acids by oral bacteria . Xylitol helps restore a healthy alkaline/acid balance in the mouth that is hostile to bacteria and plaque . Xylitol is available in the form of gum and candies as well as toothpastes and mouthwashes to help reduce cavities . <p> The American Dental Association promotes the use of xylitol in professionally applied applications to teeth as part of " comprehensive cavity prevention programs . " Ideally , the ADA recommends xylitol used in conjunction with fluoride to utilize all known assets in the fight against tooth decay . When families are opposed to fluoride , however , xylitol is an alternative to try . Dr. Lauren recommends that her little pirate patients use xylitol after every meal , after eating snacks , and before bedtime . To maximize the benefit , xylitol should be used 4-5 times a day . Vigilant adherence to brushing , flossing , and keeping children 's teeth clean is also vital . <p> A Family Endeavor <p> Parents of little pirates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statistics show that some bacteria that promote tooth decay can also be transmitted from parents to their children . Likewise , children emulate parents ' habits , so why not model healthy oral-health routines and make it a family priority . When the pirate ship sets sail to combat the nasty villain tooth decay , a united family front is the best defense .

Friends and family alike told us we needed to move but we did n't want to give up our fabulous location for a little extra space . So we stayed and made it work . Then we had a second baby and made that work too . Now we live in a house with more room , but we 've added two additional children to the mix so we are still applying the tricks we learned to living in a small space with children to accommodate our family of six . Regular purging is key , as is ensuring you make quality decisions that do n't result in a bunch of junk . Taking simple steps like going to the library for books can prevent books your child does n't love from piling up . But , there are some things you will definitely need like a place for baby to eat , sleep , stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do to keep life from being too cluttered with a little forethought and discipline . <p> Back when I was on my own I gravitated to a shabby chic look of mismatched old wooden furniture . Once we had kids and needed to find create space from our existing home I quickly learned the importance of light colors and matching patterns . I love the urbini Sweetli crib and matching changing table in white because the light color and simple , matching designs make the pieces appear to take up less space . As a bonus , since my baby is sharing a room and fitting everyone in required some creative thinking , a crib that converts to a toddler bed means you will not need to rearrange space ( or spend extra money ) when the baby gets bigger . A simple changing table can also later be used as a bookshelf or space for toy storage later on as well . <p> One trick to having enough room in a small space is to find toys or other items that serve more than one purpose . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n'Ride Talking Lotty . It rocks , wheels , and talks so it can be played with multiple ways without the need for multiple toys . If you have more than one child , I also like toys like this one that can be used by different ages and stages of development in different ways . Other examples are dolls with more functions , such as the Learn to Dress Max or Hattie Dolls which can be cuddly and teach skills , and toys such as Whoozit Whoops that be used as lovies as well as attached to strollers , car seats , or playmats . <p> Many toys are made in smaller versions designed for travel . But , there is no reason you ca n't use the same toys in your home as part of your regular stash . Playskool makes a great , durable line of toys that we like including Stack n ' Stow cups , Elmo 's On the Go Letters , and even a mini-version of a Nerf basketball hoop . <p> It may seem like everyone has the basics , like a highchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a smaller package . One example is the Mountain Buggy pod high chair that takes up absolutely no floor space because it clips right onto the table . As a bonus , it can be easily taken to restaurants or Grandma 's house . Another example is the Bright Starts Having a Ball Explore and Roar Activity Jumper which has many activities that go up rather than out and the Safari Sounds Musical Table which packs a lot into a small package with the ability to remove the legs for easier storage . <p> Finding a stroller that can fit easily in a small space yet can take you everywhere you need to go is a challenge . When I lived in a small apartment this was perhaps my biggest challenge . Again , looking for a stroller that is designed for travel might be your best bet . The smallest fold stroller I could find is the Nano , which fits in an overhead airplane compartment or a closet or even under a bed . <p> If you have multiple children , or are thinking about having more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . This way you wo n't need to buy more , or duplicate toys , if your boy refuses anything pink .

Same goes for clothes if children are close in age white socks and onsies work well for everyone . <p> Some toys are different every time you play with them . With a few toys with near limitless possibilities you not only encourage your child 's imagination but cut down dramatically on the amount of stuff you need . Building toys are a great example . Anything from simple blocks to Legos to Tinkertoys to more involved building toys like Roominate with real working circuits works . A new find for us is YOXO Toys , construction kits made from recycled wood , that can build creatures and are compatible with things you may have around the house ( toilet paper rolls and boxes ) for more elaborate building . <p> You may not need to look farther than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from years of going to kids events is how easy it is to make creations like masks out of paper plates and everything from rockets to binoculars with a paper towel roll and some tape .

The first night of being a new mom was nothing like I planned . My husband , Adrian , bonded with our boy , while I laid awake on the cardiac floor . <p> The night seemed to crawl by for me . I received a blood transfusion and had several bedside tests performed on my heart . Eventually the in and out of doctors and nurses slowed down and the entire situation started to hit me hard .

I had to ask multiple times for a nurse to contact labor and delivery , since I needed a pump . I knew the importance of early breast stimulation and I was determined to breastfeed . Eventually someone brought me a pump , although I had no idea how to use it . With nothing but time on my hands , I fumbled through the directions and set myself up . Throughout the evening , I pumped every few hours and collected very minimal colostrum drops .

I ended up dragging myself into the bathroom , which was very , very painful and challenging . <p> Eventually morning came and I was starving . I still could n't get any real food though . They did bring me a liquid diet tray for breakfast and I inhaled all of it . I was still feeling very dizzy though . Sometime after breakfast , I received 2 pints of blood and the dizziness improved . Shortly after noon , Adrian was able to talk to a patient advocate about our situation .

Get creative ! Best of all : the kids love to help with this project . Print a picture of the flag and place it in front of them and then have them follow the pattern .

After the struggles we had to get pregnant and the scary pregnancy itself , I ca n't even put into words how it felt to have him in my arms safe . <p> I am shocked to say that just a few days ago , we celebrated his first birthday . One whole year has gone by with four kids , getting to know this new little person , and our family feels complete . It 's been a while since I 've updated on how Silver ( *not his real name ) is doing and how life has been with four kids . <p> I 've learned so much this past year about myself , about my older kids , and how we seem to do really well with going with the flow . The adjustment has been bigger than I thought it would be and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier , but it 's been a really fun year ! <p> It 's so weird to say he 's already a year old it went by so fast ! He has been growing like a weed at is over 22 pounds now and while a little short , he 's doing fantastic . His biggest struggle has been ear infections he 's had three over the span of 2 months and it 's been really sad to watch . He did three rounds of antibiotics and is again on a strict dairy-free diet , still breastfeeding , and otherwise well . <p> He has n't figured out that sleeping is wonderful yet and has n't slept for more than a few hours at a time . Silver is happier when he 's dressed warmly and I know , from past kids who have slept this poorly , he will eventually sleep someday . I think he would have slept better sooner if it was n't for his ear infections , but he 's been feeling well for a few weeks so I am hoping with being super strictly dairy-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that , he 's enjoying playing with his siblings , has started to take some steps ( I think , had he not had so many ear infections , he would be running , eek ! ) and loves to cuddle a lot . <p> I said it to you all before that I was worried about the age gap of my kids the oldest turned nine as Silver turned one and the next up from that will be five years old soon . I was worried they would not get along , or not be interested , but I could n't have been further from the truth . <p> My third child , who is now almost six , is like the second-mommy and I do n't think I 'd handle all this without her . She is so helpful with Silver and always seems to know what he needs . The pair are adorable , always playing and cuddling , and I hope they stay close forever . My oldest , he is so sweet with Silver even with an eight-year age gap and my second child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who always worries about him making sure he 's not going to get hurt or put something in his mouth he should n't . <p> It 's busy . It 's tiring . It 's a new struggle every day and we do n't have a routine yet . But , my heart is full and do n't think I could be more happy .

' If you are taking fertility treatments , then you know that this is absolutely the truth . When you began your journey toward parenthood , you were n't banking on being bloated , gaining weight , being irritable , or having headaches , pelvic pain , and nausea . The American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology estimates that around 75 percent of women taking fertility treatments , whether injected or ingested , will experience these side effects . <p> Before you allow the side effects scare you away , it is important to realize that every woman is different and so is her protocol of treatment . The best thing a patient can do during these treatments is to deal with the side effects one at a time . Often , they subside as you get farther along in your treatment . Some women even claim that the artificial hormonal rebalancing actually made them feel better in the long run . <p> With some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming emotion ranging from feeling depressed to being elated .
