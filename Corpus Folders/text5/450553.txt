Most are not because I am allergic to or intolerant of most plants including almost all seasonings , grains , soy , and sugar . For people with allergies , sensitivities , and intolerances , the phrase " natural flavor " is a road block . It would be better to label the front of the product with " natural flavor added " and list each ingredient on the nutrition label , so we can determine if it the product will meet our needs . <p> Also , most people cooking with ground meats tend to add their own flavor according to the recipe they follow . For ground meat to be sold with undisclosed flavor could clash with the recipe ingredients added at home . It is an unnecessary adulteration of the meat .

@@47178815 @678815/ <h> Incorporating Protein into Your Diet <p> Getting enough protein ? That seems to be the resounding nutrition question among health enthusiasts , media outlets and water cooler fodder . We want to maximize proteins impact , whether its for everyday adequacy , satiety , performance recovery or maybe even disease management . But how do we know where to get it or what amount is needed ? Read on . <p> Protein is a major nutrient that not only helps in the structure of muscle , bone , skin , hair , teeth , organs and tendons , but also in creating enzymes , hormones , vitamins and even neurotransmitters ( no pressure ) . Each protein molecule is made up of a chain of 20 amino acids : 11 are made in our bodies and 9 are supplied to us from our diet . All animal proteins ( except gelatin ) contain all amino acids , while plant proteins may be limiting one or two ( except for soy , quinoa and spinach ) , but can easily form complete proteins with a varied diet . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally overemphasizes how much is really required for us to be our best . <p> Let 's figure out where you can get protein . Some of the highest concentrated sources of protein already in our Western diets come from meat , poultry and dairy . Yet , granting more face-time to legumes , beans , fish , nuts , grains and vegetables can boost protein intake . Let 's put this into perspective . Per 100 calories of food , lean beef and chicken provide us with 10-15 g of protein ; most dairy milks fit in 8 g of protein ; tempeh ( fermented soybean ) packs in 10 g and cooked beans offer 6 g . Additionally , fish contain about 15-20 g of protein per 100 calories , peanut butter has 4 g , wheat gluten lends us a whopping 20 g , potatoes grant us 3 g and dark green leafy veggies ( kale , collards , mustard greens ) pack a punch at around 11 g of protein per 100 calories . Protein , as well as the fiber found in several of these foods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that 10-35% of the total calories you consume should be from protein . If you 're eating a 2,000 calorie diet , that means 50-175 g of protein . Quite a range , huh ? A more solid number , backed by a lot of support , is that a healthy adult ( male or female ) needs approximately 0.8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight to sustain normal daily functions . That equates to about 62 g of protein if you weigh 170 pounds . But let 's say you 're an athlete . Even taking into account moderate to high physical activity , intake above 1.7 g of protein per kilogram bodyweight ( its a good idea to include about 20 g of protein four hours prior to exercise and within two hours post-exercise ) does n't  appear to give added bonuses like bulky muscles or increased strength . Instead , proper conditioning yields these results . Other clinical implications for altered protein intake includes diabetes management , wound healing and kidney complications . Talk to your physician or registered dietitian to find out more . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply are not reaching basic protein requirements . Perhaps you were gifted a gym membership and are suddenly lifting weights regularly , or you finally overcame anxieties and are training for a marathon . Any one of these scenarios could be a reason to supplement your diet with additional protein . One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is with beverage choices . Simple Truth offers Whey and Soy Protein Powders ( vanilla or chocolate ) that easily mixes with your favorite milk ( Simple Truth milks are available from Fat Free to Whole , with Almond , Coconut and Soy varieties also available ) and maybe some Simple Truth Organic Creamy Peanut Butter or even Simple Truth Organic Firm Tofu . Although fruit is n't necessarily a protein powerhouse , a few berries ( I find that using Simple Truth Organic Frozen Berry Medley is perfect no need to add ice cubes ! ) or slices of banana can really jazz up your drink . Protein powders can even be mixed with food preferably in foods that wont be cooked . Or , we can make things easy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite foods . How about throwing nuts on your salads for work , topping your toast with peanut butter instead of jelly , stirring lentils into soups , adding meats or " mock meats " ( e.g. , Simple Truth Meatless Crumbles or Meatless Griller Strips ) to your stir-fry , dipping veggies in hummus or Simple Truth Plain Yogurt ( mixed with a dry ranch mix ) rather than ranch dressing , or substitute quinoa for white rice ? <p> At the end of the day , protein needs are easily met through a balanced diet that includes enough calories to maintain a healthy body weight .

They have been a wonderful staple in our house until tonight when we opened a bag of oily puffed up bits of what tasted like cardboard dipped in motor oil . What happened ?

@@47178943 @678943/ <h> Compare Benefits of Grass-Fed Beef <p> What 's grass-fed beef all about ? Should you make the swap ? Grass-fed " is interchangeable with the term " grass-finished . " Both mean that the animal consumed 100% grass throughout its life ( after any necessary weaning ) and was only possibly supplemented with a select group of vitamins and minerals . On the contrary , an animal that is " grain-finished " also consumed grass the majority of its lifespan , but spent the last four to six months of its life on a feedlot , consuming a diet which likely included grains ( mostly wheat ) , silage , corn and soy . Trading your old ways for " greener " pastures could also seem like the natural choice as a cow feeding on grass rather than grains more closely mimics the way nature intended . The plant-based diet of cattle provides all the necessary fat , carbohydrates , protein and essential vitamins and minerals the animal needs in the entirety of its life . <p> The nutrition of grass-fed versus grain-fed beef is very similar , surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparisons . <h> Calories <p> A three-ounce serving of raw grain-fed lean beef provides about 154 calories . By substituting grass-fed beef for this , you can potentially save up to 45 calories per serving due to the leanness ( somewhat less fat and calories ) of the grass-fed animal . Grass-fed cattle have likely experienced more movement and a longer lifespan than grain-fed cattle . <h> Saturated Fat <p> The primary saturated fat in all beef is stearic acid . Stearic acid has a neutral effect on our blood cholesterol and LDL ( " bad " cholesterol ) , yet does little to help our HDL ( " good " cholesterol ) levels . <h> Unsaturated Fats <p> The make-up of grass-fed beef is only slightly higher in polyunsaturated heart/brain-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and CLA ( conjugated linoleic acid ) . Despite this , the best omega-3 fatty acid sources ( 1 - 1.6 g total daily is a good goal ) remain oily fish ( high in EPA/DHA ) , as well as flaxseed and walnuts ( high in ALA ) .

@@47179168 @679168/ <h> Perfectly Grilled Pork <p> Beyond its well-known designation as " the other white meat , " pork offers an affordable and versatile option for your summer grill-outs . Packed with protein and B vitamins , lean cuts of pork , such as chops and loins , provide top-notch options for health-conscious meat lovers . Though most of us are familiar with sizzling , pan-fried bacon or slow-roasted pork shoulder , firing up the grill to cook pork is a lesser-known method of preparation that can impart incredible flavor and contribute to that " summertime vibe . " Simple Truth is your best source for fresh , natural pork that is free of antibiotics and added hormones . Grab a package of natural pork chops , country ribs , or pork tenderloin and remember these three tips for grilling succulent , juicy pork delights : <p> 1 . Take its temperature . Due to the lean nature of many pork cuts , they can be easy to dry out if overcooked . Checking the internal temperature near the end of the cooking process takes the guesswork out of grilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 F. Make sure to check the temperature in the thickest part of the meat , avoiding contact with the bone , and ensuring that the probe is inserted one inch into the meat ( or up to the notch on your thermometer stem ) . Because pork must be fully cooked for food safety , be careful to keep your grill heat moderate to give the pork time to cook through without burning . <p> 2 . Focus on flavor . Pork is a mild-flavored meat , making it extremely versatile in terms of potential preparations . Marinating pork is a great way to prepare it for grilling , as this ensures a deeply-infused flavor that is heightened by the fire of the grill . Other options for serving pork include topping with fruit-based salsas or chutneys , or incorporating fresh herbs that grill well , such as rosemary . If you can handle the heat , coat the pork in a blackening spice , grill to perfection , and pair the punchy spiced exterior with a cool pineapple-mango salsa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats , giving the cooked portion a chance to rest before serving allows the juices to settle back into the fibers of the meat and contributes to a juicier end product .

Enclose a circular area that 's three or four feet in diameter with three- to four-foot-high plastic garden fencing , welded wire or chicken wire . <p> Once you 've got your bin set up , you 're ready to start filling it . <p> Add Ingredients <p> This next step causes much of the confusion you 'll find around composting . Talk of specific ratios , necessary chemical combinations and the " one-and-only right way " to compost can discourage even the most gung-ho gardener from wanting to compost . Please , let 's stop the madness . <p> The great thing about composting is that its almost impossible to fail , because nature takes care of most of the imbalances we might create . Some methods may turn your materials into usable compost quicker , but even then , the resulting soil may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three steps and you can be assured that your compost will , well , compost ! <p> Place a four-inch layer of plants with stems , broken-up sticks and other coarse materials in the bottom of your bin . This also includes tree bark , dead plant clippings and natural wood chips . <p> Add kitchen waste , fallen leaves , dead plants and grass clippings to the pile as they become available . This includes any fruit and vegetable peels , sawdust , horse or cattle manure and cardboard torn into hand-sized pieces . Do not include meat scraps , omnivorous animal feces ( dogs , cats , etc. ) , herbicide-treated grass clippings or any treated wood . <p> Spray water on the pile to achieve moistness without making it soggy . Repeat every few days to keep it moist . <p> That 's it . You now have the beginnings of some rich , healthy compost ! <p> Do n't  over-water your pile . That 's one of the most common mistakes new composters make . Think of it like spraying your hair with just enough to style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just stepped out of the shower . Bad odors are usually a sign that its too wet . If it does become soggy , simply turn the pile more often and allow it to dry out for a few days . <p> Turn the Pile <p> The main purpose of turning the pile is to ensure that the different materials you 're adding interact with each other , which helps them break down faster . Aerating the pile is another reason to turn it , although this does happen naturally , to an extent , as the pile transforms . <p> If you have a smaller pile , simply turn the materials within the bin with a pitchfork . If your pile is a bit larger , you can lift up the actual bin and set it next to the pile ( if you made a fence ) and then scoop the contents back into it with your pitchfork . <p> Its good to do this daily , although you may find that turning the pile every two to three days is perfectly adequate . You can also moisten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use the Compost <p> You know your compost is ready when you can no longer recognize the original ingredients ; it looks more like soil than scraps . It will likely turn into a dark , rich substance that has a good consistency to it . At minimum , you can expect it to take about three to four weeks , but it could take up to three months . <p> Do n't  worry if your compost is n't ready this planting season you can always store it in a large container , such as a 55-liter garbage can , and save it for next planting season . <p> If your compost looks like its almost ready , go ahead and fill holes with it and plant your seeds ; it will finish the process while its in the ground . As we mentioned earlier , its fairly difficult to fail just give it some more time if you 're in doubt . <p> Enjoy your composting , and may your plants grow to be wildly beautiful and delicious !
