Visiting smaller , and considerably more interesting airports , however , can leave the pilot with no choice other than a series of non-precision approaches . This article explains how to fly a non-precision approach , and how it differs from a more common precision approach . <p> Well use the Avalon VOR/DME-B approach as an example . Consider printing the chart , or opening it in another window so you can follow along . <p> This assumes you are already familiar with the concept of a feeder route that was introduced in the previous rating . <h> VOR/DME-B ? Which runway would that be ? <p> Approaches are often aligned with specific runways at airports , allowing for straight in minimums to be published . In such cases , the descent gradient to the field will be very reasonable , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the runway for which the approach was designed . If EITHER of those two conditions are not met , the approach will NOT have a specfic runway designated in the name , but will instead have a letter , such as A , B , C , etc . <p> In our case , the VOR/DME-B approach into Avalon is either not aligned with a specific runway , or requires too step a descent to be considered a straight in approach . For this reason , there are no straight-in minimums published for the approach , only CIRCLING minimums . Prior to reaching the missed approach , we will either have the runway environment in sight , or we must execute a missed approach . If the field is in sight , we can descend below the circling minimums , and maneuver ( circle ) to land on the runway of our choice . <h> About face ! Flying the procedure turn <p> The previous rating covered a hold in lieu of procedure turn ( HILPT ) . The VOR/DME-B chart does n't  depict a hold for the course reversal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure turn is used . This provides substantially more flexibility for the pilot . <p> Outbound from RIGLI ( heading north ) the chart calls for a course reversal to the left . Its actually legal for the pilot to make the course reversal in any manner he chooses , so long as it is done within 10nm of RIGLI . The amount of space guaranteed to provide terrain separation is slightly higher if the chart , however , so its always good practice to fly it as shown . <p> So , how to fly the procedure turn ? Any time after RIGLI , make a left 45 degree turn and proceed outbound for 60 seconds . Make a right 180 degree turn and join the final approach course inbound . That 's it ! <p> With that in mind , let 's fly the approach . <h> Flying the approach from SXC <p> Note : The procedure has since been updated to use 3400ft , rather than 3200ft for the Feeder and Initial segments , and 2300 instead of 2100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SXC is a feeder for this approach . Let 's assume were arriving from the west and told the following , " Cross SXC at or above 4000 , cleared approach . Report RIGLI inbound " <p> Depart SXC hdg 352 and join the SXC R-352 outbound , descending to 3200 . Passing SXC 5 DME ( RIGLI ) , we excecute our procedure turn , turning left to heading 307 for 60 seconds . During that outbound leg , set the NAVOBS to the inbound course of 172 . After 60 seconds on the 307 hdg , turn right to heading 127 and join the final approach course as the CDI ( the needle ) on the NAV radio begins to center . Make a right turn to join the final approach course . Once established on the radial inbound , start the descent to 2100ft . <p> Reaching RIGLI , report the position to ATC as instructed . ATC will likely release you to the advisory frequency , so you can announce your position on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency ( CTAF ) , to sequence yourself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2100ft until reaching the missed approach point ( SXC 2.8 DME ) , or until the field is in sight , whichever happens first . <p> Unlike a precision approach , which provides vertical guidance and an altitude at which a missed approach must be declared ( the decision height ) , non-precision approaches have a minimum descent altitude . This is an altitude whch is maintained until reaching the missed approach point , which is either identified using DME , GPS , or by flying for a precise amount of time from the final approach fix . Most ILS ( precision ) approaches , can also be flown as a non-precision , localizer approach , using different minimums and with a published minimum descent altitude rather than a decision height . In fact , while flying a precision approach , if the glideslope is not received , or fails during the approach , it is legal to fallback to a non-precision approach , unless specifically prohibited by the notes in the approach . <p> Back to our approach , assuming we do have the field in sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the weather is VFR , then we would make an effort to enter the pattern in a fashion that is compatible with other VFR traffic in the area . Options include entering on a right base for runway 22 , or maneuvering west of the field to enter a downwind for runway 22 . If the wind conditions are not known , it is possible to cross overhead the field above pattern altitude and then maneuver for the appropriate pattern entry . If the weather is below VFR minimums , then by definition , there should n't be any traffic in the pattern and you can maneuver as needed to become aligned with the runway of your choice . <h> Canceling IFR <p> Once you 've landed safely on the ground , do n't  forget to contact ATC to cancel IFR . That way , they can allow other IFR traffic in or out of the field . Until you cancel , ATC will not allow any other IFR traffic in or out of that non-towered airport . If the weather is good , its considered to be courteous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ATC , that way he wo n't have to shut down the airspace while awaiting your cancellation . When landing at a towered field , ATC manages your IFR cancellation automatically . So , if you hear " cleared to land " , you do n't  need to cancel IFR after you 're on the ground .

This workshop puts it all together with a relatively simple scenario from Pasa Robles ( KPRB ) to King City ( KKIC ) . It follows with a more complex flight into Marina ( KOAR ) , just outside of Monterey and Salinas , CA . <p> The first scenario ( KPRB-KKIC ) goes deep into flight planning , including route selection , estimating times enroute , navigation methods such as ded reckoning , pilotage and VOR navigation . It also covers an analysis of the airspace and various communication examples for each segment of the flight . <p> The second scenario ( KKIC-KOAR ) goes into a similar level of detail and presents different strategies for handling Montereys Class C airspace and Salinas Class D airspace . With the revelation that the destination uses right traffic for most common runway configuration , plans change and new strategies are derived on the fly !

They exist in cases where an airport has been surveyed for obstacles ( ie , it has one or more instrument approaches ) and has been found to have obstacles or terrain that would be a factor if an airplane were to depart in a random direction at a minimally acceptable climb gradient .

In some rare cases , they may also be assigned by ATC for separation and traffic flows . <p> Reviewing the ODP , it can be summarized as follows : Turn towards PDZVORTAC ( left turn off rwy 7 or a right turn from rwy 25 ) . If you 'll be departing PDZ on a course of 091-140 , or 231-280 , you can continue on course after PDZ .

This is the IFR equivalent of pattern work . <p> Pilots are often unsure what route to file in cases like this . The most prudent strategy would be to file a route , such that in the event of lost comms , you have a route that is flyable without reliance on radar vectors . In our case , the ILS 20R approach at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SLI ) , so , let 's file that with an altitude of 3000ft . In fact , in a later rating , the I-6 , you 'll be doing exactly that . <p> Once we get airborne , request vectors to the final approach . <p> Good luck on your first approach ! Youre IFR now , so be sure to listen closely to ATC . If you 're given a heading , altitude , or speed instruction , do your best to adhere as closely as possible with the restrictions . <h> IFR Clearance Primer ( CRAFT ) <p> To the uninitiated , its a long string of seemingly random instructions . Careful examination , though , reveals a strict , unwavering pattern that makes receiving and copying these clearances a whole lot easier . <p> IFR clearances are broken down into the following components : <p> Clearance Limit : This is the airport , fix , VOR , or NDB to which you are being cleared : " Cleared to the Palomar airport " <p> Route : This is the series of vectors , fixes , VORs , NDBs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes that make up the route of flight . " fly heading 175 , expect radar vectors V23 , OCN , direct " <p> Altitude : No surprises here , this is the altitude to maintain . If the filed altitude is n't immediately available , an initial altitude is given . The expect is actually there for lost communication purposes and wont be detailed here . Practically speaking , you will be climbed to your final altitude as soon as separation and other airspace related issues allow . " maintain 5000 , expect 7000 5 mins after departure " The altitude can also be replaced by " climb via SID " if utilizing a certain type of Standard Instrument Departure . This will be covered in a later rating . <p> Frequency : This is the departure frequency to expect on wheels up . Receipt of a departure frequency does NOT mean you should change to that frequency immediately . Its simply to let you know who you can EXPECT to talk to on departure . " departure frequency 128.10 " <p> Transponder : This is a discrete code that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified in the controllers airspace on radar . " squawk 1312 . " <h> As Filed <p> For brevity , if the cleared route matches what you originally filed in your flight plan , the controller can use the phrase as filed instead of reading the full route . In addition , if a Standard Instrument Departure ( SID ) is being used that contains information about departure frequencies and altitude information , the controller may omit the bulk of the Route , the Altitude and the Frequency portions of the clearance , resulting in the slightly less appealing acronym , CT ! <p> Pro Tip : When requesting an IFR clearance , do not include " as filed " in your request . Its completely redundant .

The Aeronautical Information Manual recommends doing this no more than 15nm from the field . Be sure to listen on the frequency prior to transmitting to ensure you do not interrupt an existing transaction . In order to establish two way radio communications the pilot must call the tower and the tower must reply using the aircrafts callsign . <p> As odd as it might seem , the control tower has used your callsign , so you have established two way radio communication and may enter Class D airspace . <p> However , if the tower reply was : <p> San Luis Tower : " Aircraft Calling , Standby " <p> Then you have NOT established two way radio communication and may not enter the airspace . Controllers are well aware of this distinction and may intentionally use one versus the other , so be sure to listen closely to their response . <p> Most control towers also provide ATIS ( Automated Terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually transmits weather , NOTAMs and runway information . Pilots should listen to the ATIS broadcast prior to contacting the control tower . Each ATIS has a unique letter identifier which should be relayed to the tower on initial contact . <p> Note that PilotEdge does not directly provide ATIS . Pilots should listen to the ATIS provided by their flight simulator and provide the appropriate letter identifier to the control tower . <p> Frequencies to listen to ATIS are available on VFR charts and in the Airport Facility Directory . <p> In all communications with ATC use the following guidelines : <p> Include your callsign in all transmission to Air Traffic Control . <p> Read back all ATC communications to ensure you properly understand the clearance . <p> Avoid making extra transmissions which are not required or requested by ATC . <p> As with all Air Traffic Control Communications you should comply with the instruction and advise the tower when 2 miles from the airport on a right base .

" <p> After landing exit the runway at the first available taxiway and ensure that the aircraft is past the hold short lines . The tower should either provide taxi instructions or tell you to contact ground control . Do NOT switch to ground control without an instruction to do so . If you have cleared the runway and the tower does n't  call you with instructions query the tower . <p> When contacting ground the same transmission format can be used as when making initial contact with the tower , however it is not necessary to repeat the ATIS code .

@@47829379 @1329379/ <p> Tip : The ONT Class C airspace is comically close to the SBD Class D. See the Airspace Review ? Special Considerations section below for a few suggestions on how to handle this . <h> Airspace Review <p> Class C Airspace is located around larger airports where arrival and departure sequencing is required . <p> Normally Class C airspace has two rings which are centered on the airport . The first ring goes from the airport out to 5 miles and goes from the surface to 4000 above airport elevation . The second ring starts 5 miles from the airport and extends out to 10 miles , this ring exists from 1200 above airport elevation to 4000 above airport elevation . However , a specific class C area may be modified to fit in with other airports , terrain , or other airspace areas . <p> Class C airspace is depicted on VFR charts as a solid magenta line . Within the airspace the airspace altitudes are shown ( in MSL ) in hundreds of feet in the format ( ceiling ) / ( floor ) . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface and goes to 4000 MSL . <p> To operate in Class C airspace you must have a working mode C transponder and establish two way radio communication . <p> The two way radio communication requirement is identical to the Class D requirement . You must contact ATC and ATC must reply with your callsign before you enter the airspace . The difference is that unlike a Class D airport where you would call a control tower for Class C airspace you would typically contact an approach control facility . Specific contact frequencies are available on VFR charts . <p> In addition to the charted class C airspace there an outer procedural area also exists around Class C airspace . In this area ATC provides services that are identical to those that are provided in Class C airspace . This procedural area is not depicted on charts but normally extends 20 miles from the airport . Pilots are not required to be in contact with ATC in the outer procedural area . <h> Special considerations for this flight <p> The outer shelf of the Charlie lies starts at 2700ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means we need to avoid the airspace laterally ( turn north or south shortly after takeoff ) , vertically ( remaining below 2700ft to stay under the outer shelf until establishing contact ) , or by establishing contact prior to reaching the shelf by requesting an early frequency change from the tower . Whatever the case , make sure you have a plan prior to takeoff . <h> Communications Review <p> In order to transition Class C airspace you must establish two way radio communication with the appropriate approach facility . Frequencies to contact approach are located on the sectional chart . <p> For example looking at our route of flight from KSBD to KEMT you would see that to transition the KONT Class C airspace from the North East you would contact SOCAL approach on 127.00 . <p> Requesting a Class C transition is similar to requesting VFR flight following . On initial contact you provide your callsign , location , altitude , and request . For example : <p> If we are landing at an airport near the Class C airspace it is worth mentioning our destination so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give us a squawk code , and eventually advise us when we are in radar contact . As strange as it might seem , we can enter the Charlie airspace even before they establish radar contact , so long as we have established two way communications . ATC may or may not provide us with an altitude to maintain , headings to fly , or restrictions on where we can or cant fly . In all cases read back and comply with these instructions . <p> Once we are clear of Class C airspace ATC will either terminate radar services at the end of the procedural outer area or provide us flight following . In either case we can choose to terminate radar services once clear of the Class C airspace . <p> In the case where we are landing at an airport near Class C airspace ATC will hand us off to the tower when we are approaching the airport .

Well be looking closely at the KEPEC ( RNAV ) and CLARR arrivals for Las Vegas ( KLAS ) as well as the RIIVR arrival for KLAX . <p> Correction : there is a portion of the video which says that in the case of lost communications , pilots should comply with the expect to cross instructions on the STAR . Instead , you should only comply with those if the controller has verbally issued instructions to expect those altitudes in a further clearance . Otherwise , only the mandatory altitudes become binding , such as those on the profile , or the Minimum Enroute Altitudes. 
@@47829411 @1329411/ <p> Fly the LOCRWY 27 approach profile correctly , descending as low as the procedure allows at each of the crossing fixes rather than staying at the ATC assigned altitude until the bitter end . <h> Rating Description <p> Pilot will fly IFR from KAVX ( Catalina ) to KSAN ( San Diego International ) to shoot the LOCRWY 27 approach with vectors to final . Utilizing the skills acquired in previous ratings , the pilot will use the TEC route system to file the appropriate route . The route will not be provided as part of the text . <p> While it is legal to pick up the IFR clearance in the air , for the purpose of the rating you must pick up the IFR clearance on the ground at KAVX . The pilot can either obtain an IFR release while on the ground , or they may depart VFR and activate in the air . The latter is a handy tool in cases where another aircraft is departing or arriving on an IFR flight plan at the same time which would preclude ATC for allowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 approach into KSAN is a commonly misflown approach with many pilots remaining far higher than is needed until the last minute . Controllers can often be seen gathering around the scope and reaching for the popcorn to watch yet another dive bomber approach into the field . <p> Other than making a safe landing at San Diego , obtaining this rating will require that the pilot correctly fly the approachs vertical profile . <h> IFR Non-Towered Operations <h> Try Not to Hit Anything <p> Up until now , we 've had definitive guidance regarding what heading to fly during an IFR departure since we 've been departing from towered airports . Well , there 's nobody at the helm here at Catalina since its a non-towered airport . It also turns out that Socal is n't going to be able to vector us until we reach a little bit over 3200ft . Let 's assume the first fix in our filed ( and cleared ) route is SXC . Once were at SXC and at the Minimum Enroute Altitude ( MEA ) for the airway we join after that , terrain clearance is guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieu of an initial radar vector or a SID , were on our own for getting to the first fix . In flat land airports , that 's fine , but at airports with nearby terrain , that 's suboptimal . This will be covered in more detail in the I-11 , but Obstacle Departure Procedures ( ODP ) exist for just such an occasion . They can be found in the Takeoff Minimums document ( see the workshop in the related material section at the bottom of the rating ) . The ODP for KAVX says to climb on runway heading until reaching 2300ft before turning on course . Let 's plan on that for now , but if you want to drill down into the Takeoff Minimums document , go for it ! <h> One in , One out <p> With nobody working a tower , who is going to sequence arrivals and departures at a non-towered airport , such as Catalina Airport ( KAVX ) ? In VFR conditions , pilots normally sequence themselves , utilizing the advisory frequency ( 122.70 for PilotEdge , 122.80 on text for VATSIM ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the real world , but is predicated on pilots being able to SEE and AVOID one another , the very foundation of VFR flying . <p> When the weather eases towards the dodgy end of the spectrum , see and avoid simply does n't  work . With nobody running the show , separation-wise , a mechanism DOESNOTEXIST to allow for more than one airplane to arrive and/or depart under IFR from a non-towered field . <p> ATCs primary gig in life , other than falling to their knees and shouting " WHATAREYOUDOING ? ? ! ! " is to separate IFR aircraft . The only way to ensure that two airplanes at a non-towered field are not spontaneously dismantled and distributed liberally about the airport is to make sure that only ONE airplane is operating under IFR in the local vicinity , hence the term one in , one out . <p> What does this mean for you , the pilot ? Its simple , if there is another airplane departing or arriving under IFR from a non-towered airport , you will not be able to depart or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either clear of the area , or cancels IFR . Does this mean that NOBODY can use the airport while the IFR arrival/departure occurs ? No , VFR aircraft can still fly as they please ( assuming the weather permits VFR flight ) . So , who is separating the IFR arrival/departure from the VFR guys ? Outside of Class B and Class C airspace.nobody ! That 's why its important for IFR pilots to maintain a constant vigil for other VFR aircraft at all times when the weather is VFR . <p> Assume its a relatively nice day , with one aircraft conducting an instrument approach into Catalina Airport . 10 miles out , the pilot spots the field . At the same time , he hears an aircraft calling for IFR departure from the same field . He hears the controller tell the pilot that hell need to hold for his IFR release as there is an inbound IFR aircraft . If the weather is VFR and the approaching pilot can see the field , its considered good practice to cancel IFR and proceed VFR to the field to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be covered in the next section . <h> Departing IFR <p> Pick up your IFR clearance from the overlying approach controller . Once the clearance is given , you will be released for departure . The controller is essentially closing down the airspace to any other IFR traffic , ensuring that you will be the only IFR aircraft arriving or departing the field . This should be good news to you as you enter the clouds shortly after takeoff , unable to see any other airplanes around you , and potentially before you reach an altitude at which ATC can pick you up on radar . <p> Clearly , the controller can not close down the airspace indefinitely . For this reason , your IFR release will be valid only for a certain period of time . You will most likely hear a phrase along the lines of " released for departure , clearance void if not off by 35 , time now 15 , frequency change to advisory approved . " This means that the clearance is good for 20 minutes . If you are not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer valid . There are other mechanisms for releasing aircraft , but the technique listed above is by far the most common on online networks . In the scenario above , you would swap to the published CTAF ( 122.70 for Catalina ) , and announce your intentions ( remembering that there might be other VFR aircraft operating to/from the field ) . Once airborne and when you deem it is safe to do so , you would contact departure and check in with your altitude . <p> Now picture that its a sunny day at Catalina Airport , there are a few VFR aircraft in the pattern , and you decide to undertake an IFR flight to a nearby airport . You call for your clearance , are told to hold for release , and to expect a 20 minute delay as there are 2 other IFR departures ahead of you . <p> Do you have to wait ? No , there is another option available to you . You can advise the controller that you will depart VFR and pick up the clearance in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a squawk code , and then proceed with your IFR flight . That is problematic , though , in the case where the IFR clearance is quite different than what you expected . A better option in complex airspace such as Socal is to obtain the IFR clearance on the ground , then depart VFR and activate the IFR in the air . <h> Flying the LOCRWY 27 Approach <p> The LOCRWY 27 approach chart is linked in the Required Materials at the bottom of this page . Open it up in another window or print it out , and let 's get started . <p> This is a non-precision approach . It provides lateral guidance , using a localizer as the primary navaid . Unlike the more commonly encountered ILS , there is NO glideslope component associated with this approach . <p> The full approach starts at the RYAHH intersection , proceeding to DOUGA at or above 5000 , then to VYDDA at or above 4000 . A right turn onto the localizer at VYDDA takes us to OKAIN , at or above 3600 . Continuing on the localizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or above 1800 , we can then descend to the Minimum Descent Altitude for this approach . For runway 27 , this would be 640 MSL . If we do not have the field in sight upon reaching the Missed Approach Point ( MAP ) , we execute the missed approach procedure . <p> When approaching from the west , however , ATC will vectors to final approach course , having you join the localizer a few miles prior to OKAIN or VYDDA . For example , after one or vectors from MZB , you may hear " 4 from OKAIN , fly hdg 240 , maintain 3800 until established on the localizer , cleared localizer runway 27 approach . " <p> In this case , you should maintain the altitude assigned in the approach clearance ( 3800 ) until established on the localizer . It is at this point that many online pilots fly straight and level all the way to KSAN , never leaving the last assigned altitude . Once cleared for the approach , and established on a published segment of the approach ( in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can descend to cross OKAIN at or above 3600 , then the rest of the fixes as described earlier . Do NOT expect to receive further descent instructions from ATC . Equally important , do NOT expect to see a glideslope indication on a localizer approach . <h> Flying the approach with GPS ( /G or /F ) <p> For GPS-equipped aircraft , you can use the GPS to identify the fixes listed above . As you cross each fix on the localizer , commence the descent to the next published altitude . The missed approach point , however , does not have a named fix . You must use the DME from the localizer to identify the missed approach point , or use the timing published on the chart ( 2min 33 sec for 120kt groundspeed , 2min 2sec for 150kts , etc ) . The timing is based on the Final Approach Fix ( identified by the Maltese Cross ) , which is REEBO . <h> Flying the approach with DME ( /A ) <p> Each of the fixes along the localizer can be identified using DME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the missed approach point is 1.3 DME . <h> Flying the approach without DME or GPS ( /U ) <p> Its not for the faint of heart , or weak of bowel , but it can certainly be done . The VYDDA , OKAIN , CIJHI and REEBO intersections can be identified by the intersection of the localizer , and certain radials of the PGYVOR . VYDDA is on the PGY 018 radial , OKAIN is on the 351 radial , CIHJI is the 314 radial , and REEBO is on the 304 radial . Your NAV1 radio should be tuned to the localizer . Your NAV2 radio should be tuned to PGY . As you pass each fix , reset the OBS on the NAV2 radio to identify the next fix . Start a timer at REEBO so you can determine when you have reached the Missed Approach Point ( see the GPS section above for more information ) . <h> Video <p> And now for something a little bit different , this is a shared cockpit ( 2 crew operation ) Mitsubishi MU-2 from KAVX to KSAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , released for departure , time now 2140z , clearance void if not off by 2155z . If not off by 2155z , advise Socal Approach of intentions by no later than 2205z , frequency change approved . " <p> We takeoff , follow the published Obstacle Departure Procedure for KAVX ( do n't  worry , this is covered in the I-11 ) . For now just know that if you climb straight out to 2300 , then proceed on course to SXC , that should keep you safe .

It provides VFR aircraft with traffic information . <p> Flight Following is provided by radar equipped Air Traffic Control Facilities . Generally these types of facilities can be classified as 1 of 2 types . <p> The first is an Air Route Traffic Control Center ( ARTCC ) , commonly referred to as a Center . There are 22 ARTCCs which cover the entire United States . <p> The second type of radar equipped ATC facility is the Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility ( TRACON ) commonly referred to as an Approach . TRACONs exist around larger airports and can cover smaller airports near larger airports . <p> Both ARTCCs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided several other types of radar services to VFR aircraft which will be covered in this flight and in later flights . <h> Requesting Flight Following <p> Flight following can be requested on the ground at a towered airport prior to departure or after takeoff . For this flight we will pick up flight following after departure . <p> In order to pick up flight following you need to know the local frequency for the TRACON or ARTCC facility covering your departure airport . The airport information page for SMX on Skyvector has this information in the Communications section . Otherwise , an official reference would be the Chart Supplement for SMX ( also available on the same Skyvector page , although it is still called the Airport Facility Directory on that site for now ) . Looking at either of these references , we see that the local radar controller frequency is 124.15 with Santa Barbara Approach . <p> When calling for flight following you should format your initial call as follows : <p> " ( Facility Name ) , ( Callsign ) , ( Position ) , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our specific example <p> " Santa Barbara Approach , Skyhawk 123AB , 10 miles North East of Santa Maria , 7500 , request flight following to Bakersfield .

This means that ATC can deny flight following requests or terminate flight following at any time .
